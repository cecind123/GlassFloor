rating,review
good,"Working for Walmart wasn't a bad experience. The customers come in and need assistance and your there to provide the best customer care you can give. The management seems pressured and stressed, but overall good characters. If Walmart would pay a better salary it would be a great job to remain."
good,Wal Mart is most rush rush so you learn a lot as you develop as an associate. If you are they to grow which you can then stay focused on work so you are learning every aspect of the company not just your position .
good,"This job overall groomed me to be a better person, to understand people more, and to be more compassionate. It did the opposite for some people but i tried to not take things so personal. It has greasy advancement opportunities but some management will try to hinder your growth."
good,Associates were nice and work flow was moderate. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers have a positive shopping experience. Management was a little complex when it came to who was in charge.
good,"I have worked at Wal-Mart on and off since I was 18, and it's great at first but then when it comes down to scheduling, management not being team leaders, and getting onto you about not doing a job task that's not in your job description there's a problem, but everything else was great..."
good,Walmarts strict atendence policy is a hard one epecially if rhere is an emergency or you have children I myself don't have children but I am fighting a sickness and the attendance policy had no room for my hospitalization.
good,If you work hard you will be rewarded with raises and promotions. Its very easy to move up the management ladder if you put in the work and show managers what you know.
good,very fast paced worked in a cold environment  little chance for advancement  stressful work seclude was not consistent   late one day early the next little time inbetween
good,"Walmart is as any other retailer except bigger and alot less follow-through. The upper management seems to have it's own agendas, which can prevent the department managers from effectively running thier 100% potential."
good,I had this job in highschool and it was a good job for after school. It helped me learn basic customer service sills and provide  valuable workplace experience.
good,"Walmart was a great job opportunity, the management at the time was very immature and that is why I left, as a woman I felt I had an option rather to stay in a place where I felt threatened and belittled or to move on to better opportunities."
good,While I was working there I enjoyed it but then I began to have problems with my pregnancy and had trouble with the CSM giving me restroom breaks when needed so I quit.
good,managers had favoritism issues.... and they were all young. didnt always help for another employee to strive or do better and honestly heard people talking behind other employees backs quite often.
good,They teach you to work all through the store.If peope are out you fill in their spot.Sometimes hardly anyone shows up and that is when it is stressfull.
good,"During my tenure at Walmart, I worked many hours to compensate for lack of proper staffing. The job has many stressful situations and there really is no job satisfaction or recognition for a job well done."
good,My work schedule isn't flexible hour. It still back and forth between work day and night. It was messing up the hour shifts. I only work by myself because it was not fair. Some other new hiring people was not learn everything next level of basic beginning learner this company.
good,"Depending where you are, very fast paced. Leadership quality varies by store. Promotions are not accessible as they seem. Salary does not match the workload that we encounter as associates."
good,"The Walmart store where I work at lack a lot of quality elements. Its very poor manage and a with a lot of cleaning issues.  The break room is always dirty and infected with roaches.  "
good,"It was only ever a bad place to work because of the disagreement among the higher levels of management, things that rarely ever involved me. Those problems come and go in a workplace."
good,"Overall Wal-Mart is a fast paced , friendly environment. Management is open and workable with hours or shifts that need to be adjusted for personal reasoning. Most enjoyable part is exceptional training and experience you receive to become a resourceful Wal-Mart family member. Challenging part would be the customer interaction which is sometimes not so great. Ensuring a great work atmosphere for yourself never take anything personnel."
good,"learned a lot at walmart, I enjoyed working in the warehouse/stock,everyone was friendly and helpful. I would have stayed if I thought htere was room for advancment"
good,"Una buena empresa para adquirir experiancia y obtener lo mejor de cada departamento, un impulso para llegar a mejores oportunidades laborales."
good,typically we would stock inventory. I was night shift so everything was still pretty fast pace. i learned about customer service and how to talk to people. Management.. i felt like they had there favorites at times. the hardest part of the job was when you had to restock candy and zone that place as well.. it was the worse. the most enjoyable part was i had friends there an we would help each other with the work load.
good,"I struggle with anxiety, so I know that played a huge factor in my leaving this position, but being a cashier at Wal-Mart is not easy. People will give you a verbal beating about anything from expired coupons to difference of shelf prices to tag prices to ID-ing for alcohol (alcohol is by far the worst). The worst part is that cashiers can't do anything outside of the policies they're required to uphold. What put me over the edge though was a manager who laughed at me when I told them I  had been transferred to a different department for the weekends and told me to ""go to number 7."" A lot of the cashiering management was like that. I liked my coworkers, though."
good,Selling everything in the department from Tv's to alarm clock radios.  Every day learning something new about the job. Work as a team or by yourself for all walks of life.  The hardest part of the job is staying fresh with new technology.  Helping people which is what I like to do on a daily basis.
good,would work there again if I was still located in the area. Fun place to work and I learned a lot about working with other people. If I wanted to work extra hours there was always work that could be done.
good,The manager over the cashiers was horrible. She would always wait until last minute to make your schedule. There were some instances where the schedule would come out but you were not scheduled. She never made time to make the schedule. Most of the time other managers would have to do it for her.
good,"I unloaded merchandise and stocked the floors on a daily basis. Being hands-on employee to assist customers on a daily basis. Around Christmas time, I enjoyed helping out the kids."
good,"Stocking shelve, baking bread and baked goods packaging. I learned some leadership skills. freezer work freight organization, and freight control, and scheduling."
good,this job was decent not to much that can be controlled by any one in the store as far a customers go but as far as fairness on a job this one at least made effort to do so
good,"My typical work day wood start out slow depending on the customer's "
good,"Big business is never great to work for. Management was terrible, coworkers were lazy. Pretty bad when an expecting mother was the hardest working employee"
good,a typical day at work is going in and down stocktaking all of the fright and put it out on the shelf. I learned leadership. Management there is working fright and mking sure we get our jobs done on time in a timely manner
good,it was always busy i learned alot of great customer service skills learned how to deal with all different kinds of problems and how to handle them the best way possible the best part was getting to know the ways of the company and how to do my job and get the hang of it.
good,"Not a horrible place to work,can be tough on scheduling and requesting time off. Sometimes problem with rude customers in which you must treat them with respect"
good,Wal-mart is a place I would recommend as short term deal. The place itself is not bad but when it comes to management it could do some improvement. My area of work is in the automotive side ringing up customers and helping them with other needs. The most enjoyable part of my job would be working with my fellow associates in my area.
good,"walmart is a standard grocery store job, semi fast paced environment and need the ability to deal with all sorts of people with all different needs and emotions."
good,"We had good timed breaks. There was always a good opportunity to learn about an open position that may better fit your persona; needs or desires. The discounts for employees is the worst,"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job while I was stocking shelves at Walmart, was simply the feeling of accomplishing something. Even though stocking shelves isn't the most glamorous position, I found great pride in knowing that I put in a good days work and completed the tasks I was given."
good,I was thrown into the Department Manager position without any training at all. It was okay to work there. Good discounts. The pay was not great for what we were supposed to do.
good,"I worked at the Walmart Dist.Center in Loveland and it was an ok place to work.I really do think so .If you want full time and longterm work, this will be the place for you to work at."
good,"Good place to work and high pace, that's what I like to be very busy that makes the day go by fast, to bad they don't allowed doctors note or sick days."
good,it was cool I liked the locations in salt lake city a lot more then in cedar there are just not very professional people working at the cedar city location.
good,"Very busy, consistent work. The hardest job to do it prep the chickens for the day. The most enjoyable was the people I worked with. The manager for the deli was OK."
good,"It has been some time since i have worked for Walmart, so i am not sure how much as changed. But when I was there the management was poor which seemed to roll down hill and effect everyone. Created a lot of bad vibes."
good,Unload your truck split every I'd up in to one group to be scanned in to the system so it can be loaded on the right truck .It was fast past and very challenging
good,"otima empresa, so ficou devendo na parte de oportunidades e promoções"
good,"Responsible for sorting products in backroom for overstock and binning. Setting up and stocking merchandize area. Stock products on designated shelves. Ensure aisles and areas are neat and clean and zoned before end of day. Engaging vendors, drivers and customers with a positive attitude. Greet customers and assist them when needed."

good,"It was only ever a bad place to work because of the disagreement among the higher levels of management, things that rarely ever involved me. Those problems come and go in a workplace."
good,Supply Chain Management was a third party logistics service provider while I worked for the company. It was a good place to work but their compensation scale a lot of good employees to leave.
good,"My experience at Walmart was an ok experience. Walmart management lacked professionalism which made it a more difficult task to work, other then that my job experience here at Walmart has been a good one."
good,The job was alright. It’s mostly for younger kids in high school. When I got hired the job was just temporary for me. I have no tips or reviews for the job.
good,Typical day in the pharmacy is busy. My pharmacy manager is great but the store's management is horrible this store has been open 2 years and cant keep a manger and as of right now we don't have a store manger or HR worker at all. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to work with my co-workers and helping patients.
good,unload trailers daily with new merchandise. sort and pull to floor. pick and stock freezer and cooler items and stock per expiration date. bin remaining product that did not fit on shelves on the floor.
good,"Easy job, good for a second job or just starting out. Never had any real problems but it definitely wont pay all of an adults bills. "
good,"I've been with this company for nearly 3 years and the biggest complaint I have is about the attendance system. It takes way too long for the points to ""fall off."" These points also count against you when you try to move up within the company, so you could be an extremely hard worker, but if you've been absent or late for any reason too many times in a 6 month period then you will be passed over for promotions. I do the work of a manager but I am not allowed to advance and have been passed over multiple times, but I am still expected to do management work without the pay grade."
good,Good place to work full time but bad place to work part time. The employees are energetic and friendly. Do not give a lot of OT hours and pay raises aren't that high.
good,Walmart is a decent place to work.  Walmart has a lot of benefits for their employees. Walmart also treats their employees with a treat when they go so long with out any injuries.
good,walmart is a good job to start off with and help your skills as far as retail and customer service. store 4046 needs better management though. its a wonderful environment once you get the job down.
good,"you will never get bored, some managers really do care for you other not as much, i worked alone most of the time so it was a steady job, hardest part was cleaning up after coworkers"
good,wal-mart is a very stressful work environment. and if not careful you can find yourself doing more than what you are asked to do. for example a majority of the workers don't do half of what hey are supposed to do so if you are asked to help in that department you are in  for a rude awakening
good,It was verry fast pace the mannagement was bad three hardest part of the job was building wals with the stuff that was getting shipped too the stores the other workers was always mad
good,Do not value outside experience. Not sure why I am being asked to do this involuntarily. It was a good place to work. I would return. Thank you so very much.
good,The attendance policy sucks . people get sick thats just a fact and some mire than foyr times a yeat ti expect ppl nit to be sick is unrealistic. They tell you dont come in if sick but give you no choice in fear of loosing your job. Crazy...
good,Walmart is a fun place to work. Despite the attendance point system. It can be a fun place to work depending on your management. Great job for students.
good,"While I was employed at Walmart, I was very pleased with it. As my time there was coming to an end, it was very hard to request time off and be out if my child was sick or myself. As an associate you were only allowed to miss two days in a six month time span and that is very hard when you have small children."
good,Working here was alright. Pay was low and full-time benefits don't kick in until after 90 days of working there full-time. Can be stressful if you don't know how to deal with people.
good,"Working with Walmart was a real eye-opener for me taught me a lot about responsibility skills, time management, and savings, would love to work there again sometime."
good,Nice job nice people met a lot of friendly faces work load wasn't bad I caught on very fast learned a lot from training a great job for teenagers starting out in life
good,Walmart is a low-stress environment that is barely managed. You make all the money you want to. Only really really advise college students to work at Walmart
good,"Very motivated and a great place to work.  They spend a lot of time and money into training; however, drop the hours once you are trained in.  If they were to use that to keep employees (hours and salaries) there would be hardly any turn over in the company.  Too bad.  I would stay there if full time was ever offered but it is not offered."
good,Nothing good or bad to say about working here. Management is pushy but that is expected when working in retail. Very little flexibility is working hours.
good,"Walmart Asset Protection is expected to apprehend 8 to 10 people per month, and if you go 3 months without reaching this total, someone will be speaking with you. It doesn't matter that it's slow at the store at all, they'd still cite you for not getting the apprhensions that you are expected to get."
good,Fast paced always on your feet not really hard but not easy either sometimes tiring and exhausting  but sometimes easy. Learn things everday see a million different people everyday
good,i think this is stupid to have someone go threw all this i dont work there any more and really dont care this is avery dumb to send people through all of this foolishness
good,Wal-Mart isn't somewhere i would personally recommend working. The managers and customers are stressful and managers tend to give their subordinates tasks when they're already swamped with other work.
good,The job i had at walmart was easy. I always try my best to meet demands and i did. I pushed carts in all weather conditions. I liked my job but got tired and want to do something different.
good,"Walmart had great opportunities and amazing health benefits. The hours were long and the associates were in constantly bad moods because of the workload and no appreciation. Even though everyone had equal opportunity to move up in the company, most had no desire and still stabbed you in the back just to be gossipy. The associates and management thrived on talking about others instead of developing as a team. Very Cut-throat"
good,There alright but most of the time the employees aren’t in the best of moods.Most of the employees and they’re better than one another you have to fight to get a raise even at the fight to be noticed by your superiors did you favoritism there but there good to work with.
good,I •	Unloaded boxes of merchandise in order with use of MC-40 and install wall chutes
good,this was a good place to work even though it was a seasonal job for Christmas.  I was offered major discounts. I would go back if I had to for a permanent job other than as a medical assistant.
good,Work hours were 4am to 1pm and during those hours you worked every minute. It was my first stocking job and the work is hard with low pay. To much favoritism. What I liked most was coworkers.
good,can be stressful at times but the chance to advance  higher is great. they do have a lot of resources to help though. management has their moments. But overall a good company to work for.
good,As a team member of wal-mart I learned to care for myself more cause its so quick paced if you don't slow down your customers take on attitude because of yours
good,Its an ok place to work. Having to fold and fold and fold all the things people constantly unfold and just throw wherever they feel like throwing whatever it was they didn't want.
good,My managers were sweet and understanding when it came to family emergencies. They gave more hours when requested. creating connections to customers was amazing
good,Walmart has a very diverse workforce that demands clear attention to build a cohesive team. The best thing about Walmart is the benefits and retirement of an excellent 401 k plan!
good,"Room for improvement, steady pace work environment. The team and work group was efficient and productive. Management team has very effective communication skills."
good,"on your feet all day long day good customer service managers are pretty nice people, know what there doing good and teaching. very face paced!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,"Typical day is always learning, always changing, management in great, culture is diverse, hardest part is what you make it, enjoyable part is helping the customer."
good,"A very good company to learn all you can about retail and sales, plus customer service.  The job is fast paced and a little bit stressful when short on help."
good,Its good for a temporary job. Something good for somebody in school or somebody who wants a part time job. They management is not good at all. people have no idea what they are doing. If they feel like they can throw you under the buss they will try to.
good,"Wal Mart provides great employee training. They have good benefits. This is a great place for a first job, to learn about work environments and how to advance a career."
good,"na Unload trucks"
good,"It was an okay job, but I wish I would have chosen a different position to work. Being a cashier was not for me, but I did like the management and how they treated employees equally."
good,Wal-Mart was a great start for me in business world. I learned a lot from friendly co-workers and knowledgeable superiors. The best thing I learned at Wal-Mart is working smarter is much better than working harder though still maintaining a certain standard reguardless. Always treated as an equal.
good,It is a good place to work at temporarily but it is difficult to move up in the company. The good thing is they are fair with the breaks and the lunches. They work with you a lot if you have a closed availability for example if you go to school.
good,the pay was good the staff lounge was great . the people were nice and respectful. walmart was the second best job i  had . some times the co workers were nasty but the rest were okay
good,"Great Pay, great benefits. "
good,It was not a bad place to work just no hours and lack of pay and very fast paced sometimes withouy help from mgmnt.......................................................
good,"As anyone that has every worked low end retail will tell you it's a job.  I worked on the floor and as a cashier.  So days were better than others but I think your experience will be mainly on how well the store is managed.  Good manager, good store."
good,"Great place if you want to explore other retail jobs or management. there is, however, internal bureaucracy and politics that may get in your way. But, the options to work are unlimited."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart can be super fun but also can be stressful. My co-workers that were on my level and not higher then me were amazing but the high you got in work place, the less its seemed that they cared about you."
good,The employees I worked with were all very enjoyable. Worst part of job was dealing with mad customers. I truly loved the interaction with the people & customers. The company was good but could be unfair at times.
good,"work with a sense of urgency and be productive.Keep your personal stuff at the door and be humble ,you could end up a manager yourself if you set an example"
good,Everyone was a pleasure to work with. It was a hard job but the pay rate was amazing for this area. The work environment was also nice most of the time.
good,Walmart is ok if you just need a job thats temporary unless you get a promotion which rarely happens.They bring you on as a part time employee so you are not eligible for any benefits.
good,"Stocked shelves,  worked the back room,  electronics department,  cart pusher, over  night stocking and  unloading bay.  Didnt work with too many ppl in my dept."
good,I was honored and to work for Wal Mart.  Wal Mart gave me a full time job when I needed one.  The employees at Wal Mart are overworked and underpaid.  It is a good job for a  college age people
good,Managers would get mad if I didn't get their jobs done. They didnt give me any kind of heads up about things that had to be done and when they weren't done i would get in trouble
good,"Working at Walmart is typical of any retail environment.  Your experience is dependent on your location, your position, your management team and most importantly, your attitude."
good,I was only part-time but would regularly have to stay late. I would operate registers and money center. I was immediately placed on the floor without complete training.
good,its a good job for someone that is single its not a job for a married or with children job they don't pay you enough if they started you out better pay they might keep more people longer
good,Walmart is an okay job to work if you don't have any kids. What I didn't like about Walmart was thew lack of support if you were going thru a family crisis.  They don't take hospital excuses so your missed days are unexcused and its held against you.
good,the work days were not too bad they there is always something to be done working at walmart you will never feel like you dont have anything to do you will alwasy feel busy
good,"Walmart gave the possibility of advancement, considering I was of young age compared to other management, they recognized my potential to move up to higher qualified positions due to my credentials. Only complaint is that pay did not reflect the hard work."
good,I only worked at Walmart for the holidays. I was not full-time. I only worked no more than 7 hours a day. I was only there for black Friday. After that I was let go.
good,The schedule could have been better. The management wasn't as hands on but the people I manly worked with were over all a enjoyment. The company is over all okay but I would not advise anyone to apply
good,The job was easy. A lot of standing with small breaks in between. Position ended and they offered me a position in the bakery department but that was out of my league so I just ended employment when the position ended.
good,"I have been working at Walmart part-time (More than three year)"
good,"Walmart in Clinton, North Carolina is not the place to work. The employees tend to have bad attitudes, and people seem to be miserable about working there."
good,nice and depedable job. workplace was consistent depending on job  tittle. me personally i was an sales associate in grocery department i stocked food management was ok
good,"The days seemed to drag on and management didnt really have a sense of what they wanted done at that point in time, and I started looking for more job opportunities."
good,"Comparative workplace with many chances for advancement. The management team is not properly trained and although Walmart is a good place to work, there are many pitfalls of the work Experience including: lack of communication and misunderstandings resulting in improper execution"
good,i was just a temp i work with a temporary manager. i did not get a good sense of the work environment. i didn't work with anyone that wasn't also temporary.
good,"clock in "
good,"Worked for Walmart for a little over a year in the Deli Department. Started out as a great job that paid fairly well for the difficulty of the work."
good,"typical day - busy but black fridays were not as bad as reputation,"
good,I worked the 4am-1pm shift. Only con about this job is that you have to be up at the crack of dawn. Management was cool just very unorganized. The pay wasn't great but it was my first job.
good,Walmart offers a range of wonderful benefits. The offer dental medical vision 401k and life insurance. They offer several different shifts as well as positions.
good,One of the top retail companies in the world. Great work environment. Good benefits. Customer service / Retail. Company is well-known for quality and value.
good,"mucha presion, buen ambiente, es un buen trabajo para ganar experiencia"
good,I actually enjoyed working for walmart and it was a great learning experience and moved up quickly and enjoyed working with people and meeting cutomers.
good,Consistent work flow fast pace atmosphere fast fun and friendly. Team work at times management fair most of the time. Wal-Mart is a reliable job and a place to grow
good,"I started my day off with zoning my assigned area for 2-3"
good,"I had overcome tough job as overnight stocker, however they did not raised my salary for working as night. Yet I am proud I made it through. Yet I still managed to finished my duty in quickpace and short fixed time."
good,"The maintenance crew typical day consist of sweeping the floors, mopping the floors, stripping old wax off the floors and reapplying the new wax. you always stay busy working at walmart"
good,"It's a good company to work for if your young .There can be times you have days where things might not be well, But if you have a family there not always working with you"
good,"This job should consider more the employees who are the ones who maintain the store, since the supervisors or manager do nothing. They are all day walking and talking in the store."
good,"Fast paced but friendly,the hours were not great and neither was the pay. They didn't offer benefits to someone in my position seeing that it was temp"
good,go in wait on customers for oil changes tires batteries wiper blades stock shelves cleaned out the oil pit put air in customers tires write up orders stocked tires
good,"Something they didn't tell me when I was hired. If you get injured outside of work, you have to go to the doctor and they don't cover the bill."
good,"They will keep you busy! the more versatile you are, the more valuable you are. I love the idea of cross training. I learned a lot while working there, just a shame their policies changed and I cannot return"
good,I did enjoy working for Walmart but to advance you had to know someone and over looked others better qualified. Pay was not great if trying to raise a family. Hours are what they want you to work. Asked to do any and all jobs.
good,It was a great place to work just wished that there was more hours that I was able to get  in a week time but other then that I didn't really have a problem. Also they shouldn't let management work with friends that way it would cut down on drama in the work place and a lot of he say she say.
good,Normally work is fine however at the moment and for the past month we have been understaffed making everyone stressed and over worked. management is not taking steps hire anyone to fill these positions and do to the holidays have no one currently hired to help with the extra work. the culture is usually fun with great people to work with. I enjoy being around all of my coworkers.The hardest part is being able to get all the extra work done when we are short staffed and it also being the holidays. the best part of the job is meeting new people everyday.
good,"Great Place to work, the hardest part of the job is pushing carts in the cold and the heat. The most enjoyable part about Walmart is that the coworkers are really nice."
good,"It wasn't the best or the worst job I've ever had, but the work environment itself was relatively enjoyable and challenging; there was constantly something new to do or some new task to complete.  The supervisor who I reported to directly was a fantastic individual with outstanding life skills and planning ability, but I always found that we were hogtied by bureaucracy when it came to what his supervisors had in mind for the completion of our duties.  Having six different bosses tell you ten different pieces of information concerning how to set up an end display is not always conducive to efficiency.  Still, overall, employment with them was satisfactory."
good,"Was nice to work there, you had a lot of opportunities to rise up in the company. Management really know of how to their job right, and would ask me how to help mostly. It was a good experience and had a fun doing it."
good,"Everybody wants to be your boss."
good,"Job was pretty easy for the most part.  I had different shifts a lot, so that was sometimes hard to balance with my schedule.  But overall, I thought it was a good job."
good,"Within my department there were many hours, training of new employees, and handling customers requests on products. Moved merchandise around in new mods, assisted in ordering of merchandise, stocking the merchandise, and managing overflow in the stock room."
good,"Walmart is a good company that has provided many jobs, as well, as reduced price products. It is fast-paced and you need to pay attention to detail. The people are fun to work with."
good,the employees are courteous. the work is fast paced which I didn't mind. tbh I wish I hadn't left. good job security. its a good place for a hard worker
good,it was nice being able to talk to people and help them find what they were looking for and stocking the shelves not everyone likes to do that any more help people.
good,"i enjoyed working at and for Walmart, it is a good starter and overall good job to have. always go scoop out the Walmart you would like to work at and see what are the pros and cons of working at that location."
good,Yelling supervisors and never get the hours you are promised. Promised days off only to be scheduled. Lack of consistent management.  Raises promised never received.
good,"straight days/afternoons"
good,I was a cashier I was assisting customers greeting customer as well as checking them out helping find things that fits the customer needs. the hardest part was layway
good,"working at walmart can be very had and frustrating at times, however it is a great working environment. By talking to customers it helps build your communication skills and help you learn to assist them in better ways."
good,Its an easy job and when you are just trying to get on your feet its a good first job. its hard to get raises but once you get your first one it becomes easier.
good,I've learned a lot from Walmart.  I learned the value of being a self started and motivator.  I enjoyed seeing the satisfaction in the customers. also while maintain a safe place for our customers and associates.
good,I would say working there was not all bad. yes there was communication problems with management at times. They had me work in different areas.  but all together it was an OK experience.
good,"Great place to work, people are fantastic and management is spot on. Would recommend to all my contacts. As management tasking was abundant and satisfaction guaranteed."
good,"Honestly Wal-Mart is pretty unfair to employees who are injured on the job. I learned a lot on how to run the cash register, Management was hard to communicate with most of the time. And everyone had different answers about everything"
good,"As a Department manager my day was very busy from scheduling to price changes to Modular sets and constant changes. It was a great time but not ideal for a family person due to the hours. I learned a lot of skills from computer, to organizational, to managerial, to customer service. The hardest part of the job was the lack of help most days, favoritism with upper management, lack of management guidance and understanding, and sometimes the hours like having to work on Holidays and late nights. You get a few upset customers of course but that is a part of any retail job. There are quite a few cliques that make it very hard as well if your not into that sort of thing. Over all I really enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart."
good,Wal-Mart offered various benefits to full time workers. The environment was very fast paced and competitive because they offered a employee package to those who put out the most work
good,Good team - but the change of management after 2015 - created the environment more uncertain. Till 2012 the company was under the banner of SCM - with core values of Respect for all.
good,"most work days are easy and fun going, but there are some days were everyone is not on the same page, confused, and lack of communications but overall its still a decent job to work at."
good,I worked at Walmart for a period of time.  The management was not friendly to the staff. They did attempt to help me with a situation but it just prolonged the inevitable
good,"I have issues with this company cause this was my first job and I quit cause management is horrible when dealing with employees, I try my best and ended up very unhappy."
good,"paid every 2 weeks."
good,Ok atmosphere but lack of management caused confusion and miscommunication in situations that would have been avoided . Communication is essential for a company to be successful.
good,"pushing carts all day in all weather. felt like there was a lack of care in the health of the stockman. lack of cold water in the summer, and lack of heat in the winter."
good,"The hardest part of the job was/ is  trying to achevie the goals set for you in a timely manner."
good,There are some good workers and some that work really hard that do not get notice for the work that they provide to the customers. An they need someone that they can talk to when they are having problems.
good,you start your day   with a morning meeting  and you get your to do list.  and  other task comes up for you to do.  make sure you get all your task done  before  you leave for the day.
good,"It was ok until they started changing managers. Tried to deal with the new managers, and tried to impress the new managers, some customers were difficult, but I managed the best that I could. I went above any beyond for Wal-Mart and their customers."
good,Empresa de porte grande e de grandes oportunidades.Facil de comunicacao a todos os envolvidos
good,Learning is important. The value of being still and growing has been learned. Forcing people to input information is get inconvenient. Thank you. Have a nice day.
good,I enjoyed working at wall-mart as a cashier. Working as a cashier was very helpful for me because my time would go by quickly and I got to interact with many different people. My managers worked with me since I was also a full-time student at the time.
good,Ready for a change in life. I'm looking forward to grandkids and the next stage in life. I am financially capable of cutting back. I would like to have more time with my customers than Wal-Mart allows for each interation.
good,After a year and a half the overnights were becoming too much for me to handle. i was always tired and that led to me becoming ill much of the time and very irritable
good,handling office duties. Collecting cash an overseeing cashiers. having knowledge of the merchandise that's being sold in store. Doing cash rounds on all registers that were in the store
good,Its ok working at walmart they did make it easy for me to go to school they allowed me to work only evening hours. I worked well with everyone there. Not much pay an hour though.
good,"good place to work and recomend to any one.for job security. wall mart is a good place to start working. if any one is successfull wprking in walmart , he or she will be successfull in other retail environment jobs."
good,"First of all, when you go to your interview make sure you availability is the one you want.  There online application tends to mess up on your availability.   Other than that, it's a nice job to work with, both good for minors and those who want to have a career with Walmart."
good,Es un ambiente de trabajo donde siempre estarás ocupado tanto sea ayudando a los clientes o laborando tu deber en la empresa.
good,It was a good job. I was paid a pretty decent wage. I learned how to communicate with people and obtained a hard work ethic. The management was ok and nice. The hardest part of the job was working long hot days and rarely returning inside.
good,Clock in. Go to assigned register and begin ringing up customers.When there is down time organize surrounding selves and bring nearby customers ready for check out to your register
good,"Walmart recognized my hard work and rewarded me with full time and benefits. There are are days that salaried management get frustrated and take out frustration on hourly associates, especially during the holidays (black friday, christmas, etc.), Hardest part is when certain managers build a trust with particular associates and rely on them individually to do the work of three or more associates. The most enjoyable part was the fact that I learned a lot of skills."
good,"When I worked their I had so much.  The people for the most part is a lot of fun to work with.  I really miss it, but life moves on.  I may try a someday soon"
good,I learn every department in Walmart so I kept myself busy. I like helping the customer find what they was looking for. I enjoy carrying the customers merchandise to there car. I basically enjoy giving good customer service.
good,"Okay company to work, not much with growth. raises are now 2% every year. which stinks so no matter how hard you work or go above beyond here's your 2% like everybody else."
good,Working for this company can have its ups and downs. The rules to follow are sometimes hard. When the dress codes get changed we have to purchase them ourselves even though its hard sometimes for people to purchase them.
good,Management not always on the same page with each other which in my opinion causes lost productivity. Say they are family store but are very hesitant to work with you on personal isssues.
good,it was a job that helped me pay my bills and I could nit get a set schedule which was hard for me because I have children and the company did nit pay me enough to pay for child care too.
good,It was taxing for your feet standing and walking every where but all the employees where usually extremely nice. The store manager though acted like he was too good to associate himself with people beneath him. He always walked around like he was better than everyone.
good,My experience at Walmart was a great experience it help me get better at communicating and conversing with others it was a great and fun job for a first job
good,this job was alright i had fun most of the time. Though it was back breaking because i had to push 6 carts constantly because the cart machine was broken at that moment when i was working there. the the other associate were nice including the customer and the environment there was good as well
good,"Manager sucked, workers rude, left you to do all the work for the pay.  Left you alone to do trash. It was horrible. HR women was rude. Nobody wanted to show you anything."
good,"Lots of work to do every day.  No time for slacking as work load is very demanding.  Fast paced environment, very little downtime.  Managers tend to have unrealistic expectations of workers."
good,Accepted written prescriptions to be filled for customers.  Typed prescription into computer to be reviewed by pharmacist for accuracy. Input insurance information for billing purposes. Filled prescriptions as directed by label. Also sold prescriptions at the register to customers picking up
good,"Over all Wal-Mart is a good place to work. They could work on being more open minded to those who have children and families but if you are just starting out ages 18-25, if may be a good fit. The typical work day is pretty fast paced. you learn to work as a team and have patience for others. The management is usually good. TRY IT. YOU MAY LIKE IT."
good,"fast paced environment, fun employees, gossip was very prevalent, some back stabbing, customers for the most part were pleasant, schedule was never the same"
good,"Tem que ser dinâmico e resiliente pois as mudanças em uma empresa de varejo é diária. "
good,"its a typical day to work mostly customer service and stocker"
good,Nobody ever try's to get there work done all the managers do is walk around acting like they ever do something the peopleworking there are lazy and don't ever try to be the best team.
good,"There was poor management in place. No organization around the job site.  Lack of communication among associates and upper management.  However, some really good people to work with."
good,The best part is meeting so many new people not just the Associates but the customers too.There is so many new things to learn working at walmart.the mangers were good to everyone you could talk to them when you needed too.They work with you on your  schedule.The hardest part was when you didnt get too many hours.
good,"Accounting office"
good,Productivity and efficiency were the key components of working here. The culture is what you make it. Management was helpful at times. The most enjoyable part of the job was the great hours.
good,I was a CAP 2 Team member and I stocked shelves everyday as well as unloaded trucks. Most of the management were really nice and helpful and the job itself was really easy.
good,Walmart was my first job. I was trained by a computer not really hands on. I never was sure how to do my job. I never knew who my manager was or if they were around. I was thrown to the wolves.
good,Very busy place to work and keeps you moving. Be ready to deal with alot of people must be a people person. loved all the friends i made there. Must be a quick thinker
good,"Walmart is a stressful place to work, the managers have ungodly expectations for their employees. I was hired as a Self Checkout Host(SCO) but they would always place me as a cashier on a checkout isle. I would just focus on my work and check people out as fast and safe as possible."
good,it was good days when i worked there i learned about how to zone right. An the management was poor at times with decent work place culture.the hard part of it all was the time limit but it was nice to push buggies every once in a while.
good,"I would say a typical day at work consisted of staying busy, focused, friendly, and productive at all times because the customers comes first. For the most part there was always good teamwork."
good,The management at my store needs some improvement. That is not all stores. Ther e is plenty of room to move up and the pay is higher then most other jobs in retail.
good,Its not a bad place to work all things considered. It can be stressful but as long as you do your job and don't skip work all the time you should be fine.
good,"Walmart is a great company shopping wise but employment wise its stressful,no one ever holds accountability for themselves, the managers NEVER know anything, all together, yes the are consistent if you're someone who is looking for alot of hours but be ready for the headaches."
good,Started off as a stocker 2012 andvance to maintenance learn how to mix chemicals in proper measurements bottles wax floors detail restrooms buff floor
good,"I enjoyed very much working with my fellow associates at Walmart along with the management. The only thing that would get to me is when I would come in to work and find that there was far more work then the previous day and it kept seeming to stack up as if the other shifts didn't do anything. I do not think that was the case, I think that the product just kept coming at a pace that couldn't or wasn't being able to be caught up with. Overall not a bad experience but things could always be better."
good,we have bad and good days. It's always fun to work but sometimes it's stressful. We even do jobs that we're not suppose to do. And by that i mean we do everybody's work and we clean after everybody.
good,Greeting people who are friendly and not so friendly and but I press on to do the best job possible. The culture is easy going and friendly some of the employees are nice and helpful.
good,Enjoyed working with the public from day to day helping folks. Lots of steady hard work to keep busy. Good friendly faces to work beside! Nice pay too.
good,Everyday was different. It was always changing depending on what needed to be done. I learned a lot about managing time and tasks in this position. The hardest part was ensuring that the weekly quota was met. The most enjoyable was being able to handle a lot of tasks at once and engaging with coworkers.
good,"Hard work for the money you're making, must pull a certain production percentage so you have to stay moving and on your top game at all times. Any breaks will drag down your production."
good,"It was a situation of its ok for this one but not this one, and it be the same situation, they carry their favorites and you have to kiss butt a lot if you want to get there and stay there"
good,greal reviews i really like this job in the people are so sweet I will work for them again I think they Give everyone a chance at a New career i really like this job
good,"It was ok but stressful, Customers can be nice at times but you dealing with many personalities at once. I have won an award for having a great attitude toward the customers."
good,"This is by far the worst company to work for. Pay is not good for what you have to deal with. You cant move up unless your ""friends"" with the managers. They say one thing and do another. Its just not good foe your health."
good,"Walmart is a very popular grocery store that always has a customer in it. It is crucial to understand time management and multitasking. If you are ok with being the leader and always picking up the slack, Walmart is for you."
good,I cashed out customers and helped when ever possible.  very fast paced job.  they had hired too many personnel for the holiday season and was let go because sales were not were they needed to be.
good,"not great, hours were poor and management paid no mind to your scheduling preferences. you only get four call in's and that includes being late a well."
good,"Working at Walmart has given me great customer service, teamwork, and great problem solving skills. Walmart is not an easy job nor is it a hard job. Walmart has taught me a lot and therefore wanting me to expand my horizon with the customer service that I have learned."
good,I enjoyed working as a cashier at Super Walmart. I enjoyed meeting new customers all the time. I love the fast paced work environment. This was one of my favorite jobs.
good,I absolutely loved it there. It was a great second job and I sometimes miss being there. It paid me what I needed while I was in my final years of highschool.
good,Its an okay job unless you want to work up. It could be temporary or come with a lot of benefits and you want to work up. You have to be good with customers and be able to resolve issues. The management is the best one I have had jobwise and it can range from being a fast past to slow past job. I just do not like how you have to work holidays or you'll get fired considering some people have family in different states or cities.
good,The people you worked with was fun and made the day go by fast. But management was very inconsistent and would often give you unrealistic time frames. Work was always manageable and you felt productive.
good,The best part about working for this company is the people. You get to interact with some pretty amazing people. It's hard to build relationships within the company bc it employs so many people.
good,"Fast-paced, stressful job. The most enjoyable time of the day is breaks and lunches, if you are lucky enough to even get a break. Management needs to better themselves at communicating and appreciating their associates."
good,"I do not wish to leave a comment. Since I am forced to, I enjoyed servicing the consumers and co-workers. I do not with to comment on the management team."
good,"Faltava mais espaço pra tanta coisa , estoque maior mais organização para o padrão multinacional da empresa."
good,It is a great job when you are just starting out. it is flexible and you can grow within the company. there is room for improvement and achievements and you get to meet knew people.
good,Walmart was a great learning experience and i have to regrets working there. i had fun and was treated great by my co workers. managers were a different story. learned a lot of people skills and employee management
good,I only worked during the holidays and moved to Arizona after. But it was not good management. It was just temporary so I can't review to much. That particular store just seemed to be very unorganized.
good,can't tell much of Walmart I never worked for them. just doing sales for Comcast contractor. I only can tell that I saw few people happy working for Walmart.
good,me gusto el ambuente de trabajo lo unico malo que no se porke lo hacen poner un codigo para ya no ser contratable me parece mui poca etica de la empresa.
good,The good thing about working for the Walmart home office is that they will invest in you by sending you to internal free classes. These classes teach you leadership skills.
good,Usually understaffed and always lots of pressure. Management wasn’t very clear about things and usually put themselves first. Didn’t seem to care too much about their employees.
good,"Walmart Neighborhood Market    "
good,"just fair and alot of overtime. short breaks and they have occurences and steps for tardy,even when you are sick and no call no show .Discpline is of high standard"
good,"It was an easy job with good hours (didin't want to pay overtime unless necessary)."
good,"Worked pets papper goods and chemicals "
good,Walmart was had a lot of fun moments and had some nice people but the management was poor. Some managers were very unprofessional. They weren’t very quick on solving problems and would sometimes blow them off.
good,Good work with you can get a few days rest and then you can refocus. Promotion is possible if you work hard. Day build daily if you come to work daily.
good,Its very stressful but fun at the same time. Your able to go up in the company. You meet new people each and everyday. Very helpful and friendly at times.
good,There were short breaks but they were fairly frequent. There wasnt anything special about the job but there wasnt anything awful either. I did not love the job. There were awkward hours and a confusing schedule to keep track of. it was hard to use the website to check my hours.
good,This is a retail type job. If you like working in retail  and you like the atmosphere and people this might be a company you should take a look at. Full time has good benifits for young workers.
good,It's a decent place to work at. Most of the co-workers are friendly and hardworking. Some of the upfront supervisors can sometimes lack on their job. It's a place where they really can't work with school hours unless you are in high school.
good,"Management depends on the type of person you don't mind working for, is how your experience will go. Have to be easy to work with. No Drama. Learned how to work in customer service and how to talk to people."
good,Worked in bakery. Worked odd hrs. Wasn't a lot of help from mangement. Not a lot of moral for employee or recognition. Very. Fast paced environment. Just not a lot of back up for me.
good,each shift had tasks to complete as well as helping guests with there needs. Management was present and listened and answered any needs. I worked at smaller store but a very busy store and enjoyed the people and time I was employed there.
good,I like working at Walmart. Sometimes it can be stressful and management gets on you but as long as you do your job and what you're suppose to do then you will be good.
good,Working experience at walmart is how you make it ... You had managers who treated you like a human and you had others who treated you as a number and a position
good,Performed register audits. Gave employees breaks and lunches on time. Handled any concerns of customer complaints. Hardest part of the job would be the customers.
good,"iWAlamrt is a good place to work if you are looking for part time work, however career advancement comes with who you know and what are you willing to give to the company"
good,The good things were some managers were willing to work with you and its a laid back place. Mostly bad things happened. How you were talked down too. Lack of communication. A lot of people dont work there really. They just look like there doing something only a set few would actually work. Plus over 50 people quit the 8 months I was there. Me I was working as much as 3 people I was training people when I wasnt trained my self. I was doing manager type duties but not getting paid as a manager or paid more for all this extra stuff I was doing.
good,"It may have been a job with pay and benefits, but nothing to brag about.  It paid the bills and covered me medically, so do other companies.  Was I in love with Walmart?  No  Was I happy and content?  Yes.  Maybe the next place will be better."
good,Confidentiality of any open door as far as management positions are concerned. Open door is not heard professionally. It all boils down to who you know in upper Human Resources areas.
good,"I work in the Pharmacy department putting away merchandise and helping customers. I really enjoy what I do and I was even given a chance to learn a different function so now I help my department and the other understaffed departments when needed, Overall it is a really nice experience I just wish the pay was better."
good,"Demasiada presión para al empleado, mala administración de horarios por parte de los jefes y sin beneficios por el trabajo extra"
good,This job was a lot of organization. it was very easy just tedious. I enjoyed the people i worked with. Setting up clothing displays was enjoyable. There was no hard part to this job.
good,"Very hard to get in full-time, and part-time employees don't seem to be a priority for management. Not a very supportive work environment but being a responsible employee is much appreciated by co-workers."
good,There is not enough team work or associate appreciation also to me there is favoritism I wouldn’t recommend someone to work at Walmart well I wouldn’t say all Walmart’s because I  don’t know how the other ones are but where I’m at I wouldn’t.
good,"great place to work if you enjoy fast pace and speaking to a lot of different types of people in every mood, plenty of opportunities in different departments if you are finding yourself bored."
good,good on some days to work there I mean others it is very stressfull and I mean I wanna be a cop and working there I would never make to be a cop so just holding me back
good,I've Never had a problem with Walmart yes I would work there again if i ever have the opportunity to work there again.the workers are nice everybody works together as a team
good,"Associates don't put forward their best foot, poor scheduling, unprofessional, not business savy, horrible attitude and customer service and poor management."
good,"Working at Walmart had it's ups as well as it's downs as well. Aside from some of the managers lack of communication at time, and rudeness at times the job was kind of fun. I learned alot far as cashier experience, dealing with vendors when it comes to processing merchandise, and mostly that the slightest action can make a customers day."
good,You punch in. Do your job punch out. I learned how important team work is. The culture is ok. Management is willing to work with you but are restricted by what corporate tells them to do. The hardest part is when your the only one on the secdual trying to keep up with the calls. Most enjoyable part is the people and being able to help them.
good,"Walmart was an alright place to work. I started in dry foods and worked my way to department manager, but I found it very hard to go anywhere with that company if you arent willing to pawn your work off on other people. Must say Multi-departmental in walmart is NOT a good thing."
good,"Its a easy workplace , Management is very professional and caring , Training is easy , and the atmosphere is good. I was taught how to be a sales associate."
good,"I worked three jobs their, I greeted doors, cashed people out at the register, and push carts outside. At one point they had me pushing carts in a blizzard."
good,pretty good job get paid every two weeks very simple task not hard friendly people manager is nice  they are fair to everyone no mess there they are very respectful u wont have no problems working you there
good,Fun and great place to work. Great customer service. Very fast paced environment. Great employee discounts. Would recommend this job to any one looking for a job.
good,walmart was a stressful work place  customer care is required  not much skill required the pay was not always accurate fast paced work environment time consuming
good,I was a hard worker and did intended to stay but was sick a lot. I did enjoy working with different people but it was a very stressful job. The management sometimes are easy to work with.
good,"Overall it is an okay place to work, but can be stressful when understaffed, and they had unreasonable requests of getting tasks done etc. lack of help during busy hours"
good,I enjoyed my stay and would like to work there again. They were flexible with my schedule and they were nice. Job is easy and relaxing unless there are bad customers.
good,"The hours are flexible and the pay is good. Besides some craziness around the holidays and on weekends, it isn't a bad place to work at all. I'd definitely recommend working here."
good,I love the people that I work with . I Do my job they way they want it I streefully to deal with some customer. There a lot of cleaning involved in the job.
good,i started off on the Mod Team. i liked it because i didn’t have to stock shelf’s & it was more relaxed. then when we ran out of Mods they made us stock & i didn’t like that @ all. i’m not physically built for that.
good,Pay really low according the work we do. They pay less than expected which is not enough and Management is hard. They need to do well. Some managers are really rude and they expect a lot from employees.
good,I think it can be great if one is allowed to transfer to a department which is compatible to both employee/employer. Not good if they will not move you to a different department when one is not a good fit. I requested a transfer many times from one department. No go as they had no one to take my place.
good,"Its a great opportunity for people who has another job, kids or school they will work with your off days and worked hours.Its good to move to a bigger position."
good,to be honest I enjoyed my time while working here even though it was a temporary job I wish it would have lasted longer if you enjoy customer service and staying focus on a job I say go for it
good,Work hard and it wont go unoticed its a quick paced place to work stressful at times customers are friendly good benefits good hours for people who like working retail.
good,Well my job was pretty hard you know I had to push the carts you know they were heavy was raining it was snowy it was hot we didn't have that machine that they have now to push the carts
good,"I did enjoy working at WalMart, both in the Jewelry Department and as a Cashier.  I found the Managers to be fair and competent.  I did not, however, find that to be so with some of the lower level management staff.  They were certainly not customer service oriented.  They just didn't seem to care what type of shopping experience customers had."
good,overall it was a great place to learn new skills. the company itself was great the only downfall was the location i was at was the location that was used to train new store managers. this effected the store moral significantly because each trainee made many changes that they thought would help profits and many of their ideas failed and we were all held responsible and it also made our profit sharing cheque at the end of each year lower then other locations.
good,Unruly customers tough to deal with due to verbally offensive language. Sometimes you had to hold your tongue. Black Friday 2013 I wish I had a taser for protection. I witnessed at least 20 people who needed to be locked up in a cage.
good,I enjoy working at Walmart. Walmart provides opportunities for growth. Management works with my schedule and is friendly. Walmart offer great benefits for their employees.
good,Working there was okay. Did not make enough money for the amount of experience that I have had and the scheduled hours were a bit overwhelming.  Management was mostly understanding.
good,Management was never on the same page. For a full time student the company is not willing to work with you. Benefits were great and the co workers were as well.
good,"It is a great job for a first job, however it is low pay and high stress. it is a good job for a young person or an older person that is looking for a job just tp stay busy."
good,"I enjoyed th job it was an experience .I like to be able to help people out when they had an issue with returns from products that don't work out for them ,Like greeting people and just to be able to assist"
good,"busy place to work. high turnover rate, a lot of managers that really didn't have the answers. A lot of gossip between the employees. A demanding job for low pay"
good,"I wouldn't recommend it to my dog."
good,"Customers and coworkers made the place fun and interesting. Management didn't really manage much and singled people out, treated everyone different and unfair views on everything."
good,Started off as a Cashier then was transferred to the Service Desk. Was my first ever job after high school. Taught me alot about responsibility and work eithics. Hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers.
good,"I would give a reference for Walmart if the person was interested in a advancement with in a large corporation type company. My typical day consists of customer service all around in every area of the particular location.  I learned ""I can do anything if you put your mind to it""."
good,Working at Walmart was really tough for me. I had a hard time with the hours changing all the time and management was not very kind. It was really rough.
good,Walmart is a great place for students to pursue a job because they are willing to work with your schedule as well as giving you hours that is beneficial.
good,Sucks really bad in a typical day at wal-mart. I learned to not go back there anymore. The management was horrible didn't have any experience in departments in store.
good,"uma empresa organizada, muito preoculpada em fazer sempre o correto, ela só peca em qyuestão de valor de salario."
good,Good place to work. The pay is very well for area and other associates are helpful and good to work with. Different shifts that include days nights or weekend shifts available
good,"It was a fun place to work, great co workers, treated very fairly, if it wasnt for a need to relocated i would probably still be working there........"
good,Working at Wal-mart was a way of learning to deal with many different types of personalities and also a good way of leaning customer service values. It also allowed the ability to earn overtime around the holiday seasons.
good,"It's not a place to stay at but to gain customer service experience or stocking experience. You will not gain much advancement opportunities, but its a relaxed place to work (if you're on graveyard shift)."
good,"Fun place to work, Got to meet people, Sometimes work is slow,Sometimes work is fast. We had to fix up aisle at your register, Put change and bills in the register drawers. Most of the Bosses are cool. Some bosses are not cool. I learned most people are nice and respectable, Some are just right rude and disresptful."
good,"As you know all retail businesses can be different.  But in the words of many others who wish to have holidays off, please it is retail and we all know retail hardly ever shuts down.  So if your looking for a place that gives you work and sometimes stress.  This is the industry for you."
good,i worked at walmart in the deli bakery. every day i had to cook chicken and ribs and pork loins. wing dings. chicken tenders. ext. and also work a slicer to cut meats.
good,you go in to work get your assignment for the day and try to get it done. people you work with are great . the pay ( when I was there was not that great ) but heard it went up
good,I loved working there and meeting new people everyday . Except for the rude people . I loved the friendly staff and trainers. They helped me out a lot.
good,"Positive Work environment"
good,"If you work day shift your entire day is mostly consumed by work. Draining but fair pay and opportunity for advancement, although unlikely depending on management at your store they will overwork and walk all over you"
good,"Walmart is a great place to work as a customer service rep, or cashier. It’s just the poor management that they have that will make you wanna quit. Managers there where very rude and disrespectful and does not show consideration to their workers"
good,love working at wal-mat interacting with people getting to meet know people the work place was so welcoming. I love helping people just making sure the customers walked out with a smile was good for me.
good,Wal-Mart can be a good company to work for if you want to advance your career in the retail job market. The workers and management team are very friendly and helpful in aiding you with whatever help you may need. This just wasn't the career I want to pursue further.
good,"A typical day  at works would include clocking in , figuring out where you were suppose go , going to the area , clean up the area turn on the light and start your day ."
good,My co workers made my time there easier. I learned they dont care when people get sick and dont let them have time off to get better. A very few managers there made my job more enjoyable.
good,"great benefits, low morale for associates. unless you have been there for multiple years you will be held to a higher standard while the long term associates receive everything they need due to them being there a while. They get away with everything including being disrespectful to management and upper management will not back their management team."
good,"At smart style in Pasco it wasn't always busy but I kept busy. I learned great customer service and I love to take care of people. Working in a bigger city gave me a chance to learn how to perform my services quick but with quality. I deepened my knowledge of color, perming, hair cuts and facial waxing. Working under the management there was an amazing opportunity to grow as not only an artistic hair stylist but also a person as well. The hardest part of the job was wanting to take care of every single guest as much as possible but sometimes not having enough hours in the day to get to every one. My favorite thing about my job was being able to create art with hair. I am very passionate about what I do and getting a chance to effect someone's life has given me such a deep appreciation for each individual soul on this earth. I want to take care of people to the best of my abilities and with cosmetology and the beauty industry that is possible. I am excited to continue learning new things everyday and I want to continue to grow as a person."
good,good but very tough management very bad assistant managers and never got full time when promised too. we do make friends and at times have good days. but also had bad days. depending on how good of mood management was.
good,it was a great place  to work and i loved the people i meet and worked with and how everyone worked as a team. i love how easy it was to do recovery and clean your department was.
good,This is a good job to get yourself established. Especially moving from out of state. Met a lot of interesting people made memories that I will never forget.
good,"Do not work for long because I did not have many hours and choose to look for a job with more pay. It was nice and I got a lot of knowledge about the differences in cultures, people and even workmates. Aside they do not require so much work just must be kind smiling all the time and meet customer I think it's something basic in our daily lives."
good,"mucho trabajo en equipo, politicas de trabajo seguro"
good,must be in the right group to excel. Overall the job was satisfying but most can do better elsewhere. Other stores may not have the same problem. pretty good insurance plan.
good,"ok place to work you can make really good friends and a close bond with your coworkers, could be a little better with training. Also could be better with their open door policy"
good,This was a typical retail environment with a constantly shifting work setting and flow of customers. It varied from season to season but all in all it was a relatively fast moving day.
good,Great temporary job and was able to meet alot of new people.  Was nice to be able to work with the public.  Discounts you received were also nice.  Job was over 25 years ago.
good,Working at walmart sucked. Pay was good and i needed a job. So it was a good job for someone in need of an immediate job but I would not like to work there again.
good,It was low rates and unfair shift schedule for workers who are not friends or relatives with someone in a high ranking. Sometimes the workplace was so cold because the doors were open or heater didn't work.
good,"Managers were pretty consistent with any questions or concerns."
good,Walmart was good cause it was inside but management was not good and pay. And have to like to work with people which I did. But Walmart did not pay employee enough.
good,I was written up one time at walmart when I asked a manager to handle a situation with a customer she instructed me to handle it and then wrote me up because she did not like the way I handled it
good,Muy buena empresa buen trato y respeto mutuo con los colaboradores
good,"I’ve worked there for over two years. It’s an unfair work place, management allows some people to just show up when they want and leave when they want, and allows some to sit around while others work."
good,The job can be quick paced but not overwhelming. Tasks are easy to understand and learn. Management is approachable and open to listening to employees.
good,"•	Assigned to cashier and inventory duties in a diverse team environment. "
good,Wal-mart is a good company. The pay rate should be raised for people to be able to afford to live. The work atmosphere is usually pretty good to work.
good,"My typical day includes me being tethered to the pharmacy register.  If I'm not chained to the register, I'm putting out stock or zoning and that is what I do all day. "
good,A good solid company low paying. You cant make a living if your single - you must have other sources of income. They won't promote you unless you are young. Mistreatment of younger employees and racial discrimination
good,Day at walmart can be fast paced and hard on you with dealing with the customers. The work isn't hard just stressful at times and the walking can be rough on the feet.
good,Management is very disrespectful to employee. I enjoyed the work but did not appreciate managers speaking ill to employees. They called people stupid and other unprofessional names.
good,"staff is friendly but can also be difficult with drama, it is an alright place to work and grow. learning new areas of the store and getting to work with great people"
good,It is an okay job but the management is not very good at standing behind their workers and all they seem to really care about is if they make profits for the year so they can get their own personal bonus. It is an okay job for full-time associates but if you want part-time work do not expect much from them as far as advancement or respect.
good,"face paced environment, on busy day .time would go bye fast but the store was left a mess every night and once store closed associated would have to stay after hours to clean up and organized"
good,"This is a retail environment, so to work for them, you have to have open availability. They are vey customer orientated . The managers are not as trained as they were in Kmart, they are not hands on managers."
good,"Pretty fast paced, some managers were good, some bad. No motivation for employees other than to go home and play video games, even managers. It was exceptional pay for unloading"
good,well its was always a productive day but tend to be a little stressful  always getting locked out of my register because no one to relieve me for my break but i enjoyed staying busy and interacting with the customers in all in all i enjoyed my job cause i enjoy people
good,"I liked the place done all the duties that is allowed at there ,  great meeting different cultures learning the likes an dislikes of the customers , and loved the staff."
good,Its a good job if you are willing to work. The company is cutting hours badly and its difficult to live on what the pay. I wished they would give more hours to work.
good,Management needs to treat associates with respect.... Management road the good workers and let the lazy ones slide...Management allows other employees and customers be disrespectful..
good,"They hate their employees, was working 40+ hours a week and could not get medical insurance for myself and my infant daughter. My coworkers were cool, some of them I'm still in contact with."
good,Wal-Mart is an ok job... Some of the people there are very nice to work for but it can be very hostile. It is very fast past and you have to meet a died line.
good,As an over night stocker it was my job to stock the merchandise that came into the store that night for what ever department I was assigned too. By the end of the night each department that I worked in should be zoned with the overstock binned in the backroom.
good,Pharmacy tech has many different roles that you have to pay close attention too. One of them includes assisting the Pharmacist in there everyday task.
good,"I enjoyed the people and selling new guns, talking with older people about guns. Helping people find items they need quickly and nicely. They work around your schedule if you are in college or have another job."
good,"Local bom de trabalhar, organização excelente e feedback interessante"
good,"early morning packing and prepping"
good,"Really difficult to have management work with your schedule. It was mandatory to have a 1 hour lunch, which made the day go by slow.  Also, the way they schedule you was not pleasant. 11am to 8pm, all day and most the night."
good,Una empresa gigante a nivel mundial con pocos beneficios poca la remuneración y te explotaban
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting and assisting customers with their requests and needs.  I really liked it when I had return customers who asked for me by name.
good,It’s an ok job for a teen or retired person my personal opinion is people who deserve better opportunities don’t get them they don’t really recognize hard work
good,Its a stressful job and inconsistent scheduling however they do work with you on your scheduling needs. Its difficult to get enough hours each week so a full time position would be better its just hard to get full time positions.
good,"The job was easy, the major problem is you can't transfer to other areas if you work in the custodian division. "
good,"The job entailed is quick-paced. The need to be quick and friendly is a must. The customers expect a quick and friendly experience. Overall, the job experience is good."
good,go to work stocking shelves and helping with customers needs. work 8 hour shifts have a 1 hour kunch and 2 15 minute breaks. you have to fill shelves and also clean the back room daily
good,"Work was easy, even when given things to do that involve lifting or organizing things, etc. You earn $10 an hour after about 2-3 months and get your discount card in-between that time which takes 10 percent off of everything in store. There are some good and bad managers here, as with any job, however more end up being negative rather than positive. To most of the managers it's all about their wallets. Good part time job, wouldn't recommend full time, every year benefits get cut more and more."
good,"Good atmosphere and good people. Open Door policies are endorsed which I like. However, There policies across the country, how they treat us salary and benefit wise is a sore spot. The culture is good, relaxed, and laid back but we don't get the credit I think we deserve. They pay us poorly because of our location, not realizing that location doesn't matter as much in the tech world anyway. They are turning their associates away because of bad beefits and that feels.....slimey to me because it is only the Bentonville office that suffers from this issue. My managers are great but it is nearly impossible to get a raise or promotion."
good,"Constant business, its never a boring or slow day. Always expect a rush even when it seems to have slowed down. Be prepared to have your breaks pushed back."
good,"It was just a temporary job, and not one I'm likely to go back to unless I have to. There are many other jobs I would choose over this one. The only upside to the job was the customers."
good,"Stressful"
good,"I didn't work there long, but I enjoyed the job.  It was not too boring and my coworkers were great. I worked in the produce dept.  I felt I had a reasonable amount of responsibility for my knowlege and experience"
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart. The best part of it by far were my co-workers. They made the day easier and better. A little more focus on the employees would be nice.
good,they were very helpful when my husband died the treated me like family. the associates were friendly and helpful. the like to cut hours on the front end where the cashiers are
good,"Working for this company, you have to be able to handle situations under a lot of stress. The company itself is a good company but they need to work on their management. They aren't always there for you when you need them or when you need help resolving a problem. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the customers."
good,"There's always something to do which is a good and bad thing. They expected you to work in any department but never received training which doesn't work well for employees or customers. I enjoyed having benefits, however HR was not very helpful and seemed to be annoyed by doing their job. Overall if you need a job this is the place."
good,good job its inside and plenty to do helping people when black friday comes along it is very fun and exciting. management are very helpful   and nice.
good,It was a great company to work for in the beginning. However with times changing it also changed and was more making money than their employees. Needed a change
good,"Walmart trains employees to be hopeful by sharing a message, that I believe the founder Sam Walton believed, that business can be profitable when you put people first over money.  Unfortunately, in my experience this mentality seemed to have been all, but abandoned with him gone.  Walmart boast high starting pay rates and advancement opportunities, and then trains its employees with videos that assert your importance to the company, but in my experience as an employee, the general mentality of the workers was that we were viewed as easily replacable if our contribution wasn't worthy in the warehouse.  In my observation, this fear didn't seem to go away, even when you had moved up.  It didn't bother me much at first as I felt I was putting an honest effort into the job, but as I moved toward advancement in the company, I shared some ideas to help us improve operations, one of which she told me that she had suggested the same thing and was told by the engineers that, ""She did not make enough to worry about these things.""  I pushed for some of these ideas that I felt would improve operations, but I would always agree to stand united with them when she explained that Walmart wants us to do it another way, in spite of the desire to point out that the training videos say that Sam Walton loved to hear his employees' ideas and often made very successful changes based on them.  After making my case I would always agree to represent Walmart the way corporate wanted to be represented among those I lead, and after this soft interview/training, the general manager let me know that she didn't"
good,"Requires a lot of attention to detail and customers. Typical day at work consisted of stocking freight and helping customers.  Hired as an Electronics Associate, but get moved around a lot."
good,"Handle proper labeling and pricing of merchandize"
good,"It is retail so of course at times the work is stressful, sometimes due to call offs they may be understaffed but overall the job is not the worst job I have ever had."
good,Llevar control de vendedores e inventario de lo que entra y sale en la compañía checkear invoices y p.o de mercancía proveniente de Fedex y ups  hacerle créditos de lo q sale
good,"Fellow managers were great  to work with. I learned a lot about the wine and beer business when it comes  to sales."
good,"Stocked shelves, greet customers as they enter the store,did a little light cleaning, did price check. I get to work do what i have to do. I come to work on time.I really didnt do to much cause it was a temp job."
good,"Busy on the weekends, some customers are very nice and some are very rude. It helps when it is a study pace, because it make the day go by faster. Over all its a great way to be nice and friendly."
good,"Ok hours, solid work experience. "
good,hardest part was the store getting packed for holidays with only a few of us working we had to work fast paced had to get everybody out of line in a decent time
good,It was fun for a while but management expects way to much and management is out of touch. The associates are mistreated by customers and management seems not to care. it would be nice if management would help out especially upfront when lines are long instead of standing around yelline on the walkies.
good,"Team oriented job. Very Flexible with great pay. hours vary from day to day. A lot of standing, and walking. No heavy lifting. Promotes within company"
good,"Not a terrible place to work, but there are challenges. Rude customers, under staffing, and co-workers who may or may not show up to help. There are great locations and there are also terrible locations, so your mileage will vary. The pay is fair considering the tasks i'm asked to preform."
good,clean floors when done stock shelves to make 40 hors a week. I learned how to use a minuteman floor scrubber and buffer. Management was ok. Workplace just work get it done go home. Hardest part was putting up with threats form my sup. Enjoyable part of the job is when I moved on.
good,pues es una empresa no muy buena pero tampoco es una mala opcion para poder trabajar
good,"Not a bad place to work. Had its challenges but over all was fun. Learned a lot about inventory, ordering and working with individuals that were green to retail."
good,"it was an overall nice place to work. management could have been better at times. the hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers. but, i enjoyed my time with Walmart overall."
good,Average work place. Learned all about health and safety. The training was excellent but they were not very good about scheduling the breaks. I would go 2 to 3 hours without a break.
good,Walmart is a great place to work. They are very structured inside the workplace. You have a strict schedule but they can be flexible with your schedule if you have any time restrictions. The work environment is very friendly.
good,"Pleasant company to work for but they did not value their employees."
good,I honestly did not have a problem working at Walmart loved my peers just upper management was a lot to deal with. But overall I liked my job in a whole
good,any thing from check cashing to helping customers with issues and trying to resolve it at the lowest level possible if not turn the issue over to higher staff
good,Management is co-ordinating and easy going. Its an okay place for a part time job for students. Hours are flexible. The environment is decent. Not great but nor too bad.
good,I love my job. I love what I do .Its hard to excel in a poor managed environment. Very unprofessional managers .  I am eager to be successful and grow with a good team and great company. Its hard to get promoted to many favorites . Looking for a fresh start
good,very stressful job  a lot of heavy lifting  managers talk down on you a very fast paced job  never enough help they are always short handed  mostly work every weekend and holidays
good,job descriptions included a lot of tasks in a work day. Sometimes other work tasks were asked to be done that were out of job descriptions. Had to pick up other workers slack sometimes as well
good,average work environment. diverse customers. can't please everyone. they did let you work on online classes. as you passed these classes their incentive was a raise.
good,"I loved working here. They were so friendly and nice. the only reason i left, was i had to move home for the summer while i was in college. great place to work."
good,"Uma   otima  empresa  ,  "
good,"Working as the Overnight Stock Associate, I received, stored, and issued materials and other items from the stockroom, warehouse, or storage yard. I kept all records and compiled them for review."
good,I've learned alot during retail. The hardest part is being on feet all night. Managment is very unorgganized. A typical night come in try to fine where you are working and can't fine half the equiment you need to work with.
good,"Good company, Hard to get moved to a full time employee and as part time employee you only get a 10% discount as benefits and that's it. Full time employees get much more."
good,"Not very flexible with hours. There was good pay, but sometimes the job would be boring. When it is busy it does keep you on your toes. Coworkers were friendly."
good,"Answered questions regarding the store and its merchandise."
good,"A typical workday at Walmart is fast-pace, demanding, challenging but rewarding. Walmart is invested in staying the leader in retail which mean rapid change for Leaders and associates. Associates are great at Walmart. The most enjoyable part about Walmart is working with the Associates. Giving associates an opportunity to grow their careers with a good organization."
good,Walmart is a job that is what you make it.  On average associates that are grandfathered in at Wal-mart are the final survivors.  Other associates may want to use the job a stepping stone to a dream career.
good,It has provided me with tremendous experience good and bad. I'M so thankful that I was able to learn on the job and have had the opportunity to work with some really great people
good,"Great environment to work in , the people are very nice and friendly, and Ii loved interacting with the customers , I’ve learned many things about customer service and organization."
good,"Walmart was a good place for me to work at while i was in school, good employees, just poor management, i really did enjoy my time there im a social person so i was happy to talk to customers."
good,"worked there 13 years ,had job offer to better my career,meet alot of nice people along the way,there is room for advancement, if you can relocate to a new store,"
good,"Walmart was good to me in many ways. I advanced rather quickly. "
good,Walmart was very understanding when it came to school and health. they were open with my availability as well. Working overnight we normally got a lot of overtime but they were good at letting us cut it instead of getting in trouble for it
good,"Every day was the same. Receiving, and unloading merchandise, with an inflexible deadline. Managment with little to no experiance in that department, giving unrealistic ultimatums."
good,Pretty good place to work. If your only looking for part time. Very little opportunity for advancement. If your seeking full time or management there is very little opportunity for that.
good,Hard to work with sudden inconveniences. Hard to change schedule around and hard to get days off even with doing three weeks in advance. Always were needing to cut hours and would fire over any little thing to help that happen.
good,I learned how to handle money and be a great supervisor. I had a great team that taught me a lot of new things. I also was able to step up my game with excellent customer service skills.
good,"Typical day is getting pulled in 5 different directions at once"
good,"get to work and stand at the register, ringing people out. making friendly but light conversation and checking ads for ad match. management was good, but also all over the place. there was always so many different things going on that nobody could be there right away to help. the hardest part of the job was keeping lines short and customers happy at checkout. the most enjoyable part was meeting all sorts of different people with different stories."
good,Walmart has a reputation for long hours and low pay which was true for when i worked there. Not much flexibility with the scheduling and not very open to considering those with medical issues
good,Was a fair place to work but lack of management skills has made people look for other jobs. Work is hard but not to bad if you can manage your time. Culture has changed though the years and has become undesirable for some.
good,if u dont mind standing all day long and people yelling at u a lot its the job for u. good pay. not good insurance for such a big company with people who need to go to the dr
good,get a discount after 90 days employed.  o.k. place to work depending on where and when you work.  some departments have good managers and some do not.
good,i need to work i like jobs that is work my whole shift not part managers at night dont know what there doing love the morning shift but when u have kids u cant be at work 12 hours a day for 4 days
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart. face paced. trained you well. I was a cashier and stocker in the garden department. we had to move to Arizona with my family.
good,"I work this three positions cashier,overnight stocker. and inventory prep. I alternated the positions throughout the week. It was a fast-paced environment."
good,My time there was fun. Love to come into work every day and use the training provided. If I could go back and manage I would. Not sure how things are ran now though.
good,I learned how to cut fabric and stock different areas of the store in a way the customers will view the products and have a great shopping experience.
good,I enjoy my job at Walmart. It’s an enjoyable atmosphere and the people are friendly. It’s an easy job to learn and there are many advancement opportunities within the company
good,great environment to start out and learn skills. Had to lift boxes was the hardest part of the job. workers work together to achieve the expectation of the store arrangement.
good,I loved the job.  The company is lacking. I found morale low with the employees but I enjoyed being in the bakery. My coworkers were wonderful. Best crew I have ever worked with.
good,"A typical work day can be very stressful. They are supposed to give you scheduled breaks after every two hours, and sometimes that never happened. You just have to ask for your break or go ahead and go. Management is average, being sick is not an option unless you have worked there for a while. Employees are very under paid."
good,"stock alot of stuff"
good,"The benefits and salary are much higher than average in the industry, but as are expectations. Stress is high, as in any retail environment. Most store cultures seem like a family. Employees are typically positive."
good,I enjoyed my work as a supervisor. I was responsible for making sure my fellow associates knew what their daily tasks were and answering any questions they may have.
good,The management did not work as a team. when you tried to help customers you were told to go and punch for your breaks which left the customers alone with no help.
good,"Most of the managers are cool to work with. You are not allowed to have overtime, unless during the holiday season. The late policy was nice, 9 minutes before it counted against you."
good,"Much like every company, there are good and bad about this place. You can move up, but staffing is always an issue and depends on your manager. It is a fine job as long as you know what to expect"
good,"Staff was pleasant to work with"
good,more jobs needed. it was good but I want more out of life .. I wanted to be a manger but I never got a interview for the job I wanted.. then my dad got got sick and I had to leave
good,Previously a tremendous place to work. Uncertainty about recent changes and the effect it has on our business has the future in question. Long term and short term associates are beginning to leave the company due to these changes.
good,I worked at walmart for my first job right out of high school as a maintenance man. Let's just say it was not the best job in the world and I definitely didn't get paid enough to clean up peoples messes.
good,"At the time I worked for the company the environment was very stressful and the company.  I have heard the company is not on a good path and things are coming around like they were before I left.  "
good,"working as a team to make the store look good .i learned to be   comfortable in a work place . the management was good for me "
good,never work for a wal mart in your like they treat you like dirt talking about i started where you are yeah right they dont see hard work its just who can suck up the most so never work there
good,"Typical day was always different , I don't know who was going to show up in my line for check out. I learned there are so many different people in this world all struggling making ends meet."
good,A typical day at work consist of stocking merchandise and helping with costumers. You have to be able to multitask and do it effectively. Sometimes you are needed in six places at one time and you have to be able to mange that and also be precise while doing so.
good,"The job was Okay. I worked overnight, which was the hardest part of the job. I was a stocker, which wasn't bad. The management team wasn't very nice. They were mean, and rude."
good,"Satisfactory overall.  The store is often short-staffed, unorganized and there is opportunity for advancement only for those who have been working there for 10+ years.  I learned many invaluable things pertaining to the job itself, working alongside a team, the company culture and the value of putting the customer first.  The workplace is disorganized and so is the management team which pertains to the store."
good,"Need a change in job looking for a job that I can spend more time with family , Walmart is always short handed need to hire enough people to ilimanate for employe’s to get over whelm"
good,"I Like Walmart, it’s easy to work and co workers was friendly and easily to get alone with. Now as for mangerment I Believe they need to work on talking to their employees to make sure the goal(s) are received good. I feel like you can move up in the company but make sure the mangers are good and have a good work ethics because if not nothing going to get done"
good,"Regardless to any Walmart in Los Angeles, all of them suck from higher management to security. The pay sucks, benefits suck, organization sucks, any logical thinking sucks."
good,"fair working environment"
good,got to work stock the shelves have lunch go back to stocking the shelves make sure everything is facing front and nothing is out of place help others.
good,"Walmart was a good place to work. I got to meet a lot of cool people, and made quite a few friends while working there. It was a good opportunity to meet new people. Some of the pros from working there, were decent lunch break, and opportunities for advancement. the cons were the management team on some points and short breaks."
good,"management is horrible and they show favoritism, glad i do not work there anymore. They expect you to take on so much that would take two days and get it all done by end of shift."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart as a loss prevention associate was challenging , but exciting. It's a good place to work of you have good management to guide you threw."
good,I loved the fast pace and staying busy. Even when we are not busy in the warehouse Im allowed to go on the floor and put up displays and help other employees do their job. I find that the more you know about your employer business the further up the ladder you can climb.
good,The hardest part of work was learning how to stock shelves and doing your other duties. Being friendly with customer. I learn different parts of the store.
good,"Its a good job, great enviorment, most the people are great to work with. Hours were great and Paid Time Off was good till the change. To where it made it more difficult to do with out help"
good,"The deli is very fast paced. It a full service department that is constantly waiting on customers. There can be mistakes make just like aim any department l, but the thing is to learn from them."
good,"It was a okay place too work, however it was just a temporary job. I am now looking for a better paying, more stable & fast paced career opportunity!!"
good,"customers are job one,I did varous things main job to take care of my area [automotive] and customers cashing out auto service,answering questions about services.helping other areas as needed"
good,A typical day at work includes planning to complete tasks in a timely manner. I've learned how to manage and motivate others. Time management is tough
good,"People you work with are okay, customers not so much. Some managers know what they are doing, some don't. Overall, it's just okay. It's not as bad as people make it out to be."
good,Working at walmart was very fun for me because i worked with fun/energetic co-workers. Working in apparel was very fun and simple. i enjoyed assisting customers.
good,Working at Walmart was fun for a while until they began to treat the good employees the same as the bad ones. I kind of lost the incentive to do a good job and that's no fun.
good,"Outside most of the time, you get an hour lunch.  Collect all the carts from every corral in the parking lot."
good,Department Manager  scowled at me every time  she saw me. At times she would not even respond to my questions. A a new practically minimum wage employee I could not see an action that would not result in some type of sublime retaliation if I complained. The 'well' became 'poisoned' and my only positive action was to quit.
good,"It was good some months others,it got abit out of hand and with people coming and going the morale was sometimes not there when needed.I still liked my manager,and team when I was there but the main store manager was asking so much from us every night it was impossible to please him and corporate. Id still tell the younger generations to apply and try it out not all is bad any more and flexible hours"
good,"Work was fine. Decent work, never got bored. I had a rather nice manager that I worked under but stories from other coworkers seem to make this an exception. Scheduling is cutthroat, they will set your hours and expect you to live around them. Doesn't help that they keep switching your hours. All in all, the work was easy, but I would not want it while pursuing other life goals."
good,"In the department I worked, my co workers were friendly, I got along with every one. i don't believe, however, that everyone who works there is quite as lucky. The only time working here was stressful is the holidays when everything is crunched for time and sometimes you have to man a position by yourself."
good,"nothing good or bad to say, i worked in a neighborhood walmart so i didnt have to work the crazy black friday hours, it made the environment more personal."
good,I come to work to be ready for anything. I put a smile on and do the job. I downstock the items in the back. I also then stock those items to the floor and zone them. I also am a back up cashier so i sometimes up front. I help customers find where stuff goes. I get a hour lunch and 15 min breaks.
good,"My work was seasonal, and I worked during the late summer, thanksgiving and Christmas seasons I enjoyed the displays and events that were done locally."
good,"the management needs to have better communication,"
good,"Normalmente el trabajo es relajado "
good,Its an okay work environment. It could be a little better with management. I don't think they care about their employees like they should. Family should come first.
good,"Management does not care for the employees. "
good,The infrastructure of everything revolving around an automated system did not help much for employees to address issues across to management or human resources. Response time on issues were very late.
good,"I loved my job and the interactions that I had with customers and associates., teamwork is really important part in your roll in being successful at Walmart."
good,It's really stressful and fast-paced. it takes a while for mangers to notice that you deserve a raise or a better position. Not much for advancement..
good,"Helpful ,clean, they always help the customer are in needs. also they go out their way to help a customer out taking thing for the customer. when a customer come in a bad mood the are leaving there in a good mood."
good,This job was okay. You do make the money if you work but they can not keep people they have a huge over turn. I enjoyed most of the coworkers but people are not treated fairly their
good,"greeting customers"
good,a fast paced and often stressful environment. but good benefits available after a year and place to advance for people who are willing to put in the effort. overall a good place to work.
good,Productive. This job is more for someone who have open avalianity. I do not recommend this job for people with family and small children at home because they will not work with you and there is no set schedule.
good,Working at Walmart has been a total learning experience. Other jobs may not offer such options and opportunity. Growing with experience. Growing through the cultural devide and working with others. Learning different things and cultures
good,Good place to communicate with customers. Great benefits. Management was fair. Learned many customer related activities working for this company. Most enjoyable part of this job is to meet new people everyday.
good,"It was good at first. But the longer your there the more its like living in repeat and you can't really go no wjere in that job, unless you know someone. But that's not about all walmarts."
good,It is stressful and not worth it. There are good days and bad days. Management does not listen and they do not care for you as a person. All they care bought is themselves.
good,"I didn't have much experiences working working at walmart. But the little time i was there the other workers were friendly, while all the managers had their butts on their backs. Some of the managers would try to help you but the manager in the area you works will leave you high and dry."
good,this is a job that will work around your schedule.  You will meet some interesting people at Walmart.   They are willing to cross train you in different areas of the store.
good,"Typical day at work is stocking shelves, answering customer questions until the store is closed. Walmart has good learning experiences like using a pallet jack, putting overstock in bins, and learning to use a telxon scanner."
good,Its a good place to shop at but working wise probably not the best . It was more as your independent all day except for when you cime back from break and yoh wait to get assigned to a register .
good,a very fun and productive environment! it can get very busy at times but that's what I like most! It can get overwhelming at times for some but I love the fast paced environment. time moves much quicker and you meet a lot of people
good,"Management is not organized, very unprofessional and hectic work place. No benefits, hard to fill hours. No room to move upward.  Pay is not desireable"
good,I was s cashier. I rang peoples items up and accepted the money for their items. I was  a layaway cashier and I also was a customer service cashier. It is a fast paced work environment.
good,"alot of changes  frequently, overworking employees lately, they took on more stores to service and was not adequitely prepared and now the associates are having to make up for their mishap"
good,"Overall, my experience wasn’t pleasant. You get disrespected by managers/supervisors and very little acknowledgement for any positive work you’ve done through out your shift."
good,"Hectic, stressful environment. Busy with customers most of the time during the day, making it difficult to get carts or skids through. Co-workers are nice and so are the management team.    Customers are interesting and find ways to make you smile if you look too serious, though there are some cranky customers (you have this at any store)."
good,Love working with all my fellow workers and managers. But looking for advancement and more salary. I want a better  future for myself and my children.
good,"overall this is a good place to work. you have to stick with it for a couple years to see the maximum benefits. consistently i got 38 to 40 hours a week with some overtime during the busier times of the year. however, you cannot have overtime unless it is approved. good amount of paid time off and a good hourly rate of pay if you work overnights like i did"
good,"If your looking for 401K dental, vision benefits and job sercurity then wal-mart is a place where you can recieve that and more. They have multiple departments along with locations so you can transfer if needed."
good,The job is hard and mentally straining. Your hours are all over the place and you will likely often go to lunch/break very late. Management was strict yet unorganized.
good,I would recommend this jobs to others it was a good opportunity learn things. This job has taught me alot and helped me grow in many ways sand for that I'm thankful.
good,"I over saw the store working with as many as fifty to one hundred fifty employees a day. Over saw stock room in store and the receiving and organized freight. Did hiring, training and termination of employees."
good,The crew in the warehouse I worked with were amazing and we had an amazing team. Worked well together and always helped each other out. Walmart was a good companie.
good,"The job is not hard at all.It's how people treat you,but it is a good work place.Plus you learn how to work in different areas. The main thing you have to make sure everything is in the right place and make sure all items are zone."
good,WALMART is  a great place to work. The pay is great and so are the benefits. I loved my customers. I learned alot by working there and made friends for life.
good,Its not like how it use to be when I first started working there. Management isn't professional. They favorite their workers. They are rude never work around your school schedule.
good,a day at work would be greeting customers making sure they are happy with there experience. the hardest part was doing price checks because it was always busy and the cutomer got impatient.
good,"pushing carts outside in extreme weather conditions, very physically demanding but i worked with a lot of fun people and got along with most of the managers there"
good,Checking groceries is an easy first job. It helped me with my people skills and it was nice to meet new people every day. Some days were more busy than others.
good,"it was an ok work place, they don’t really care about the people that work there. My only issue with Walmart is that the first few months were ok but they end up just losing interest and not caring about you and your needs."
good,"Responsible for taking money in the form of cash, check, or credit card from patrons in exchange for food or services. Scans items, provides change, balances drawer, and processes card transactions."
good,Its alright place to work alot of work you have to do in a certain amount of time managers can be rued and very demanding if production slows down due to long semi loads
good,Walmart will keep you busy. Workday tends to go by fairly quickly. Meets lots of interesting people and have chance to network on many levels.overall average job.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart.  The crew was very friendly and was a family environment. I had to leave due to school functions and getting ready for college.
good,Great hours choices. Back of the house the best place to be. The pay is better the work is more but it's worth it. The employees have fun and makes the day worth working there.
good,"au début j'ai commencer a y travailler jeune, mais au fil des années beaucoup de changements sont survenus l'environnement n'étais plus le même."
good,"Walmart, by it self is a great place of employment, however, if you work as a Cart Associate, by any means, it isn't going to be that great. It is extremely stressful and the pay is too little when you factor in the risks of the job from the heat, dehydration, and cars that sometimes drive recklessly."
good,I loved the challenge of being a manager.  I enjoyed helping customers and my crew.  Daily goals were set and I felt I accomplished them as an individual and as a team.  It was fast paced at times.  Hardest part was when we didn't have enough cashiers to handle the flow of customers.  I feel I worked well with the other management and we tackled all issues by either brain storming or stream lining the issues.
good,if in need of a job at a moments notice Walmart can help with that. the management was ok but advancement opportunities are hampered by employees who have seniority rather than expertise
good,"Department manager was great to work for but upper management lacks ability to problem solve, if someone calls in there is no backup plan to replace that individual, the burden of closing down the department is solely left on one person, upper management will not step up and assist"
good,A typical day is walking a lot. I learned how to be patient with the customers. Management could use some help. The culture of this job is mixed. the hardest part of this job is making sure you get the task at hand done right and in a timely manner. I loved working with the public
good,The one thing I learn working for a business is that its never personal. You have to understand everybody is there to do a job and your outside friendship cannot be apart of your job.
good,the store manager was influenced more by his co managers than actually taking the time to get to know his own managing team. Would not get back to me when i used the open door policy until i found myself in a couching and being asked to step down.
good,a job is a job. i worked there because  there was not a hole lot of options where i was living. it was a good job for the time i worked there despite the inappropriate supervisors.
good,This job would be great for someone who only needed part time work slightly above minimum wage. This job is not good for someone who looks forward to extra hours or over time.
good,"i started as a cashier, you had to scan a certain amount of items an hour. i transferred out of cashier to sales associate but ended up being a cashier most of it."
good,"Scan items and ensure pricing is correct."
good,"I learned how to cash checks and how to look for valid ID's, Also how to look for counterfeit money. I most enjoyed learning new things and talking to my coworkers."
good,"Average hourly worker not paid or treated very fairly, but once in a management type role, things get better.  Fast paced and sometimes stressful corporate environment and culture.  Local management is overworked and largely inattentive to employees' needs and concerns.  Corporate management doesn't have a clue about what the average working store associate deals with.  There is a culture (mostly out of fear) of keeping problems at the local levels and hiding them from senior management who could do something about it if they knew more."
good,"the job is easy work just the upper-managment is unorganized, and disrespectful. coworker are laid back and easy to get along with. Still would not recommend."
good,If you don't have tough skin this job isn't for you. It's fun however it can get overwhelming very fast. You have to really love working with people to love this job.
good,Was placed in a no-win situation where my job was on the line after it came to light I was transgendered. I decided to quit rather than be placed in this situation.
good,Daily routines included a process called CAP which focused on correcting inventory so that items are kept in stock. This routine was mainly focused on consumables. Apparel is stocked daily and Jewelry is inventory controlled
good,"A typical wirk day involved stocking, cleaning, and culling of produce merchandise. Management is not progressive, but for the most part fair and overworked. the workplace culture is one of gossip.The most enjoyable part of my job is meeting all the different people that come into the store."
good,"It's a fine place to work at if you need a stable place to work, but it's not somewhere I'd want to spend my entire career at. Overall I'd say it's a great place if there isn't anything better on the table."
good,Great place to work if we were paid what we deserved and appreciated for our efforts and hard work. The expectations are set high with no time or associates to get it done.
good,"Great for a first job, customer service training. Great for someone who.is in school. Except for the inconsistent scheduling, which I am sure can be negotiated."
good,"Not much to say besides managers make the store. If you get a good group of managers it can be a great place to work. However, if you don't have good managers it will not be enjoyable at all."
good,"Es interesante el ambiente de walmart puesto que no es rutinario y siempre aprendes cosas nuevas e interesantes, conoces a mas personas y te ayuda a relacionarte en un entorno social con todo tipo de personas ."
good,"great pay, unrealistic expectation but great pay and nice ppl to work with. No job security, you can come in one day and be gone the next just because a supervisor doesnt like you."
good,"Customer service is the provision of service to customers before, during and after a purchase. The perception of success of such interactions is dependent on employees ""who can adjust themselves to the personality of the guest."
good,"was easy, good atmosphere, not a place you want to be at if you cant deal with getting yelled at by customers. manager was nice, assistant manager has a problem with people telling her that shes doing something wrong."
good,Walmart used to be a great place to work for but the company keeps cutting out things each year. They cut hours during the HOLIDAYS! Pay raise has drastically lowered. Rarely hire full time people or give people full time hours. Never enough associates or cashiers. Now you have to have open availability which means you can work 7 days in a row and 3 the next week.
good,walmart is walmart i mean we all been there before its just a job to have not a career you just greet customers and fold clothes or work in departments they need help in
good,"High paced environment"
good,I worked there 5 years ago when I left management was completely different it was a good place to work starting out for a first job but not a good place for long term employment if you are trying to support a family
good,"hardest part of the job is irate customers"
good,"Good place to work."
good,"Walmart it's a great company to for over all, hours are flexible, and fair for everyone. I like the way the system works as tasks need to be done on time, Luch hours one time, and clocking out on time. So it's a job every one need to respect because they teach employees to be always on with any thing they doing."
good,I want to do something more. This place is very fun. I love my employees. I enjoy working with people. I want to do something more challenging. Higher position.
good,"Hard work, many opportunities for promotion.  Working here is a great opportunity for individuals who want to engage in work that promotes quickly and maximizes employee benefits."
good,The management did not care about their employees.  The CEOs did not care about employees either.  You go 10% off your purchases.  You could not get overtime at all.  If you did not get off on time you had to cut it later in the week.
good,"Day would start to see what door I covered as a greeter, clock in, go to door. Make sure I have return tickets made out for customers returning items. Check floor for cleanliness a riding carts plugged in. Greet customers by saying good morning welcome to Walmart and sometimes I would direct them to were an item they wanted was. When exiting at times when very busy I would not have time to greet, as I had to try and stop everyone or look at every cart going by to make sure they didn't try to sneak behind, which when I was very busy some did. I has to stop the ones with items not in a bag and check their receipts and often got a lot of verbal abuse and once sometimes pushed or feet ran over purposely. "
good,"Decent job to start and have for a little extra cash in your pockets but at times feel like your working too hard for the same pay. So it feels like your doing as much or more work, stressing your body and barely increase pay."
good,"I loved wal-mart, I connected with all the customers. They were what made my job fun, It was an amazing experience for me. If I could, i would most certainly do it again!!"
good,This is a good job for a person that is in school. I worked the night shift and it was pretty cool. The fact that they only have one register open can become stressful at times.
good,"O horário era bom, trabalhava 7:20 por dia. Empresa com ética profissional."
good,"Don't pay there managers what they are worth, and they need to concentrate more on training there employees properly and they turn over rate may not be as bad"
good,"It's a great place to come and work and meet new people and learn more things that you may have never thought you could learn. Also, you can grow within this company!"
good,"Friendly people"
good,at Wal-mart as a department manager was a good job to learn what a  department does on a day to day basic. It was not hard work but taking care of a whole department can be a little stressful.
good,They were alright when it came to working for them but they don't accept doctor notes no matter the occasion so you could lose your job. Not all customers are friendly.
good,"Working at Wal-mart will test your ability to handle customer's either good or bad....mostly bad.  People that came in think your going to bend over for them and only them even though you are already helping someone else at the time.  "
good,"I do not enjoy my management team, or my schedule due to scheduling issues due to cutting pharmacist hours. They want more work done with less man hours.  Also try to preach they want us to have a good work life balance but when you work every day, its very hard to have that balance."
good,"Hours are inconsistent.  Management at my location is unorganized and lacks communication skills.  Very strict attendance, no flexibility or understanding of personal or medical absences."
good,"Grocery Is not too bad it all depends on what shift you are on, the co-workers, and who your manager is.  Other than that the work is not terrible they pay is not the best but it keeps you busy."
good,"Chaotic, lightening fast paced, if you are unable juggle 20-30 situations at a time you will not be successful here. Daily routines consist of putting out 'one fire' after another besides trying to complete all operational and merchandising tasks. The hardest part of the job is executing plans and set goals in an ever changing environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is the interaction with the variety of customers."
good,If you want to be talked to rude or treated unfairly the by all means this is the place for you. If you want a place to work where it is a pleasant environment then this is not the place for you
good,i enjoyed the customers for the most part. but getting help when needed seemed nearly impossible. and even when in need of serious help even hitting security codes did not bring management fast enough
good,I enjoy the atmosphere and the job.  I like helping customers find the items they are shopping for.  My co-workers and I help each other to get the job done.
good,"I like my co-worker.  Because I work at night, I do not have a bakery supervisor that I can talk to about any questions that I have.  I can talk to a manager, but they may not have an answer in regards to a bakery issue."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart because I got to meet new people every night. I enjoyed greeting customers and helping them find what they need in the store.
good,"PDD was the best place to work. With over 50 people in the division everyone was very friendly and got along well. We were very team orientated and everyone was always willing to help if you needed assistance. Work was fun with various interoffice pot lucks and "
good,Walmart is a simi-productive work place . Flexible hours and fun people to work with . You learn many new things working for Walmart. Walmart cam teach you alot.
good,The management was not understanding. You could not go and talk to them about any issue. I had to call corporate to get anything done. Which was recommended as a general practice by many of my coworkers.
good,This job works well with college schedule. I was never forced to choose work over school. I was lucky enough to never have to work black Friday. The work culture was pretty good.
good,Best thing about this job is it is flexible. Everyone has been to Walmart and seen how the associates conduct themselves. Nothing much else to say. Great part-time if in school or something I guess..
good,"didn't really have a manager around when one was needed, got yelled at if things weren't done the way a specific person wanted it, constantly felt like a ping pong ball"
good,Walmart as a whole is a company anyone can work for I just don't view it as a career choice. Due to stipulation you receive from corporate doesn't allow advancement through the company.
good,"worded 2nd shift, and about Walmart employee I worked with some of the coolest people at Walmart, and when my husband got Cancer they were very understanding and compassionate"
good,"Walmart is an okay job, it still needs a lot of improvement starting with management. At 1st I loved working for the company but then they changed, took away benefits and place all associates on part time but they still work full time hours"
good,"fast paced on weekends it is hard sometimes to get time off, it is sometimes  hard to be recognized on hard work when there is so many supervisors that you do not work with all the time. Half the time they do not know who you are.  It takes the right supervisor to recognize your work and how hard you work and help."
good,It was a learning experience.  How to clean and move shelves. Restock merchandise and set displays. Maintained a clean work area and took out trash daily.
good,"The hardest part of the job was being the only sales associate for 4-5 different departments. Also, customers getting mad because you were helping other customers."
good,My time at the local location wasn't always the most enjoyable. I can't speak for other locations but the management  of  my local  store was deporable. Much of the time more focus was on the negative things employees  did such as the one thing they forgot to do and less on the good work that they did do. At times I and others felt like we were not being apreciated  or given positive  re-enforcement.
good,"Working here gave me a sense of what sales and retail was like. I was able to do many things and when i wasnt doing anything, the friendly employees and i talked about our days"
good,It was a mess at times. Straightening all racks and zoning and putting returns back to the selling floor. Customer service was usually pleasant. Management was fine. Culture was pretty team oriented.
good,"The working life at Wal-Mart can be some what stressful knowing you have a lot of people in line that are trying to get out of their as fast as they can because its Wal-Mart, the place that everyone seems to be at the same time. A typical day at Wal-Mart is checking people out, bagging their grocery's and having a little bit of conversation to keep the awkwardness away. Something you learn from working at Wal-Mart is going a pace passed and trying to not mess up so the customers don't get angry and can get out as fast as they can. Everyone messes up but knowing how some people can get it something that I don't like dealing with but you got to do what you got to do at that point in time. That's pretty much the hardest part of the job is when you mess up and got to wait for the manager to come help you out and customers sit their and stare at you and start mouthing and you can't do anything about it. There was nothing that I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart."
good,Hours vary all the time with no consistency. Hard to get time off. Can be a fun place to work if you find the right job fit. Many chances to learn new jobs.
good,"The job wasn't difficult or demanding and you could set availability which they then gave you random hours within, but there seemed to be a lack of coordination. They could be seen as a bit forgiving at times but they don't take nonsense. Most of my co-workers were friendly and performed their duties well. All in all it wasn't terrible if you don't need a strict pattern."
good,Daily I open the accounting office and run the reports. Verify the register checks and balances. Troubleshoot the cash recycler and audit the cash supply. Organize the office supplies and paperwork. The hardest thing is to prioritize which task that is next to the in the to complete. The most I like about it is working alone
good,Can be stressful at times but that is part of the retail business. If I would have to say this job is best suited for a student working their way through college.
good,I was fortunate enough to end my time at WalMart on 3rd shift. The perks were that is was consistent a reliable hours. My reason for parting with the company was that I was no longer able to work overnights and had to find a position with comparable pay and earlier hours.
good,"Wal mart isn't a bad company to work for, its a very stressful job, aggravating at times, some management is hard to deal with. "
good,"My typical day at was coming in to notes that had to get completed on a daily basis, I did evaluations on associates, did there schedules, I managed different depts, and I was over  20 associates, I sent out emails on daily basis to fellow  managers and dept managers."
good,This was an okay place to work...decent part time pay although no benefits. Management was full of themselves and not always professional in handling situations.
good,"When I worked there, it was always hectic. The management was very poor. The customers were allowed to treat us any kind of way. I was working full time hours and wasn't getting the full time benefits. The managers didn't stand up for their associates even if we were correct. I had almost 50 hours in PTO time and it was always an hassle to use them. The store overall was unprofessional."
good,"Working for walmart was fun and fast pace. Customer service was always number one. My duties included keeping my merchandise stocked , ordered, and clean."
good,"A typical day for a stocker/orderfiller would start before everyone else to get freight into slots to be pulled for stores.  If asked to pull from the floor you sign onto a tugged and find your store labels, pull freight, put freight on cart and put out at proper stop on stocker table to be stocked and pulled by orderfiller for stores.  When finished stocking you help any orderfiller that is still pulling freight for stores. When everything is completed, clean area and put any freight that is hanging out in proper slot"
good,Good place to start work career. Good job for people just getting out of school. I have learned how to do multiple jobs. Typical day is 90% dealing with customers.
good,"I was getting enough hours threw the week, other then not getting enough hours thew the week I would probably still be there I loved working with other people."
good,I was hired when this warehouse first came on-line. My initial job was in recieving. I eventually moved to inventory control were I was happy doing this work.
good,"The company itself is great, they have great benefits and good work environment. The pay could be better,  but overall, I would recommend it to anyone."
good,Aider le client à trouver la marchandise. Placer la marchandise. Faire toutes les demandes demandées par le gérant.
good,They are good company they work around your schedule don't like not having over time managers are very nice paid vacations good benefits Great great job to meet different kinds of people
good,"Its Walmart. What else can I say? Politics, gossip, good stores, bad stores, good management, bad management. The right people can make the difference, I find that Walmart attracts a lot of the wrong people."
good,I enjoyed being busy. I liked the fact that occasionally I got to help out on the sales floor putting out new merchandise and I enjoyed zoning the department. The part of my job I did not enjoy was having the occasional upset customer. I did feel satisfied when we solved the issue and the customer left satisfied.
good,"A great place to work,   Just a typical retail setting that does not reward the employee for putting their heart and soul into the job. "
good,Through out the years I worked in different departments. I mainly worked on the register. Part of my job was to keep our customer satisfied. I sold membership and credit card while being on the register. Most enjoyable must of been working with people I now call friends.
good,"The employees I worked with made working here super fun.  Management was a toss up if you had a good manager or not.  There was lots of opportunities for career advancement.  Other than working with lots of cranky and annoyed customers, it was a fun work experience."
good,It was a great experience. I enjoyed my time with Walmart and they are a great company. I was a cashier and a customer service host. U have to be fast and friendly.  It is an easy job and I liked what I did.
good,"If you've ever shopped at Wal-Mart it is self evident. It can be taxing at times, but if you are adaptable and self-motivated it is nothing that cannot be handled."
good,Walmart was a fun and exciting place to work. The benefits where great and pay was great. They where very understandable as well. Management was fair.
good,typical work day included dealing with customers. I learned the importance of being able to work independently as well as within a team. Workplace culture was generally good.
good,I felt like I was being taken Advantage of especially on my hours I would work 31 hours a week just 9 short of full time and I wouldn't receive any of the benefits
good,at times staff can be unhelpful. There needs to be better orgsnixsytion in their csll center so against can escalate problem. Which can also get better
good,Working at Walmart is a great place to start your experiences with book keeping. It's a friendly place to work an you get to learn new things in different area.
good,Working for a small town Walmart that was understaffed was an issue for this job. Had to perform tasks that were not a part of my assigned position due to understaffed issues.
good,Buen clima de trabajo y entorno rico para aprender y progresar dentro de la empresa.
good,Es buena empresa tiene una cultura laboral buena pero tiene también muchas oportunidades
good,Its a good company to work at.it just that it really a stressful job to do for me.like the management are really hard headed to work with and your co-worker does not work with you has a team.
good,"It's what you'd expect from large corporation. Long hours, average pay, no real advancement. Doctor's notes are not taken. Any time off due to illness goes through a company called Sedgwick. And if you don't do their paperwork right you will be let go."
good,I think you are better off working there part time because Walmart is a very busy & stressful  place to work. I worked 10:00pm - 7:00am. for 5 years stocking shelves 40 hours a week & it just got to be too hard for me to handle. Too much heavy lifting for my back. If I ever worked there again I wouldn't want to stock shelves again.
good,Never liked it but worked to make a living not much but still was helpful. Manager got after me about my black pants and told me to get the required type of pants but didn't even get my first pay yet and it was only a few days of just starting the job so and this was my very first job and I had no money to even begin with before the job.
good,"A fairly relaxed setting, though also hectic at times. management"
good,working at walmart was alright if you liked to stay busy i enjoyed it during the holidays cause it was busy  but if you came short or over you got fired and if you called in you got wrote up they didn't care if you was sick or not
good,It's a good job. But being a cashier ur hours are everywhere. U can't change ur available for 6 months. But over all it's a good job and if anyone who needs a job should go there.
good,A typical day at Walmart was overall very relaxed.I learned how to use the hand held scanner that enable you to locate various items in stock .Management was overall friendly and professional.Workplace culture was laid back. The hardest part of my job was simply having to work nights. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with the customers.
good,"Maybe better pay / benefits more  respect from upper management & floor associates /team work efforts/ respect for all customers  would have gave me & many other people better insensitive to want to stay with the company longer . You should also enjoy the work place"
good,"* To sum it up a typical day at Walmart is never dull."
good,A typical day at Walmart could be fast-paced or steady.  Learned how to handle stressful situation cooly and calmly.  The hardest part of this job would be keeping your head straight in those situations.
good,I think you have to have a certain mind set to work @ Wal-mart. Its now easy dealing with angry Customers so you need to have a thick skin. its not for everybody so either try and Climb the Management latter or stay a peon up to you what you do with your Career.
good,"Walmart was high pace, you stayed on your feet. many many customers, so not a slow moment. You surely got your work out on. Not a dull moment, much work to do."
good,would not recommend working here the company does not allow time to be taken off and are hard to accommodate part time hours for those in school or with kids.
good,"With this company do not expect to have a lot of time for you family. As a retail store you will work all holidays. without holiday pay. "
good,"not really all that bad, Its walmart, people are friendly and there is room for advancement. I see those who put in effort like they should advance to better paying positions fairly quickly."
good,"understand that nothing you ever do will be good enough, did you go above and beyond for your job that day, too bad cause tomorrow you better it and more."
good,This is a good job for high school students who need extra money or a college student. Takes a while to get to full time and weekends are a must. has some opportunity for growth.
good,"Since I didn't work for Walmart, I actually worked for CPI Corp, the job was a bit different hours were nice, and guest interaction was always fun. Taking pictures was something I enjoyed, and enhancing them was even better, making a guest happy with the work you've done was something I enjoyed. Hardest part of the job would have to be taking babies passport photos, but it was a challenge that made work enjoyable."
good,Nothing bad about being a cashier. But when management doesn't have adequate staffing to fully accommodate the customer demand it becomes stressful. Did enjoy the pharmacy cashier position though since it was more clean cut and by the book.
good,"Company grows management from within so if you're looking for a place to plant your roots and grow, this is it!  It's also a good transitionary position for in-between jobs. Great job for teenagers and recent college grads."
good,"Working part-time at Walmart while in school is a good job to hold as it allows schedule flexibility. Working is the customer service industry is demanding but also very engaging at the same time, allowing us to constantly be hands on and learning something new."
good,Overall not a bad job place to work. Defiantly takes some smarts to perform certain jobs. Neighborhood markets are a lot more slow paced than the super centers are.
good,"Typical day at Walmart is customer service, making sure stock is worked and binned. Making sure your areas are neat, clean and organize. I learned great customer service,profit, loss, sales,merchandising. Walmart is a good company to work for you don't mind long hours and hard work. There's not a good work/life balance. I love building relationships and taking care customers."
good,every thing was good meet a lot of new people that i am still friends with. meet alot of ppl and was able to learn how to drive a forklift and drove a left cart to stock thing with .
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. It's always busy and they maintain structure. They are dedicated to everything they do and display very good costumer service
good,"Walmart is a great company. When I started with them I would have recommend them to anyone and everyone. However the company is going through a lot of leadership changes at the moment. The company culture has become diluted, vision has lost focus, benefits continue to decline year over year, and the IT division is still dealing with the mushy middle problem."
good,"Walmart is a great place to start off if you are looking for a job during high school or after. Great work environment with great management personnel. Fast-paced, with great benefits after the probation period. Overall , a typical day at work is relaxing . Not too busy and never too slow . I have experience with Walmart and the customers that visit almost on a daily . I enjoyed working at Walmart ."
good,"You never know what shift you are going to have. They are flexible with college students however which is always a plus. However, the wages are low so good luck paying rent and school on this paycheck."
good,"i loved walmart so much i did so well, moved up, worked great with everyone, learned alot from walmart, very hard to work when managers dont get along with employees"
good,"Walmart is an ok place to work the pay is fine the only problem there is the management there nasty and don't know how to talk to there workers. When u have a problem there they don't handle the problem and they make u have to go above them just to get your problem fixed. They make you do so much work there and do others work and when you do something for them they don't even give you a thank you, good work or anything."
good,fine place to work if you have bills to pay. some people make a career out of it i didnt.  work there or dont not a big deal. good for students or seniors.
good,Its to much like highschool.I just Want to Work. To much he say she say. If u dont play games with then u will not Want to Work for them. Work go home
good,Working at WalMart has taught me to just keep your head down and do your job. Managers seemed to not overly care about situations in the store if they do not pertain to their specific section of the store.
good,It pretty much sucks but there isn't really anything else for anyone to do around here unless they want to cut chicken all day long. Who wants to do that?
good,"Pay could be better due to the work load. "
good,"My position in the Pharmacy. It is a very fast paced and stressful job. My co-workers are the only thing that makes my job tolerable..I have a immediate supervisor is a micro manager. She treats everyone the same way, so i don't take her treatment personal. The pay is low for my talent and experience. However the benefits are"
good,work is constant. stocking shelves rotating stock. helping customers find items. unloading trucks pushing carts. customer service is top of the list of things to do
good,"It was a job. It paid. Learned a few things. Some people let alittle power over others go to their head. Store managers, and district managers tend to focus on overall store look, than performance."
good,"It's a fast paced job when busy. Deal with rude customers but I have at least 18 years of customer service skills. The managers look out for each other, so if you have a complaint nothing get accomplished. That's the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part is friendly customers and friendly coworkers."
good,I enjoy working with the public and the co workers.  Would like to have advancement possibilities.  Would like to work weekdays and have weekends off.
good,"Overall, my experience wasn't awful, but management has too much going on to the point where if you need to talk to someone, they are never available. And if you want to have so many hours, they'll start you off with a similar set of hours and try to follow your schedule, but after a while they'll stop caring, cut your hours in half and in my case my hours were on a completely different schedule than what I asked for and I was working so few hours that I was spending all my money on gas than I was making working there. I started the job so I could afford to pay off my car but they cut my hours to where I could hardly afford the gas and definitely couldn't handle the payments."
good,"Working at Wal-mart wasn't what I expected, very poor communication between management and hourly associates, very unorganized and unprofessional....."
good,Go to work. Take a break. Go to work. Have lunch. Go back to work. Go home. Sometimes I'm sent to other departments in order to help other associates with their jobs.
good,I would check out customers and help them in anyway I could . It was fast pace at times and I loved it. I tried to advance but it did not seem like I was going to . And I needed more hours and insurance.
good,Trabalhei em três empresas na mesma Extraeconomico Sonae e Walmart Supermercado cada uma foi muito boa pois aprendi muito com elas acredito que fui uma boa funcionária pois lá permaneci por todos estes anos
good,"Working at Walmart was okay until I needed specific days off. My maternity leave was not a problem, but it was unpaid. I enjoyed my job for the most part."
good,It was a little stressful and fast but good till I broke my foot and I think the people were nice and respectful  I really like to unloading the truck and putting away the truck wasn't bad.
good,"Overall Wal-Mart is demanding but the work is typical of retail environment where emphasis is placed on the customer. The philosophy is that you always side with the customer, this however is not always the best approach as it leave the door open to the less than honest people that exist in society"
good,I am a friendly person that gets along with anyone. My personality allowed me to build relationships with customers on a personal level that brought them back to the store. I enjoyed interacting with fellow associates and customers on a daily basis that allowed these relationships to form and to bring quality customer service.
good,Walmart was very comfortable even though you have bad days . You mangers still help and support you . I've  had a couples problems there but i dealt with them in was there for 9 good months .
good,"I worked at Walmart as a part time associate.  Enjoyed my time there.  The manager and sales associates, make it feel like home. Even after all these years, I can walk in and be greeted by some of my old friends."
good,The Walmart culture is great. Advancement is possible and occurs often. Management is often not in line with employee needs. Scheduling is a nightmare.
good,"Very understaffed, and what staff they do have they treat very poorly."
good,It was a great experience to learn more about customer service and time management and learning different equipment for the purpose of cashiering it was a pleasure working there
good,You work 9 hrs a day with an hour lunch unloading the truck & stocking shelves. Very fast paced. You help the customers when needed. It is a decent place to work
good,store management often pushed back on policy driven programs. there was lots of Drama within the stores management team it was hard to trust anyone there
good,Wal-Mart is a very fast pace job if you work in the front end of the store' but as an overnight stocker my job was pretty relaxed and calm. during overnight hours there not to many customers coming in so you don't have to really worry about people being in your way as you work.
good,"Its a Job. Nothing special. They always have positions available for hiring in different aspects of the job especially for temporary holiday help. If you need a job, its an easy one to get"
good,"hard labor, monotonous work. Night shift has advantage of few customer interaction but is hard on family life. Other shifts are available. Teamwork is required."
good,"I was there for a while and learned a lot of things, but our department lack management or we had managers that didn't know procedures. People we continuously coming and going."
good,"love working with the crew I worked with"
good,The fellow employees was nice and some of them where supportive. The management were nice and supportive also. The position I worked was fast paced. The hardest part was not being able to use the cart mule so I would have to collect the carts and physically push them into the store. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to being outside.
good,part time with almost full time hours. Great stock and 401 with annual bonuses (usually pretty big ones). Great on making sure you get breaks and lunches and do cater meals for special events.
good,I tried to do my best for this job and work really hard to get my work done on time and I tried to keep my job space safe from anything the could hurt the customers
good,The company itself was good to work for but I wasn't really enjoying the work. Might've just been my work schedule(graveyard shift). But the work was easy to learn and it seems like a fairly safe and stable job.
good,Working as a cashier at this particular store was great dealing with an variety of different cultures was great. Going to work you would continuously be moving at a steady pace.
good,Walmart is a good place to start out . they have many hours available . the only thing I didn't like was the fact they were not accommodating when it came to employees needed help to be able to do there job effectively.
good,"Walmart is as youd expect it to be. management is ok. other employees are ok. don't expect help from them, but they job isn't bad, work isn't hard and they have strict rules on hourly vs salary. pretty ok job."
good,"This Job is okay. It is WalMart, so do not expect alot. They worked with me while I was in college, but overall it still sucked working there. They were flexible at first, but then stopped when I started putting school first."
good,From my experience I was treated well and was asked to perform many different tasks that I was able to accomplish. When I left it was getting to be more task/efficiency oriented which is not necessarily bad but management makes or breaks the job.
good,"Wal-Mart is a fast-paced work environment. It was better than everywhere else I have previously worked, but I know it is not the best that there is. I am looking for something different."
good,"Busy and very fast pace. You work your tail off to make rate . Not enough mobile equipment around for everyone, you have to share and some don't like to do that.One forklift for 3 people also cuts into your ability to make rate."
good,"Local agradável de trabalho,pessoas alegres e dinâmicas"
good,The perfect place to work to get up on your feet and get things together.  I don't know what else to say I'm just doing this more now just to get this part over with.
good,They have nice and fast working employees and also very loyal customers. The customers remember your name and respect that your there to help them. The employees respect each other as well.
good,"Sometimes it was stressful, there were favorites who did nothing while others had to zone, redline, and even clean the restrooms, all while the favorites are gossiping with the CSM."
good,the management is not too bad. the hours were less than i was hoping for and the work was monotonous. i was passed up for advancements because they go by seniority rather than skill
good,Walmart is an okay place to work. It is also a very stressful place to work. They have to find the hours for one to work. They also don't work around your school schedule. But they do have wonderful benefits.
good,Very good learning experience dealing with customers. Had to use good and own judgement when clients return items. Crazy hours were never stable. Overtime especially during Holidays was always mandatory.
good,"You would clock in go to your register, assist customers, clean up your area. I learned and gained the experience on how to be a cashier. Some supervisors were not professional at all. Like workplace, the hardest part was standing all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new customers and being able to talk to them."
good,Was not a bad job at all. The Customer Service Managers were all very kind and understanding. I enjoyed working here as my first job. I would recommend this job.
good,Responsibility is important. Must be a self starter. Very friendly managers and associates. I learned a great deal from the managers there. I would recommend this to a friend as a place to work.
good,"Worked as cashier, nothing special, everyday was the same"
good,"first job enjoyed other employees, did not like rotating schedules, would have preferred a steady schedule. Customers in the parking lot were rude at times."
good,it was cool people were awesome but the management team sucked...it was all about the good ol boy system and people were to cut throat for me. other than that it was cool
good,Fun place to work but I also think they need to screen there managers more before hiring them . loved the people I work with just some of the policies make it hard
good,"i enjoyed working at walmart. The one I worked for was small.We were all like family and at the time, the managers were fun to work with and were like family too."
good,A typical day at work would be doing toy or bike freight or inventory changing prices when needed I've learned to micro manage sales associates the hardest part of working at Walmart is when your extremely short staffed it can be very stressful at times.
good,"This job was convienent as far location to home, and at times it was a very pleasant environment but as management changed it's personnel the culture of the environment lost its demeanor and slowly became a job u regretted coming to on the daily"
good,"I worked there many years. Made a lot friends . Big turn over. Hard to get full time. To many bosses. Store Mang, co manger , Dept. mangers, CCM CSM . yep yep"
good,"Okay place to work very busy all the time, never a dull moment fun people to work with. The costumers were always fun to talk to.Nice pitch ins with good food, always had lunch the employees"
good,"started my day at the register, helped customers, ringed customers up with their merchandise, collected money, counted money, did go backs, stocked merchandise"
good,they are really willing to work with you on what days you can work. they are also willing to work around you having another job. Also really caring and nice management.
good,Greeted customers and provided excellent customer service. Processed orders quickly and efficiently to lessen wait times. Organized products in store and cashier line. Cleaned as needed.
good,Great for learning customer service skills. Easy learning curve for things you've never done. I learned more about the process of assembling and maintaining bicycles.
good,"It was a job that I woke part time while i went to school for the"
good,"You have to be ready for change all the time. management always changes, Very long day and always a lot of conterversary.Cannot have set days off. climate is very uncontrollable"
good,"Productive and ok to work at, but after awhile things tend to run there course. Some of the management is ok to work with while others are not so well to work with. Most employees are overworked or taken advantage of. Some are threatened or blackmailed with losing there job overall it started out as a great place to work at but after a year or less it became very stressful and diffcult to work here."
good,Fast paced. Enjoy the conversations with the customers. Also enjoy the associates I work with. Walmart changes the culture often. This mean there is a learning experience every day. Learning is good.
good,As a cashier I greeted each customer and make sure they had an easy product transaction. It usually was busy at this particular site which made the time go by fast. Nothing really hard about the position. Hardest part mainly was dealing with upset customers.
good,"it was an ok place to work for."
good,"Don't expect the best from Walmart, coworkers are very rude and act very immature. Managers are great, they work with what's going on in life. Very hard to get fired from Walmart. Worked part time."
good,Loved working with the people. Not enough help. Managers were always busy. Left unloading and stocking shelves to someone else. Loved working in bakery.
good,it was a lot of work and they expected a lot in one day. Long hours and you really don't have any help. sometimes you don't know what time you get off.
good,This job is very demanding and emotionally draining. The management is harsh and rarely take responsibility for things that have gone wrong. Most of the employees can be very grumpy and rude.
good,"Associates are understanding no matter what the situation is.  One day, I asked a front door associate what's going to see if another associate needed some help, or if they're just helping a customer.  She told me everything is okay and I went back to work."
good,"needs improvement on some department managers when it comes to new employee's, they could be very rude or nasty towards new employee's. It's a very demanding and fast pacing job for minimum pay, needs lots of improvement as far as communication between employees."
good,"Job is easy and can be fun, but some management could improve. If everyone would do things by the book and be consistent then the job would be a lot better."
good,Walmart did not advance employees that went above and beyond the job description. At the time I was employed there the pay was not very good. I was making the same as some cashiers and I was a supervisor
good,"It is a fast paced environment. Having a strong work ethic will ensure that you do well in your position, however your associates tend to not have as strong of a work ethic which puts a lot more weight on your shoulderes."
good,faced paced place to work sometimes depending on the managers things were good but sometimes things were not that great. overall not a bad place to work.
good,Como manager del departamento del area d mi trabajo tengo experiesnsias para resolver confictos con los associados con los clientes y con mis superiores. Es un ambiente d trabajo en equipo y se hacen muchas tareas como deparment manager mis superiores me han dado apollo en todo lo q planteo y me an dado la ayuda para superarme.

good,very laid back environment.   enjoyed working with customers and staff.very easy  job. typical day at work consisted of assisting customers and providing customers with products
good,"The management can really affect how your work life goes and each store is ran differently. "
good,"over worked work area ..its not a good job to work at but thank you  walmart your help me to make up my mind to go back to school."
good,"there really isn't much to say about working at wal-mart. it was a great starting job for me, other that not much to say. except that things do tend to change a lot depending on the store manager."
good,Unload trucks stock shelves front/face merchandise. not bad if you dont mind working multiple departments other than what you get hired for. also for low pay.
good,OK place to work for. The manager when I worked there was very friendly and fair. Hours are flexible. Pay is OK. Public customers can be a pain.  Pay is fair.
good,"I loved my job. it was hard at times because of other people constantly calling out and since a lot of people calling out, the department manager gets upset when things are not done. but other then that, I love my job."
good,Walmart can be a good career for a lot of people. you can learn a lot of different things about people and living. I have worked in a Walmart with great management where most of the employees are happy and get the most out of their job. the one I am working at now is not very organized and the management is not so good which causes my job to not have the resources I need to do the job well. on the other hand I work with a lot of good and friendly people that make it more enjoyable to come to work.
good,"Overall I did enjoy my job as a Customer Service Manager at Walmart. A typical day included counting money, looking up receipts, answering questions from customers and associates, doing price checks, running registers. Overall the management team at the Tomah walmart was great, however there were a few managers who werent very respectable. The hardest part about my job would have been dealing with the few managers who I did not get along with. The most enjoyable part about my job was helping customers and being around people all day."
good,"Great company in retail, values of company have declined , fun challenging at times, incredibly stressful at others, you build a good amount of skill in customer service."
good,"Shift starts at 11 pm with a nightly meeting informing us what is expected to be done for the whole shift. Updates on sales, claims and how many loads arrived for the night to be completed following a modular."
good,"Supervise services rendered to vehicles. I have learned how to interact and manage people.  The hardest part of the job is meeting the expectations of management without being provided the tools necessary to succeed, Being around co-workers and working on cars is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Good employer to work for, better opportunities.... it has great variety of geographical diversity and has multiple locations to pick from and a fun place to work"
good,I worked for over sixteen years at the Wal Mart distribution center.  I was able to purchase stock along with their contribution.  I also participated in a 401K plan.
good,"My typical day would be to always check the amount of freight that was coming in, what time it was due to arrive and unload it or help unload it.  I helped assign associates tasks on a daily basic. Make sure the sales floor was clean and well stocked. I also had to run a register when needed."
good,A nice place to work if you like to be around people. Always busy very productive nice coworkers room for improvement and a lot of departments to choose from
good,it like most retailers there all the time changing different processes and trying to improve different things that could help sales improve but the road gets ruff in the process
good,OK it’s a workday for me is clutch can check my sales check my team to see who I have committed go to the back check my freight then cap my bans go into the floor and do paperwork if their price changes in any mods if I have to with working in Walmart I have learned to manage a group of associates delegate to get all of my notes done
good,"Was a good job to work at in a small community where everybody knows each other, productive and competitive work area.  I was moved around to many areas for learning experience."
good,I enjoyed working with all my coworkers they were like family. Everyone was very friendly. Walmart had alot of good qualities in a work place and I was saddened when I had to leave.
good,Walmart has taught me a lot on how to work and handle different personalities in a work place. I have grown as a manager. Pay and benefits are good. Work long hours.
good,"I started off working here as a cart pusher and worked my way up to being a Customer Service Manager, it was worth it. What I can tell you is that its a lot of politics going on in Walmart, so if you can deal with that you will be fine."
good,It is an okay place to shop and work.  Not my favorite but I would work there again if that was an option.  The benefits would be nice to have.  It just depends on the atmosphere.
good,"Typically stocked put things where they go. Load and unload trucks. Somedays i would also do cashier if they were short, i would greet all customers in a kind manner."
good,"Pulled items to be shipped to local Wal -Marts good schedule worked Tuesday through Friday off every Saturday,Sunday and Monday.The only down side to this schedule was working 3p till 2a."
good,"•	Primary job duties include loading and unloading shipments, organizing backroom spaces, constructing displays, and stocking shelves."
good,I worked there during the Great Recession. Only place that had guaranteed job security at the time.  Management played favorites and rarely promoted the correct person for supervisory roles for fear that the promoted employees would eventually take over their position.  Not recommended if you prefer 9-5 hours. They will schedule you for crazy turn around shifts all the time!
good,Exelente ambiente lavoral y muy buena empresa lo que no es muy bueno son los salarios . Pero en lo demas es muy buena empresa y con muchas oportunidades para todos.
good,Wal-Mart is like any other employee. It has its good benefits and not so good benefits. It has good management and coworkers and not so good management and coworkers. What I like most about Wal-Mart is an employee's ability to transfer if a need for family location arises.
good,I was let go for accidentally clocking out 1 minute too soon and it pointed me putting me over my points for the first 6 months. My other points were medical issues.
good,it was interesting and it taught me a lot. hardest part of the day is waking up at 3am but once you get past it its easy peezy. the most enjoyable part of the day is the smiles and faces and of the customers and co-workers.
good,If you want to work long hours at a meaningless job.  This is the place for you.  Supervisors didn't get along well with others.  Office personnel were dumb and lazy.
good,"Supply new merchandise to every assigned ailes by the supervisor. Knowlegde on how to clean hazardous liquid spils, palletjack, and rocketcars handling zones. Transport freight to the sales floors after sorting and ensuring that sufficient quantity has been delivered. Ensure that any excess materials are placed in storage rooms. Handle stock inventory and make sure that it is accurate by rechecking it. Ensure that items are marked properly before they are send to the sales floors. Assist customers during night hours by providing them with product information."
good,Walmart is a very fast paced stressful job. It does pay good. upper management the worst. they do talk down to their employees and have no empathy or understanding.
good,It’s a good first job but I personally wouldn’t turn it into a career. I’m currently looking for something more long term and steady preferably something full-time.
good,"Fast paced with plenty of competitive opportunities for growth. "
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart something new and exciting liked meeting new people and helping others as myself and my family didn't stay due to having to relocate
good,"""Its a job"" is a good description of any position at walmart but it was a constant source of pay for anyone who is not sure what they want to do. You can work and pay most your bills at this pay rate."
good,Walmart is a stressful place to work. Employee bonuses were taken away from regular employees. The benefits were not as good as other fortune 500 companies I were employeed
good,"high volume of product moves through the doors on a daily basis. Be prepared to work at a fast pace to keep up with freight flow. "
good,Same routine every day. Constant breaks. Employee discounts. Busy holidays. Pretty much picking up after all the customers mess and displacements of items.
good,"I liked working for Walmart, for the most part I enjoyed everyone I worked with. the scheduling was good and I had the freedom to work by myself along coworkers."
good,"If this is about Walmart I don't have any thing good to say"

good,"I worked at Walmart for a bit, it was great experience but I felt it wasn’t for me , getting to work back and forth was a struggle . Plus hours wasn’t looking great"
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walmart because I got the chance to do what I love and do best, and that's helping people. my co-workers became my friends and a few of them became my family that I still deal with to this very day."
good,Walmart is a good place to work in some aspects it wasn't bad at all! Just knowing how to do your job would make everything ok! That's it go in do your job and then go home
good,"It was a great successful learning experience. The two and a half years of me being there, I learned so much and overall it is good. Great people there"
good,A typical work day is setting goals to clear all palettes before the end of shift with less back stock as possible while helping customers in the store.

good,I would cfheck out my customers. I learned a lot as far as their policies. Management was very helpful if needed. the hardest part of the job was when wer would be understaffed. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people all the times andseeing alot of familiar faces.
good,"Most know how Wal-mart treats employees and it was no different in my time there.  Just a stop gap job until you find something worth staying at , nothing more."
good,it was a steady job and income with job security. the pay isn't all that great for the amnt of work you have to complete. but overall it was an ok environment
good,"I like to work with the other employees but the management on the floor needs to go to customer service classes and pass.  The manager when I worked there, was really great."
good,"good selection of groceries with small amount of non-perishables. Very busy, not enough coverage. Management seen but not heard My experience was that of a grand opening of a new store. Expected to accomplish very little in an 8hr period while working in a construction zone (required to wear a hardhat). Hardest part, checking out & bagging groceries alone. enjoyed the customers."
good,The London Ohio Walmart is a very unorganized store. Management does not communicate with one another leaving associated especially department managers very frustrated and confused. Rules are only followed by management if convenient for them. Staff is under appreciated  and talked down too.
good,"Being on time, putting customers first, maintaining a safe environment and work place. Working as a team and respecting one another every day no matter what."
good,I liked the fast oace but didnt like the houts cut. I was at 32 hours a week and went to 10 out of nowhere.  Pay is every two weeks but starting off wage is not bad.
good,Walmart is a hard place to work because customers are rude and they work you like a dog and you don't get any benefits. It was easy for me to progress because I was a hard worker. They don't hire very good quality people.
good,"it has been many things i have learned at walmart such as: stocking, Communication, Interpretation, and awareness. Walmart was such a learning experience for me."
good,Count prior days financial transaction. Maintain financial paperwork  for Corporate office and Management. Email Management on the Profit and Loss numbers for the prior day.
good,Ioved making the customers smile as well as helping the elderly to there car everyone was always so happy the mangers were hands on when it came to training
good,"The Hours Started Out Really Good Then When They Started Cutting Hours It Began To Lose My Interest, My Overall Opinion Is That It Was Okay. The Pay Was Decent."
good,"A typical day at Walmart is quite busy consisting of heavy work load, several customers coming across in minutes; Upper management is fairly good, however can be too lenient at times to those who provide poor performance. The most enjoyable part of working here is the diversity of customers and staff. Working at Walmart is definitely not easy, however it is important to balance time in finishing projects as well as corresponding with customers."
good,When I worked for Walmart I was hired on as a part-time cashier and was promoted  after 6mos full-time but they were hiring other  people on full-time with benefits
good,"A typical work day was not too fast paced and tolerable, learned how to work together to form teams as benefits and performance depended heavily on them, and enjoyed the family discounts."
good,"i would recommend Wal-Mart to any one ,cause it is a decent company ,but cutting my hours makes it hard sometimes to pay bills and take care of a family"
good,"learned how to stock stationary products onto shelves properly, stock boxes.   the hardest of the job was the manual fork lifts and climbiing ladders. it was a great job."
good,"Wal-Mart is an excellent place to work at.  Your are in safe work place and most of the employees are friendly and easy to get along with.  There a also good, smart managers who are always willing to help."
good,"the job is productive and can be enjoyable, sadly the opportunities for job advancement are very few and far in between only ever being offered to a few people"
good,I don't really have much to say. I wasn't there long because it was a temp job. I didn't like my supervisor or manager. The hours were too inconsistent (Probably because I was temp).
good,"Had to work hard to keep the lobby full of shopping carts for the high number of customers coming into the store. Worked in all kinds of weather including, hot and cold temperatures, rain, snow, hot sun. The breaks were not very long (15 minutes twice a day, for 8 hour shift - 1 hour lunch). Excellent benefits, including dental, vision, health care. Opportunity to invest in stock options in Company."
good,"I find that we are so understaffed that I do everyone else's job constantly. Management doesn't understand and I have to do jobs I have not been trained for. I notice other worked who get paid more than me do less and pick what they get to do while as I do way more and get no praise for it unlike other people. I feel like I try hard to get nothing except stress in return. I feel no push to work hard anymore. 75% of the management is pushy and rude with me. "
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart. It started out as a seasonal job for me and they hired me on as full-time. I learned how to rewrap packages and work with my associates with teamwork
good,"A very friendly and considerate group of employees.  The environment was fast paced, but was always one in which a person could be proud of working there."
good,walmart dont care for they employees only if your coming to work. it has its moments and customers are difficult but work is work and they based off you making them money. They bonuses suck !!!!
good,the walmart i work at is very up tight and they are always on your back. the store manager is very unprofessional and doesnt know how to run a store .
good,"it did what I needed at the time in my life just moving to Georgia for a new beginning. so now I can take that experience and move forward, use it as a stepping stone to move ahead"
good,Enjoyed interacting with the customers and other employees. Business could be slower during the day but would pick up after school and work hours. Would also help clean and organize the store.
good,Walmart was always under staffed when it came to weekends and big events. We would have long lines and when we needed a CSM we would have to wait a long time to even get to talk to the CSM. Customers would always get mad about waiting. it was just a very stressful work environment
good,"Work culture is difficult but manageable."
good,A typical day for me was full of repetitive and fast work i definitely learned a lot of different skills that will benefit me in future jobs to come. my management team was very professional hard workers. the work place was comfortable and provided everything we needed to have a successful day at work. the hardest part for me would have to be the lifting repeatedly. The most enjoyable time was being able to interact with my co workers.
good,Loss prevention worker is why i am leaving. She has constantly harassed me and always accuses me of things and i am tired of it. If she spent as much of her time watching thieves as watching employees there wouldn't be any thieves.
good,Wal mart has changed over the years . They went from caring about there employees to not caring . I was there for 10 years and watched them slowly go down hill
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job included meeting different people, watching the new merchandise come in and displaying it and being surrounded by coworkers who made the day enjoyable. Managers who cared about their employees made sure they had the necessary equipment and training to complete assignments; who worked signed by side with their associates. They also had an open door policy where you could talk to them without feeling intimidated. A typical day consisted of restocking shelves and making the store presentable for the next day. Those that knew how reset shelves to either remove or add new merchandise were given that task. They were also given special capabilities via desktop and handheld computers. Because I was a quick paced employee, I was also trained and certified to utilize licensed equipment."
good,It's a fun place to work you get to learn lots of new things and meet lots of nice people and even lots of not so nice people. I enjoyed having an hour break and being able to shop for stuff you need on break time
good,it`s a good job to work a lot of time it gets really busy and stressful but a great place to get retail experience  and learn grow in your career  I would recommend
good,"Buen lugar de trabajo."
good,good employer.liked the hours looking forward to working there again.would defiantly refer them for work the pay is great .and i lived close so it was super
good,"A great place for old retired folks and high school kids to work..... overall a great place to work though, the AC works GREAT but the pay is incredibly low for my standards and as should be for anyone else.............well as a sales associate anyway."
good,It was a alright job. lots of good people and good experience.  Learned a lot form the people that trained me. They seem to to want me in a position in which i had knowledge of the products that i was selling.
good,"Love the Team building"
good,While working at Wal-Mart I was trained to work in EVERY area of the store. It is expected of you to be knowledgeable of each area so that if you are needed to help a customer you can do so properly.
good,"A place where there are 15 managers and they expect all the work to trickle down to maybe 3 or 4 teammates, and every project needed to be done yesterday.  If you want to go to work and put in your 8, this is the place to go.  Of course WalMart is the number 1 employer in the history of man, there are positions for everyone, you can start out as a buggy boy and move up to store manager, i have seen it happen, it's just a rocky road to get there, and they put you to the test every single day."
good,"I like working in Walmart stores because they pay very well, schedules are horrible, yet they are very good at working with you and accommodate according to your needs. If you don't know the proper person you will never be able to move up. I have a degree and yet they say it doesn't mean anything to them."
good,"I liked it for the time I was there, co-workers were nice and easy to get along with.  Work went by fast due to being busy most of the time.  Had fun parties"
good,"	Oversee 30 Front End cashier, service desk and maintenance employee activities. "
good,"This was my first job and I can honestly say I actually liked working here I got to learn so much from customer serive cash handling and so much more ,"
good,"to many turn overs.  favoritism, management has many retaliation issues.  wal mart always were under the assumptions of theft.  you always had to watch your back"
good,"Liked the hours because as an overnight manager, you worked four nights on, four nights off. It allowed for more time with the family. Fast paced and lots of work to maintain store to company standards."
good,"Wal-mart was a fun working experience but really wasn't what i was looking for in a job."
good,Thanks very good job. Was a wonderful experience working in the bakery and on the floor.  Great place great and friendly people. Clean and organized very satisfied.
good,"My job was more then one person should have to take on alone, Impossible task on a daily basis,lifting 1lb to 70lb when told a physical was not required because you lift nothing over 40lbs"
good,"don't trust managers, was going to stay there but was lied to so quit, shop chief was pretty good, had a dept manager who yelled all the time, did not like them very much, could care less.  I stayed late several times when a customer call needing a tire, who was traveling and had a blowout, i didn't mind it was helping someone get home safe."
good,walmart is a good job to work at with great hours. always offered overtime and opportunities to work more. i learned how walmart is a successful company.
good,Very nice place to work. You always have something to do. There is always opportunity for anyone to move up within the company. Its a fun and safe enviorment to work in.
good,"It was an ok place to work.  It is warehouse work, and everything is typical of what warehouse work is. Pay was comprable to other warehouses. Ensured quality was always good."
good,"Working at Walmart was a good experience, I learned to deal with hard situations in a appropiate matter."
good,"The warehouse isn't on the same page. The company wants to be the best. But doesn't think about its fellow associates. A little selfish, not enough credit is given out."
good,The supervisors need to work on treating everyone equally and recognizing good work potential. Need to gain more organizational skills to keep all employees happy and willing to work.
good,Every Wal-Mart is different. It all depends on the management team. When I was there it was good for the most part. A couple managers had there problems but the rest was good .
good,Very clean place to work. But I feel like everyone gets away without working and the mangers don't say anything to anyone and if some lead say something they get mad. Low pay job but its a job
good,With Walmart my duties were to greet the customer as they enter the store. Give the best customer service. At time my job code changed to stocker as well as meat department/ deparment scanner.
good,"the management wasn't all that great, they had favorites and cliques, I left because I started school. I loved my job in the sense of working with customers and people but not with the crew"
good,"A typical day at work is coming in without enough help, associates calling out, freight not worked the night before. Store manager walks around give notes. Notes have to be done plus your daily routine."
good,Yeah it was a good place to be and they pay good too. It was a full time job so I always had room to improve and work on my flaws. It was overall a decent place
good,"need better job and better organization. I was lifting, stocking, staying late to finish others work, loading and unloading. taking an hour lunch brake but forced to take a 2 hour lunch break if I worked more then the hours that are on my schedule."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is helping customers and receiving positive feedback. I have learned how to handle stressful situations that arise in a productive and timely manner.
good,"Walmart has its days. It's either fast and stressful or slow and tiring. As long as you have great team members and customers, you have nothing to worry about. Watch our for management, they play favoritism!!"
good,i learned alot while i was there. how to work the cameras. everything i did over there was very fun i had good people to work with we all treated eachother with respect.
good,"Clock in, get cash drawer, help and assist customers. I would assist co-workers as needed in other departments. Stocked shelves, handling of monies, data entry."
good,"It wasn't terrible, but the closing shift in the Deli is basically one of the most stressful positions in the store, I'd argue. High turnover rate for the position, with pretty consistent understaffing and a lot of work that needs doing."
good,"A typical work day at Walmart it can be fast paced at times."
good,I worked in the frozen/dairy department. My day would involve stocking shelves and pulling out dated items. I would sometimes help with manager duties. I learned how to keep a grocery area clean and stocked. The work place was low key. The hardest part of the job was lifting 30-50 lbs boxes. I really enjoyed the people I worked with
good,"Working with this company was fun, it was fast paced some days. other days it would be slow. I always met new people everyday. Working as a cashier always kept you busy and I enjoyed it."
good,"Today i went to work and found out that I didn't finish what I was suppose to finish last night. Well, wen I came in today I had to finish the project that was suppose to get finished yesterday, It didn't thou. "
good,"Easy pace work, simple troubleshooting and repairs. Leadership is not so bad, just unexperienced for the job due to the pay schedule. Decent benefits, but to hard to pay on income."
good,for the work that is demanded for a tle tech to accomplish the wages do not compare. the Walmart I work at has no AC or fully working coolers in shop to keep cool in this Arizona heat
good,Cap 2 works very hard unloading the trucks and stocking consumables but overall everyone is friendly and ready to help out. Management offers incentives for staying injury free and safe.
good,"Oportunidades de crescimento por recrutamentos internos, também tive vivencia na área de logística adquirindo conhecimentos."
good,"Working at Walmart was a learning experience. The day was usually a busy day, with customers and management.  It was a diverse work area. I learned the basics and routes in being a baker. The most hardest part was having to wake up at 430 am but I made myself costume to it. The most enjoyable was my coworkers."
good,"Flexible schedule with decent pay. 2, 15 minute breaks and a 1 hour lunch break when working an 8 hour shift. Good bonuses and holiday pay. Benefits and insurance available to full time employees."
good,did not make much money . or hours. back then. one of my bosses would hit on me everyday. was making me feel uncomfortable. called me so much . changed my number and did not go back to work. but over all I love shopping at Walmart.
good,"Its a great company to work for if you are trying to move up to management because the benefits are great, and the co-workers could be more considerate but all in all its a good company to work for."
good,The managers at my Walmart wouldn't let me change my availability and we're rude about it. It wasn't a fun place to work either. People constantly complained about their lives
good,"loved working there "
good,"Walmart is not a bad place to work. I have been there 9 years. Things are changing, I have a new manager and I am ready for a change. She is not encouraging."
good,"Again could be better, the only good thing about working there was the Occasional times when the store would shut down. The manager for my section (Electronics) was ok."
good,"i retrieves carts from storage docks in the parking lot and returns them to the store for patrons to use.Once carts have been retrieved, i then moves them either into the store or to an exterior loading place where carts are stored for customers."
good,needed more money due to personal circumstances. not working enough hours to make enough money to pay my bills. Just needed something more substantial.
good,"all about customer service , cashier , helping all arround the stores , worked in every single department in there , gained all the experince from working there m fun , fast , quick and you have to always be able to multitask"
good,I liked the hours I was given I was always challenged at this job is very high paced the pay was okay. The only thing that was poor were the mangers  ability to stay professional and keeping their personal life out of the store
good,walmart has some good job opportunities. my favorite part of the store to work in was the produce section. that area taught me alot about many different fruits and veggies.
good,"You need patience, you need to be ok with standing all day, and you usually dont have a steady schedule.  Be ready to be called in to work on a few hours notice"
good,"It was difficult to build up fast checking times as the bags, change and other supplies ran out a lot. The shift times were stupid as the schedule would be close one night and return to open the next morning,"
good,the work is very strenuous and stressful the hours are kind of set its really hard to be moved to other areas of the store.the people are really nice  and the benefits are okay
good,"Fast paced, lots of lifting, stocking, walking, standing on hard floors. Great benefits, and quarterly bonus. Huge turn over weekly. No union sometimes no hot water but they serve food daily."
good,This being my first ever and only job I've  ever had. Its a pretty good oppertunity to learn and develop professionalism and  up your customer service experiences for the future job you apply but defiantly not a career.  plus you only get paid $10 per hour after 90 days of staying with the compney.
good,"While most of the people who work there can be friendly, the pay isn't great and some of the management is a little off. It also can be hard to provide good service when you don't have enough coworkers who got your back"
good,You do have times when you don't want to work there because of some customers but your fellow associates and others remind you why you are there. Just helping customers and associates is very satisfying.  You go with the good and bad days but you just have fun and lots of smiles with everyone.
good,Walmart was stressful and the pay wasn't good enough for everything I had to do. Plus management didn't work with me on a family matter. I did like the work cause it kept me busy
good,"It was a retail position, fast-paced. Days went by quickly, with something always needing to be done. They are good about training you on multiple tasks if you ask and are willing to learn"
good,It is a good company to work for. I wouldn't stay there as long as some people. But they have helped a lot of people over the years. The hours are flexible
good,"If I would you I would work somewhere else, work at Walmart if u have to, it is stressful and they didn't treat me fairly but if you like that then Walmart is the job for you"
good,"fast paced and fun environment. Good management and flexible hours, great for students. paid 15 minute breaks. Comfortable working environment. Diverse culture, no judgement."
good,Good place to work if you like having your own area to yourself to work. There always room for improving or advancing to that next level. You can learn a lot about daily products and equipment just by being around it all the time.
good,"Nice management, fairly flexible. Low wage, and very small raises. Good benefits if you can obtain full time status. Free lunches from time to time. Friendly environment."
good,"The best thing about Walmart is they pay above minimum wage, have decent benefits and if you are good at your job you get good hours. Unfortunately the benefits take a huge chunk out of my paycheck which makes it harder for me."
good,"good company  but needs better pay and more opportunity"
good,"cool work place with a lot of multitasking... Provides customer service and assistance"
good,Enjoyed working in the maintenance dept.  I liked getting my work accomplished at my own schedule and being productive during my whole shift.  Asset protection was a little more challenging.
good,Some of the managers were very rude and made you feel as if you didn't matter. I was threatening a miscarriage and was still made to stand and lift 50 pound boxes.
good,I have learned a lot in my four years that I have been with this company. From customer service skills to critical thinking. I have gained a lot of insight that will carry me from this job and onto others that I might have in  the future.
good,highly recommend to any pharmacy technician wanting a professional workplace and learning experience. fast paced and customer to patient relationship is necessary for line of field
good,"Walmart is currently decreasing the amount of opportunities for advancement.  work life balance is minimal, PTO is above average, and management works well with you"
good,always busy and productive work enviorment. competitive and motivated coworkers. everyone worked at a team and hepled eachother when ever there was a problem to deal with.
good,"Overall it isn't a horrible place to work. The attendance policy is somewhat strict, but not terribly so. It was a decent job that I enjoyed doing, had it paid better I would have stayed."
good,Wal-Mart is going down hill I worked there 9 months and I liked it at first but the management is bad and some co workers just never show up and you have to cover there slack
good,Ordered product check and fixed inventor irregularities. assigned day and night crew duties to make sure product was rotated correctly. made price changes to ensure price accuracy.
good,É um local bom de trabalhar.  Só não tem muitasido oportunidades de crescimento.
good,"Get used to long days working for people that don't care about you or anything in your life. Some managers are alright but others barely qualify as people, let alone as decent managers."
good,As a technician I was separate from the main store. It really depends on your manager as to what the environment is like. I have been through 5 managers. overall the style of the manager makes a huge difference in the pharmacy morale.
good,"Customer service is a must in the world of Walmart.  getting to interact with many different customers, facilitating their needs and helping them find what ever items they need was a fulfilling venture but the best part was the employees that you worked with."
good,I loved working there managers are very  training was amazing and very interesting I wish I could've balanced school and work I would've stayed I loved it
good,"Clocked in at 1:00 PM. I would stock, clean, help customers, work with money, everything an other Wal-Mart associate would do. I would leave 10:00 PM."
good,Its really just an ok job. Not fun but not absolutely terrible. Some people are nice and some arent. They pay you and its Walmart. what can  you reasonably complain about?
good,I worked in the grocery department and it was just a little up tempo. I made it work and always stayed on task. I worked evening and daylight occasionally.
good,"Work hard,stay busy,& team work is the key. Walmart is a very good career & is a safe environment to work in. Please the costumer & stay for focused on completely your task."
good,"A typical day at Walmart is hectic."
good,Working at Walmart was the worst but not the best. There were good hours good pay but co-workers were the worst. They were very disrespectful and they figured that they can treat you wrongfully and have favorites and not treat everybody fair and with respect.
good,It was hard work felt like it was a thankless job. The Magement was never able to get things done. Second it felt like I wasn't even a person there I was just a number
good,The customers face when i help them get in and out quick that is the greatest part of my day and the  hardest part is the work load. I've been working with this store for 3 years i love the people
good,"Walmart is a great job, the have benefits. 401k I believe! Discounts as while. And the whole environment is calm and collect. Walmart is a easy going job and I loved working for the and won't mind again"
good,"Nice job to have, Wored around any emergenies pertaining to family.. Typical day at work consisted of very busy with custoers, learned how to handle difficult custoers, anagement on 3rd shift now how to assist with freight, culture of company in integrity and thoroughness. Hardess prt of job was trying to run front end and throw freight  and get it all done. Enjoyed  working with the coworkers like a faily"
good,"Working up close and personal with the public can be rewarding and when it,s not your professional ability to make a customer feel appreciation is key in this work setting."
good,My department was very we organized management was very understanding of life events and would work with you on anything you needed. Everyone is very respectful
good,Was a good place to work. Only bad thing is the dont take doctots notes. I had got a kidney infection n had to be off work due to it. Got fired due to missed work yet it was due to medical reasons
good,"I was not an actual Wal-Mart employee I worked inside of the stores as a third party vendor. but everyone at my sites was kind, personable and pleasant to be around"
good,I enjoy this job it did many different kinds of jobs I worked on the stocking and inventory I unloaded a trucks by work in the bakery worked on the garden center as a cashier and then worked in clothing apparel and then back to cashiering again I left this job because my husband had gotten a job at this time to relocate and I did not transfer because I did not have any daycare for my children at the time.
good,Learned about how a Walmart store is operated. Very fast-paced work environment. Enjoyed always having something do work on. There was never a slow day at the store. Management was very professional .
good,This was a good place to work. Pay was good and the people was easy to get along with. The managers that I had here was really good. They cared and would help you .
good,Job was OK needs improvement better system...lack of opportunity... Better management needed...break nd lunch break were OK...hardest part Was dealing with rude customers
good,The hardest part of my job was getting hurt and having to sit for 2 hours. Then because they failed to find and incident for me getting hurt I was denied medical. I have no insurance and no way to take care of my injury so I left.
good,"Walmart isn't the greatest place to work, but I've worked at much worse places.  The people are pretty nice, but management could really use an overhaul."
good,"Nice place to work , people were friendly , customers were ok , there were sometime where things would get hectic but that's with any company , over all I would recommend this place to anyone."
good,I really did not learn too much at wal-mart. They don't really train you for your position. They pretty much put you out there and let you learn as you go on.
good,Walmart is a good place to go if you are unemployed and seeking temporary employment. It is not the type of place to settle unless absolutely necessary.
good,Working at Walmart they will give you a title of the position but will not pay you for the position that you hold. Working here has put a bad taste in my mouth I couldn't get a pay raise but I got a title raise it's the job.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart for about the first 4 months until the work became redundant. The Store manager at the windsor heights walmart also refused to pay me my PTO when I left on good terms. I had been reassured by the assistant manager Jen that it would be taken care of. Instead I was cheated out of almost 30 hours of paid time off when I left. Diverse work environment though.
good,"It's a stressful place to work at night because it seems most of the workload is forced upon the night shift, and it seems day shift gets the more recognition for achievements than the night shift as well.  Sometimes it feels like the night shift doesn't matter, and I feel if we are going to do the most work, we should get better pay"
good,A typical day at work or night since I worked the graveyard shift. Walt-Mart will hire back people who stole as well as people who walked on their lunch
good,"Worked overnight"
good,good place to work but management is stressful great people and customers . loved working here and would defiently work here again. some great people come in and they get to be like family
good,Walmart is a customer focused place of business that provides quality products at a low price. If you can't find it in the store you can always shop online.
good,Very Cheap company they need to start paying Double on holidays!!  And they require you to do a lot of work for 9 dollars hr !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,"-No existen los días típicos"
good,A position where an employee will learn the importance of stocking/zoning shelved products. Can be hectic at times depending on the time of year IE Christmas.
good,"Personally i wouldn't refer someone to work here just because its Walmart, what you see is what it is. Some people enjoy it more than others and thats fine, but it is a good place to work if you dont have any other options."
good,"Learned a lot about the retail business which I've never been in before.  "
good,"It was decent, no real complaints. The pay was okay. Health care was nonexistent. Paid time off you had to wait over a year for. manager was a decent guy though"
good,"Walmart helped me improve my customer service skills, as well as helped me develop the skill to work efficiently under pressure, as well as complete tasks in a timely manner. I am very thankful for the experience I have received."
good,"kinda slow in the mornings then pick up at noon."
good,"very fast paced, some mangers are ok, while others are not,bakery is fun to work in, non stop and always something to do, if you dont mind baking bread, or donuts or fillin sales floor,  its definetly a good place to work"
good,As a first job this was very beneficial in developing my skills in operations and leadership.  Team oriented group that helps accomplish all expectations.
good,"customer services by checking them out through cash register,stocking on counters the needed items suchs as clotthings,books,drinks and foodstuffs and then customer assistance."
good,Its hard to say because everyone that i worked with had different feelings. To be honest it was a good job and as long as you showed up and did your job you would be fine.
good,This just applies to the Walmart I worked at. I did not particularly enjoy working here. I did like helping customers though. Management was helpful though when I needed paperwork for medical reasons.
good,"At time can be fun other times may be stressful. Management at the time was tolerable at times then other not so competitive. Some management all right other not so good. "
good,"Did not get 40 hours a week as a full time employee.Very difficult to support a family on different hours each week. Benefits were good."
good,"I am a stocker so its very fast paced, the hardest part is trying to get everything done on time. You get a certain amount of hours to do your freight, with doing that you have to also assist customers and help out other employees. They all come together as a team to make sure we have everything the customers need."
good,A very strong company with a very strong corporate culture.  It pays well however there is very little opportunity to be creative as everything is all preplanned out.
good,Work environment was poor scheduling is flexible and lunches are an hour and customer are rude employees are rude job culture is balanced but needs work
good,it was an ok place to work.  Management was weird sometimes they supported ur opinion and other times they could be unsupportive.  THe management had a high turn over
good,A fast pace job it was fun to work with the staff. everyone had their own responsibly. you had to scan the price of meats and pick it if there's none on the sales floor. then you go in the back and scan the meats until you find the certain meat for example steak. then you pick out how many you need and put in on a 9 high and scan it for a date. and then you put in on the sales floor so the customers can see.
good,does not care about their employees.  cutthroat management who only cares that the job is done in record time.  does not treat employees fairly or equally
good,It was a job to  good work experience in retail learned about meat handeling and food safety met a variety of people and made some good contacts able to vary your hours
good,"I worked at Wal-Mart through a temporary service and the employees of walmart treated us different. It was very laid back, got our assignment and stocked shelves all night."
good,Good place to work only reason i left was i got offered more pay or i would still work for them currently never had a bad moment at walmart at all would recomend
good,Walmart is a pretty easy job they teach u what you need to know to do your job. Also you learn how to work with all kinds of people and how to deal with different attitudes. Walmart is very fun place to work if you like talking to people.
good,"the place is a cluster "
good,"I don't believe every wal mart is like this, but working here at the time was just not working out for me. They didn't want to work with my college schedule after I had been told they would so thats when I found Carmike and went there after working with Wal Mart for over a year."
good,"It was an okay job one of my first & first job to actually be almost 40 hrs a week with sick pay & paid days off, cant beat that so we'll talk more in details."
good,"A big store with a variety of items makes working at Walmart a challenging place since you have to know most items to be able to assist customers. "
good,sometimes a hard place to work due to poor supervision and communication skills. due to employment shortage duties during the shift change numberous times taking you away from the duties of your job description and resposibilities.
good,Fun atmosphere lots of different jobs available promoted from within instead of hiring from outside got raises based on performance very understanding of personal problems
good,Falta una mejor administración porque em muchas ocasiones hacia falta una mejor organización para que funcione de mejor manera la empresa
good,My managers was very understanding and kind. They taught my how to stock appropriately. Their training was superb. Walmart is a very supportive and family oriented business to work for. Im glad I was apart of the corporation.
good,"multi tasking all day some employee do more than others. lack of team work some managers show favor towards certain employees. lack of staff, bringing other associates from other stores to work."
good,"I really don't have much to say about walmart.  It was a seasonal job while in high school. "
good,Wal-Mart was a difficult job to get used to but the management wants the workers to succeed and I was given ample options when I was having difficulty at work.
good,Walmart was very busy so made my shifts go by quickly. The hardest part of the job was dealing with some difficult customers. It was a pleasant place to work
good,"really fast paces, cut throat, high turn over. Work my decently paid and was kind of close. Wal-mart doesn't have the best benefits either for their employees."
good,working at WalMart was an experience I first started working the the second shift and eventually ended up doing day and overnights and working all three shifts allowed me to see the many different sides of the business and was quite enjoyible
good,I started in Deli and was there for 3 years before moving to Electronics. I  straighten up and stock shelves every day. I also do some reports and lots and lots of cleaning. I also am required to watch at least 2 other departments every day due to lack of help. Hours were cut recently due to poor managment. Now the place looks like a pigsty and people are complaining about the lack of people on the floor to wait on them There has been a rash of people quitting due to the managment understanding of life issues such as sickness and family death and illness.
good,"Walmart is one of those places that when it comes to working for them, it's a love/hate relationship. At least usually. I'm sure most people just hate it. The break rooms are alright and Management does what they can."
good,A typical work day is busy. You get to interact with customers whenever they're in need. Management was okay they seemed like they didn't really care about associates.
good,"It was a great first job to start out with, not something I wanted to do forever but like I said, definitely a good first job, gets you kinda started on your work life."
good,"i enjoyed my time working for the corporate side of it. basically its spoon fed to you, some of the staff that has been there for many years can really help you enjoy your time there. not a bad place to move up in management if you're okay with retail"
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with.  Had fun with most of my customers. As with any job there are good and bad things you just have to learn how to deal with them.
good,I had a really great experience at Wal-Mart. I learned many things that made me better as an associate as well as a individual. Wal-Mart believes in promoting within which is a great aspect to have as a company.
good,I would recommend Walmart because you can learn a lot about retail.  You also learn how to work in a very diverse work setting.  The location of the store wasn't the best.
good,helping customers in fabrics and crafts by cutting the amount asked for and then pricing product accordingly. resetting planograms and restocking shelves as needed. keeping area clean of all debris.
good,The company its self is great to work for and has an amazing history. They are always trying to become better. I think that the management at the store that I worked for wasn't the best. seemed to have a lot to hide every time that corporate would come. also had a lot of favoritism. The company is great to work for but I think that they need to rethink the new pay structures that they have. They made it so that new associates are making more money starting out. They took the normal 4 to 6 % raises away from the previous workers and gave them all 2% raises each year for 2 years. now new associates are making just as much or more than associates that have been with the company for more than 2 years.
good,it wasn't a horrible place to work. there was a lot of work to do and not enough people to do it. bosses complained about that. be prepared to do a lot of extra unassigned work
good,"My job at WalMart was temporary, so I did not mind the conditions. The work environment was fast-paced, but acceptable for a student looking to earn some extra cash and gain some work experience."
good,"The expectations for both RX and OTC are very high, the work is manageable but the unfair treatment and the retaliation from management team are very disturbing"
good,It was ok. The only thing the co workers always like to judge everyone. If they didn't like you they would spread rumors about you. The managers were cool.
good,"It was a challenge, very quick paced.  They time everything.  You feel pressured to get things done.  Although in pharmacy some things take time for example a problem with insurance or intereactions."
good,"I like my job a lot I open boxes and organize clothes i just do not get paid enough  I want a job that pays well and do not have to work  weekends."
good,"I was an unloader/stocker working at Walmart. I can't expect too much out of the job.  For the pay and the job itself, it wasn't that bad. I wouldn't recommend working at Walmart unless you are just in need of a job, but I believe in pursuing a real career, this is a good job for while you're in school or in between jobs."
good,Walmart is a good company to start off as a first time job or someone in college. They work around your school schedule but they are very orientated around it is not what you know but who you know in order to advance in the company. If you are not in the group of friends that the manager likes and don't even bother.
good,I worked graveyard and the bosses never seemed happy no matter how hard we worked. The work was tiring and never was completed. Graveyard got a $.50 different pay rate then others.
good,"Stressful, fast pace, lots of opportunities in career advancement, and opportunities to transfer around the world where there's a walmart and lots of benifits."
good,I had to deal with rude customers every day but I remain calm and still did my job the best way I could and know how by me being hearing impaired they thought in shouldn't work but I knew I could accomplish and manage everything I need at that job.
good,"It was ok, it was really stressful. Had a lot of drama and don't really recommend this job to anyone that can't really deal with stress. Was really low pay."
good,The work load was always very heavy i was expected to do scheduling and inventory and ordering for 2 departments and oversee the training in a third.  I was railroaded into extra work and not compensated.
good,Walmart was not a bad place to work pay was OK and discounts. I worked like 32 hours a week. I didn't care about getting paid every 2weeks. The people there was pretty good.
good,I didn't really like they way the employees were treated and environment  wasn't healthy. but I don't think I would work with wal mart again as stocker but maybe try something different.
good,It was a good start in a career in retail. I got a lot of retail experience in Manny different positions. I moved around a lot to learn more and more.
good,"I personally don't love it here, but I understand how some can, it can be great for others, but for me personally it was not my cup or tea, especially the greeter position due to many reasons."
good,I love working with my co workers and the management directly above me. They really care about how I'm feeling and really take into account my thoughts and ideas. Although some other management should not have even been managers because they only worry about themselves and make associates work late and they just leave more work for other people.
good,"Its alot of work and it can be stressful at first,but once you get the hang of it its pertty fun. If you like quick-pase and clear instructions .highly recommend"
good,Mi experiencia  por Walmart  es muy positivo porque obtuve muchas herramientas de trabajo  que se que van hacer muy útiles  para mi próximo  empleo.
good,"It's an ok job for a limited time. Do not think that you can make more out of Walmart then a short term job, because you got to be a suck up to get a higher position."
good,"No me gusto el ambiente laboral, ni su cultura."
good,"Its slow paced, or actually, its however your speed is. I was actually pretty fast with my work, and I managed to help others with theirs when I was done. Don't go too slow, or you will get fired, don't miss more than the required amount, and you will not be fired. Also, do not take sass. Sass can get you into trouble. It was what I had to deal with. Sassy employees are the worst. "
good,"I found myself working harder not smarter, Customer service was my strong-suit within working in the workplace in aisles. Re-Stocked shelves that needed product. Gave quality in instructions to those in need to finding a product within the store. The most difficult part of the workplace would be the dealing with the management. They could be considerate at the working conditions, although only when they wanted to. The most enjoyable part of the Job would be dealing with the customers and working with my aisle partner."
good,Todo muy ordenado buenos jefes en general y tratos a personas
good,If you are used to working in a professional business this may not be the place for you. People are not real good about being held accountable for their actions.
good,I had a great time working there was likeba second family. Have nothing but good things to say about the Walmart I worked at. I left cuse I relocated to a different state
good,"Walmart offer work at regular way as a part time, not offer benefits first 3-6 months, work hours are cut depending theirs necessity. scheduling is not deseable."
good,"sometimes of the day it may be very slow, other times of the day it may get very busy and make the time at work go by very fast i really enjoyed my time their meet alot of new faces some good and mean"
good,It a good starter job for anyone who looking for a first job. It a fun place to work for and you learn how to have good customer services. good management
good,I do not believe walmart pay their pharmacy techs well. The insurance is not very good and they dont give us very many people to help us but still expect us to be perfect.I love the people I work with and would be sad to have to  leave them but you will not move up in this company in the pharmacy.
good,"It's a nice place to start customer service.  However, the pay is small.  There is no overtime allowed.  The employees were great to be around.  I would recommend Walmart."
good,"Walmart is a never ending job that requires a lot of energy. Walmart wants workers to be dedicated to them, regardless of situations of employees. Hard work and no time to play."
good,it depends on the management you get. Some are great and others are not. I liked working in some departments. Being a cashier can be boring when it is slow.
good,Atendimento aos clientes na operação de caixa de mercadorias.
good,"No se cuenta con el material para trabajar, y uno tiene que ingeniarselas"
good,"Ok place to work for pushing carts.  Felt like my time there went well, but I needed to leave for personal reasons and sometimes it felt like management didn't care."
good,You are paid well for some of the positions that really don't require a high level of education while some other positions you may feel underpaid. The work load regardless of where you are in the warehouse is high and you do not get enough training.
good,"not a bad place to work, the main issue I had was the lack of communication everyone it was very terrible, and also the trust of when u ask the manger for something it gets taking care of but it doesn't for like months"
good,the company is good i just dont like that they dont give enough hours and the pay sucks im looking for something better now i been doing customer service for 3 years its time i take my experince else where
good,When out of season the store is mostly enjoyable because you mostly help customers and can finish cleaning your area before the end of your shift. In season there are not enough workers and not a good prioritization of employees. It is difficult to reach management and due to having five different managers very often there are miscommunications and discrepancies.
good,"Walmart offers a good work life balance for its employees alongwith other benefits however the work flow is irregular and the management is into politics and lobbying. "
good,Walmart was not a bad place to work for. The people whom i worked with were nice and the job was ok. I do not think i have anything bad to say about this job.
good,At this point its all about the money.  In the Lower Mainland of BC the Upper Manager is really pushing the Store Level Management to not worry about standards or associates. leading to countless staff issues and customer complaints.
good,"Very good company to work for in Bentonville. very involved in communities.  "
good,when i was working at Walmart i loved working with the worker there and i got to see a lot for people i know come in to Walmart so i say hi and i like helping people trying to find things they need.
good,Overall my experience of working at Walmart was okay. They say they are family oriented but I didn't feel like I was treated with respect when it came to having issues with my family and work. But I would never tell anyone not to work for Walmart.
good,It was a good learning experience with clinical pharmacy as well as retail. Worked a lot with different kinds of insurances and worked with pharmaceutical companies for the best products for patients.
good,The work hours are inconsistent and based on the different seasons. Sometimes you will get a lot of over-time and at another time you will be getting between 20-30 hours per week making $18-20.
good,Long busy day. Just what I like to stay busy. Great management. I learn how to deal different customers and there attitudes. Nothing is never to hard for me I feel like its a challenge. Great place to work.
good,"I have learned many areas of the store and I have held three different positions. Walmart have many pros and cons. One of the pros would be the benefits, and a con would be cutting hours when they feel like cutting hours."
good,I needed a job for awhile was lots of freight handling very fast paced worst was all the lifting Best was coworkers they were great    Being exmilitary I am very structure oriented they were not management was very haphazard one manager didn't know what another was doing so one tells you to do one thing another tells you to do something else and gets on you for what you were doing that another manager told you to do.
good,"Work environment is stressful. Co-workers are difficult to work with and work closely with. Work divided unfairly. Co-workers often take advantage of breaks, leaving the floor understaffed."
good,Fast paced worked midnight shift stocking a lot of freight. Really liked what I did! Just was part time and I needed full time and more hours. They move a lot of product in and out throughout the day.
good,Its a place that cares more for the work getting done than the caring about its employees or understanding that life does happen and that there needs some type of understanding with that.
good,"I would work flexible hours. Stocking shelves, helping customers, and a back-up cashier. Some days were fun and some would be stressful. Cashier would be one of the best positions."
good,Have to learn your pace and stay on top of it to maintain your work speed and not get left behind.It is a lot to learn at a fast paste. must need to keep up
good,put up new shelves painted shelves drove forklift helped put in new floors loaded unloaded trucks worked with some great people helped stock shelves was a nice place to work for
good,I think almost everyone has worked for wally world not a career choice for me but it was not the worst place to work either all and all I would recommend working here.
good,The overall work experience was simple enough and not that hard but the way the management expected you to go about doing the job was inefficient and inaccurate. However the staff were very helpful especially to new people and offered training courses for people looking to advance. Even a 95¢ raise after you complete the mandatory exams on the computer. Which even though mandatory my supervisor didn't often allow me to go do it. Supervisor also stood around and did not do much. Other supervisors and managers had conflicting goals. Overall main problem was clutter in the backroom. Excessive amounts of stock with no where to put it.
good,job is  fast paced so time goes by rather fast. good pay real good pay. managers wants you to be everywhere at one time. point system sucks. if your new and if you have any medical issues please let them know before hand because if you recieve over 4 points in first six months they will not override even if it is due to a medical reason.
good,The ad matching is a terrible idea. Although it saves people money it takes much longer to ring them up and in result the customers in line get impatient quickly.
good,Learned a lot about the business and what is entitled for that business.  Liked training new hirer and enjoyed the people.  Had to spend a lot of time away from family.
good,Good management.  No room to advance.   hard to ge t overtime. HR group is not helpful. They do not want to help employees and are not easy to work with.
good,Need to own more pallet Jacks and not have bulling  associates and be more aware of people bulling  each other. The guy even told me to take it up with the manager and she did not do one thing about it.
good,"Worked as a night shift cashier. Duties included cleaning, stocking, organizing product, and obviously checking out customers. When it was slow, moved to stocking in other areas of the store."
good,Just busy fast paced working day customers all day needing help. Management working to help the associates. I learned a lot about the stores operations. Catching shoplifters and making sure the store is safe.
good,"•	In-depth knowledge about IV infusion pumps and drips. (Order sets, titration, manipulation of pumps.)"
good,"I liked working there but to many hired employees than hours schedule to work, so wasn't making enough for 2 weeks pay, other than that a decent job to be at."
good,"No comment on Walmart procedure and business standards"
good,"I worked as a part time employee."
good,"Good customer service, "
good,It is a fast paced environment. The food was always kept fresh. And even the shelf life of food was rotated daily. It was kept fresh for all customers.
good,The job is not worth the headache. I transferred from a smaller store. I loved working at that store but I hated working at a larger store. Workers were rude to each other and to the customers.
good,"Did not get full time hours and the pay was not good, too little pay not enough hours, schedule was horrible, but it had some advantages like getting food on holidays"
good,Was a decent workplace that provided help when needed. Was put on the register with no prior training but was pretty easy to pick up. Pushed carts my first week or two on the job.
good,"Wal-mart was a decent place to work for. It was stressful at times, but you are always made aware of what is expected of you. They make a good first time job for people looking for a start in life."
good,hours always changed as well as daily duties. Fellow workers were nice. Management was hard to find at times and get time off was difficult as well at times.
good,typical retail job. you come in for your shift then you leave at the end of the day. most days are ok except when dealing with the random unruly customers who believe you're lower than dirt and treat you that way. other than that it's an ok job to start at.
good,Overall it's a good place to work people are friendly and we have they have the best customer service and the employees that I work with was very respectable and nice and helpful
good,Good place to work I really like it. I asked to be moved to full time employment and they told me no becuz they didn't want anymore full time people. A
good,"At my time working here, the schedules were constantly done in error and multiple times have whole departments with less than adequate amount of workers."
good,"Retail Sales:"
good,"Working there was fun at first, but it was just all a dream. Yeah they will get you for all the perks and exciting you about the promotions they have within the store. So you doing your job and take the test, but you still have to jump through loops. Yes, you must have open availability, no exceptions. Oh well for 9.40/hr you have better opportunities elsewhere."
good,"As a cashier my job was very easy but was very tough on my knees and back, even with the rubber mat to stand on. It was simply the standing and not moving that made me hurt. I ended up in the hospital due to pneumonia, unable to breathe let alone talk. The manager in charge of hiring was kind and understanding and let me come back to work when I was able to. I eventually transferred to the deli department. It wasn't a hard job but the nightly clean up was very tedious. Always an abundance of pots, pans, trays, and wracks to wash by hand. Fryers, hot box, rotisserie ovens, and slicers to break down and clean with chemicals. The schedule was never set so hours varied. The worst part of the job was the hand cramps after an evening of scrubbing and the fact that the grease seeped into your pores, hair, and clothing. No matter how many times you washed you still smelled like grease."
good,"A typical day at Walmart includes clocking in, working the areas your supervisor assigns you, and getting two 15 minute breaks and one 1 hour lunch break for an 8 hour day. The communication between management and hourly associates is very poor. I have learned a lot in my years at Walmart but hardly anyone wants to teach new associates because they assume they won't last. The hardest part of the job would be getting your coworkers to come to an agreement and communicating with your management. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of helping customers."
good,its very stressful but its okay if you just want a job for the time being. I made the best of it and the employees are very helpful of one another. hours where very hectic
good,I like working at walmart  they work with you with your hours and i meet nice people. You can also talk to people about your problem they can give you advice
good,It was a good seasonal job.  I was able to work passed the end of the season at the last minute.  Walmart is very accommodating to your schedule.  Pay is minimum wage.
good,Liked working with people. I also enjoyed working in the Liquor store. The only issue I had was they would have you work just shy of full time not to supply benefits for a year. After a year they offered minimal benefits.
good,"Sadly, Walmart is a famous and rich company, but it definitely lacks of good management and the payment is horrible. "
good,I enjoyed working there because it was a fast paced environment. I loved interacting with the many different customers. I learned alot and I was able to enhance my customer service skills.
good,i often felt under appreciated for the job i did and looked at as more of a tool than an individual. Management were not organized and often had different priorities which lead to confusion. Under paid for the job i did as it was hard labor with not great working hours. profit sharing (yearly check) was the main positive.
good,"A typical day a work is having to deal with mad customer. I learned to not said anything to people who think they are right about everything. Management was OK, the workplace culture was normal.  The hardest part of the job was trying to please customers and the enjoyable part the job was talking to customers."
good,"I worked at Wal-mart for over 15 years i worked as a stand up fork lift driving. My supervisor was a fair man , the hours were good and the pay was fair. They did not want to relocate me to another Wal-mart when my living situation changed."
good,busy the management sucks their only help you if its beneficial to them their culture friendly but mostly hired spanish and if your not hispanic youll have a hard time advancing
good,Work was great had fun very psychical but not hard work. Pay was good always earning more and  eligible to make more . Will work there again if having the opportunity
good,"Minor changes, you are going to always have some changes that you have to deal with on any Job!You just have to deal with them.Some changes good and some are not."
good,"a day at work at walmart could be slow and boring to quick and tiring i learned customer service skills how to communicate properly, attend to customers needs properly."
good,"fun place to work, you work very hard, very fast pace, ,meet a lot of different people while working there. The pay is good, the vacation days are fair to how many you get"
good,"I loved all management there, worked with me and were very understandable with my hours if i had to change my schedule a couple of times.I enjoyed the atmosphere and flexibility of my job."
good,Walmart was everything you read about in the news but if you worked hard you could move up and become something.  Hard work and dedication can bring your life better things.
good,assist and checkout customers in the in the electronics department. Go through and stock  high valued inventory. Activate and charge cell phones for customers.
good,"Walmart is a decent place to work, they have lots of different jobs to choose from. Management can get kinda air headed sometimes but mostly nice. The pay went up after i left but was quite low for a management type role when I was there"
good,Would work there shaking for non seasonal. Great management employee respect. It's a company where you can move up if you work hard. I would recommend anybody to work there
good,the culture is nice the hardest part i say is just getting used to your new jobs the most enjoyable part is meeting customers always something to do didnt really learn
good,"You had to work with a sense of urgency,the store had to be stocked,staffed clean and ready for the customer, so you had to stay on your toes and create an environment conducive to productivity."
good,This is ideal for young people or retires looking for extra income. many other options to look outside of this retail chain. handled multi-task duties but for the pay rate was not sufficient.
good,"I didn't work at Walmart long enough to really have any thing bad to say about the company and I feel blessed that I had a employment. The employees were always helpful, and I learned new things each day I started my position."
good,They work You too hard for the pay. They don't care about the family side of things. Of you're sick they will just replace you with someone younger...
good,"Walmarts very fast passed, you have to keeep busy. The CSMS are akright we need more of them to help out though. Well be waiying like 20 minutes for someone to come help."
good,"walmart is good for the starting of a career, management at walmart is very supportive. they take care of the associates in all possible ways. if you are looking to work more than 40 hrs  a week then walmart is not your place to work"
good,"Wal Mart is a good company if you want to grow with the company. I was able to work my way up from a part time associate to Assistant manager and run the store in the absence of the Store manager. I enjoyed learning all aspects of the business and the everyday running of the store. By working your way up through the business, it gives you a better understanding of how everything works together. The most difficult part of the job is maintaining a work/life balance."
good,Walmart was a good job. on a typical work day u go in stock shelves and make sure isles are clean and up to par so its easier when a customer is looking for a product. the hardest part of working for Walmart is trying to get all the fright out on time and being able to do other tasks as well as giving good customer service
good,I enjoy my job but I work the overnight shift and my body and health just can't take it anymore after 5 years. I have wonderful coworkers and some great bosses. I have been trying to get a days position and had 3 interviews for advancement and didn't get any of them.
good,I enjoyed working at customer service cashier. It allowed me to meet and see new people though-out the day. I was able to learn a variety of skills while working this summer job.
good,It's a cool job you learn auite a bit you can move around and move up takes effect and knowledge and accuracy but overall it's a nice workplace meet new people.
good,Don't always get your hopes up about working at Walmart. It was a good job for better part of a decade when I needed to work to pay for gas to get to school and back to work.
good,"My typical  day at the Tre -Lube Express consisted of greeting customers, writing service work orders for the  customer's vehicle, running cash register and  receiving and stocking shelves. At times could be very hectic and sometimes stressful. Management was very helpful  when I had a particular question about work.  Most enjoyable part of  the job was interacting with the customers and providing them with quality customer service."
good,The amount of work that I did didnt amount to the pay . It's a good company to work for as far as benefits and all but it's not nothing you can make a career out of with the pay salary .
good,"I love working overnight because it gives me time to bond with my son. However, the hours and the pay are not sufficient enough to provide for a family of 3."
good,It was ok I like working for them I would like to work for them again but if not it's ok I can find something better..................................
good,"Acababan de empezar la plantilla del turno nocturno por eso faltaba mucho personal y el encargado del turno a veces cambiaba gente de departamento por eso a veces no terminaban su propia área."
good,"•uniform helped"
good,I loved working as an ICS associate but the overnight shift was pretty tough.  My favorite part of working at Walmart was being a pharmacy technician.
good,"The hardest part of the job is the customers, normally it is impossible to make them happy. Managers can be both good and bad depending on who you get. The people you work with are usually the best part."
good,"If you dont mind working long hours, and working alot of overtime I would recommend someone who likes to work alot and hard to work at Wal-Mart. The only manager who actually cared about their people was Regina, She was amazing."
good,I like my co workers but working nights really took a toll on my body and personal life. One thing I didn't like was I felt unappreciated and I couldn't take time off when my mother was in the hospital
good,"My husband fell off a roof and broke both legs,and  I was let go because of accumulated points.  They do not accept doctor's excuses so when I missed days due to being sick they counted against me."
good,"boa para trabalhar, mas não tem muitas expectativa de crescimento la dentro."
good,Great job just first job out of high school back in 2012 I heard things are better there now. Always work there good place to work up and build up on .
good,My beginning job was a cart handler. It started good but as time went on got harder and harder. I was moved to environmental services and the work was better
good,"worked in produce dept, and grocery co workers were very helpful, management was real supportive enjoyed working there, room for growth. Employees still say hello to me by name nice to be able to go to work in different departments, even though I haven't worked there for a few years"
good,"I enjoyed the job, it was just too far away to work consistently. During the winter it took 3 hour drive.The other employees were very hard to work with."
good,The people there are wonderful to work with but the company is not the best. They won't work with scheduling and if you can't work one day for a good reason they will cut your hours.
good,"typical day at work is very overwhelming, have not learned a lot, management doesnt help much, work place cultre is to diversed, hardest part is answering phones, and the enjoyable part is being on the floorhelping customers."
good,"Began as a cashier and cross trained in restaurant, layaway and customer service counter.  Competition within the employees to provide fast and friendly service."
good,"Walmart is a good job I have been there for 6 years in total, they offer health benefits and stock options. I worked in many different departments through out the store."
good,"Being a cashier is very repetitive and physically taxing. Most customers are kind and will actually stop and talk with you for a time, but the occasional disrespectful people can be very upsetting. If you are looking for a job that requires a decent amount of work for not that much pay, Walmart is for you. Job security is amazing and you can work as long as you continue to show up to your shifts. Sometimes they will work with your schedule too."
good,"I can only attest to the distribution centers, as I have never worked in a store.Take caution before applying here because this place of employment is very physically demanding and is only fit for people who are in extremely good shape.They say that you only lift, up to 75lbs, on your own. However, if you are in the shipping department, you must be able to lift, whatever comes down the line. This can be anything from pillows, to massive 4 burner grills and 10,000 BTU A/C units. You are required to move an average of 5500 cases per shift. Note, this is an average. You will have lite days and you will have heavy days. They do compensate you well in pay and benefits. I recommend this job to young backs. Someone that can lift a max of 140lbs close to 5000 times in the course of 10 hours."
good,Had to over compensate work for the other lazy workers.  All employees are not treated equally.  Not considerate of family life or seniority with employees.  Hard to advance even with qualifications because of managers being partial to other applicants.
good,"The work they ask of you is very reasonable, however people above store level pass word along to cut hours. I have personally went from working 40 hours a week to 20-30 hours a week. I don't believe this is as much location specific as it is company wide. Overall it Is an ok place to work with a few chances to promote within the company and has great opportunities for the individual compared to most retail jobs."
good,"Co-workers were vey friendly and very supportive, always looking out for each other. Customer service is exceptional. Got breaks when needed. Paid breaks. Got at least one day off a week.. requested time off was usually given."
good,"It's a easy-going environment, pretty much work at your own pace as long as you get the job done. The hours are long and opportunities for overtime are there but not much outside of work time."
good,"Simple, you come to work and stock for 6-7 hours and then you go home. Some sections of the store are more labor intensive which seems kind of unfair to other staff but for the most part it's a team effort."
good,Make Sure You work hard and get all the work done. They won't You to move fast but still be accurate. No sloppy work. Keep the customers in mind at all times.
good,Having to keep a clean work space while tending to customers with  great customer service and making sure the work space around you was safe. I learned how to use a register and help customers look up prices for items. Also to sort products and return them to the proper place with manager consent. The hardest part of the job was learning register. The best part of the job was helping customers. Management was a big help with this they were patient as we learn new things.
good,I am a cashier and enjoy working with different customers everyday. I drive a long way to get to Walmart ( 1 hour ) but I enjoy the job once I get there.
good,"Staff in Hawaii is biased and not friendly to temp employees, along with a disdain for white males working there, very hostile work environment. would not recommend working for them in Hawaii."
good,really fast pace work place and friendly employees. The managers is not as friendly as the managers that I have worked for at Safeway. The company did not have a back generator and then lost half of the produce inventory.
good,Cashiering was okay most customers was alright some would have attitudes or be in a rush .managers was all over the place they would come when needed  the breaks where not always at the time they was scheduled and we didnt have many lines open on most nights so it would get really busy after 3
good,the hours were kind of late. The fellow associates were nice enough. management was kind of iffy. i enjoyed the hour long lunch break. I did not enjoy the understaffed team.
good,Usually understaffed so you need to do the work of a few people. Don't ever go over 40 hours or you will be fired. Various positions you can work and different shifts.
good,This job can be very demanding as far as production goes. You have to be able to help customers and finish whatever task you have to do at the same time in a reasonable amount of time.
good,"Not having customers curse at you, everyday is a learning experience. Managers you have kind and mean people. Culture is good, complaints cashiers. Not good"
good,its a productive but sometimes stressfull place to work but any place where you deal with people all day can become stressfull. most of the managers and emplyees are a joy to work with  everyone seems to help eachother out when needed.
good,Excelente ambiente de trabajo......en el tiempo que estuve.....existia competividad sana entre compañeros .....y ganabamos insentivos
good,"typical work are is always smile, assisting costumers. I have learn patience helps and takes u a long way with people. Hardest part was getting use to schedule and juggling family. Most in enjoyable part is getting to meet and help different people from all backgrounds ."
good,"I enjoyed working here most days.  I always got my job done.  There were many times that there was conflict because all you would hear is complaining from other workers about things they had to do, or not getting certain times off and etc."
good,"They are not the best people to work for you can work your butt off there and go no where they will give promotions to people who don't deserve it Management can be very rude and self center ,"
good,WalMart is a decent place to work if you are in the distribution center however the retail store can become very stressful if you aren't careful and willing to do everything that the upper management asks of you .... Watch your back
good,"Its a great atmosphere to work in with really good co workers, and a pretty decent management staff. I have really enjoyed working there. It is a really great place to start your first job."
good,los supervisores se entienden con el persaonal y piden apoyo sobre el tiempo extra y son comprencibles y t ayudan siempre y cuando tu lo agas
good,"As a whole I thought Walmart was a great opportunity for me as a stepping stone. I learned a lot of knowledge on the front end as far as customer service and supervising. I started out with a lot of potential for growth in my store. Recently the opportunity for growth seems to be decreasing due to outsourcing more than internal promotion. I really enjoyed my direct manager and they were good about setting goals for me and providing feedback often. The downfall of management in  my eyes were that they changed often and each bought a different outlook which called for some confusion, The workplace and co-workers were amazing it was always a pretty uplifting atmosphere that I was happy to be at on a day to day basis. The hardest part of the job was to doing my job effectively and by the book when I wasn't provided the personal I needed. The most enjoyable part about my job was the experience I had with customers along with the interpersonal relationships I gained through my work."
good,Needs a little help with cleanliness as far as the deli is concerned but overall a great workplace if you can ignore others negativity I really enjoyed working the truck at Walmart and seeing all the lovely customers
good,"Not much to really say, worked as a baker associate customers were friendly, other employees and were very assisting. Helped others when needed, able to get very creative with donuts, cakes and donuts"
good,"overall is a good company but not the easiest to work at. if you like working hard and work long hours, then apply. the company is always finding new ways to better themselves."
good,We do all kinds of work at Walmart  but I enjoy what I do it could be fun sometimes and easy I love being around people and   Customers are my   Priority
good,"My time at Wal-Mart was very mediocre at best. The staff their were very bias and most of the time not too caring. The job is really meant just for those who need, really need, money."
good,"Walmart provided a lot of opportunity to grow and learn in the field of Asset Protection, however you are just a number to them. At the end of the day you are expected to do whatever necessary to complete the job."
good,Senior Management is poor because they are more worried about not spending any money within the store for anything because they are afraid they will loose there annual bonuses
good,"Working at WalMart was a great learning experience. I had great hands-on work experience, mostly learned on my own. Working with very strict guidelines and time restraints has disciplined me on time management."
good,"I have worked at several of their stores.  I liked the people i worked with and the customers that I met."
good,It's a great place to work with great people to work with. The only down side is if you miss to many days for a good reason you'll be asked to leave..
good,"As an associate in the electronics department, a bulk of the work is carried by us. Aside from helping customers with buying electronic products and providing cashier support, I also had to answer questions about other departments. Sometimes, we will be asked to help out in these other departments as well, with zoning and stocking. "
good,"My store 7326 has poor management skills, they don't know how to communicate with other managers or associates. I wouldn't recommend my store to any of my friends."
good,"Can be a stressful job at times. Have to be able to adapt to change, team player, and willing to work all over the store. As a support manager, I really take on the role as an assistant. Majority of the associates depend on me more than higher management. I just enjoy the feeling of being appreciated but it can be something at times."
good,it is a great job to work for right out of high school not a career its okay job to work not as a career best job for second income not a career best work to get some side money not to have as a career
good,not good place to work. I unload truck and stock shelves and everyone that works there is rude and isn't nice and they don't fire people who try to fight u in back room.
good,Hard work but good job. Provides decent pay and decent hours. You take 3 breaks if you work a full 8 hour shift. Great opportunity to start a career. Good for customer service experience.
good,The Walmart I worked at was poorly managed. Everyone had complaints on the management. Scheduling was a mess. You couldn't get days off unless it was paid time off.
good,"The pay was fine and overall supervisors and employees were friendly but the way the store was managed was all over the place. They failed to take me off the schedule for the week of my vacation which they knew about and approved, even though I had informed 2 managers and the human resources person."
good,"overall not to bad a place to work, can be fun, can be busy, never a lack of things to do, managers can be a pain sometimes. benefits are good but the pay is not very good"
good,This Company was an Ok company to work for. Pay was decent. Managers were not respectful and did not follow workplace etiquette.  Favoritism was shown among employees. The most enjoyable part of working there was getting to know your customers and working with some of your co-workers.
good,"Unloading trucks and putting stock away on shelves, always keeping busy and makes the shift go by quickly. Help customers when they are inquiring for certain stock."
good,If you have tough skin is good for you customer and management can be very rude. I've been here for a long time because of the job security. But it keeps getting worse by the minute.
good,I enjoyed working with the public to find what product they need in the store. The learning of different departments and what was being sold in the other departments.
good,Do not work for walmart its not worth the time and bs you end up dealing with find something worth your time and energy not this garbage hole of a company
good,"Walmart allowed me to work part time which is what I was looking for. I took maternity leave and they were able to hold my job for me, after 12 weeks."
good,"Walmart is a ok company to work for. Its not a bad company but its not a great one either. The work life balance is terrible....many long hours and rarely time to enjoy your off days. One good thing there pay is competitive and has good 401k plan . Also , other benefits like health , dental , and vision is available. Vacation time , paid holidays , and paid personal days you accumulate is a plus."
good,"Very demanding work with fear of being caught doing something wrong. Supervisor extremely nice and flexible. Management needs to lighten up and communicate more with employees. But, it could be a fun place to work under different circumstances"
good,"Empresa agradável de se trabalhar,produtiva e desempenhada"
good,I worked overnight so a lot of times you would be by yourself!!I thought that they provided an equal opportunity for the staff and a very professional environment.
good,"The working experience for Walmart was/is productive depending on how one views opportunity for simplify and improve given tasks.  If you take the initiative to ""Improve / Simplify"" core tasks and focus on customer driven opportunities, then Walmart will be fun.  Likewise, if you go just for the paycheck, you will receive only what one puts into the assigned tasks."
good,"I worked in a certain department and was able to cover for others, when needed I had to cover for 3/4 different departments, got called a lot to ring register and then asked why I didn't do my job in my own department."
good,"Great benefits, family orientated there is always room for improvement co workers are very helpful and willing to help when help is needed great company to work for"
good,"It's pretty steady, I learned multitasking really well. Management is poor, the csm doesn't know what she's doing. The hardest part of the job is trying to stay busy because it gets slow a lot and there is nothing to do. I love working at Walmart because of the customers I've met and help ."
good,"Typical day at work was answering main phones while simultaneously assisting customers with fitting room apparel. The doors to the fitting room are kept locked so it is a challenge with only one person assigned to the area.  - Also, that is the hardest part of the job."
good,"Hot summer days working constantly outside pushing carts, or very cold days in the winter. The hours were terrible, they dont give you very many, and no paid vacation."
good,"I worked in tle.it was hot they did not pay enough,kept changing managers.Wal mart has a lot of things in its stores.you have groceries,clothes,toys tires,a lot of things.the stores are big and their products are cheap, because they buy everything from china"
good,I didn't appreciate the fact that they hire part-time 90% of the time so they don't have to pay for healthcare and benefits. Its very difficult to live off a part-time and be making close to minimum wage.
good,"It's an easy job, and most of your fellow associates are likable people. Management is hit or miss, and can cause stress if they are unsure of what they're doing."
good,"Good place to work.  I am self motivated which pays off here.  Stay busy and meet your work quotas, and the management won't have any issues.  Be sure to maintain pace or they will get rid of you"
good,Good place to work. Easy going managers. Flexible hours. Great company to be a part of. Fast paced. The coworkers were great friendly and didn't hesitate to help you out.
good,"Walmart is a fast paced company.  Starting pay is reasonable but in order to make a decent living, an employee has to work in management.  Management positions require a lot of time away from home.  In order to compete in the retail industry, Walmart will cut work hours and there is no option for overtime."
good,I enjoyed the fast pace. The front end managers were excellent and great to work with. The diversity of my co-workers is part of what made the job fun.
good,"nice place to work. customers very friendly. employees have terrible attitudes sometimes but generally very nice. management could use lots of work, not very understanding."
good,If you work hard they will keep you in your same area and not move you anywhere else. just because you do that good so they dont want you in a different area.
good,"Nice place to work, good place to build a career. Get paid every two weeks. different shifts to work. work 40 hrs. a week. paid vacations and sick pay."
good,Walmart pays no overtime but expects you to work over and then get off the clock at end of week.They will write you up if you get overtime.The new management refused to give me any help as I ran groceries all by myself.I am a very hard worker and I like being busy so I liked it being fast paced.I made mistake trying to fix my time so I didnt have overtime.Should have handled differently.If they have good management not to shabby of a job.
good,"I went to work and help customers all day. It was fun and social and i enjoyed meeting new people, coworkers and customers alike. I also enjoyed the moving of merchandise"
good,"push cart"
good,"Could be better."
good,"Lots of hours with very little pay, hard company to work for. You are hired for one job and end up doing most things in the store without the pay including management jobs."
good,"Walmart has great benefits, that's why I'm still there. Management does little to help or provide help. They often expect you to do more than one person can do. The upper management lies and throws lower management under the bus. It's a job though I'm glad I have one."
good,"It was okay, management could be better and with better scheduling. Overall, it is not a bad job and it should be easier to bump up positions. They have great benefits."
good,My opinion is a big pens on what Walmart store you work at to what kind of treatment you get each one is so different in management. In my opinion the Fairfield Walmart store manager does not care about us Associates that much I would recommend working at other Walmarts but the one in Fairfield
good,"At the store level, any time you are called in to over ride an associate following company policy, make sure that you first make it clear to the associate and customer that they were doing their job and that you are making an exception."
good,That it is a place that manager like to micro manager which can be annoying at times and force you to do thing in there particular view which you might not agree with.
good,"learn how to work with big printer machines and how to be organised, also learned how to maintain the printers and teach the customer how to print properly"
good,fast paced and energetic work environment. Management is always willing to listen to ideas and suggestions to better the work environment or to settle any issues or problems.
good,this was an okay place to work...breaks were decent...management were more about favoritism....benefits not that good...works with schedule sometimes..
good,not a bad place to work they have health benefits and time off if this is your first job its not a bad one at  all you could find a home a good place to build
good,"Come into work and do oil changes or tire work. Deal with customers to satisfy their needs, and do the best I can with the knowledge I have. Management could do better and other co workers could do better."
good,Busy fast paced. Good beginner job. Plenty of opportunities to advance or receive a position you might prefer. Overall not a bad place to work. Bette than having no job at all.
good,"Working at Walmart is like a typical job. Retail, busy, lots of people. There is always something to do on your work days. There isn't much down time which makes time go by faster"
good,"Walmart is a great place to work if you are looking to work a job that you don't take home with you. "
good,"Rotación en tres turnos, salario bajo, buen ambiente de trabajo en general.."
good,"I've been with the company for a while, and over the time I've seen things come and go, expect change and daily. Management may change what is allowed one day to the next."
good,"Walmart pharmacy covers all bases in retail pharmacy. You get exposed to several different scenarios and situations regarding pharmacy.  Company covers almost all prescription insurance, which benefits the technician in becoming well versed in insurance specifics."
good,"Working at Walmart as a courtesy associate is stressful. People hardly took an interest in my job, and we were always at ""The bottom of the pole"". Our job was unimportant to some but to others the courtesy associate role was the backbone of the store. Who else would go outside to push carts? It'd be easier with a mule, a machine that helps push the carts, but ours have been broken for a long time, years apparently."
good,"My typical day at work at Walmart was always hectic and busy. I was always giving 100% to my department regarding my work. The workplace was difficult in terms of coworkers always showing up to work late, or not showing up at all and if they were there they would hardly help out. I was pregnant and lifting heavy equipment because i'm at work, actually work. Hardly anything was done about this situation i was almost to have my baby and decided to take care of my two kids and enrolled in school to pursue a better career."
good,I would just sit there at my register and check people out all day long. some times i was boring some times it was not. depended on what crazy people came in that day
good,"I loved working at Walmart despite the cliched cons. My teammates were engaged and interested in helping each other out, whether on the floor or between friends. Management was often inexperienced and overly idealistic as a result of quick turnover, and as a supervisor that could make things a bit stressful, but there was always something to be done to feel productive and successful. I was in an excellent store as well, and the customers were, by and large, pleasant."
good,"fast paced "
good,They Need to be m equal when it come to employees. They have a good system . They good go better with the lines at Walmart . Everything is okay other than that .
good,"Walmart is a great place to start your career of working.  With a multi cultural work place, you have many challenges and achievements.  "
good,"This was great first time job! I started right out of high school. It was a great learning experience! "
good,"The people are friendly but the management is terrible, they dont balance work and life very will so you have horriable hours and minimum wage pay even as a full time employ i was only getting 28 hours a week on average"
good,I was able to use some of my schooling in this job.  I was able to advance with this company and learned a lot to do with the money side of a business.
good,It was great working at Walmart. The job was easy but when it came to extra work that was a problem. Other departments would fall behind and my department had to pick up after their slack. We would have to finish our duty for the day as quick as possible then go on to another department that was behind. I dont think it was right that we would have to do other departments work.
good,"not a bad place to work, as long as you don't try for overtime. They give you good hours but demand you take longer lunches and breaks if there is a mandatory meeting so they don't need to pay you to be there but it still looks like they did.  Their disability program only works with you if it's an obvious disability or you have been with the company long enough to qualify for it. You have to work for them for at least 2 years to qualify.  All in all its not a bad work experience, but their policies need some work."
good,Walmart is a mess with very few organized areas. Depends on which management you are dealing with is how you determine if what you need to be done is done.
good,Organization and Management exceptional. Security and Loss Prevention policies lacking. Public Relations and Customer Service both excellent. Friendly and helpful staff and co-workers.
good,walmart need to pay their associates more money for the work that expect them to do. they also ned to hire more people to take care of customers needs.
good,"Walmart is an easy going place, even better if you have great social skills. You meet new people everyday, develop friendships with co workers and sometimes even customers."
good,I started off loving my job. I always loved the people I worked with. As the years went I got really bored with my job and it became very unsatisfying.
good,Working here was extremely fun and fast paced. The tempo of the business was very upbeat. I had to be on my feet and moving mpst of my shift. I enjoyed it because it helped pass the time no matter how long the shift. I'd recommend this job for energetic individuals.
good,wal mart was cool because it worked with my schedule. but at times it was hard on my body. the management at walmart was ok they understood the needs and concerns of the employees
good,"wal-mart is a nice place to work if you are looking to work only part time.managers are nice,friendly workers.willing to help you as soon as you walk in the door."
good,Walmart is a even pased work enviorment..the coworkers were nice to work around..management at the particular walmart I worked at didnt care for their employees much but I still liked my job
good,el equpo de trabajo era bueno mas cuando todos cooperaban
good,Nothing to say very stressfullsnd leaders push their stress down to you. Trying to do too many things at once need ability to hire what we needed to do the work load
good,"ok job, not much for promotions.. I have a Bachelors degree, yet did not matter.  I would have liked o proceed in management with Wal Mart, however, it did not happen..."
good,The job would've been better if they actually went by my school schedule instead of me always having to get on them about fixing my schedule. They would still constantly schedule me to work over my classes.
good,"Depends on the location. This particular location is newly renovated since 2014. Multiple positions cashier, sales floor associate, cart pusher, department associates, etc."
good,During this time I worked as a shipping receiver and stock person.  Was very physical job.  Benefits in this company were very good.  You can advance in this company depending your what you want out of this company.
good,Walmart is a good company to work for. It has some flaws but so does other co.Panines. Just depends on what your lookk g for. The pay isnt that good but other than that its grest.
good,"I enjoy working here because the associates are great and they work safely, keeping other's in mind.  It is clean and friendly. Everyone helps each other"
good,"Very fast past job at times, will need to be able to lift at least 50lbs and be very customer friendly. Must be able to get along working with others in groups."
good,great starter job with ability to move up. hours were very flexible. easy to move between departments. transferring from store to warehouse slightly difficult
good,"Busy only 4 cashiers worked at night, we did back stock as well as cash people out, management was ok the workplace was fast moving.  I met new poeple."
good,Great workplace with great associates. I enjoyed working at Walmart. Very organized with management. I learned how to become a better person and better worker from Walmart.
good,I was employed by Walmart for many years. There were many different jobs that  performed during my time there. My last position there was a cashier on third shift.
good,Can be a great career but needs structure. Most managers do not work as a team. Lacks communication between areas so confusion is high. No-one wants to take responsibility for actions. Easier to point fingers due to their own career advancement.
good,i made sure the lot had no carts and that the customers always had carts to get to. i kept the cash register stocked with bags and kept the front end clean
good,"Full charge processing of all accounts receivable and payables, manage all petty cash and office supply expenxe accounts and establish customer credit lines and set up credit accounts with vendors."
good,"Not so flexible, not very supportive with needing time off or if you have to miss work for an illness to yourself or others.  It is very easy work though"
good,"Management was great and family oriented. Schedules were always posted on time. Overall I had a good experience working for Walmart and would recommend it,"
good,I loved working for Walmart the only thing I don't like about them is they don't offer full time and no benefits other then that I loved the environment
good,Over night stocker. Stocked Cleaned and maintained Made sure the job was prepared and ready for opening for the next business day. Prepared shelves for display..
good,I supervise 54 employees. I make sure their breaks and lunches are taken on time. I audit their tills through out the day. Making sure customers are happy and satisfied while still following company policy is a big part of my job. I am also responsible for putting out tills and pulling them for the day. Making sure customer service and money center run smoothly.
good,great company if you are willing to work 60 hours a week and willing to relocate across the country on the drop of a dime. Other wise you will just hate life.
good,"My review on Walmart, as a ex employee is average very casual, in my humble opinion the schedule (work times) could change to make things flow easier!!"
good,"When I was starting out in the work-force, I chose Walmart. They are are always looking for reliable, hardworking associates, and that was what I was around when I was hired on."
good,"I recently put my two weeks in at the Walmart I was currently at. It wasn't the people I worked with except for a few that had it out for people in management, and I disagreed with that, hence why I left for my own good."
good,Decent company can easily move up lot of work company expects a lot but doesn't properly compensate for it work life balance in management is non existent
good,Es un empleo sobre trabajo pesado no opstante es muy difícil desarrollarlo
good,Managers at Wal-Mart will be fighting against me 24/7. I work in the auto care center everything there is awesome the managers are good and I have nice co-workers. I get the worst customers who want to tell me off and start arguments and I just have to stay calm no matter what and sometimes let someone else handle a customer. The #1 problem is when it gets close to closing time I have to make a choice between writing vehicles up until close and let the techs get overtime and later get in trouble for having overtime or turn people away and get in trouble myself.
good,For the most for Walmart is a great place to work. There are times where the job can get a little stressful and you feel like you do to much work for not enough money but overall it's a great starting place
good,"Aprendi a manejar dinero, tratar a la gente, vender, etc, mis compañeros fueron muy amables en todo tiempo, lo mas dificil son los horarios intermedios y cierres."
good,"lots of different hours to work . The store was a 24 hour store, a lot of displays changing, lot of associates complaining about work load, never enough help"
good,"arrive at work from sapmson community college,which happen to 30-45 minutes early. "
good,"not a equal playing job, they are mean to their employees, horrible hour, pay was horrible for the amount of work you did. when you call off for a emergency they frown apron that"
good,It is not to bad it has its ups and downs but amazing people to work with that can help you with your job and it is a pretty good starting job and if you like working on your feet all day
good,I met  a  lot  of  nice  people  there.  And  the  managers  were  nice  too.  I  learned  to  work  in  team and  have  care  for  others. When I just to work there I learned how to perform the duress all around the store
good,a typical day at work would be watching customers to make sure they don't steal or run off with product. i loved it because they worked with my school schedule.
good,Great people and good management to work for over all. The abilities to move throughout the store to help in different departments helped to keep the job interesting. Will to help with issues with medical conditions.
good,It was great until they got a new leadership in my team. The outsourcing and re-badging needs to stop. The work environment got way too stressful beginning of July 2017 and the future of the team appears uncertain.
good,Unsupportive managers and coworkers. No reasonable amount of sickdays.Customers are allowed to treat you horribly and you are unable to defend yourself.Even if the manager sees the customer using foul language at you and pushing you around they encourage the customer saying they are right and automatically assume it is the employees fault. Forced to work overtime even when it is your time to clock out.extremely disorganized schedule making and managers are very rude and biased.
good,People there are great. They do however fire you after the holidays for any infraction because they over hire then they have to get rid of associates after their busy season which is what happened when my son worked for them. They were great to my dad who was a door greeter for a long time. They need more benefits for their associates.
good,stressful everyday. when you needed something the supervisers or magagers were nowhere to be found. the lines would get out of hand because the shift supervisors wold not open enough registers.
good,"The managers at this job take pride in their work, and are very tentative to their customers and workers. They are on top of when breaks need to be taken, and always make sure things are running smoothly."
good,l'aspect difficile au travailler il y a beaucoup de travail pour une seule personne mais le gérant ne fait rien
good,"In my typical day since I work mainly on the front end, I see all types of customers and situations happen. We receive all types of customers and complaints. I've learned how fast paced it can be. We can go from no lines to every register needing to be opened in five minutes or less. Management depends on who is the manager that day. We have no assistant on the front end so it's all up to the computer and store manager and the store manager makes the final decision and the final decision is usually the wrong one. The hardest part of the job is when we have customers who want to be mean or difficult and rude for no reason because they're just in a mood or because we don't do what they want. It's hard because some people are just so horrible and we have to sit there and take it. They enjoyable day is when I get to the point to see my friends and good customers."
good,a very decent entry level job for someone willing and motivated to do fast paced work.  the management isn't the best in the world but it is a fairly good job.
good,Management is usually really busy so you have to chase after them to get things done. Typically there are a lot of people always in the store unless they are not 24 hours so it will be stressful and people will be in bad moods.
good,Walmart is a great place to shop and meet new exciting people. The location I worked at people where friendly and nice as well as staff members.I worked as a cashier and in the bakery and I enjoyed making all types of cakes.
good,"Management found it hard to keep good employees, however, employees made it difficult to function without a gang mentality against new co-workers. Some good management tools, but mostly even management treated everyone as if they were high school delinquents. Guilty until proven innocent."
good,"On your feet all day."
good,It was a pleasant experience overall while working here. Management and Co-workers are extremely friendly and they provide a good support group if any questions needed to be asked.
good,if you want a job to keep a check coming good place to work not many chances for moving up or raised lots of good people but usually none willing to help move up
good,"The people at Walmart were varied, with some colleagues being great mentors and friends. Management needed more communication skills with workers when responsibilities changed. Overall, it was an okay work environment, with room for improvement."
good,"Nice and safe place to work, its all indoors. I got to learn about different departments and the products. The management was very efficient. The work culture was good. I felt that the physical exertion was way too high. I learned so much about different products and departments. They offer medical insurance, assist in schooling, bonuses etc."
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart. Everyday it was something new with customers and coworkers. Walmart made me learn to think outside of the box for projects and planning. I also enjoyed managing tasks and associates, having the responsibility of not only myself but other people is something that keeps me motivated. Sometimes it was ruff when we were understaffed but it taught me to work with what i have and delegate tasks."
good,Cashiering is a starter job.  Not a career.  Rude customers make the job miserable.  Regular breaks and a discount on some items make it more bearable.
good,Walmart was my 1st retail job. I learned the majority of my retail experience from them. I had great mentors who taught me the right way. Those mentors made me the manager I am today.
good,It's be of the best jobs there is out there. I enjoyed working with each guest that worked through those automatic doors. Some times it was even sad to see them leave. I enjoy every moment their.
good,Fast paced. Sometimes streamlined to a fault and big problems not being corected can give way to small problems growing instead. Not the worst place  Just far too sedentary for me.
good,"Lots of notes to be done."
good,"I think that Walmart is a job for teenagers or someone who is retired. They don't hold associates accountable for their actions sometimes. I've experienced great people and customers as well as the bad employees and not so great customers. It sometimes becomes stressful because you are passionate about your job, but not when people don't treat you well"
good,Our managers are pretty cool for the most part. A regular shift consist of a meeting at the beginning where we end with a chant. The rest of the shift is spent with us stocking the store until it's time to prepare the store for the opening shift
good,No dan posibilidades de progreso de acuerdo a tu desempeñó
good,I really like working for this company its the pay that upsets me. I worth more than what I'm receiving. I'm very experienced in the department that I'm currently in
good,"Everybody knows how Walmart is. They try to save money by not having so many people on registers. The way the public sees, it is what you see. But we as employees will work and try our best to make sure the customers are taken care of."
good,Opportunitys to easily build a career are always coming up. Deep team involvement and communication is key. Over all the culture is customer driven and easy to become engaged with.
good,"Advancement opportunities, great at developing skills, great place to learn a skill and grow your resume, or grow with the company."
good,My typical day can be very busy at times I have to keep up with everything especially with the restrooms and spills and making sure you respond to page's at a fast paste. I have learned how important it is to have a clean and safe environment for customers and workers it is important for the customer to have a great experience and make them wanna come back. The hardest thing about my job is dealing with angry customers but over the years I've learned to stay clam try to help the customer as much as I can and be personal at all times. The best part of my job is helping customers I love helping them find things that need and making sure they have a great shopping experience.
good,"This was a great start of my work experience. I had to push the carts in extremely hot weather with minimum break time. Although that sounds a bit strict , I enjoyed it because of it made me realize fast that working a job isn't easy and we need to expect to work extremely hard when we get a new job."
good,Was able to interact with a lot of people.  Was able to learn great methods of customer service and excellent people skills. Great job to grow and experience great coworkers
good,Wal-Mart is a fun place to work. It's a easy going job. Friendly staff. Never a dull day at work. Decent pay. You can learn a lot of job skills a long with a lot about your self.
good,"Its a great job to begin with, and with enough pushing you can advance pretty easily. However staying there is not really beneficial, unless you begin the climb to store manager."
good,It's not the best place to work at. You don't get the respect or courtesy from the supervisors or some of the customers that you provide for them. If you love working in a fast- paced environment than this is the place for you.
good,"One of the highest paying truck driving jobs that are available on the market. Good Pay per mile and paid vacation time is always a plus,"
good,A place where most of the employees do not enjoy their jobs and that is easy shown through their attitude and work ethic. Remaining at this location gives you many opportunities to move up and improve your pay.
good,Its a horrible to work for the management team is rude. Some of the other employees is rude or just quite. No one is full time except csm and the pay sucks.
good,"My work experience with fellow associates was good. I just faced problems with my former manager because he was discriminatory, which made making my schedule difficult at times."
good,"The hardest part of working at Walmart was the cumbersome scheduling system. By the time I figured it out I already had a point against me. I enjoyed being cart-associate, I felt myself getting stronger every day, and I enjoyed the customer service aspect of the job."
good,Very fast paced with a heavy work load. You must be able to keep up and show up for work. Absences are tolerated but only to a certain extent. You will be fired if you call out too much.
good,"- great company to be employed by"
good,"Walmart Is A fair company to work for ... Walmart provides You opportunities to move up in the company allow you to try new position to see what's best for you . Walmart is every good With scheduling , Walmart base they schedule around the times you are available."
good,It is not possible to work here unless you adapt to the needs of the business and are open minded toward change. Every facility is different. Every management team is different.
good,"schedules are given two weeks in advance and given a point system for attendance."
good,"Keeps you busy and the day goes by quickly, management usually isn't very helpful or concerned with personal problems. Customers are awful. Basic retail experience."
good,A steady paced work environment with good people as associates and customers. The management I had were fair and cared about the employees as people. It is also a very diverse ethnical work place.
good,"But whether it is for you depends on how you value yourself at this point in your life.  The place I worked at seemed to seek out flaws, seemingly under the guise of improving, but more it appeared to control your path.  Making it past the six month period will be a major achievement.  Several there liked it.  Many more did not while I was there."
good,Work was always very hectic.I learned how to use my customer services skills fluently and how to solve situations without inconveniencing the customer.the most Enjoyable part of my job was going home every night knowing I proudly helped over hundreds of  people a day succeed their shopping obstacle.
good,Every morning. I walk in my job and clock in to the computer. I report to my area and complete my regular routine. I print my paperwork. Review the number of sales we made as a whole store. At the end of the day I wrap up and clock out.
good,La empresa me dio mucho aprendizaje pero sus políticas y su trato con los empleados deja mucho que desear
good,"From start to finish I answer questions, do returns, bill pay, wire money, answer the phone and clean my area. Cleaning up the area where the Customers can see is easy and fast, on the other hand the back area that holds the returns is always full, but I find enjoyment in sorting and cleaning it up when I can."
good,"I loved working at Wal-Mart, I liked helping other people Wal-Mart it's a place to learn customer service especially has a cashier lived checking people out."
good,I enjoyed going to work there cause it was cool in the summer and warm in the winter! Sometimes customers would get angry but other than that a decent place to work! All my management team were nice and helpful
good,Walmart was a very stressful place to work; the managers were unprofessional and would tend to let personal feelings hinder making important decisions.
good,Is a fast work place where we pick product off the self place on pallet as we order fill. But the hardest part is to keep your production up and the manager are ok
good,Empresa Mexicana parte del grupo ADO que tenía procesos administrativos muy largos.
good,"My favorite part of the day was working with my field associates.  I enjoyed the managers, clerks, and human resource managers and clerks I worked with out in the field."
good,"Typical work day there is hectic and random.You tend to learn on your own or by co-workers because some Csm's were never around when needed. The hardest part for me was having to explain to a customer about something I needed the Manager for and can't do it until they got there[key turn,price over ride, sale approval] some were nice and some were not happy.The best part was meeting new people and babies every day and making someone's day just by talking."
good,"The pay was good ,but the job was not worth the pay sometimes. There were several occasions when my schedule was changed last minute and I was not informed."
good,"Cashier, Customer Service, Deposits, Load Groceries, Operator, Self Check, Price Match, Cleaning Register, Money Center.. The hardest thing to do work is carry merchandice"
good,"Primary Responsibilities: "
good,The people I worked with were good. The management however seemed to not care. Most issues were brushed off and even with the open door policy Walmart pushes there were consistently issues that were not being heard.
good,i didn't like to work there thts why I quit so early they don't respect the associate selfrespect they just use them and try to put extra burdone associate are not coprative in delta Walmart  they put there duties to other new commers
good,Very strick place to work.  Great place to work if follow the rules.  Infraction of the rules will not be tolerated.  There is no forgiveness and or second chances.
good,"Being a cashier at such a popular store has its pros and cons. It can get very busy on the weekends and holidays. The only holiday you get off is Christmas, so you can't spend it with your family."
good,Didnt really enjoy it at all. A lot of walking around and the customers really did a lot of exsesive things. Job wasnt really hads on I love to work wit my hands.
good,"While Walmart is a very competitive company I do believe they can afford every employee at least 12 dollars an hr for me they couldn't accommodate the rate of pay I should be at which is 32,000-150,000 with all of the work experience and education that I possess other than that really great place too work"
good,"You work your area and are always ask to pick up other people slack in there areas so it is hard to keep a positive attitude  sometimes."
good,"worked graveyard.  stocked merchandise on shelves, unloaded trucks, cleaned shelves. great crew to work with. boss was great until he left and new one came."
good,"Decent job with plenty advancement opportunities. If you're a very hard worker be prepared to be taken advantage of by management and co-workers alike. You need to be strong minded, keep your cool and do your job. Management was for the most part terrible, as it is at most places these days. You either try to become their friend or they will walk all over you."
good,"good job, but they take away your help. So nothing gets done after your shift. Management expects it done when u get ontop of what you have to do for that day."
good,Walmart is a fast paced environment that provides several services to our customers and associates. The insurances provided by Walmart in my opinion are good. One of the downfalls is that the scheduling doesn't allow much time between work and family.
good,You keep busy on a daily basis there is always something to do. You meet a lot of new people that are associates and many customers. Advancement takes determination and is rewarding
good,Many of the people there are older and they dont care about drama. Its a pretty good place to work for just out of high school. But they dont seem to work with schedules very well.
good,"I takes allot of energy to work at Walmart. Working at Walmart at night gets paid 50 cents more than dayshirft, but it takes lots of energy. It can be a fun place to work if you can do your job right!"
good,"Working for Walmart is not all that bad.  The people I work with are great, they have become friends outside of work and most of the managers are really nice and understand that life happens."
good,Walmart oil change and tire position was a learning lesson to me. It aloud me to learn more about vehicle while doing maintenance to vehicles at the same time.
good,typical day there was ok because its always a cart to collected and you always help people which i enjoyed doing and the the thing i learned there was how to really be helpful as i could be
good,"What you'd typically except from working as a cashier at a store. The management doesn't really care much for you on a personal basis, you're rather replaceable so it doesn't really matter if you decide to spend time personally getting to know anybody. Just be able to scan more than 1000 items per minute, always show up, clean and with whatever smile on your face you can muster, and your day will be over before you know it. I didn't really learn much there, to be honest. I already was fairly decent with people and cash management, and scanning items faster isn't exactly something I could say I learned from them. It was all just stuff that I learned personally, but you could say my skills developed through the sheer practice of it. The hardest part about the job was dealing with the management, as they aren't really the best of people. If I had to pick something I enjoyed about the job, I supposed it was working with some of my coworkers. They made the job a bit more tolerable."
good,"I was trained in several areas of the store but not paid for all they had me doing from a cashier, to floor associate, to layaway, to photo tech.They just keep taking from you and taking but not caring about their employees"
good,Se llevaba una cultura de respeto y responsabilidad además de que es una empresa que trata de apoyar a sus asociados en lo que necesitan.
good,The mangers only care for themselves. Good luck getting your schedule changed or putting in time off. Mangers come in late and never get in trouble. They leave you to do work by yourselves. They care nothing about your opinion. They bend the rules as they want. Horrible experience
good,I would recommend Wal-Mart as a place to work. They were very good to me. My store manager was excellent. She took the time to get to know her employees. She wanted everyone to succeed. She watched her employees and knew who was capable to advancement. That is missed alot these days.
good,This job helped me to learn how to better communicate and work with others. I also got to learn how to communicate with people with different backgrounds.
good,"Good place to start a first job to put on a resume, if you're younger I wouldn't recommend staying here for longer then 3 years tops."
good,working at Walmart is quite an experience the people can tend to be rude sometimes fights would break loose. Then there were people who were completely opposite.
good,"I worked at Wal-Mart many years before leaving for a better paying job at a competitor."
good,"I worked for Walmart for 7 years.  The company in itself is a great company.  However, the in store ethics need some work.  I loved the job that I did everyday, which was claims and receiving.  I also cared for most of the people that I interacted with everyday.  I can say that I would not go back.  The standards for one and not another becomes a big issue.  They do not treat you very well as a person."
good,"Open or close a cash register, assist customers with their needs, clean and organize work area. Always being up beat and happy for the customers in the store."
good,walmart was my first job and i got paid well for a first job. they provide good benefits but not the best discount. Management at the walmart I worked at could be better and they also need to hire more people.they were also very strict on getting overtime we always ad to kill it on our lunches. But overall it is a good place to work at for someone to gain experience.
good,I have learned a lot about the drugs and their uses and misuses. It is sometimes hectic and always challenging. You need to learn to multi-task and be efficient all day. Accuracy and knowledge are the most important parts of pharmacy life. If you don't pay attention to details you could be hurting someone. I love problem solving insurance issues.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart because it was a fast paced environment and I had a chance to use my customer service skills. Walmart is a great place to work that focuses on teamwork and high company morale.
good,"There was never enough people on shift.  We worked short a lot and we're not a loud overtime at all.  If we did work any overtime, we would be written up."
good,Did remodeling to start off with. Really enjoyed that the whole three months we did it. Then got hired on full time. I had a hard time keeping up with people that had been there longer. We was all expected to work at the same pace. Was expected to do too much in too little time in order to do a good job.
good,Everyone that worked here was super friendly. The pay was decent and so were the hours. If you get robbed and your the cashier who does then you will get fired.
good,Wal-Mart at that time was really flexible with students and offered a competitive wage.  The management was pretty terrible and spoke very rudely to it's employees. You definitely could see that they were moving away from how Sam Walton wanted his employees treated. Benefits were awesome and I really enjoyed my time there!
good,I enjoyed helping my customers but the company is just in for themselves not the customers or the employees and they cut your hours so you cannot afford to live
good,It was ok and  stressful at the same time but it's a good job to start for the  Time being. Walmart have good benefits &  health-insurance I would  recommend this job to a lot people.
good,"I learned a lot of skills working at Walmart. I was able to learn work ethic because it was my first job. Not only did was I a stock clerk at Walmart, but I also worked as a greeter and a cart pusher."
good,"Creo que es una empresa como la mayoría, responsable y trata de incrementar sus ventas."
good,"Fast paced and you can advance quickly, if your willing to work any day and any shift.  Good place for some one to start entry level job, and move to salary management."
good,Walmart is a great place to work. The benefits are awesome. The hours are great. Management suck. It's fast past. The time goes faster when u working.
good,"The company is a good place to work, but they do need to teach some of management on the benefits of showing their subordinates mutual respect. But on the other hand they have always been there for me when times were rough. I'll always be thankful..."
good,Not a bad place to work but scheduling and management is terrible. Takes forever to get a hold of a customer service manager and the scheduling manger cuts your hours without even telling you the reason.
good,Typical day would involve checking out customers and restocking items that customers did not want. There are never enough registers open for as busy as Walmart can be.
good,"Wal-Mart in Guntersville was one of the first super centers built back in the late 1990's. The back room was narrow and cluttered, and none of the customers did not want to shop there either."
good,"Being at Walmart taught me only so much in specific areas, and it was an okay job I loved the job wish I had more hours probably would have been there right now, but it's okay I'm going and lookin to forward to better my jobs."
good,"Empresa séria de se trabalhar, com pessoas capacitadas, remuneração regular, trata os clientes como prioridade e educação."
good,"As a security guard my main focus was making sure they were no wanderers that cam in after hours. I worked the night shift, at the time I worked mainly at their downtown location by the night clubs This company doesnt seem to value its employees. Most of the time I was dealing with drunk men and women."
good,I work 10 pm-7 am three days a week. i learned how to make subs and sandwiches. Mangers don't act like mangers. Its slow. only working because of pay.
good,The work was a good way to lose weight and keep your focus trying to safely unload a hot truck full of items that had been sitting all day but each position has its own issues everyone is different.
good,Walmart is a great place to work for.  It gave me an opportunity to lean more about the company and there process.  I just wanted more hours and a better chance for advancement opportunity.
good,"Clean bathroom on routine schedule, clean up hazardous waste spills, maintain the floors and clean the bottle return room and machines. Cart Collector- Responsible for collecting the carts and maintaining the appearance of the parking lot"
good,Working at Walmart no one feels like its a great job. I actually had a good time and though the pay is messed up concidering they hired me for $7.50 and hired a kid younger than me with no job experience for $9 6 months after me that I was training. Don't waist your time with a company that doesn't value you.
good,this was for a internship but when I was there they didn't even have sharp containers to put needles after use they threw in a empty draw and cleaned out later. I would not recommend this unsafe environment for anyone.
good,"I worked with some of the most rudest people there. Unprofessional, lazy and unfair. I will never go back there. a lot of people would show up late for there shifts and I'd have extra work on my hands."
good,"A large company and see customers on a constant basis, good to be helpful in giving directions, The most enjoyable part was getting to see new items arrive for different occasions such as Christmas/Back to School, etc."
good,"I love the department I am currently in, but it took me quite a long time to get here. Customers are rowdy, which I can handle, but considering how busy my department gets and management scheduling me to either close alone or with only one other person it does not go as smoothly as I'd like it to because customers demand immediate attention and get upset when they can't get it since I'm only able to help one at a time."
good,Walmart is a good employeer.  They provide many jobs where you can advance.  It can be a hard job at times but can be rewarding.  Somtimes the politics of the job are hard to deal with.  The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting many different types of people.Pay is good
good,"Typically, I would keep my designated area clean and worked with lots of customers. I learned not to let myself get overwhelmed with the work load. Management could have been better, there was a lot of misinformation. It is up to the associate to complete tasks by the end of the shift, team work was encouraged. The hardest part of the job was learning that you cant make every customer that walks in the door happy. This was difficult for me to learn because good customer services is so important. The most enjoyable part was making new friends."
good,Good place to work just had another opportunity come my way and had to make a choice i had a good time there and the people that worked there were very nice and welcoming but chose different job.
good,"typical day was keeping your department together you whole shift, but if you worked evenings you end of staying 2 or 3 hour after the store closed, because you had to go help people that didn't keep there department together, some of management was not a team player, the hardest part was putting the store together, most enjoyable part was, when I left there."
good,Wal-Mart was not so much of a job for me. I love multi tasking and Wal-Mart was just too slow for me. After unloading the freight we would get all jobs done than have to figure out what to do in the meantime while we wait till more work come for us to do
good,"busy environment....can be frustrating at times when things are not in place as should be and employees and managers are not doing what is expected. You have to learn fast, work hard and smart."
good,Walmart is a fast pace workplace. Walmart has allowed me to learn more than one task and work with so many associates. Thanks to it I've learned a lot.
good,"Walmart is a fast pace workplace, but they never had enough people and they can never give you enough hours. With due aside, its a good learning experience."
good,Working at Walmart wasn't that bad. But in everything i do i give my best. It was something that i did while in school that fit my schedule. It would most definitely be something to fall back on.
good,My tips are really dont let anything outside of work interfere when you are at work. Try your best to put a smile on your face . Always help the costumer when needed
good,"It was very fast paced, the managers don't care about you, but all they make sure is that you are working, the management sucks, all of the managers are very rude and mean,I had more nice customers than the management there, the only positive thing is the benefits, Great benefits and that's it..."
good,"daily demands from district manager to do more with less.  being salary required working long hours with no incentive other than trying not to get fired.  Not near enough payroll to keep up such a large store.  Has continued to get worse over the years as sales have softened.  They are only looking for yes people.  Do exactly what they say when they say it.  Even if you have a better idea, keep it to yourself."
good,"Advancement opportunities, great at developing skills, great place to learn a skill and grow your resume, or grow with the company."
good,Long hours and in the frozen section. fast paced. I did lots of paper work and organized everything. Made sure orders went out correctly. All made time go fast.
good,"Management varies from person to person, most were nice, some were apathetic and others had no understanding of what the people they're in charge of are suppose to be doing. You will not advance here either. No matter what they tell you, it will take a while before you actually move some where you wanted. They accommodate the times you want to work very well so it is a job well suited for students or if you're in training for another job but they will never give you 40 hours."
good,Job requirements change with managers.  Most managers are easy to get along with and will help you on the way.  Medium paced work with emphasis on customer service.
good,"Loved this job, but they aren't very flexiable when you have children ( needed Saturday and sundays off) because daycare isn't open on those days and I couldn't have those days off so it made it very hard to work and find a babysitter for the weekend. Overall, I love the workplace and my coworkers."
good,stocking not really alot of work to do just make sure items are pulled forward ands that all the returns back on the shelf and make sure that there is nothing on the floors that is of danger to the customers
good,The job was very stressful and the customers were so unbearable. Management seemed to be missing when everything goes down. They rarely compliment workers on good jobs and just complain about what isn't being done.
good,for your workload extremely underpaid. i never worked in such a ghetto environment people and staff where horrible. so much mess and work is never done on time one of the worst walmarts ive been to
good,overall it was not to bad of a job it was about half as much money as I was used to getting though and for that reason I started to look for something else.
good,Coworkers and managers were really friendly and were always willing to led a helping hand for moving product to the shelves. If i ever needed assistance with a customer the managers were alwasy their to help.
good,"Your typical day depends on the area you are working in. I learned how to do a few different positions there. Some I enjoyed more than others. My experience is you never know what management will be like. The culture can be fun and inviting, but it can be super stressful. The hardest part of the job is the large turn over in employees."
good,"safety tours around the store, then hold a safety team meeting with the store managers and express the concerns that I seen through the store. Once the meeting is over I take tours around the tour trying to stop any theft I can find"
good,its usually busy early so you wont have to wait around for long a sometimes things get rough but you get through it as long as you take your time An work with the customers as best as you can An If they don’t seem satisfied a manager or someone will always be around to help
good,"Overall, walmart was not a bad place to work.  I had good days and bad days.  It all depended on the customers that I was working with that day.  The hardest part was when people got mad at me for following the rules when it came to processing returns."
good,"A typical day involves long boring hours of doing the same exact stuff everyday. The management want to keep us ""happy"" and ""friendly"" rather than allow us to get our work done. The hardest part of the day at Walmart is cleaning up the mistakes of other co-workers who could not do their job properly. The most enjoyable part of the day is when the work is finished. I've learned to tolerate people working at Walmart."
good,Sometimes disorganized and not prepared for the work day. A very fasted paced work environment and you need to be able to deal with sometimes stressful situations.
good,I walked a lot working at wal-mart.When you have cash registers all over the store and customers. You might as well wear comfortable shoes. I loved the walking part and talking to customers throughout the store. It made my job worth working there.
good,Empresa muy seria ambiente bueno para laborar decanso rolados
good,It was a okay place to work. just didn't appreciate working 40 hours for a period then getting cut down to 12 hours a week. other then hours . co workers were nice
good,"Working hard and helping customers/co-workers was a pleasure- but the way the store was run was miserable. Training and safety procedures were almost never adhered to... except right before an inspection.  And we almost never had the tools/equipment we needed. On a typical day, you could spend an hour running around trying to find them (uselessly)."
good,"It really depends on the store you are located in. The store I am in is in Bentonville AR so we have higher standards in comparison to other stores. I constantly have to deal with working with a crew that is half the size it needs to be. New hires last roughly 2-4 months before quitting or transferring because they hate the rush and being alone. Management refuses to hire more because we are over our hour capacity for a neighborhood market even though we are #1 in the region constantly, but they are fine giving out hours to anyone who wants it."
good,"The deli was always poorly stocked under old management. (It's new management now, so that might have changed). It could also be pretty dangerous because the blades get sharpened so much that they get too far away from the guard, so it is easy to slice your finger open."
good,"I dont like the fact that they try to underpay you by working you half crazy. The benefits can be better, however, its a nice package. Nothing bad to say."
good,Management was not consistent and a lot of favoritism .Hours were not evenly given out. hardest part of job was finding the supplies needed to do my job.
good,Great people to work for if you like warehouse work at very fast pace good pay  everyone is very friendly management is friendly also just show up on time
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for. It is also a company you can easily excel in, and is a great learning environment to move forward in positions."
good,"It was a great job at walmart, it had a great environment and all the other cashiers were great. I left walmart because the management was not great. They managers were rude, demanding, not caring at all, they yelled at workers and customers and i was not comfortablr getting yelled at all the time for nothing."
good,"I'm going to keep this one short."
good,"I worked at walmart in the TLE but when management shifted around we got a manager from customer service which did not know how to run the TLE department, we got overstocked and underemployed... I also got moved from TLE to upfront registers due to my code in the system so the manager didnt have to staff me... It was extremely unprofessional and the manager had ""personal vices"""
good,A Walmart job is what you make of it. It was a good place to start during college. Small town atmosphere means small town mentality and that can be tricky.
good,"mi jornada de trabajo comúnmente empezaba a las 6am y terminaba hasta no tener pendientes (10pm), tuve que aprender rápido por que me dejaron como encargado de área de logística menos de 3 meses, aprendí a planear arribos de trasportes de producto, cancelar producto que venia de mas de lo que se pide por parte de la gerencia, administrar los tiempos, y presupuesto trabajar bajo estrés, teníamos poco comunicación con mis colegas de otras áreas no porque yo tuviera esa actitud pero mi trabajo era tener controlado toda la mercancía y caducidades y se podía tener una mala comunicación de parte de ellos y prestarse a malos entendidos, lo que mas me gusto en lala fue conocer otro tipo de giro de empresas ya que no fuera de autoservicio, es un punto mas a mi favor ya que conocí el otro giro de negocio"
good,"I learned ordering procedures, importance of point of sale merchandise, and many more valuable tools during my employment with Wal-Mart. Co-workers were from many different walks of life. Fun and exciting."
good,"Overall fun working environment. I loved this job, being able to make the store look nice and also to be able to find the customers find things in the store!"
good,"At walmart I was a cashier initially. I then got promoted to pharmacy technician shortly after being hired. I loved my job. I inputted prescriptions, counted them out, did the drug order for the company and checked it in for them."
good,It was an okay job. But the managers wasn't so nice. They worry too much about the works then the employee. So it is very stressful. They need better management.
good,I didn't care much for the work environment no one seems to get in trouble for being lazy. We also never had enough people working to cover the whole day and many times I worked alone.
good,"We were always busy being a cashier, and if there was too many cashiers on the same shift we had to work around the store. It was always busy one way or another, but a great job opportunity."
good,"I would go back there, good enviroment I love meeting new people. managers are and co-workers are ok most are friendly and easy going. pay is nice and so are the benefits."
good,Its a good job. You can make some good friends The environment can become stressful at times and it does get busy. At times I feel csm should be there more often to help when we need them. Plus security should be there due to some customers being crazy.
good,"I like working here but sometimes it can get very annoying, they like to change your schedule without letting you know or they'll end up leaving you to be the only person on the sales floor which is not pleasant at all."
good,The hardest thing to deal with here is the management and the customers. Some managers just don't listen and others listen completely and care about everything. The pay is ok and the work is alright
good,"Walmart was a great place to work! However the workers at the time was not getting paid as much, there was also a lot of favoritism and not enough room for growth or opportunity."
good,My typical day at work was unloading trucks and stocking merchandise. I learned how to work the register one day when the store was really busy. The hardest part was when i had a certain time to finish a big task by myself with no help. I really enjoyed being on the register and interacting with customers.
good,As long the management know your skills and capabilities are they will place you to that situation BUT they will not give you the proper raise you deserve. Walmart stayed on 40 cent raise to everybody. It does not matter what are your skills are. Walmart avoids the chaos between employees why other employee got higher raise than other. So they stayed 40 cent on every employee.
good,This company does not treat its employees right. they pay minimum wage and overwork people  as slaves. That's the only company I worked for where I did not feel appreciated and respected.
good,Walmart is an open and friendly environment where you meet people from all walks of life. I enjoyed being a cashier there. It was easy going and relaxed.
good,"The benefits were great, bu the pay and work load were not proportionate to the salary and hours. Would have liked to have seen more growth opportunities."
good,"A very demanding workplace, can be stressfull at times. They will try and get all they can out of you, management is not that great. Pay not that great."
good,"When I started out I worked as an Asset Protection Associate, looking for those who are shoplifting within Walmart, then detaining them until the police arrive.  It is a lot of walking, someone had said that it was they had walked about 13 miles in a shift."
good,"Was a basic job. did a lot of stocking and facing. Quit there to following a career somewhere else. I work overnight, but still have a lot of customer service."
good,Fun seeing new people. Learning new things. Working with new people . Finding new friends.learning about the stock program.  Just over all leading new things and new ppl
good,I was worked hard at my overnight Wal-Mart shift. We were held to a tight schedule wherein each task is timed down to the minute. And after each task completed we had to go back to kiosks located in the departments to acknowledge that tasks were completed.
good,"Never a set schedule or position, but it is fast pace and easy. You can move up in the company if you do well and show leadership skills. You can openly talk with most management when you have a problem."
good,Company moral on a corporate level is different from a store level. Management was very understanding of problems and accommodated accordingly. Great work place.
good,"I worked at the service desk so my job was stressful.  I liked the long days, it wasn't so bad because of all the breaks you get.  There were staff party's and fun events that made the days amazing."
good,Ok at best . Read the cons section. At least I was employed for over 9 years and was able to learn and build my career.  Now I have to start  from the bottom
good,"nothing gets done when managers cant get off he chair and help when needed."
good,"It was easy going at times. Of course there was stressful moments. However, as long as you stayed focused and worked through the difficult moments, it was a breeze."
good,Lack of communication between management and employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was some of the other employees and constantly moving and doing things.
good,I loved running two depts all those years and gave up all of it to be a mom of two kids now. I was told no depts avail when left to have first child so knew could not stay there. Life changed and I do not regret my decisions.
good,I will always appreciate them for working around my school schedule but I still think they are a bad company. They do a lot of unethical stuff to keep you from getting health insurance
good,es una empresa ala cual se le aprende mucho el cual sabes como funcionan las cosas es de puertas abierta trabajar bajo presión y atender al cliente tal y como lo indica sus políticas que demanden.
good,"mi puesto era de administrativo en la farmacia, y la mayoria del tiempo ternia que estar acomodando producto en bodega y cambiar precios y estantes del departamento, no me daba tiempo de realizar las actividades para las cuales fui contratada"
good,"While I can be stressful sometimes, I enjoy working at Wal-Mart. The level of family togetherness and how everyone cares for you makes Walmart the perfect place to work"
good,The workplace is very busy. As a sales associate you have to learn to multitask. Customer service is an essential for communicating with customers. Everyone is always there to help.
good,"this particular walmart does not care about their empoyees. many of their staff have been here since hey first opened and are not given the chance to mve up. i persnally was given he chance to move to a diffrent position with a higher pay, only i was not given he pay but was expected to do the work."
good,Walmart was very busy especially around the holidays. You have to maintain a positive attitude are a customer will ruin your day. I've learned that it is ok to ask for help when needing it. Management and upper management is there to help if you're stuck in a situation out of the norm. hardest part of the job is pleasing a customer. I've learned even if your nice some people you just can't please. Your co workers can make a stressful situation joyable.
good,i think it a lot of good people in the work place but they need to be more organized. i loved working with a partner on a semi truck. i believe they could be cleaner that what they are.
good,"order dairy products to supply the demand for that Walmart location"
good,"A typical day at work was checking customer items out at the register, checking correct prices on items, inventory, stocking shelves, giving great customer services, and working with your peers when needed. I've learned how to work the register. Management was okay. Workplace culture was very diverse. The hardest part of the job was to keep your composure there were a lot of unpleasant customers. The best part of the job was working as a team to get the job done and the discounts were great."
good,Overwork and unappreciated I worked overnight as a stocker and was continuously on my knees.The hard part is trying to makr sur we work as a team if someone is overworked
good,"Too many levels to management it's almost impossible to get anything done, but the pay is good. Walmart has good benefits that go with the pay as well."
good,I enjoyed my experience in the Walmart family. The atmosphere and work conditions are are good and the various crew memebers make it an interesting but good enviroment.
good,scan items and receive several types of payment forms. Help customer's as needed.  Complete required computer based learning sessions on computer.  Help special needs customer's as requested
good,I pushed carts for 2 years I got employee of the month. If people didn't show up or called in I usually fill in for them when they were short-handed. Custodian work and unloading the truck. But my main is cart pushing.
good,"Walmart was okay to start as a new team member, a lot of opportunity to grow, okay  management directionyou'll have to run everything by every manager higher than your position and deal with criticism from other associates"
good,"As far as I can recall, it was an OK place to work. The bosses were sub-par, management was strict, enforcing time limits on how many pallets should be broken down within the hour."
good,"Quick paced and required good customer service, many opportunities for advancement as well as opportunities to learn. I did not enjoy the menial labor"
good,I like the interaction with the customers. I didn't like not having a set schedule and not knowing what hours i was going to be working. The pay was good.
good,Its wonderful to have a job like Walmarti will never forget this experience. Unfortunatly I won't be there any longer due to none personal issues. I feel like I've given this job my best
good,"Room for advancement with a leader in the industry.  Always opportunities to rise above others and stand out.  No appreciation of credit for monumental projects being completed.  The company culture is ""survival of the fittest"" or ""Execute or be executed"".  They want management that will put everything else on hold and be completely devoted to the business 24/7.  Does not matter if you are on an approved day off or vacation.  The only care is the company."
good,"computer based helping customers with refilling their medications. answer phone to assist customers, patient care and customer service. private desk setting"
good,Walmart gave really good raises and gave the opportunity to meet so many great people. One of the most enjoyable places I worked but definitely have to be flexible.
good,"Very busy, definitely keeps you going. There is a lot of managers...too many to keep up with actually. If you have anxiety I wouldn't suggest working here."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart sometimes the customers would be difficult but we also had nice customers also and they made my day I would work at walmart again if i had the chance
good,"though training was provide for each position, there was a lack when you  may needed extra help in dealing with unexpected experiences in dealing with customers"
good,"Always short handed people. Didn't get paid enough for what I had to go through. This was the only job were I've had people curse me out, throw things at me."
good,"Wal-mart was a boring place to work, customers treat you with disrespect a long with the managers. If you finished your tasks early you had to go do other peoples tasks and there was no appreciation for it, it was like you owed them to go above and beyond. So because of that everyone worked at a slow  pace just to finish their tasks in time to leave. Inventory is a joke, and it will NEVER be accurate because no one there really cares about the place or the people who work in it. its more of a stepping stone and not a career place."
good,"Gostei de trabalhar na empresa ,eles dão  todo o treinamento necessário  para ecersser a função"
good,Easy work environment but you work a lot of hours and don't get paid enough.  I work about 36 hours a week and make $9.00 and hour so when I get paid it's less then $500.
good,as an orderfiler it is very physically demanding. mentally there is not a lot of stress but you are timed and given a performance percentage each which can be stressful at times to meet.
good,"A constant worry of uncoordinated workers and supervisors."
good,"We started at 2:00 AM. "
good,"Walmart gave me my first tools in the car business, as well as customer service. A lot can be learned in this job and applied to future jobs, but vertical mobility and on job training is very much encouraged."
good,"Walmart DC is a one of a kind workplace. You arrive daily not knowing if that day will be your last and receive little help from management. The Walmart DC loses employees as fast as they replace them so their mindset is, everyone can be replaced. The only people who are remotely happy working at a DC are managers and higher ups."
good,"L'environnement est agréable pour exécuter un travail productif. De plus, les clients aussi sont agréables."
good,"I enjoy working at Walmart , all of us employees are so happy and enjoyable I wouldn't want to change anything ! Except management , they should be way better and organized with their store than they are."
good,At this company You are over worked and under paid. If you can't handle stress I would advice that you don't apply. Its hard enough dealing with rude customer but it's even harder working for this company.
good,"Positive associate to all other associates.  Self-motivated, good listener, and worked every day with the attitude of doing the best job that I could do for that day."
good,"Good place for a first job."
good,"What can i say about walmart, its a good job for stabilty. I would work there again for the fact that the jobs are straight forward and keep you busy."
good,was my first full time job and worked mainly nights and when was readt to work more days the CSM would not allow it so I left and went to work wlsewhere
good,I loved my job. It can be very fast paced. Hours of standing in one spot. They have favorites there. I wasn't one of them. Most days customers are very enjoyable. But when a complaint was made it took two weeks to before anything was said to me. Not sure what the delay was
good,"This job entailed me to be prompt on time, and dressed for my best. I handled customers questions or complaints, checked out their merchandise and ran check, credit and cash transactions. Cleaned up wet messes, comforted people when needed, assisted with their bags, and made friends along the way."
good,I enjoyed working there for the most part. I didn't like the fact that their full time hours was only 28 hours a week. I only worked 14 hours a week. They didn't have enough staff to cover the dept.
good,The money was nice but Walmart it's self was messy more people there to talk than to work your supervisor never have your back on anything even the supervisor would discuss your personal business ! It's like a big high school
good,"stay to yourself , do your job and mind you and yours no one is your friend , document every problem you have with workers or management with dates times places and who was around"
good,facilidad de subir de puesto y conocer sobre mas áreas dentro del Centro de distribucion
good,Una empresa donde puedes crcer siempre y cuando le eches ganas a tu trabajo
good,Wasn't bad as long as you stayed busy and had things to occupy your time. Management was changed twice while I was there and you didn't really see the higher levels but the shift leaders were patient and understanding with you.
good,"Wal-Mart is a good company to work for if you are matched with the right management team within the right store.  If the department and store is not a good fit, its a rough work environment.  Walmart also needs to watch the possibility of age discrimination that can be prevalent in some of the the associates within management."
good,"The work experience I had with Walmart was interesting to say the least. Sure, the hours felt long, but I did find satisfaction when I could find the right shirt or pants size or pointed them to the section they were looking for."
good,"Working here was fun because i got to meet new people as a cashier, and they worked around my hours that i needed. The managers were friendly but they did their jobs."
good,Very fast paced environment and stressful. Have to deal with rude customers and aren't rewarded for anything. Work during holidays and only gives option for a part-time job.
good,This company is a good company to start with especially when you young and need to have a stable job. I had nothing but an amazing experience with this company.
good,It needs more organization and better CSMs. It's a lot more that can be done. Managers need better training. They need to learn how to treat their employees.
good,"Working here has certainly been an experience. A typical day, for me, consisted of staying busy, assisting customers, including tracking down items unknown, speaking to management on behalf of the customers and answering general questions."
good,Advancement opportunity is based on favoritism. If you are actually a good worker they will use you.The management looks down on the lower associates like there better than them. All the elderly people get paid to have social hour.IF COMPANY COMES MANAGERS ACT LIKE CHICKENS WITH THERE HEADS CUT OFF. WALMART DOESN'T ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO WORK 40 HOURS MOST ASSOCIATES ARE HIRED AS PART TIME.
good,"For a part time job it is okay as a cashier.  Being a cashier is fun sometimes, but lifting heavy groceries wears down your back.. I think i would rather work on the floor putting away groceries and products than deal with most of the people that shopped there."
good,Walmart has a very strict environment. They have simple and repetitive job tasks. They have a good HR team and management always stayed on top of things.
good,advancement is a plus and never had any issues i left because i took a better paying job i miss the people i work with but still see them when i go in to shop
good,"other than the fact that it is a requirement that you must work every single weekend, the managers are very lenient with your availability which was helpful for me, being a student. "
good,"constant movement needed re-stocking shelves, helping customers find the product they came in for, getting back to your area making sure it is zoned and cleaned so that the customer experience is excellent."
good,dentro de lo que cabe el ambiente de trabajo sano lo hace uno recibes la capacitacion para el puesto y si quieres seguir aprendiendo lo haces sin ningun problema
good,Wal-Mart is a good place for someone who is looking for a job fresh out of school. A good company for someone who wants to learn different things and wants to be able to try to get a foot in at management
good,"Challenging but I find it very productive and I like everyday challenges that occur. Sometimes you'll encounter a rude customer, but I just treated it as part of the job and serve them fairly with all my strengths and capability and with a smile."
good,"To be honest, Walmart was one of the worst places I worked at. The management was bad, the service was horrible, and just overall the place was unbarably disorganized."
good,Buena empresa para aprender a ser un buen comprador
good,Walmart is a fast environment because there is always customers . Theyy always have work for you to do and mostly all of the customers are really friendly.
good,I have been away for a while (vacation) and they (management) and the manager still accommodated me and gave a spot anytime I will work again with them.
good,"As a cashier, I dealt with customers throughout the entire day.  They were usually alright, but I would often be confronted about something the store did wrong and they would vent to me.  A few times they came up cussing, and I had to continue to be polite and bid them a good day as they walked away with a last glare in my direction.  You have to stand all day, but you get up to three breaks throughout the day depending on your shift."
good,"It's a great place to work very safe and I had an awesome pharmacy manager. Early in the mornings are slow, at about 11am it starts getting really busy. The incoming drug orders comes in and the phones start ringing."
good,I was a cashier so my job never really changed. Pretty easy job. I personally loved working with the public on a day to day basis. Good job to work if you dont know what you are looking for yet.
good,"My job title was an unloader. The job wasn't so bad, but they would always put us in different departments when we finish. I didn't know necessarily why they did it. Maybe they needed extra help but my job title wasn't an overnight stock person."
good,"Fomos contratados na fase inicial. Montamos plateleiras, estruturas e abastecemos todo o estoque antes da abertura do supermercado."
good,"Customer service managers are great"
good,They supervisor was amazing and so were my coworkers. The pay for the job was not competitive with other companies. It was a very stressful workplace.
good,while working at Wal-mart a typical day consisted of working in the back room bringing merchandise to be stocked to the sell floor. the hardest thing about the job was being able to accomplish the job while assisting customers.
good,"Me gusto trabajar en walmart "
good,Fun place to work if you can handle customers other than that only problem was to many managers not enough workers. Not to much time for the family during Holidays.
good,"Need to be better at rotation for management staff. Do more for there employees and allow more open understanding for family values, that the company is suppose to be base off."
good,it's was a ok work place to work at for this most part dint agree to some thing but overall..it was fun time off n 401k was the best thing there..but need improvement
good,it can be a nice pace to work but the can like to spread there employees to thin. an people tend to look down on you as a employee but it can be fun there.
good,Good experience for anyone wanting to work in a hospital to gain necessary experience or to get a feel for the medical world and see if it is something that suits them
good,It's not the customers it's management they just don't care about there employees are the things they might have going on in there life but I love working and meeting a lot of people
good,the Manager over Assets Protection was horrible. i was attending college while working here and she did not want to be flexible with my schedule. when i asked to transfer to another department to work with my schedule she told me no.
good,I was offered better pay and hours so I can't speak on behalf of Walmart Very fun energetic place to work from what I've heard and the coworker experience is like a family
good,If you have ever worked at a large company you understand the environment. They try to give the feeling of family but that is difficult when you have that many people working in one place
good,"Working with Wal-Mart has its ups and downs. Depending on the position, work is good and entertaining. At the time of my employment, there were no mentor opportunities on how to develop your skills and apply for advancement. With big businesses with many employees, it can be difficult do keep track on associate motivations and how they feel about the environment. The work culture could use some work."
good,Unloading the trucks is a fast paced job. Each person in the line is responsible for identifying the inventory for their department and stacking on pallets to be stored until they are stocked on the sales floor.
good,I have a 6 month old baby so the night schedule works perfectly for me to spend time with her . Great job opportunity and nice management . Pretty decent co workers
good,I worked there the pay was really bad and some of the supervisor was ok but some of them was really bad and I guess it all depends on which one you work at
good,"Open the photo lab. Gather all of the on line orders that have come in. Go through all reports and take care of any issues. Expedite photo orders, take care of all the customers, keep up maintenance on all photo equipment, including repairs.  Process all incoming dotcom orders."
good,"no matter what dept you are in, the job is easy if you have the correct tools. I've done numerous positions at walmart and have enjoyed most of them.  hardest part is non communication and support but best part is making the customers day."
good,"I enjoyed working here, but decided it was time to move on as I'd stayed in the same position with very little increase in pay over five years. I learned a lot about working with people and it taught me to be more open."
good,Seasonal job..a typical day consists of a fast paced enviornment..the pay was good..a con about this job is that it was seasonal work.............................
good,It was seasonal but was very greatful.Met a few good people that I respect always. Don't really have anything else. The location was good because I live so close.
good,"If you are looking for a great company with many incentives this is the place for you! They offer benefits, profit sharing and a variety of other generous resources to help you as an individual."
good,"Important:  The only department guaranteed a 40-hour week is maintenance.  And managers, I guess.  Think carefully before you take a job at the distribution center.  Sure, a good wage is offered; but what if you're getting just 35 hours per week?  Or struggling to get 30 from January to May?  Is that wage going to provide you the weekly income you need?"
good,"Unnecessary stress load for any one person."
good,"I learned a lot of leadership skills while working at Wal-Mart. The management are very kind, hard working, and care about the associates. The best part about working there was the other associates i was able to work with."
good,Pay is competitive for managers but schedule isn't family friendly.  I do not agree with the processes.  Instead of worrying about whether the process is followed 100% why not focus on the results?
good,"Overall, a good place to work. The hardest part of the job is standing and lifting. The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers and meeting so many new people."
good,"i really dont know wat to tdell you about the job, cause the other employees was nont friendly at all and manager didnt not do their job. pay was good and so was the hours tho."
good,Management sucked the pay was not all the good as well. I dont hve much good to say and my experience was not tht good. Thts why i to find another job tht paid better and respected their employees as much as their customers.
good,Walmart is all about family. Every part of working at Walmart has a closeness to Family Oriented ideas. It is a great place to shop with and for your family. Especially if you work for the company!
good,You can move up in the company when positions become avaiable if you work hard and show up to work when you are scheduled. The fellow work crew are friendly people and can be fun and a learning experience to work with
good,"Fun fast pace, good to start off with the people skills, you learn a lot of skills working here, also teaches you to be really patient with everything and everyone"
good,"Buena empresa, aunque tiene buenas politicas , existe conflicto de interés y no llevan las políticas como debe de ser."
good,Company is great to work for and many new things to learn in the process .  It has it's Pro and Cons. Once you work and do your job it starts to reflect onto others.
good,"Takes years to get on a decent shift. Mostly Manual labor. Receiving isn't too bad. Some jobs are harder than others, more physical. The pay does max out so a 5 year employee makes the same as a 30 year employee. It's not a terrible job but it's not for everyone"
good,"Work was great. Moving up withing the company was a breeze. Staff was great and I couldn't be happier for the time I was there."
good,"People aspect of the job is wonderful.  The schedule is awful and it is very difficult to be a high level manager and have a balanced work/personal life.  Rarely get holidays off (It is retail), but as a salaried manager, you receive a good amount of vacation days (7 years with the company and I get 31 vacation days, so 6 weeks vacation).  The sky is the limit with the company; if you do not want to have a life outside work you are able to move up the ladder fast and make a lot of money doing so."
good,when i was working at walmart the place was ok i like the people that were there its a great place to work and you can advance in the walmart you are at the management is fair
good,Working here is like working at ANY retail place!! So work here at your own risk. Management sucks for the most part. But it is a good first time job.
good,"Work well with others. Very demanding job with little room for advancement."
good,My specific store did not bother to finish up an ethics investigation. instead they kept all individuals in the department and prevented me from transferring.
good,"friendly employees and some good assistant managers, store manager only cares for self, customers are rude most days, theft happened often, blame game happened often. poor environment full of anxiety and depression"
good,"I was always very productive but I never heard anything positive come from the managers. I was fortunate enough to have one of the best managers in that store so that he seen my potential, which is why he had me be a supervisor for the remaining time of me being in that city. The hardest part of this job was the management team never had anything positive to say. The most enjoyable part was that I got along with everybody. I didn't have any enemies."
good,company was ok had a discrepancy in terms customer based but sometimes did not really look out for customer wanted to put company first and all else on the back burner
good,"The jobs themselves are not an issue within Wal-Mart, but the social structure is a bit lacking. Salaried members of management frequently undermine one another at the expense of the associates. Communication is nearly non-existent. Associates within the store frequently form cliques and will cause drama over small miscommunication errors. The lack of strong coordination often leaves anyone involved in a particular project without any clear direction, often leading to a job that could have been done once with clear instruction having to be redone after the first attempt was not up to desired standard."
good,"It's a good work environment,great team members, cap team 2 is a fast work environment and a lot of memorizing as well as stocking aisles at the end of the night and helping customers find products."
good,"Manage different modes of money transaction."
good,I Enjoyed most of the customers I dealt with on a daily basis. It's a pretty laid back work environment. They are very flexible with your schedule....
good,The most enjoyable part of this particular job was meeting new people every day.  I learned the value and the importance of paying attention of fine details
good,"I was a customer service manager so I did a lot of running and cash handling.  I had to count registers, give cashiers money when needed, and take cash bags to cash office. I learned that some people can be mean and nice but no matter what always be kind. I also loved working with customers and being a manager and having people depend on me."
good,I did enjoy working at walmart. I met a lot of people and friends there. I will not forget my time working there. Management had room for improvement but overall a great place to work.
good,I had to make sure everything was in inventory. Check bins in the back room pull pick for the sales floor. Make sure inventory was right on different items.
good,"In the Sporting Goods department there was always something to do."
good,"Initiated a customer service strategy, which helped to increase store sales by 5% over six months "
good,"it was fair working environment "
good,"I didn't care much about this job. It was my first non-restaurant job, and I found it overly boring and simple. The pace was relaxed, but coworkers and guests did sometimes make the job more of a chore than it should have been."
good,Es un excelente trabajo pero no me acomodo con mis horarios
good,wal mart is a god place to work I work with good people get an hr lunch and oir shift leader is good we are asked a little too much of but over it isn't bad
good,Its good for if u don't have a job and bills need to b paid they work u to death but it makes the day go by as long as u working but it'll all pay off one day
good,I learned how to work well with other employees. The management and supervisor teams were accommodating and very professional. I learned how to accurately do a number of positions in the store during my time of employment.
good,"Too much disrespect, wasn't paid for full time work for full time hours, felt expendable, wasn't offered much and the work was stressful and not very fun at all"
good,It is a good place to work its just very tiring because they don't manage very well. They don't appreciate you enough and aren't flexible on hours. They also hold a lot of grudges.
good,"a typical day was pretty easy and was handled well. i learned how to work a register, and learned customer service. The hardest part of the job was when items were not entered in the data base and customers had to wait for a price."
good,"Constantly on your back about production,they really don't train proper...Every day a new rule that's not in the handbook...Could be bad pallets on truck,regardless u still on production....You Gotta unload the truck an process the freight..Up an down on the fork lift all shift...Only gets two 20 minute breaks,that take u 10 minutes to walk to the break room an get something to eat...."
good,They are bad with keeping up with cashier money drops. It takes them a long time to respond to a cashier to assist the customers. They barely give breaks accordingly n when you are late due to their miscommunication to relieve you for your break they throw the blame to cover their position.
good,"The Assitant Manager position is not for the feint of heart. The days are rigorous and long. The company recruits external clients with promises of work life balance. There is very little work life balance. I often hear co-workers complaining that their spouses are not happy with the amount of work the position demands. When you do an honest assessment of what you are being paid versus the actual hours worked, you will quickly realize that your salary is much lower than you think. "
good,i made my way through high school and my young adulthood by always working as a team. working for Walmart with the time i had was a wonderful experience i got to work with so meany wonderful people. management was grate they got things done when needed. everyone always worked as a team. all tho there are some things that can be worked on customer service could be better.  i believe brakes can be a little longer do to the fact that they get taken advantage.
good,had a good time with friendly people but I was in search of something more with advancement not just standing for hours decided to leave because of transportation asked to transfer but was not applicable.
good,Gran apertura para la posibilidad de desarrollo de las capacidades individuales y muy buen trato entre el personal.
good,It was not a good place to work for people over 40 years of age. Because of felt it was people working hard and not being appreciated and wasn't no room for advancement on the company.
good,I lived an hour away from this Wal-Mart and they would schedule me to work till 11pm at night and be back at 6am the next day. The pay isn't that good. They don't make sure the employees are good and have everything they need to succeed. They pick favorites and are not willing to work with you to better yourself with their company.
good,Good hours decent pay. Applying for other positions is a joke though...got offered a back up manager job .then had a family illness come up.they said the postion was still mine but when I got back they have it to someone else.
good,"I worked at Walmart as a stock associate, only for about 3 months. The staff was friendly and nice. I was only seasonal but the work wasn't to hard. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to stock in the back of the store where shipping & receiving was."
good,great benefits but lousy pay. All the money that Walmart makes they could have done the workers so much better than they done. It was embarrassing getting such small bonuses.
good,Good place to work and good people to work with. Always good help people find what they are wanting to purchase. The enjoying part of work is customer satisfaction.
good,Walmart is a real family orientated place to be. They was always willing to go above and beyond for there employees. Real easy and quick job to pick up new abilities and skills.
good,As a manager you are responsible for a lot of things.  There is a routine and it changes almost weekly by the company. You are responsible for ordering scanning out and lows. Then you have to fill the sales floor for customers.
good,Walmart is a customer service representative job. I was a Sales Associate for a few months with Walmart before I decided to go to Dental Assisting school.
good,"We've all heard horror stories about Walmart, and although most are true, they Actually make working at Walmart not so terrible. If you plan to go in, make your money, and get on with your life.. This is a decent way to go about that."
good,Walmart company has a very poor job culture they no longer take care of  the customer and the employee like they just to. The company has decaying  for the past 20 years. talking to the people who's been working for Walmart their whole life had lost Benefits and the most important faith in their company. they are not opportunities to succeed if you want to apply for a hire position you must have someone to pull you up. they are people with potential and great ideas is a great you to get experience.
good,"Not a bad place to start working straight out of high school, but not a great career option.  I received regular pay increases, but started out so low that I never made much."
good,My Walmart experience would of been a lot better without all the drama in the workplace . the work environment was very stressful. I would like to work at Walmart again bit in another location.
good,"Walmart was a good job, the only downfalls being only getting paid every two weeks. The other downfall is that they did not give many hours. When I asked for my hours I was told time and time again that I would get them but never did."
good,"Working for walmart was certainly a learning experience, and had a nice family atmosphere in which i was always comfortable and felt eager to move up in."
good,It's pretty easy at times but there are also days that are very fast paced. We have a lot of pressure put on us and sometimes no back up. Bonuses are nice.
good,I have worked at Walmart for over two years now and overall it has been a decent place to work. Typically my job consists of helping customers while solving problems with freight and overall department cleanliness. I've learned that often times problems that seem impossible to solve at first always have a solution. The key is to be flexible and adaptable to your situation. Management is knowledgeable and helpful most of the time; everyone has their off days. Working here you will make new friends and develop good personal relationships as well as professional relationships. The hardest part of the job is the stress one gets from pressing time constraints. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction of accomplishing all of your tasks in a given day as well as the smiles one receives from customers when the job is well done.
good,"A typical day at Walmart is highly unorganized and unsupervised. Although I did learn about stock and bringing out items from the back, and using scanners. Nothing was hard, just not together. Meeting good friends, nice people and learning everyday from someone else, customer, manager or co-worker was the most enjoyable part of my job. The interaction is nice."
good,"Answering phones, counting money, waiting on customers, scanning & marking merchandise, straightening shelves, putting away new merchandise in the clothing department, pricing & stocking items from purchasing department."
good,"I enjoyed working at the Indian Harbour Beach Walmart.  The management was supportive and fair.  Most of the customers, at this location, were kind and understanding."
good,Good pay that is robbed from other employers in the area......................................................It was okay but it robs you of your soul!
good,we should punch in and have our nightly Walmart meeting and then we would be given a department to work in that night. once we knew where we would be working we would take out the skids from the back room filled with merchandise and stock the shelves until the morning.
good,Working here was a great experience. Its alot of lifting and alot of moving heavy boxes. Overnight hours so  your schedule is not a normal sleep schedule
good,"Walmart is definitely a job to acquire flexibility, patience, endurance, and many other skills. It is a fast-pace environment and requires an ability to be flexible, policies change often, job demands change often, and just about every thing is subjective. If you need a job to just scrape by, and need flexibility with your schedule, depending on your management staff and relations, they'll work with you. However, the pay is not nearly enough to fully support a family. Right out of high school and near /after retirement this place is ok to work. Any plans of moving up in management, you must understand that there is A LOT of pressure and stress and long hours required. Not much of an outside life the higher up you go."
good,"It brings a since of pride to work for the largest company in the world. A typical day starts with walking the store and noting all the things that needs to be taken care that day. Your day will be dictated by how much freight is left behind by the overnight crew (its suppose to be none)."
good,"Good management, nice co-workers, discount on purchases, training as needed.  Worked with you if you had family issues.  Not much opportunity for advancement and inadequate pay."
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart because they were very helpful. I learned a lot and met a lot of different people. They offer a lot of different opprotunities. Wish I was still there.
good,"It was difficult because of the type of customers I had to deal with. Overall the pay made up for it, and it was worth it. I enjoyed meeting new people."
good,"Gave a three star overall due to the fact that you're working for one of the largest retailers in the world. In Theory working for Wal-mart is supposed to be great. You have too many bosses from your current supervisor, to assistant management, then to your managers. Each and everyone of them has something different they want you to do. The environment is what you make it there, but sometimes the environment becomes pretty toxic."
good,I started as a cashier and worked my way up to Customer Service Manager. The employees were great and I learned a lot. I even worked in the produce department. I loved being able to help customers with all their needs.
good,"Depending on the department you are placed in the difficulty changes but overall it is an easy going workplace with the same duties each day you go to work, biggest concern i had was the lack of good management if that were to improve Walmart would be a great company to work for"
good,very cold barely let you go to the bathroom under paid and under appreciated rude and people are not friendly can not get off for doctors appt and is very life consuming
good,I personally didn't care for the atmosphere.  Management required training for a dollar raise but never gave me the opportunity to complete the online training during work hours.
good,"Not a job I want to be at for the rest of my life at all. We've been understaffed for the past two years I've been working here. However, management always saying that we aren't hiring at the moment. Which is crazy because the give everyone in the store 3-4 departments a night to stock. Then expect it all to get done, even when everyone's hours are being cut! Majority of the time you ask management something, their answers are always ""I don't know"" or ""I'm not sure"""
good,Coworkers are cool. Company is good place to work for. A lot of changes by company too much. Everyone is quite friendly and we know most customers by name.
good,Always busy and had to resolve issues and problems. Management overturn most times. Learned to have patience and not to offend anyone and treat them with respect.
good,It is an okay company to work for. I would have liked a better experience with the company around inventory however other than that it was a decent experience
good,"Many of the managers are skilled and hard-working, though not all.  Much of the frustration with the company is the corporate attitudes, which often show little to no experience with day-to-day in the stores.  Corporate policies sometimes change week-to-week, increasing stress on management and pressing down on associates as a result."
good,Working for walmart is an exciting experience. They have everything you need right at your fingertips. Management is always one step ahead of you. They also go above and beyond fpr their employees.
good,Typical day at Walmart is providing good customer service. Making sure customers are taken care of to ensure they will return. Sometimes the hardest part of my job is when your manager comes to work with and attitude. What I enjoy most is seeing the customers happy.
good,"Not the best nor the worst place to work if you don't mind the high school atmosphere , and expecting the impossible with less than I deal help. but it beats nothing"
good,The hardest part is standing on concrete for 8 hours in one spot. Will work with school schedule. Management is not the best but there is some justice. Fun working with others co workers and great work load
good,Its a good environment. You learn things very quickly when being trained. They have good discounts and in all reality is a very good store to shop in for anything.
good,"Lots of work, so much that it was impossible for one person actually complete by themselves. Fortunately, neighboring associates can and will assist when they can."
good,It's an okay place to work if you're young and trying to gain work experience. Customers need quite a bit of guidance when asking for items and usually will purchase the item you suggest if they don't have a specific item in mind.
good,"They were willing to work around my school schedule"
good,"Walmart is a solid company and fun to work for, I work overnight 10 p.m to 7 a.m I stock freight, break down boxes, zone freight, help customers find items."
good,"The pay is good and it does have decent benefits, but management is super shady. It's a good first job for anyone looking for work experience because they are willing to hire and train anyone. I would not recommend it as a long term career however, for the sake of your mental health."
good,"Wal-mart was okay. I enjoyed working there. Wal-Mart is a good place for people work for if you're young, and don't have a family to provide for. I don't think it is a job if you have to provide a for family, and Wal-Mart is your only source of income."
good,It was fun and it was very demanding if you really want it to be.  There were lots of contradictory statements by management but always follow the policy.  That is key.
good,The beginning of a shift begins with off loading the the truck sometime with up to 2000 items on the truck. Some nights we had 2 or 3 trucks to of load.
good,Decent place to work. Associates ypu get can definitely vary depending on the location of the store. If you like grocery stores I'd recommend price Chopper to them.
good,"Unloading trucks can be a pain unless you have a full crew there, but quick isn't always best, especially when people get hurt or the product breaks, but we get blamed still for it all. Enjoyable part of the job would be doing picks, and just taking them to where you need to drop them off at."
good,my typical day at work is stressful and monatonus. I do love the creativity but I don't enjoy the monotony. I feel I am not  appreciated or valued. limited.
good,"Day involves working at a rapid rate to ensure the inventory is stocked and are available to customers on a daily basis. Management is particularly tough on staff due to pressure from the higher ups in management. Most days are difficult due to the high turnover on customers on a daily basis, making finishing other projects in the store a long-term issue. Co-workers are fun and help alleviate the stress from work."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is boring, and the job can be very repetitive, the people there were somewhat nice at my store, but they were always stressed."
good,"It's a good job to actually work at. If you an frist timer working, or you wanna get out the house, or you tire of  retirement  and you really wanna work. Walmart is the way to go."
good,"A typical day at work would include helping customers, working the registers, and zoning departments.  I learned excellent communication and problem solving skills."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work starting out of high school, the company is big on customer satisfaction and making sure the business is well equip to meet customer needs."
good,My review on Walmart is that I loved working there was a great place to be and coworkers are friendly got treated right till that one  Manager decided to pick on me and treat me wrong and then wrote me up for anything that I never did other than that was a great place
good,I enjoyed most of my time at Walmart but the have one huge flaw. to them everyone is expendable. they don't care about their workers and that reflects in the service to the customer.
good,"Wal-Mart is struggling.Online shopping is taking a huge toll on the company and in order to compete they have rolled out  a car delivery service where the associate will do the shopping for you and deliver it to your car."
good,Great opportunity workplace but low starting salary for experienced salaried associates.Quite stressful at times doing the same things over and over but expecting different results.
good,I appreciated how Management worked with my school schedule and their genuine compassion when I needed to step down to focus on school work.  The hardest part of the job was also the most amusing because you never knew what misplaced items you would find in the unlikeliest of places.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when I had finished tidying up a section and knew everything looked good and there was an appropriate variety easily accessible to the customers.
good,"This was a job that I got just because I needed something. They do not give you all the details about certain aspects until it is too late and you could possibly get fired for being sick and not understand how sick days work. It can be a positive experience though, so not all of it was a bad experience."
good,"walmart is a hard place to work if you arent ready to deal with harsh management and rude customers. If your patience is short, and you dont have a drive to "" learn things yourself'. you wont make it."
good,It was a good job and the hours and pay were very good. I enjoyed working at Walmart. always had to get stuff done within a matter of time though which wasn't hard.
good,"When I went to work for walmart I felt at home. This was mainly because of the work environment that I was put into. The longer I stayed there, the more at home I felt."
good,"It was temporary work, you just need to fill the shelves and complete their work in the required time. There is no training. It was very short time to know more about the company."
good,"Retail associate; provide quality customer service within a retail environment "
good,not a bad place to work for. other employees are nice to work for but the managers aren't very nice. I liked the job just couldn't work overnights anymore
good,When I started it was all good I thought it was going to be a good environment two months in I started to notice it was no good supervisors and I started getting treated wrong I was a very hard worker
good,"A typical day at work is retrieving carts from outside, helping customers, and restocking shelves. I learned how to properly guide a shopping cart. Management didn't do much except come out and tell us to take a break or continue working. Workplace culture was very diverse and the hardest part of the job was during the afternoons when it was very busy. I enjoyed talking with my co-workers."
good,"Walmart was my first employer, so my expectations were low in the beginning. There is lots of room for movement, but not upward. I went from $7.15 to $10.55 in 6 years, so the pay was bad too."
good,good work and easy jobs. many different types of assignments throughout the store to keep you busy. Also always gave us paid lunches and lots of over time.
good,"Management doesn't really care about your schedule if you tell them you can only work certain days, They will tell you that they'll have to cut your hours and not give you 40hrs a week."
good,"I want to work for this company again so, I'll write that the associates are friendly, helpful. The Managers are hard working & helpful. the customer is met with a friendly smile."
good,working there was fun overall at my location they could have used new management because they were slow and lazy and was on their time. the other workers were amazing to work with nice and kind people
good,"The job is not hard, and the work environment is great. However, management is not very accountable. The hardest part of the job is just dealing with the assistant managers."
good,I first started as a cashier and worked my way up to a Pharmacy Cashier. Never did I thought I had an interest in the medical field until I worked hands on with the pharmacy technicians. So this job made me realize to always be open to learning new things.
good,"I really enjoyed working with a variety of people and the ability to grow in the workplace. The only thing I did not appreciate about them is toward the end, I became only a number."
good,What can you say about Walmart that everyone doesn't already know.  Big business not looking out for the little employees.  Managment varies from store to store.
good,I stock meat make sure the floors are clean at all times break down the trucks (unloading). Always Kept The meat Wall Filled Up For The Customer Cut Meat. I Got Terminated For Goin 7mins over my break.
good,The management at Wal-mart will have you working everyone else's job along with your own. They will have you running all over the store to cover different departments because they don't have enough people because they are constantly firing people.
good,"I worked here when I was young and just starting my career. I quickly moved into management and it went down hill from there. The culture of the company is great if you work close to the home office, other wise you are at the mercy of the store manager and the district managers."
good,"Great job to work at, however it does tend to move up people in the company with no education which causes unnecessary bottle necking.  Otherwise it can be a great place to work at."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work because the benefits are great if you've been there for a year. i enjoyed my job in the deli helping customers and cooking food. I found it difficult to request for a set schedule due to the amount of associates going in an out of employment there. I really enjoyed going about my daily duties of slicing meat for customers, fulling orders at the fryer, baking pizza etc. I learned many skills such as time-management and teamwork. the management is a bit discombobulated but that comes with having multiple levels of management on one store. At times it seemed impossible to get any manager to answer the phone or walkie and if you requested to move departments or change your schedule it takes weeks for the request to go through all members of management. The hardest part of my job was closing some nights alone, getting everything done in the time given is very difficult but not impossible. the best part of my job was fry cooking, it is a new skill for me but i have become very skillful in it."
good,"Work fast "
good,"Overall good place to work with good pay. Very high goals to reach. Good benifits with affordable insurance, 401k and bonas program. Hard work but rewarding atmosphere."
good,it wasn't a job id like to keep for a long time but i didn't expect it to be. it was just the job i had for a semester while i was in school. if i had to do it again id find a day job instead.
good,"Me sentia muito bem na Walmart,amava meu trabalho."
good,"A typical day would be different every day, most likely because I was a seasonal worker. I never knew what I was going to do when I showed up so it was quite nerve-racking at times."
good,"I love the job and customer but the job became to unorganized , went up on pay for new employees but not older ones, always cutting hours went it's busy."
good,I would not recommend anyone to work here. management was terrible and we were well over worked for the amount of pay we were getting. I would only recommend to people who are still in high school or just graduated.
good,"I liked being a cashier at Wal-Mart seen different faces made new friends , learned new things about the store got too explore the store and see new things I've never seen at Wal-Mart."
good,"While providing decent hours for a live at home life style, the pay for hours along with job security and overall management is generally lacking. Provided you work at a decent store, your experience will be beneficial to all future positions."
good,A typical day at work included an average of 35 customer interactions. The most important thing I learned at this job was teamwork. The workplace culture was hostile.
good,Management was very horrible. You get enough breaks so that's a plus. Always needed to work both days of the weekend. You can't book off any days during the busy blacked out days.
good,Good place to start a career in sales/management. I worked here for two years and I really bonded with my coworkers. I wish I couldve stayed longer ...
good,"was an okay job. People didnt seem to have any idea how to do their jobs , The rules for dealing with shoplifters can get you hurt. It needs to have better people running theur security thye have NO IDEA !!!!! what they are doing"
good,Wal-Mart has changed since stock owners have become more involved with the running of the Wal-Mart franchise. It was a supportive family atmosphere in the beginning.
good,"I liked my job. I had specific tasks and specific times at which to perform them and I respond well to structured environments. Most of  my co-workers were easy to work with and management was always easy to talk with.  The environment on the job was upbeat, most everyone was friendly and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job, for me, was the closing time full kitchen break down as it was a long and tedious process and often done alone. I really liked working there. My only complaint was that employees did not work full 40 hour weeks and were often only short the full 40 by 15 minutes. That affects any chance at overtime and some benefits."
good,management and culture at walmart is terrible. Everything is a hurdle along with trying to get a lunch or a short break. I hope one day they will be able to correct this mistake.
good,Working at Walmart have been a very good experience. Working there means you get to meet different people there everyday. The most enjoyable part of this job is that you learn know things everyday
good,"A typical day of work started with clocking into a machine, where you would later start being told what to do by young kids with a yellow vest that had authority to tell you what to do, It also consisted of waiting three hours for a break and putting up with attitudes from managers if you reminded them that you needed to take a break. It was the worst hostile environment and I wish someone could have witnessed what I experienced there at that work place, It was hard enough to not see any managers willing to help or even offer their assistance when you were having trouble with a customer. Half the time the Managers were eating lunch, or talking about their personal lives on the daily."
good,"Overall, Wal-Mart isn't as bad as it used to be. There is a program they have that takes about 4 months to complete, and after it, you get a $1.00/hr. raise. While you are hired to work in a specific department, you will be working everywhere, including cashiering. "
good,"The job was all right. It motivated me to get my degree so that I would not have to work there for the rest of my life. If we are reviewing that, then it was great."
good,"On a typical day at the Wal-Mart I worked at is busy and hardly any staff to work. Never fully staffed and management gets mad when they have to help you. I have learned to always treat your employees as a person not a soldier. The management in the Wal-Mart that I worked at need to work a shift in the front end without any help then maybe things would have been different. The hardest thing about my job as customer service supervisor was pushing shopping carts in the hot heat. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers, I always enjoy meeting new people, I also had regular customers come find me and say hello"
good,"They work with you family-wise. But, there's no consideration for employees' futures. Enjoyed the customers. Friendly atmosphere. Enjoyed my team....."
good,I learned a ton working for these two places. They were very flexible with my school requirements and the management was amazing. I still talk to my manager after almost 10 years of being gone.
good,"It was a great place to work, learned a lot. Pretty disappointed, I lost my job. Had a great time with the people I worked with. And the customers were so friendly."
good,"If you are not a very fast thinking and working person, this job is NOT for you."
good,I have worked at some good walmarts and some bad. Their all not that bad but i had more bad than good. They do offer good benifits and 401k. Its a very easy place to get a job.
good,Honestly it all depends on the type of management and the people that work there if your not buddy buddy with the right people dont expect to move up .
good,Did not really like my job which could reflect why I feel the way I do. Would recommend working somewhere else before taking a look at Walmart. Pay was not great.
good,Its a job. The work that I do i feel its good for a male. It's allot of lifting . It's an okay job for people that care about lifting. Management should listen to associates when they come to them with ideas
good,Quick pace unloading trucks and stocking shelves. Overall got along with everyone. We all helped each other out and had a great time working. Never had a problem.
good,Working at Walmart was about what you'd expect of working midnights at an entry level job. The work environment was okay and my coworkers were friendly enough.
good,I had a good experience at wal mart with a tolerable staff of managers and associates made it easy to work and get along with everyone management is where the money is in this company
good,"Working at Walmarts Tire and Lube Express was not a fun place to be, working here meant that you had to apologize to customers constantly for not being able to work on their vehicles. Two workers had to be certified to actually work on the vehicles and one worker was always certified while the other one was never."
good,you just have to work there to understand the stress level they do NOT appreciate there employees. Everyone blames each other and management  don't care
good,"40 hours guarantee overnight , very peaceful and quiet , closes at 12 so the rest of the night you don't have to deal with customers, consist of constancy, fast past job that requires a lot of listing and bending"
good,I liked my job.  At time management didn't follow the same rules for everyone. Walmart is only in it to make money for the company.  Made some good friends.  Hour were good except the holidays.
good,its okay not much to say about the places like  I feel they should pay more money it feels like a slave ship. I just really don't know good luck to people applying
good,Ok place to work can use more good people need to listen to employees more. Have good and bad to say this should be enough . If needed would go back to work part time . More vacation time and higher pay would be nice   . I got decent hours at first then kept getting my hours cut for rediculus reasons. No respect shown towards employees.
good,"Great place to work, friendly customers and managers, great work environment. Hours and workload can be long but break times do make up for the hard work."
good,"I got paid for a cashier position while I did more stocking than being on a registered. I feel as if while doing stockers work, I should have been getting stockers pay."
good,They put alot of work on you so your constantly busy. Never a moment you don't have something to do. Just not enough pay for the amount of your you need to get done.
good,I push carts and help Customer to their vehicles bringing their groceries and furniture and not enough help for employees who needs it and waiting getting the help we deserve to get
good,"Was there to decorated cakes, cookies and cupcakes. The job was good to work at hours of work was great just some of the mangers was not good. They had power trips."
good,They are a ok place to work for but can be stressful some days. Managers needs to work on their customer skills better. And you have to really watch your call offs
good,Was a lot and time-consuming if you work on 3rd Shift it's not bad you'll have bad customers but it was okay my experience was very nice I wish I could go back there and be a cashier
good,"This is a OK place to work for. They do have good benefits, but what they say your hourly wage is when you apply is false. Management has awful communication skills and are never available when you need them."
good,They do work with you a bit. Trianning was pleasant i worked there for two years and made some friends. loved the work out pulling and unloading the pallets.
good,not much to say but I did my job and stayed to myself I liked the new stuff they tought me and their were a few people I got along with and the cap team worked together
good,Baking donuts and bread was a fun experience. Great laughs . i learned how to ice donuts and box them up perfectly . i learned to prepare the bead perfectly.
good,Not for everyone. i got sick and could not keep up with the fast paced environment. Its a busy company with a lot to do. Hard on my feet and lots to remember.
good,"They only thing i didn't enjoy while working for Walmart was the amount of pay & pay increases they gave employees. You could only earn up to .60 (cents) at the most when it came to yearly raises. Benefits aren't bad to be honest, but they are horrible about placement with employees. I was a Department Manager over 1/4 of a store, and only had 1 to 2 employees to work with every day."
good,"Walmart is an ok placed to work. Flexible schedule, great customer service. Managers are available to answer any questions or concerns. Need to improve on relationships with staff."
good,"Walmart is a very busy place to work. The hardest part of the job is the constant steady stream of customers that never seem to end, but you get to interact with each of them and each are unique in their own way."
good,"I didn't hate or like love it.  They are very strict with hours, one time I pick up some shifts and that put me over 32 hours two weeks in a row and they banned me from picking up shift's for 6 months"
good,I had such great respect for my team for putting their all in to assisting in the goals we set forth and completed in a timely matter. The feeling that you did a job well done when you see that the customer had a satisfying shopping experience when they left the store.
good,"Learned cashier experience but I didn't like management, Didn't get enough hours as a whole and showed favoritism. I liked some of my manangers but some of them were rude."
good,Mostly working alone and having to complete certain tasks at a certain time.Unload the truck and stock the meats and other foods. Have to pull and stock the freezers with fresh food.
good,"Typical day through all hours is to push carts from the islands outside and get them back into the store for customers to use. Occasionally helped with product going in and coming out of the store for customers and always greet people as walking by. Learned how much hard work it is for menial tasks. Management was ok, stiff and hard to get compliments out of but most of the time firm and fair. Workplace culture ok, a few good people and some of the more delinquents would be put as courtesy associate. Hardest part of the job is first few months getting adjusted to the work if not a normal part of working out and staying hydrated when needed. Enjoyable part is getting to rest and only wash windows when all of the carts were collected and able to get some sort of breather in between."
good,"It takes initiative and motivation to move up at Walmart. In my experience, you cannot rely on your managers to be paragons of excellence who meter out advancement and promotions to whom it is due. If you believe you deserve it, you have to press them for advancement, or they may very well be content to let you remain in whatever position you currently hold."
good,"A typical day at work is overseeing the cashiers, running the customer service/money center, assisting customers, doing register audits, hopping on a register if there were lines, doing register audits, help train cashiers, push carts, empty and reset registers and self checks, and whatever tasks management assigned to me to be done.  The hardest part of the job was being required to do all of the above mentioned things while being short staffed.  Scheduling has become inconsistent, thereby I never have a set schedule or have set days off anymore.  Even after discussing this with the manager who does the scheduling and having them promise they would fix it, it is still inconsistent."
good,Depends on which location store and the people that work there. all places have the same Stereotypes just depends on location and people you with and at
good,It is an ok place to work. But the managers like to yell all the time. You can get more done by asking nicely and not yelling. They are always adding more  to your job.
good,It was a great place to work the only issue is getting your breaks on time. You had to learn to work with all types of people. You had to have great time management.
good,"Managed department by maintaining shelves and stockroom, managed 11 associates (scheduling, training, and creating daily task), reviewed profit and loss statement of the store, reported regularly to management regarding department operation and challenges, carried out monthly cost inventory of items in stock, and assisted in hiring and interviewing new bakery associates"
good,"Was a good place to work for, the people there are good people and work hard. It was a good place to work and I would go back to work there again....."
good,A typical day they expect you to do get everything done at a certain time with little help. I have learned how to pace myself with my work and not injurining myself. The management is not what I expected. They are misleading due to the lack of training. I feel like I have to do everything on my own. The workplace culture is disappointing. The hardest part of the job are the sleepless nights. The most enjoyable part of the job is that my shifts go by quick.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart... retail is my favorite and customer service comes natural to me. I am a people person and love to help others. I would recommend working at Walmart :)
good,I wouldn't recommend Walmart to people. The managers were extremely rude and didn't value their employees. I did enjoy my job because I had to make work fun.
good,"Some managers really try and work with you and your schedule. The people that work there are fun to be around and make the day go by fast, enjoy working there."
good,"For what the job was, walmart was a great job. Their managers are not very well trained but some do try their best. Turnover is to much and the most important jobs are often forgotten."
good,Busy for the holidays just needed the extra help and extra check. I wouldn't advise it just for the Holidays it isn't really worth it. For a full time deal go for it.
good,"Buen habiente de trabajo, poca relación con los directivos"
good,Each day brings about different challenges which requires you to think quickly to solve problems and meet customers needs. Sometimes can be frustracting getting your job done with the interruptions from customer service but that also gives you the oppertunity to meet a wide range of people.
good,Working for walmart was a good experience for me as an individual. The major drawback was the lack of hours that you could receive. If you got to 40 hours in a week you would be sent home.
good,I think Walmart is a great place to gain knowledge and experience and it's a productive and hard working environment to work in and I think the experience the better
good,"A typical work day was to be on the register the whole shift minus breaks and dinner."
good,"Going above and beyond is not recognized at the work place. The communication between management is terrible and it affects what gets done in a typical day at the store. More often then not there is favoritism to associate from management. The pay is nice but over all it can be a very toxic place to work. I wish I could say better things but at at the end of the day management doesn't care and you can see it reflected in the motivation and drive for people to get things done, and that makes the store suffer as a hole."
good,Wal-Mart started out as a fun job but quickly changed after the sisters took over the company. They made it harder to do your job and easier to get written up.
good,a really great place to work if you like doing manual labor.  It is tedious work and a great atmosphere. Takes a lot of concentration and motives to focus on the job.
good,I enjoy working with my coworkers however the compant does not pay enough to survive. I am a single mom and I have to rely on public assistance to help support my son and I. I am currently looking for a different job so I can better our situation.
good,Some of the co workers can be mean but other then that it's a very positive and polite working environment remember everytime you see a customer smile at them and make Sam Walton proud.
good,"A typical day included getting produce boxes off the truck.  Then, I  had to attempt to organize the shipment into a small room.  There was not enough room to store this food and made it very difficult to find the correct product.  In the end, Walmart fires many employees after awhile so they don't need to pay them more.  After that, Walmart just hires new workers and continues the process."
good,"Workplace culture is descent, a typical day at work is to finished all of the projects that were assign to me and then helping others with there projects."
good,This is a business to work for while looking for better opportunities.  The managers were often unaware of the state of things and therefore unable to do their job.  Or the managers were so high strung that they caused employees to feel personally attacked.  It was not a pleasant working environment overall.
good,you have to stand on your feet for just about all day but the pay is OK for someone who's a independent person and do not have a family you get a 30 minute break and sometimes you have to deal with really rude customers but overall is a OK job hope you get it!
good,Policies were not enforced for certain employees. High turnover rate. Pay starts at 9 an hour so not too bad. Opportunity for growth if you show initiative.
good,"I haven't worked there in a long time, I actually put my review for walmart under the review for family dollar. Both places were about the same though."
good,The store is mostly kept clean and organized but the customer service was not that great. I suggest hiring more people who like to interact with customers
good,"Typical day if an overnighter is usually breakdown pallets stock help customers till closing then keep stocking and then clean up till store opens. Not a hard job at all , i took this shift because i didn't want to work with customers , yet there the least of your issue , management can be a pain but if you have headphones your day will go on so much quicker . People are nice ,environments easygoing and somedays you get little work and zone , easy job and you can move up quickly."
good,"It was a two day event, they had me help with the set up of the event. i volunteered. theres really nothing else to it................................................................."
good,Making sure you ask customers have they found everything okay. Providing excellent customer service. Busy lines you have to remain calm and move fast.
good,I like the fact that I know I will always have job security with them. I enjoy the people that work with. I'll admit the job can get stressful at times trying to please the customer but I enjoyed the experience.
good,Very stressful.. Never got a weekend off unless I requested it.. Family is important but Walmart didn't seem to think so.. The work was't that hard just a lot of it
good,"Walmart has been good to me but it is time for me to move on. Good pay, great fellow workers, managers were great. I am moving this is why I am leaving."
good,"Putting up fruits and vegetables all day isn't bad at all. Just remember that when management says you can only miss 9 days, they mean you will get fired the 9th time you are absent, not the 10th."
good,"I work in electronics, and I'm constantly being given the short end of the stick. But if you love electronic stuff and helping people, it's a pretty good job. It's just up to you if you want to put up with it and the management."
good,It's a good job but it is ran by computers. The people there care but there isnt anything they can do because EVERYTHING is ran by the computer. So if you miss a day because your child is being born and that was your third day then oh well you are fired.
good,"I worked third shift while at Walmart, felt like they compensated well but the routine gets old. Feel like its a good opportunity for as far as management."
good,"Although the management can sometimes play favorites, the teamwork that the regular employees provides makes it worth it. I learned how to be a better leader and make decisions that were for the best of the team not the person. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management team."
good,"I'm a peoples person so i worked well with each and everyone of my customers. i was good at handling the money always gave correct change back ,there was no problems."
good,"walmart is a good company to work for the only downside is have check weekly as to what your schedule will be, because days off can change week to week and you might h40 hours one and less than 40 the next week"
good,Walmart isn't such a bad workplace. The workload can sometimes get a little out of hand but nothing much you can't handle with the assistance of others. Management isn't too good with solving problems but other than that everything else is fine.
good,worked alot hours and got trained on the floors in other departments and was always busy store i got pregant so i went back on the register till i had my son
good,"Its a great place to work but its has very strict policies on tardiness an call outs. The 1st 6 months you can't go over 4points. Once you make it past 6months, your considered hired. An your maximum points is 9 at that time. So your pointing system starts over after 6months after the date you begin."
good,"Typical day bring carts in, learned to work the cart machine, outside the environment can be hectic, the hardest part of the job was getting the whole parking lot cleaned in time before I left, the most enjoyable part was doing carry outs for customers. Which had barely any time for."
good,"Walmart can be a great store, but with new changes it has become harder to enjoy your work. Staffing is a constant issue. It is harder to advance than in earlier years. Employees are constantly asked to do the jobs of other due to lack of staffing making it harder to said employees to finish the tasks assigned to them. Retention rate is most likely at its lowest."
good,"I would say that it is a great entry-level job opportunity since they are patient with training the newbies. But as years passes by, there is not much room for improvement."
good,Its ok working there some of the management is friendly and easy to get along with the customers are amazing and really great to help the pay is good.
good,"I enjoyed working here, but did not think that I got paid a good"
good,"It was an ok job but not fully for me. The job quality was not too bad but the tasks assigned to me were not very interesting in my personal opinion. "
good,"For many teenagers this place would be a quality first employer, the hours are good and the pay is good for the age. They are willing to work around you."
good,The job was fast paced. Being a cashier is hard work. You are not paid accordingly. Some of the customers are mean and hateful. Expected lots for the meager salary. Yes I would recommend this job until you can do better.
good,its was a challenge everyday i had set of goals to complete my task i learned shipping receiving customer service learned how to use a hand he'll device making orders inventory i motivate other co-workers to give it there 100% everyday the hardest part was making sure to be there for the customer no matter what the only thing i loved and enjoyed was seeing the customer happy.
good,Assisted customers with finding specific merchandise. Performed cashier duties. Stocked shelves with merchandise. Performed returns and exchanges for customers. Assisted with money transfers as well.
good,"Wal-Mart could be a great opportunity depending on the store management. Worked for this company for 12 years and enjoyed it for years, unfortunately management changed and so did the store. As a Jewelry manager I was able to work with different culture of people. Down part of this job as a manager you were given several departments and not enough help your department was not the only department to work, but the good deal is that we are a team and worked as a team"
good,"A normal day at the office, not a lot of talking you having to be working answering phone calls, taking care of your customers and doing the best to fix stores issues"
good,Had a lot of work on my plate had to stock 7 departments alone overnights totaling over my 8 hour shift constantly near the end of my time there ended up being fired over one little cart of freight.
good,Amazing people who make you feel at home. Great starting company to work for. Wouldn't consider working there as a career. I probably won't work there again but not bad.
good,"Great place to start a career and for someone to start working out."
good,"not the best though but its not that bad    , i love walmart it has some ups n downs ,  nothing  intresting ..........................................."
good,"be on the register for most part of the day, check out the customer , help zone defense on different departments at walmart when needed."
good,"Uma empresa de grande porte localizada no bairro Sarandi em porto alegre, muito boa de trabalhar."
good,I was very frustrated working for them. It was very competitive. I got paid every two weeks and it was ver hard to keep up because I have two children.
good,"Walmart is a large company and benefits and suffers from its size constantly.  Culture and management vary from store to store, and the socio-cultural reputation the company has created a stigma for the work environment and it spills over into your daily work."
good,"i guess its preference. im not a globalist so i cant relate to walmart model in that regard, but i appreciate their willingness for equal opportunities for all. Just not my cup of tea.... well retail in general lol."
good,"The bakery was an interesting department, it was attached to the cake/donuts and deli, where you could help out as well for variety of work.  My position turned to midnights and I couldn't do that."
good,"Working at Walmart was one of the worse experience I've encountered in my life. The management team was not good. I learned how to prevent people from stealing store products. My job title was loss prevention. The hardest part of the job was arresting people for stolen items, because some of the people that stole didn't just do it because they are thieves, they stole because of peer pressure or simple because they are in need. There was nothing exciting in arresting people but it was part of my job description and I did it very well."
good,"Responsibilities are shared among all."
good,"Operate cash register; assist customer’s needs while shopping in the store; assist customers with cashing checks, purchasing money orders, and merchandise refunds; computer operations"
good,"Aprendi mais sobre trabalho em equipe, como lidar com clientes."
good,very busy fun to work with coworkers horrible pay but great hours understanding managers love the customer service area and break room is always fun activities to do.
good,Hard to work. Very stressful. More and more responsibility for the same pay. Don't have enough associates. Management do not treat workers fairly.  Do not provide tools for work.
good,Would get to work and check people out. Left because I didn't have a car at the time so I needed some where closer to home. I really liked working here.
good,"An excellent company to work for, especially if you're looking to get started, or earn a little extra in retirement. Once you overcome the initial unease of working there, the people can be quite nice. If you get a good store, you have a very helpful management staff that can point you in the right direction."
good,Wal-Mart can offer experience in many different areas of employment with opportunities for advancement along with and transfer possibilities. Overall good employer.
good,The co-workers make work enjoyable. But it's hard to move up. You also get tasked with more then you can get done in one night. Scheduling does help you have set days off if you chose. Plus it's easy to request time off for vacations or such.
good,"A typical day is just checking out customers at the register. The managers and co-workers are nice. I enjoy working with my CSMs. I also enjoy seeing the regular customers daily and getting to know them. The hardest part of the job is the constant standing. Also, with my schedule, not being able to participate in a lot of family activities or go to church."
good,Most employees are in a bad mood which is understandable being as though they are expected to put in maximum effort and constantly work for the benefit of the company for low pay
good,The staff at the agency was very nice.  Low pay rates and the placement they sent me too was not very selective and unprofessional.  some people really liked it there however
good,I would make sure the parking lot was clean and keep alot of carts in the biggie station so the customers can shop.my co-workers where like family..the different weather changes kind of got to me but was great mostly
good,"A Typical Day of Work Is  demanding as in any jobs and it all depends on the mangers.my time was great but 3 years working overnight Takes a lot from family and times to enjoy yourself,as I Lost A daughter to brain cancer the loa Service is was wonderful.but working over night is taxing"
good,Heavy duty truck and trailer inspection and maintenance. Good pay and benefits. Mostly no rush environment with friendly co-workers. Nice schedules and time off.
good,we would always be short staffed due to management constantly taking the apparel workers for cashiers. You cant leave early if you feel sick or they'll mark it as a no show. If you came at least 2 minutes late they would mark it as a tardy.
good,"It was fun working there, met a lot of nice people and the co-workers were friendly. Would recommend friends and family to apply if they ever needed to just to enjoy and have the experience."
good,"basic retail company, good corporate structure and training was always available to employees. Profit sharing was great among all employees at Walmart."
good,"un trabajo algo pesado, con un buen trato con mis compañeros"
good,Wal-Mart was truly a great experience.  I am seeking something similar to the things I did there. Wal-Mart was a great place to work if you are a people person. I really enjoyed working there until my husband got sick.
good,l'aspect le plus difficile est de ne pas pouvoir avoir de communication ou peu avec la clientèle
good,Work hours were nice. I learned a lot of about customer service and demand and supply. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers.The employees were always patient and polite.
good,good job for college kids... not a set schedule if u have kids can be difficult to get them from school and daycare.this was a fun job and if u r a people person itsa good job
good,There's no equality in being promoted. The managers per-mote who they want how they want to. Its not based on seniority. They treat people how they want to with no care.
good,"Managers wil work with you to find a good job that is statisfying Cart pushing takes time to learn, but eventually you will get it right. Pretty good place to work: equal  pay for all jobs."
good,It was okay for a seasonal job. Got to learn about wal-mart and how it all statred. Depending on where you want to go in life you can take working there a very long way.
good,Great for career advancement but you have to be willing to put in the time offer a good stock option package I wold advise anyone to take advantage of it and keep it.
good,There were decent benefits and routine raises when employed there long enough. The break room had a good atmosphere and most managers were friendly. But not allowing overtime is unacceptable.
good,I had very hard headed customer complaints. Employee day to day struggles with long hours. Good Insurance and Benefits with Vacation Time. Holiday Pay and extra time off on occasions.
good,"Walmart is a great place to put one's foot in the door when entering the work force. While I enjoyed working at Walmart for my short time, the managers make the work environment toxic by expecting more out of the workers than can be done within the allotted time period."
good,I didn't enjoy working at Walmart people that don't respect you. Even if you are just working there to pay for college housing. I encountered people that was very disrespectful plenty of times.
good,It was fun working at first but my issue is that people are not treating right and you have to work double to cover other people slack. But What I learned is patient.
good,"busy fast placed environment,on your feet all day .management well some are good some just do not care .benefits are good .option to buy there stock ."
good,"good company to work for, but they do not care about long term associates.   It is all about bringing in young people who do not care about the company but just want to get Wal-Mart experience and then leave."
good,"Good for a first job"
good,"Decent pay, not that great of benefits. Great first job for high school students. Its very educational on medication and how the insurance and doctors work with the pharmacies."
good,Stressful if you are in any kind of management position. Hours were good. Management wasn't always on the same page. I'm sure that a lot has changed since I left though.
good,"Wal-mart was a highly educational experience, teaching the challenges and triumphs of daily work within retail. Members of management (see most, not all) were curt and apt to bouts of attitude, which is understandable considering the context of retail and the negativity of dissatisfied consumer complaints. Yet I say this as well: that should never affect your interaction with co workers or underlings. Beyond that it was an enjoyable struggle to ensure that even the worst customer left with a smile on their face."
good,Good starting job with possible advancement for those who enjoy the work. Great Benefits for long term employees and easy transfer to different stores for those who travel.
good,This employer requires most employees to have open availablity and your schedule is more than likely going to be all over the board.  This company will require you to work holidays and can potentially schedule you outside of your availability even as a part time employee with limited availability.  Many frontline leadership positions are held by unqualified candidates and are less than helpful.
good,"The work is easy if you are hard working, the management does not respect workers and hardly speaks. Other than upper management and their snooty attitudes as well as lazy co-workers the job isn't too unbearable"
good,"Fun and fast pace work environment,"
good,"Its a good company as far as associate wise, managers and DM managers could be better, they should care and be understanding more for the employees. If you are just looking for a job here to have something part time then great. Some of the managers only focus on one person or two people just to have someone to corner out."
good,There is time for growth and development. Good place for young graduate and working environment is friendly and ability to rise. Benefits are numerous but the starting pay is too low .
good,It was a good work place. also a great learning experience on something new. I just didn't like how some employees didn't work hard enough on the job.
good,"A typical day involves unloading and putting away freight, and  stocking the meat wall while attending to customer needs. I learned that it is a very demanding job if you are short handed on a busy day. The management was very attentive to needs of employees. The culture of the workplace was very diverse with people from all walks of life. The hardest part of the job was being short staffed on busy days and the most enjoyable part was helping customers and meeting their needs."
good,"A good place for a first job. But if your older and already have experience in different areas, try to stay away from here. Walmart wants your life to be bout Walmart. they are not really family oriented."
good,It's a relaxing place to work I was at the area of produce at the same time I like to help out I do customers service it's not so stressful a career job it's hard because they always promise to help you to grow but it's not true recommended to those students jobs time
good,Although walmart is a great company I don't believe it is a place that I would prefer to work because it has so much dis-organization. I do enjoy the customer friendly environment but its really stressful at times and also hard on the body.
good,"They will take advantage of you and the discounts are ALRIGHT, and don't expect holidays off.The workers are rude to customers, and like to stand around and talk to each other"
good,"A typical day at work  would consist of unloading trucks, placing boxes on their corresponding pallets, and bringing the pallets to their respective locations via pallet jacks."
good,Feels like you are the only person in the store and you have to do everyone else's job as well as your own.  You then get chewed out because your area wasn't worked.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers. My co-workers were very nice to work with. I liked the teamwork between our night shift crew.
good,"A typical work day at WalMart consists of constantly being on the move. You have to be fast and meet every customers needs. If you can't handle any sort of stress, I definitely would not work for WalMart. It is a total stressfest."
good,"My summary of wal-mart there are lot of customers that we have to deal with,like if someone ask you a question that you have to answer it, or if don"" know the answer,you call upon your supervisor for help."
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart but it's time for a change in my life and I always wanted to work for the Postal service.I have basically done everything in the store almost and what to move on to something else.
good,"On a typical work day I would be stocking shelves with new merchandise, Wal-Mart was a decent place to work. I left after I sustained an injury to my back which certain people did not take into consideration, this was the only reason I did not stay. It was enjoyable to work hard and in a fast paced environment. Although the toughest parts was working on little to no sleep even so the job had to get done. The management was sub-par as they did not take into account of my well being."
good,It's a ok place to work.. It has is good days and bad bad days but what job don't. Management is ok just depends on what day they are having. They need more team work
good,"I really enjoyed working at Walmart. The work is not hard, back breaking work. It can be really fast paced, especially around holidays or sales like Black Friday and Back to School. They have a good benefits package for full time associates. However, they don't take good care of and at times take advantage their hourly associates. A couple years back Walmart said they were giving hourly associates though out the company a $0.50 an hour increase so their wages would be competitive in the market.The night I was called to the office to sign for and officially receive it I got the increase then my manager explained how Walmart was paying an overnight differential of $1 (like I was getting) in some stores and $.50 in the others and the were changing it so the differential at all stores was the same. Then he said they were reducing our overnight differential to $.50 then he said ""you didn't really lose anything"" . And so all of the unfortunate people working 3rd shift in a store that had been giving a $1 differential did not get that $.50 increase .All the fortunate associates working 1st and 2nd shifts and 3rd shift (in stores already getting a $.50 differential) received their increase. Also in 2017 they did away giving out increases with your annual review which was based on performance reflected in your review (between $.20 and $.60 per hr.). Instead all hourly associates got $.20 regardless.Otherwise I had fun. The work is easy. Most of the people are easy going. And besides that......you never know what is going to walk into Walmart."
good,A pretty ok place to work. If you come in and work hard there are many chances to advance within the company. They have A lot of events that take place at the store that can be fun.
good,Wal-Mart isn't too bad to work for; depending on which state you are in. I really enjoyed my job which I started in Texas then transferred to another stated. Things were totally different in that state.
good,"This job increased my flexibility skills in working. Stocking, cashier, secret shopper. You never know how the day may go until you get there. Some days were easy going and others was hard but manageable."
good,"I did enjoy working with Wal-Mart in my beginning years. As time went along, the dynamic of Wal-Mart change. It was no longer about the employees while making money. It became about strictly making profits."
good,"The work environment isn't bad there are days where you have negative customers or staff, however it is a fun work place I got along with most of my customers and coworkers."
good,"Job is okay, with decent pay. It's a warehouse job that is very demanding, make production goal or get written up. Hot in the summer months with long hours."
good,"This was my first big chain, I guess retail job. It was not too bad. Of course the store I worked at was a brand new store. The other employees were nice."
good,"At the time of me working at Walmart was okay, They need to do a little bit better far as management and I say this because its not meant for everyone to be in management especially when working retail."
good,cuidar a sus empleados dar para recibir no ser groceros
good,"Walmart was a good starting job for me. It got me into the door of customer service which oa what I like. It made me realize I wanted a job where I could help people, and for that I'm thankful."
good,I got to meet different people as they checked out with their groceries. Cashiers talk to people on a daily basis and learn a lot about each customer and how their day is going in so little time.
good,I worked at Walmart pat time and it was the most relaxed job I have had. the people I worked with were very friendly. I didn't have to stress about not getting something done and there was always somebody there to help if I needed it.
good,Enjoyed meeting new people everyday.  Being available for overtime of different job was always up for a good day for learning more about the company. Changes came daily.
good,"I loved and enjoyed my position due to employees and customers, but the company itself really has alot to learn about how to treat their employees well and  give them constructive criticism."
good,It is a very fast paced environment which I prefer. The store is very diverse yet sometimes messy in the summer. They did however reconstruct the inside which was nice. I loved meeting new people every day.
good,Job can be stressing and demanding as your usually going to be required to do a variety of tasks while being understaffed. Customers are the worst part of the whole ordeal. You will eventually run into people trying to cheat the system.
good,"enjoyed working there, the people I worked with was awesome to work for and with , worked as a team stocking shelves and taking care of customers needs"
good,"Management wasn't great, expected too much with little to no training.  People were okay but working overnights weren't agreeable for me.  Did get along with co-workers."
good,They sometimes had managers that were rude and had a lot of unprofessional language there. It was a good job at first. I would love to work at a different location.
good,"A typical day at work was busy and cold, because I worked in the dairy department. The hardest part of the job was unloading the trucks. The most enjoyable part at the job, is when I was able to keep the dairy products fully stocked."
good,"Wal-Mart is a cool place to work. I worked in electronics, so it was relaxed and fun to play with all the new gadgets. I would recommend Wal-Mart as a career move to anyone."
good,It was a job i worked to get me thru college it was a good experience to work there i learned a lot of patience and learned a lot of people skills while working there.
good,"I worked for wal-mart back in 2003, we were always short staffed, the pay was not great, the benefits barely covered anything. It was my least favorite place to work. but maybe it has changed since then."
good,"dont care if you are sick or dying , you have tio come to work at any means ! didnt care about the fact that my fiance was killed and i had to attend the funeral . they wouldnt give me the day ooff cause we wasnt offically married"
good,Walmart overall was not the best job. The management was all over the place. They would not want to work around my school schedule. The cut back hours due to schooling. The whole atmosphere was very hard to be around due to the favoritism.
good,"Fun coworkers, okay management, not great pay, not many hours, mostly part time, if you're willing to work extra hard then there is room to move up but otherwise it's easy to stagnate in a position for years."
good,Our days at work are pretty standard. We are trained well and we do a good job at giving excellent customer service. The compensation isn't always the best but they do a good job at making sure that all of our needs are met
good,I was a CSM at Wal Mart and it was terrible they couldn't pay me to work there again. It was terrible pay for the way I was treated. Not to mention the lack of team work.
good,"Walmart is a fast paced, fun environment where you meet lots of people. One reason I loved working at Walmart is because everything is hands on and whenever you have a question their right there to guide you."
good,"It's a very productive job because not only are you working with the customers but you are learning what some medications are for . You learn the right way to say medications or another thing I learned is a lot about insurances and the difference it provides to a consumer when they only have to pay a co payment. It's also a very confidential job because the customers have to tell you their information in order for you to hand them their medication,it is important to always keep it proffesional and you're feet on the ground,for the same reason that some people need their medication to stay calm they might give you a harder time then other patients but that's when your understanding comes in place."
good,"basically worked a ton, to make less money that is what it was. and couldn't move up to a different positions cause of the team leads not wanting to do there job"
good,"My typical day of work at Walmart would have to be walking in with my badge, punching into the system on the computer in the front then checking the schedule to see what register I'm on whether I'm opening up, breaking a person or taking over. I learned what being a team was, experiencing personalities from different, wonderful beings. Management were a bit of slackers, if you had to code them, it'd take them like 10 mins to get to you when they're with friends, laughing away and talking which is a bit disappointing. The hardest part were the managers not really caring and feel like they have the authority to do whatever they please without any aftermath but the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people, and enjoying a conversation with customers about their life, adventures or their own personal experiences at certain places."
good,Walmart is a good place to work and they offer incentives. The offer competitive pay and have a fun work environment. The one thing I did not like was the management staff treated employees like kids.
good,Not the hardest job to work unless the outdoors are bothersome. My coworkers were a balance between hardworking and lazy and some of the management wasn't very knowledgable and I don't believe I was paid fairly and the chance for promotion was rare and I was overlooked.
good,Enjoy working there but the favorism that occur made you feel whats the use of coming to work. I enjoy interacting with the customers that came through the line checking out their items.
good,"was a fun place to work, people were nice until the new management became involved in the company, it then went downhill from there. no one cared about staff"
good,Mi puesto desempeñado fue de cajera y atención al cliente primordialmente lo importante en este trabajo fue que día a día ahí que esforzarnos lo más que podamos y tener claro que siempre ahí que atender al cliente lo mejor que podamos ya que gracias a ellos tenemos trabajo
good,"There was little to no training.  Then support from managers was very little.  There was one manager that I worked with was very helpful but other than that most of the managers walked around or disappeared.  It was not a friendly place to work and new employees were not treated well."
good,"buen ambiente, buen horario"
good,Working at Walmart is very simple. All your tasks are broken down and assigned in a simplistic manner. If you accomplish your goals and show up to work on time management and your peers will respect and be nice to you. If you are bad at your job or show up late people will hold it against you.
good,Looking for a job that I get 40 hours a week and a good wage and easy people to work with and a good work environment something that is close to home so that it's not overly that far away
good,Walmart was a nice place to work but you have to be ready for the drama that comes along with the work atmosphere. My manager that was over me as a Assistant Mgr she was awesome and was always there for suggestions when I asked for them.
good,I had not very helpful managers and they didn't train me very well when I started  I had to learn everything on my own. I probably wouldn't work there again it was a good learning experience.
good,"awesome start good expirences learned alot from working different fields , grew to appreciate food and develop respect for the kitchen and that is require to take from the prep to plating"
good,"I was a cashier at walmart. Overall, it was an average job. The people seemed nice but the overall management was a little scattered. I appreciated the job at the time."
good,It was an ok place to work hours weren't very flexiable due to my need for flexibility because of personal family matters the environment was ok and the people were nice.
good,"If you are good with sales and customer service this job is for you. There is sales stress and pressure put on you to make sales, Overall a good job for a proactive person"
good,you would show up and clock in and you would go to your ten oclock meeting and go talk about what needs done what is low in the store and also make sure you did it with a smile
good,"as a cashier processed customers orders, and payments for the goods they were purchasing.  At slow times did other tasks are required by management.  Handled all types of payments used by customers including coupons and gift cards."
good,It could be stressful at times than it could be a wonderful thing something depends on the customer come thru your line and your attitude it all count.
good,What I learned in stocking for Walmart is its very important to make sure that the product looked neat and selves fully stocked for our customers so that the customer was satisfied
good,I've learned to work with the public on a day to day basis. I handle money on a daily basis and I'm very reliable and responsible. I'm organized and I enjoy a clean and well kept work environment therefore I make sure I clean my space and make sure I've got the items I need to perform my job daily. I also know how to process applications for our companies credit card and in return help customers in processing payments for their credit card.
good,I loved working at walmart. can be stressful at times but family oriented environment. the only problem is working holidays and  black Friday especially
good,"My time at Wal-mart was seasonal for the holiday season. I had good co-workers, The customers made the job interesting and fun. The schedule was a good schedule."
good,"Working with customers is challenging, but you can learn so much. I enjoyed working with my friendly coworkers, learning new skills and meeting a lot of people."
good,"I only worked there for a short period on a contract basis. Was always busy and fast paced, which made the day go by faster..It was a good place to work"
good,"Nice people, fun environment, some managers just don't care enough to help. They're always looking for a reason to get someone in trouble/fire someone. Overall I liked working there."
good,"Customer service not friendly unless you have good customer service people on your team. "
good,it was a boring environment youd get tired from standing in the same spot all day and other associates got special treatments  id like to try something new
good,Better management needs to be in place in order to run a successful business. They need to stop treating the employees like criminals and give more breaks in between work shift.
good,I have learned how to fill prescriptions stock shelves and always be courteous to people no mater how they are to me. I have also learned that if I have a problem I should always talk to some one before I make a choice to leave my Job.
good,tem algum equilibrio no sistema de avaliação de produtividade assim como seus beneficios são bons.
good,"The job was not difficult."
good,"working at Walmart its very exiting coz meeting a lot of different"
good,The back warehouse is an entirely different atmosphere and viewpoint from being a customer at the fronts. I no longer will view Walmart employees the same.
good,"atención a socios, proveedores y asociados, personal a cargo."
good,"First off, I would just like to point out that most of the cashiers and csm treated me with respect but the environment was too much to handle, What really made the decision finalized is the fact that I couldn't have the ability to step into my job without feeling overwhelmed. The customers most of the time are pleasant but there are a few that just put down your character if they can't get their way."
good,I was thankful to have the opportunity to be hired in the pharmacy to get the learning experience to know that I was still interested in working in a pharmacy.
good,"I've worked with Walmart for a while. It's pretty good, nothing too special although it's better than most starting jobs. The pay is nice along with the hours."
good,"Me sentía bien trabajando, pero muy presionado por la universidad, pero me trataron bien en el tiempo laborado con ellos."
good,It could be a productive night depends on customers. Lack of cashiers at night. Supervisor are around but hard to get them to come and help. Some cashier have lack of training.
good,being able to move in fast past environments is a must working here.  the more busier your days are the faster they seem to go. the management suck in my opinion i feel their unorganized in many areas.
good,"What can I say, its Walmart. A pretty much cut and dry job, stock the merchandise, assist customers, help Receiving if needed, and conduct the general housekeeping needed."
good,"I worked at walmart as a cashier for one year, I didn't enjoy working there, I don't think it's a place where you can have a career, there was no chance to grow or improve."
good,I worked here for 15 years.  There were a lot of workers/bosses come and go some were great others not the best.  They didn't work as a team.  I was having health issues and they didn't really want to work with me to help.
good,The walmart I worked at was in dublin georgia and it wasnt the best experiance I had working but hope fully they have changed. Half the time we did not have air in the garden center were I was an associate. We did not get our 15 min break . And sometimes you would be the only worked in the garden center for hours because the under staffed us. I learned how to deal with many things and how to multi task and to have better customer service I also learned how to run the cash register and to stock.
good,If you want to meet the world then cashier for walmart. Everyone in your city shops there and it takes little time to get to know a large portion of them all. Many will become ' your customers' refusing to shop except on your schedule and to be checked out only in your lane.
good,I stocked shelves with product. helped customers find product in the store. and loaded their vehicles with product at different times. management was not around all the time looking over our shoulders
good,"The hardest part about the job is being nice to the customers who are clearly wrong. The work day is pretty standard, come to work take a lunch and then leave."
good,"many hours as ASM"
good,"Over all it is okay to work at Walmart, management is willing to work with your schedule. If you give them three week notice you need a day off your most likely to get it"
good,I really liked working with Walmart. The only thing that I wasn't too happy with was the hours. As a high school student sometimes working a 39 hour shift per week as a part time is a bit too much.
good,"If your'e looking for experience, this job is for you. It gives you retail and customer service experience. Stocked a lot of shelves and cashiered. It was all around a good place to start for me"
good,Opportunity for advancement was there if one wanted it. The pay was on the low part of the scale. Long hours for management. Not a very good life balance.
good,"Could have been managed better but overall fun experience. Customers are always put first but aren't always considerate, which didn't bother me but sometimes they were just plain rude. Would work there again."
good,It was fun. Some nights got boring than others. I would work there again. Standing on your feet most the time. But you get good breaks. The people were awesome & nicr
good,I enjoyed working for Walmart.  I spent 4 years with the company.  I started as a shoe department associate and was eventually promoted to a customer service manager.
good,"Very advance technology but is very fugal in other areas.  Need to invest more in people at the lower management level.  I love the security and utilizing top of the line technology to test, track, and implement quickly."
good,Walmart is a people orientated work place. Their number one concern is the costumers. The managers get hands on when needed and they care about the associates
good,"Management really needs to learn communication, the cliques need to be erased and they really need to learn to work with people that have disabilities. The need to update their policies to actually fit everyone."
good,one thing i can say about this place is that it does pay well. regardless of what the job is everyone is paid the same. i actually enjoyed the people here
good,There is not an extensive training program. The customers and co-workers are nice. The management are constantly threatening your job and there is zero tolerance for missing days.
good,"My direct Managers were great.  I enjoyed my time there. The work was not too hard.   The benefits were great when I worked there. "
good,"I enjoy working with the customers and with my fellow associates. Wal-Mart has multiple sources for you to grow and become successful at work and personally. It's like working in different stores. There is always room for improvement though, no matter where you are."
good,I don't agree with the stores policy of not being able to have your family members come to your register. I also don't need an hour lunch. When I worked there the management was not user friendly.
good,Honesty it's not a bad job. Your day goes by super fast. But you have to be a people person. If your not your going to find it extremely hard to work in retail.
good,Management was rude and inpatient. They would hardly ever hire full time because they didn't want to give benefits to the people who really needed them. Scheduling was horrible.
good,The associates at Walmart are mostly exceptionally nice people. The management was mostly very considerate. The only downside is the policy for absences is very strict and does not allow for many sick days.
good,The job is fast paced.  It really depends on who the manager is.  Some wont even let you talk to your dock neighbor.  They have some rule where.managers arent allowed to be friends with employees
good,"Managers were the sole reason it was hard to work there, as I LOVED the work itself. It was challenging enough, but rewarding by the end of the day when you knew you did your job. I have always taken a lot of pride in how hard I work. Management just doesn't care to notice anything but the bad in any and all, but seemingly pick on the hard workers the worst, ironically."
good,Didn't pay enough for the work I was doing and the years I put in there after 8 years I feel like I should have   atleast made over 10 dollars a hour.
good,"fun place to work, management is friendly, show accountability for your work and do what is expected and everything will be fine, the difficulty here is working with mostly uneducated, unmotivated associates who often slack off and make more work for everyone else."
good,"Management is terrible, over worked, not good pay, not good insurance, disrespectful supervisors, constantly cut hours, but expect you to get the same amount of work done"
good,"For the most part the work experience depends on the store.  I worked at one store that expected me to do 16 hours of work in 8 hours.  This store had  a high turnover rate and was hard to keep employees.  The store I am at now is a much better managed store.  Lower turnover rate along with a supportive management team.  There are times when the amount of work that is asked is exceeds the time time that you have to work it.  The expectations can be unreasonable.   Then the pay is not that great.  Like all retail, You are expected to work hard for low pay in order to keep prices low for competition."
good,"Trabalhei com alteração de contos, controle de pedidos de funcionários."
good,I learned a lot of customer service skills and I like working with my coworkers but sometimes rude customers make it impossible to like your job. Nut overall it is not that bad.
good,Worked with customers on a daily bases and was their end experience of the company. Learned that time is important to customers and management. Hardest part was that I has to learn to work odd hours everyday.
good,"Muy bien casi todo, menos los jefes de departamento que acosan a las compañeras"
good,"I got to work with an very special team, most of us stuck together with keeping eachother in an positive standstill no matter what was wrong. My Co worker was so very sweet and always had the heart of gold when it came to helping learn new things about the job."
good,"Good pay. as a manager you wont have a lot of family time. Great if your Single."
good,I really would prefer not to give my opinion about working for Wal*Mart.  It has no reflection on looking for a new experience or career line after being in a company for 22 yrs.
good,This job was hit or miss some days could be good and some not so good. I did like the work environment and there was a lot of opportunity for advancement
good,My experience at Walmart was good it was a good Part-Time position working with people and talking to different people.I working greeting people also at the register checking people out.
good,An average work environment with inconsistent work place policy and procedure. Strong work place environment in specific work departments but little room to advance in some departments. Will tolerate work place violence.
good,Good for the experience dealing with customers. Learning to keep your cool in a situation that you just want to explode. Time management and learning to be helpful to others.
good,I like being around the customers when they would talk about the purchases they were making.  It was a fast-paced position.  The people at the other cash register were willing to help.
good,I can't say that i would ever work for this particular branch again. They won't get a second chance from me. The management was NEVER on the same page at my location and I find that discouraging.
good,Nice job just sucks when they throw you in a random position to work when they are down workers. They could put u in as a door greeter when your cart pushing just because one decided not to show up
good,"Days can be strenuous and tough, but it also just comes with any job or place of business in which you work. It calls for a lot of physical activity, you have have a strong mind for it."
good,Mala mucho favoritismo entre los asociados y falta de oportunidad de crecimiento
good,"When I worked here, I was working in Health and Beauty. I worked evenings and the day time people would never let me know what I was suppose to do or get done during my shift. Management didnt watch the employees, we left early or whenever we wanted to and noone would tell us anything."
good,These positions consisted of several task each came its pros and cons but at the end of the day what satisfied me the most was going home knowing I did the job to the best of my abilities .
good,Sometimes management was hard to get along with but as long as you do your job to the best of your abilities you won't have any problems. Customers are always right.
good,"Most enjoyable are the customers and co workers, have learned alot working there, not really a bad company to work for, it just depends on the management team."
good,In a salaried position they require your constant commitment regardless of your home-life. There are many inexperienced leaders who are only there for their paycheck and not to take care of their associates or to help the company be successful. There are unrealistic deadlines to meet and no support from other leaders. My associates were the best part of the job. There are so many different personalities and it's a great place to work when those personalities match. Overall if I had the opportunity to work for Wal-mart in a management position again I would decline it. I put in 13 yrs and was very good at the politics of the company. However it can just wear you out. Just remember managers will always tell you what they think you want to hear.
good,I liked the job the customers was great people the store was well organized. I like the management. It was a professional and busy company that take tare of their employees. I was getting overtime. The hourly wage was okay because the overtime.
good,"I spent the whole night stocking the electronics department and answering over night phone calls. A large portion of the calls were prank calls which is kind of annoying but it is fun sometimes. Co-workers were really cool and nice, but the managers were often unreasonable. Hardest part of the job for me was taking phone calls simply because I don't like talking on the phone or callers would ask for things that I am not able to do. Most enjoyable part is getting paid"
good,Walmart is a good place to start working with no experience. There are opportunities for advancement if you work hard. If you can make it to higher levels of management you can be well compensated.
good,Top notch only problem was getting 40 hrs. Work was easy. Simple friendly ppl. Couldn't ask for an easier job store manager was good person. Straight up individual.
good,I enjoyed working here for the time I did because I got learn many aspects of the job. I was given the opportunity to work in different areas and learn about more than just the basics.
good,"They never had enough members to ever do anything, and customers would always be very stressed because they have to wait in super long lines. I was usually the one yelled at"
good,A typical day at work was me getting to work on time in an orderly fashion. I began to take the innitiative of daily routines making walmart a better and comfortable place for customers. Working at walmart taught me to be more responcible and made me understand how much potential I have to become greater than any job.
good,"Walmart overall is a great company. Yet, unfair to some positions in the work environment. Every other member with any other job position had a better hourly rate, besides cashiers."
good,you outside all day getting carts where ever those lazy custom's put them and we have to do carry outs . the limit is 20 on a machine but I put 30 or 40 because I hate making all those trips around the parking lot
good,My co-workers were great to work for but the company did not give back to the Employees. No benefits were offered and advancement was far and few between
good,"This is a huge company. The work environment can be friendly, but often overwhelming. Plenty of room for upward mobility, but very taxing and demanding work."
good,"Stockman is i geart job. Becuse you helping pepole, inside or outside of walmart. At Walmart, your in good hands of Walmart team. And you have a good team at Walmart."
good,"Every job function involves collaborative effort of every member of the team. Ultimately the pharmacist is responsible to ensuring that safe and effective medicine is dispensed to the customer. Although, each store is assigned a manager the pharmacist on duty is the manager during a particular work shift. There's always an opportunity to learn something new at the job. Learning opportunity can come from the customers we assist, technicians we work with and the healthcare providers we communicate with. Multi-tasking is a valuable skill required to perform successfully as a Pharmacist with Walmart which could be challenging at time, but its also rewarding."
good,"A typical work day includes doing everyone else's work because Walmart is short staffed all the time. A lot of the times they are calling for back up cashiers to the front, allowing other people not to get their work done."
good,I worked at Walmart before the changes so it wasn't great but it wasn't terrible. The pay was terrible but they were very understanding while I was pregnant. You have lots of opportunities to move up in the company. Pay was terrible at the time for the amount of work.
good,Es regular ya que el trabajo  es algo pesado  y algo de presion para  los  asociados
good,"I really enjoy the opportunity to learn more about the product each day, and pass that knowledge on to my clients. When handling each unloading they are not rushed, we are able to take the time to get our job done correctly"
good,"Assisting the blind shop, assist in money center cashing checks and assisting customers with money gram paying bills/sending money to others, the hardest part of the job is working with a short hand of staff, the enjoyable part of my job was meeting people from all different walks of life"
good,Walmart has great benefits and great vacation and PTO time. Most of the management is pretty rude. Scheduling is sometimes difficult because the schedule is done so far in advance.
good,I worked at Walmart as a seasonal worker during the Christmas holiday season. I feel indifferent about the experience. It wasn't too bad but it wasn't really good either.
good,"I loved my job at walmart it was one of my favorite jobs. However, I was not treated with respect. My supervisor bullied workers that have not been working in the department for long. There were only 2 people that have worked there for a long period of time, the rest of us were new and thats why she was so terrible to us because we were still learning."
good,"It's not a bad place to work, if you can deal with the  hypocrisy. Management will tell you that it's ""easy to advance"" and become a manager; but when a position opens,  they already know who they are going to promote the position. they hold interviews because they have to. "
good,Working at Walmart helped me to overcome my shyness.  I enjoyed working with my coworkers and most of the people that I came in contact with as a cashier.
good,"razoavelmente satisfatorio, pagamento em dia, oferece oportunidade de crescimento."
good,"Nothing too exciting about the job. Cashier work is to satisfy the customers needs in every way. Customers come first. Management is okay, some are great to go to for advice but some are not. The hardest part of the job is trying to be 100% perfect."
good,Unloading 2 to 3 trucks a day with a small crew was the normal for us but we worked as a unit so the production was faster even with the lack of help.
good,"I loved my job at Walmart it was close to home I had a great department manager going into work made me happy the hardest part was staying in the cooler,"
good,I was an overnight stocker at I also brought out and broke down the merchandise that was wrapped up on the pallets and then I was to place the items where they belonged.
good,"Fellow associates are willing to help out if needed,  Willing to work with availability somewhat. Pay is good. Fellow associates are easy to work with ."
good,no comment as I did not work for the company very long.  The training I received was not very through and no over time was ever allowed.. The managers that I did work under had lots of enthusiasm.
good,Make sure the customers had a good experience at the front end of the store.  Make sure the lines were not to long and customers were able to get through the lines in a timely manner.
good,"depending on your job you can have a lot of freedom there, structured job that is done by the book with proper training.  most management was friendly"
good,"Tem ótimos profissionais, uma excelente cultura, porém se perde em problemas internos."
good,Wal-Mart is a decent job to have and is only made better if your deciding to make a career of working there. If not or it's your first job is recommend just about anywhere else. The benefits to staying with Wal-Mart for the long run goes from discounts on produce to health and dental insurance also a 401k plan too.
good,the compensation was not that good but the experience is beneficial for preparing you for the next step in life. depending on the location the treatment of management may vary.
good,if you have a store that is ran properly and your co workers are not lazy it can be a great place to work with some realy good benefits. i say again not every store is ran the same even though they are suppose it ran the same way
good,"I took care of cars, and learned ALOT about vehicles while I was working there. The hardest part of the job was learning FAST about what tools apply to which vehicle for oil changing and the easiest thing was listening to music."
good,"With my experience from Wal-Mart it has help me learn the responsibilities of time management, and by that I am referring to I had a time limit to get my set task done so they can move me and help through out the store. My main task were stocking the deli wall: all the bacon, sausage, kielbasa, hot dogs, lunchables, and then lunch meat, once I got done stocking or while I was stocking I would pull everything else forward and zoned it with where it was meant to be and when I got done with that I would take my trash empty boxes plastic and pallet to the back crush the boxes put the pallet and plastic where they were meant to go and be moved to where ever they needed help"
good,Great place to work. long hrs but steady paycheck friendly coworkers benefits are OK.  hardest part of the job was being on your feet so long periods of time but breaks were given
good,Todos dependen de si mismos pocas capacitacinis malas prestación sueldos muy bajos el ambiente laboral entre trabajadores es Bueno
good,"Bonne ambiance de travail, Salaire pas insuffisant mais j'ai beaucoup aimé travailler la"
good,Management was horrible. They were more concerned about being yelled at by higher ups that they treated employees with no respect and made them feel like they weren't important.
good,"It was an okay job. Not very many hours per week, and very hard to get full time. Employees and management were very nice. They worked around my school schedule with me."
good,"fast paced, good management, they were just looking to fill their time slots,  decent place to work if you're looking to just make some money but not worth staying for a long time."
good,I would recommend to young people who would like to earn job experience working in retail or customer service. The pay when I worked there was lacking. But I heard they have since raised the bottom dollar.
good,j'était cassiere une tres bonne caissiere qui aime travailler avec le public car il ont toujours quelque choses a nous apprendre et de travailler avec beaucoup de jeune a qui on peut leur apprendre le metier
good,go in and never know what I will be doing. day to day its always different. work with others occasionally. always busy and do not really have time for my family working 3rds
good,incentive for working hard based on a predetermined time for picking cases. pto time accumulates immediately... no holiday pay any more and if you miss a day youll get terminated
good,Employer friendly only not enough help and they didn't explain the position very well. Not a place I would want a career the rest of my life. Seem they where not organized on this shift and not the right type of equipment.
good,"Come into work and be assigned to a register to check out customers efficiently. "
good,It depends on the store as to how you will be treated. Some are very good and some I'd rather be jobless.  I have been in 3 different stores and all are suppose to have the same rules but none of them follow the same rules and they defently have favorites and if your not part of those your slowly shoved out the door by lowering your hours or the way you are treated on a daily basis.
good,Walmart says they work with your schedule but when it comes down to it they do not they will step you down in rank and the need to work with single mothers as well
good,"Bastante trabalho, ambiente ótimo de trabalho clientes maravilhosos."
good,This is a very busy pharmacy and requires various knowledge of pharmacy. The hardest part of the job is other employees not doing what they need to do.
good,A typical at Walmart includes constant customer interactions at point of sale and also handling customer inquiries. I have learned how to better deal with customer complaints and certain inquiries.  Management has been informative and diligent in training. The hardest part of my job was dealing with customer complaints and making sure they are content. The most enjoyable part is meeting the needs of consumers.
good,"this company was very productive, i unloaded trucks, and brought the merchandise out on the floor, at Christmas time we would get two to four trucks a day. ."
good,My typical work day started relaxed and things stared to speed up as the day progressed. Working at Wal-Mart wasn't the best job but it paid the bills.
good,I love work with customer. They will help you to appreciate other people.You see there are some people are more unfortunately not as happy with there life.They customer  make you have a good day.
good,Una empresa buena pero la calidad de vida es algo que les falta como empresa
good,"Seasonal employment working 12 hour shifts 5-6 days a week until Christmas was over.  Forklift experience, shipping & receiving, restocking, Product Flow Coordinator.  Was able to train in several different areas and gain more knowledge."
good,Buen ambiente laboan con un receso de diez minutos para tomar cafe.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart, it is a good first job I would say because it's good pay and the managers and the other employees are nice to work with."
good,as a cashier i would mostly handle customer transactions and make sure i was up to date in the knowledge of current promotions that were being offered in the store.
good,"A fast paced environment, along with slow moving process. I gained skills such as learning new machinery, working with peers, and the life of a warehouse. Management was very pleasant but not very present at the times of need."
good,"Challenging environment for a manger, fast paced atmosphere.  Work life balance is tough.   Pay well with experience.  Big work load to take on in the smaller formats."
good,You have to be able to mulittask and work long hours on your feet. Pharmacists will make or break the work experience. The hours each week with change day by day depending on other techs.
good,"Participated in stocking of goods and products through the store, in addition to coordinating with senior leadership on inventory control initiatives and planning."
good,"I was pregnant and the staffing had a lot of picks and chose, you couldn't do certain things, they fussed when you needed to sit down after standing so long, yes they did give breaks in between but at time you be so busy and couldn't leave"
good,"Over the years I have learned many things working for Wal-Mart.  I have incorporated the 4 basic beliefs in my everyday life: Respect for the individual, strive for excellence, Service to the customer, and acting with integrity. I am continually learning new things as technological changes effect the company.  I love the fact that the company is so in tuned with assisting the communities in which it resides in."
good,Work load may be a little stressful at times but working with the right team can change that. Hours are flexible. Best part of the job is satisfying the customers needs.
good,days consisted of scanning and weighing products. bagging customer items returning items that were not satisfying or broken. handling customer complaints.
good,Super easy job nothing to fancy it paid the bills for a short while met some good people. Just depends on management to be honest. Break room was nice though
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo Unq la hora de comida no alcanza
good,"hard and stressful job"
good,Walmart is a good job The Walmart in Laplace I used to work at was disorganized and the employees and managers were unprofessional. It was always hot.
good,Walmart wasnt somewhere i wanted to be working at but i ended up there for a little over a year.. it was stressful and i didnt like most of the managers there but in the end it paid the bills.
good,I felt like it was very helpful I like this website a lot. It was fast and easy. Very useful and helps I'm glad I used it. I will use it whenever I'm looking for a job.
good,"very stressful, not enough help, low pay, pressure from corporate people, little appreciation, However I enjoyed my coworkers and the patients that we dealt with"
good,"Semi-fun place to work.  Put up stock and check out customers, when completed bring more stock to the floor and do it all over again.  Kind of repetitive, day in and day out, with low pay."
good,Overall walmart excells when it comes to productivity and organization. Walmart strives in making sure that customs are shopping in a clean and safe environment.
good,Show up to work and try to help as many customers as possible while getting along with your coworkers. 15 min breaks every 2 hours followed by 1 Hour Lunch every 4 hours.
good,"The best part about Walmart that I believe was working with the customers, getting to know your customers and having them return to your lane to scan their products."
good,I worked at Walmart Neighborhood Market and the hours were great as a cap team 2 employee but everything was just very unorganized and unprofessional.
good,i had to force myself work overnight because they re paying more money during the night and then when i decided i had it enough with night since im 25 i dont want to miss out of life and lifes so short. i decided i want to switch to day shift and they want to take dollar and 50 cent off that i worked so hard for 4 years! not right and its very wrong
good,This summer job gave me the opportunity to earn some money with flexible hours while working locally.  I enjoyed working during the busy summer season and helping customers prepare for their summer holiday.
good,"The managers took entirely too long to respond to cashiers' needs which resulted in angry customers taking out their frustrations on the people that were simply trying to help them. The people there liked to start rumors and were very interested in others' business. Other than that, it was an ok place to work in."
good,"Assisting customers with purchase and questions."
good,I loved the job because I love being around new people and being able to help them with Find what they need and getting them were they want to come back
good,"A typical day at Walmart could be fast paced or very slow. It really depends where you were at. Same with management, it really depends what location you are at."
good,Great company and excellent experience! Responsible for developing the southeast region for my company's assets. Excellent co workers and very macro based company!
good,"Benefits are good. attendance is too strict. only allowed 4 days in a 6 month time frame. expected to do more than your job description entitles. management can sometimes be good, but more than often they are lazy."
good,"My time at Walmart, although short, was quite enjoyable. I liked the interaction that I had with customers and even appreciated the compliments I got on my smile. The management is what gave this review a 3 start because sometimes they were for the employees and at other times, they weren't. It was kind of an up and down experience. It just depended on the day."
good,"Wal-Mart Northside was a good place to work they always had lots to do, dairy and helping other departments and also helping out 2nd instock crew pull from the truck and clear out zoning area, lot of hard work which I enjoyed"
good,"When I worked with Walmart North side I found it to be a good job with hard work and lots to do, which made time fly by and the co-workers were helpful and I enjoyed jobs like counts, binning and when we load stock for all departments"
good,The department i work in has VERY high expectations. It has been made near impossible to perform all the job functions at the level they expect. Wal-Mart seemed to look out for it's employees until I witnessed first hand how they apologetically deny any help.
good,Walmart is an good place to work for a couple of years. But I'm looking g for other job because I will love to work with cars and I will like to move on from Walmart
good,Unloading trucks taught me how to be a Hard worker ....I also learned about Team work .....often worked past midnight ....learned about different departments
good,I had the pleasure of working with experience service techs that helped me learn the ins and outs of car service. I was able to earn their respect by listening to their needs and going to bat for them with management. I also got dirty sweaty with them because the shop was kind of hot. But all and all I wouldn't change the experience at all.
good,"Walmart is a friendly environment work place where we provide good customer service and help maintain a safe environment to work at."
good,"Wal mart was a fast paced work place with strategically placed associates to keep operations as smooth as possible. Wal Mart didn't pay enough to keep me around and the work load was not equal to the pay I received ."
good,"Cobro de mercancía general, atención y buen trato al cliente, así como también algunas veces auxiliar en áreas dentro de la tienda en piso de venta, tales como jardinería, abarrotes, bodega etc"
good,"customer servie, meal prep, and cleaning. I feel as if management could pay more attention to the associates needs in theyre department. Associates in the deli are up front with the customers taking care of them as well as cooking, inventory and cleaning. Having the right amount of coverage is important."
good,Wal-Mart is a very easy job. They are not really good with time off if it's for family it is like they think its just time you're not working an can care less.
good,"fast pace, I have not learned anything that I didn't already know, need to improve on the management a normal workplace culture, nothing hard, working as a team is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"If staff is loyal to employer and provides good customer service, then, this becomes a great place to work and shop.  Management has demand quality service from employees."
good,"Llegar con el uniforme puesto, pedir fondo del dia y comenzar a atender la caja. Dias que no hay mucha gente, ayudar a repositores"
good,Safe to say its easy to work at. People are really nice and easy to approach .Just stocking and zoning and perfecting isles for the departments I'm assigned on.
good,"Wal-Mart you learn to do a lot in time "
good,On a Typical day I would clock in check my emails. Check all my merchandise protected equipment. Fallow up with associates and management. Walk the sales floor as an undercover associate dressed in plain clothes identifying potential shop lifters.
good,"I've worked at 2 different walmart, and so far I've noticed that they both have bad management. The managers are usually gone for weeks  and you can't get help with anything when you need it."
good,a good company to work for if it is your first job or you are in school can not make a living here but A great first job and good benefits. have nothing bad to say about them
good,"For a DM be prepared to do paper work and stocking shelfs and being prepared for anything. And ready to learn new things such as register,keeping you department updated and ready for customers to shop in."
good,I love Wal-Mart great deals and there is everything I need in one store ...as far as corporate Wal-Mart being apart of there team is very difficult overwhelming and much like high school
good,stocking was physically exhausting not worth the pay. although the people were amazing the job itself was not what i wanted. I do know many people who have excelled.
good,day at work is always busy management is sometimes good i learned how too pretty much do the whole store how too work the register how to cook how to work the fright
good,I learned how to work in a high stressed job but it  was not very tolerant of family first. Management was sometimes short tempered. The best part of the job was the customers.
good,"●	Maintained clean and neat station and ensured registers were balanced and functioning."
good,"Simple work, can be repetitive. If you need help with any task, a customer has a question you don't know the answer to, or need machine operation explained to you, then you're very unlikely to get help in a timely manner."
good,Fun friendly ppl. Scheduling is horrible and understaffed but good pay. Manager young but promising and kind and willing to do what it takes in order to run a productive store
good,I learned that not everyone is committed to doing the job that they are supposed to. The hardest part was the working nights part. Management wasn't really the best at that particular store.
good,i started in the garden center then went to crafts and fabric then to the bakery. i love decorating the cakes. i learned so much and worked in every department at walmart.
good,While in college I worked at Wal-Mart. My managers knew that I was in school and that would be my first priority so they worked really well with my schedule and if I needed to request days off. They were also willing to work with me on holidays because I was a couple of hours away from my family. One thing I did not like about working there was that because I was in school they would not allow me to move up in the company which I did not think was fair because I always received good reviews from customers as well as co-workers.
good,It's Walmart. If you have another option go with that option of employment. There is never enough employees to complement the high demand of customers.
good,it was just an okay place to work but as far as maigment goes they could put in more effort with employees and not focus so much on customer service and i do understand that customer service is important
good,"fast paced environment, nut sometimes could not find enough tasks in the day, supervisors were ok but not the greatest to work for and they pay was less than ideal."
good,"As with any job, this can be a good company to work for.  Despite the fact that people don`t agree with the wages paid to employees, this company does do a lot for communities (food drives, Breakfast Club of Canada, etc.)"
good,gained allot of experience with this company.  started as an hourly associate and worked my way up to a management position.  learned hour to work with different associates.
good,"It wasn't a bad place to work, well at least in my position. The store I work at was filled with a great group of folks and were a joy to work around."
good,"Although they pay a lot, the higher ups at Wal-mart do not see you as a person, and all they care about is making more money for themselves. You literally have to be dying to call in sick, and even then they'll probably just replace you."
good,"it can be stressful. be prepared to do more that what the job says. you'll meet a lot of people and will get along greatly with people. When requesting time off, do it three or more weeks ahead and to tell a manager once you do."
good,great customer service and friendly co workers. there is a lot of opportunities to move up at walmart but they dont pay really well. you dont get a big enough raise every year.
good,"Typically I received shipments of fresh, freezer and dairy foods for inspection. I then conducted in house inspections for stored foods to maintain proper temperatures and storage times."
good,"my review of walmart come from 4 times working there at 3 different locations, two supercenters ands one neighborhood market, over all a good starting job for the young but it takes years of waiting for promotions or store tranfers and even department tranfers, no overtime and not enough management support for associates to complete tasks"
good,I would say that my experience working at Walmart would be up and down. Meaning that management was to strict on their employees and their trust varied from each employee. I did enjoy working for Walmart but would not consider it to be a lifelong career choice for me.
good,"I worked night shift so my work environment as far as customers goes was very slow. There were things you had to do like stocking shelves by the registers, but you got benefits and an hour lunch break."
good,"My time at Wal-Mart was time well spent. I may not have been able to learn everything, but the little bit of time I was there I learned a lot of employability skills"
good,"Semi cool place to work , some managers where snotty and thought they were better than some employees and they customers where a little rude but I really cool place to work ."
good,Walmart is a good retail store where people works hard and keep progressing. They also give incentives and medical benefits to their employees. They believe in making their customers happy. They also take care of their associates.
good,What can I say??? Its great if you can maintain a good work/life balance. Also must me able to lift heavy all day usually 12 hours a day. Not for everyone.
good,walmart was a good job i kept count on inventory make sure the shelves was stocked  make sure the cart was stocked and help out customer on the floor when needed
good,Loved Greening Walmart customers and helping them to locate items that they need it. Very happy to help people get their children into cards and also the elderly on the electric carts. kept the area clean especially during rainy days and snow days to ensure customer safety.
good,I enjoyed working with others and being a team player. I was consistently a team player and multitasked with everything I did. I liked my job in apparel working with customers.
good,You can work here if you want time to go to school. Management can be pretty flexible when it comes to needing time to go to school. Take advantage of it and better yourself
good,The place is okay to work. For the most part you'll know what your job duties are. If your competent management will leave you to your work. The pay raises are a joke. If you want to work here only do it for less than a year (which in all likeliness Walmart wants). Schedule is consistent and getting time off is easy as well. You'll get good management and bad management.
good,"easy to learn, easy to do, the job is very basic and the pay reflects that. Most things you learn should be common sense. The turn over rate is pretty high."
good,Pleasant work place.  Easy.  Sometimes the days drag on but it's a good environment.  Will never have to miss a scheduled break or something.  decent benefits for full timers.
good,A typical day at Walmart is pretty fast paced and can be enjoyable if you handle it right. Managers are friendly for the most part. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers can be rude but the most enjoyable part is working with people whose company you enjoy.
good,It has its small town clicks but all in all its a decent part time job in town...... The Incentive programs a fun team building days are a cool aspect
good,"it was 3rd shift so it wasn't my best time to work... but I knew a lot about the store, and I think that they could have treated their employees a whole lot better"
good,Typical day at work is to help customers find their needs and answer their questions regarding products. Have to be able to handle customer complaints properly. Management can be difficult if they're not on top of things.
good,"While I didn't particularly care for the role of front-end cashier, I loved working the customer service counter and layaway, before they terminated their layaway program."
good,Managament needs improvement.. Co-workers are great to work with and very helpful. Getting time off is very hard to get if when you request months in advance.
good,enjoyed working with the customers and helping them. I did not work for WalMart directly. I was offered by management a bakery job in evan mills store the day of my last event for crossmark .
good,"As the largest retail chain in the world, Walmart must hire on and maintain sizable staffs of sales associates to provide customer service. Workers falling under the job title of sales associate take responsibility for greeting customers, locating products, price-checking items, and organizing store shelves and displays. Sales associates also answer customer questions about policies, services, and products. Returning carts to store frontends also serves as a typical, daily responsibility of sales associates."
good,"A great place to work, the job is easy to get. I worked in the automotive department, so i took orders and ran the cash register. At night i zoned the shelves."
good,"Most Walmarts are decent to work for, but there are a few bad apples. Always ask the employees there how they like working there before applying to that specific store. "
good,"cant say anything about Walmart that everyone doesn't already know, not a horrible company to work for....................................................."
good,It was cool and laid back sometimes hard to work with things going on. you learn very quickly and get opt to it I enjoyed working there and would love to go back if I had the chance.
good,"I worked as a cashier before I was promoted to the customer service desk. The hours were pretty consistent and stable. Its very busy and fast paced.  However, there are too many trying to be management who aren't. This causes issues among employees. Also, they are not understanding when it comes to scheduling."
good,It was an ok job. I did my work that I needed then I went looking for more. Just before I moved on to the career that I wanted to be doing I was doing the over night stocking in three different departments. they asked me if I wanted to move up but since I was not wanting to stay they as a career I said no.
good,"It was an ok place to work, wish the hours would have been more definitive and pay a little better. I liked the people that I worked with, and would definitely go back again."
good,"Stock toys, keep toy section clean and organized. I help in other areas if need. Management is nice and I've learned that walmart is helpful. The workplace is very busy"
good,"Working at Walmart was a challenging but fun experience. I was constantly on the move and doing something to help the store, whether it was cleaning the floors or helping with stockers. It was overall a decent experience."
good,i worked there on 3 month contract very friendly atmosphere some heavy work required in some departments good discounts for the staff working there.Good company to work on permanent basis
good,"The permanent employees were helpful,  I learned the layout of a Walmart store, I got to work in several different departments and hoped they would hire me as a permanent employee but they didn't."
good,depending on your store you could have good or bad management....we had to take hour long lunches which put you there 9 hours instead of 8 or 8.5.....
good,Great people to work around. Different people made each day delightful. You meet new people everyday. And as long as you do your job most days were great.
good,"Is constantly busy, you are crossed trained and is benefited from that because you gain a lot of knowledge from the managers you work with. It also puts your foot in the door to have a possible position in management with you being experienced in more than one department in the store."
good,"It's a good place to work, very busy, keeps you going. Customer service isn't for everyone though so make sure have a tolerance for people with attitude"
good,It's an ok place to work if you have no outside life beside walmart. I wouldn't go back unless i was absolutely had to. The benefits really suck and aren't cheap.
good,"Some Co store managers (not all) do not know how to talk to others. They do not show respect towards the employees. They speak down to them and their expectations are way to high. If not fully staffed, they expect to get work done in a time manner as if they are fully staffed."
good,"I found the work at Walmart very satisfying; however the pay was extremely, and pitifully, low. I think there may have been some improvement in this regard in recent years, but it's still not enough for the average adult to pay their bills. I also think the culture has changed at the company and that's a shame-I preferred the Sam Walton version."
good,"The customers would switch between either flowing in constantly, or coming in periodically. Te hardest part was keeping up with everyone when one of the registers was locked and we had to wait for a manger."
good,"before you begin to work there is a meeting, where you then see what part of the store you will be working. you then stock and face the products. management was ok, nothing too hard about the job."
good,"Good company to work for, benefits are good the family environment is wonderful.Breaks and lunches are good the holidays are special as well.The bonuses are a plus the holiday meals are a plus​ discount on certain items."
good,the manger was very rude they would put me on the schedule for one day and then I come in and they say I suppose to work later and I have to go back home. there was never enough cashier at the front of the store so the line were long
good,"Working at Walmart is fun when there is no drama, and the mangers are doing what they are suppose to. Working with customers one on one is exciting as well."
good,"A typical day a Wal-Mart is pretty much like any other job dealing with retail. The hardest part was being in a area were you had to be relieve, because people took there time getting to there work station, and management always looked the other way"
good,I learn how to deal with difficult situations. I learn to give a great and positive customer service. I learn how to reorder merchandiser and how to deal with a cash register.
good,"It was a good overall experience"
good,Every year the changes that are made are most of the time horrible. At least 50 percent of the large changes that are made are reversed after a few months.
good,Walmart is a job that if you do your work and get things done like they want you to do they will leave you alone but you are watched like a hawk and dont stand around for long you ll get in trouble
good,good place to work in beginning. not much learning and career enhancement. boring some times. very friendly co-workers. focus on displaying products and learning visual presentation on floor.
good,"bajos salarios, no hay mucho crecimiento , poco tiempo libre"
good,"Pretty easy job come in get done what you need to get done for the day and go home , some assignments may be difficult but there's always helpful co-workers."
good,It is very easy to move up in the company and management works with you. A negative is the thin line between employee and paid slave. Saying that employees are overworked is an understatement.
good,"It is a nice place to work for if you are planning on getting nowhere or if you are still in high school. For me it wasn't horrible at first by they screw up hours for everyone if you are part time, if you are full time you gain more. Management was pretty good some of them know what they are doing, others not so much."
good,"Learned to work under stress, lift heavy packages safely, and stay on my feet for the entirety of my shift. "
good,"It is very numbers oriented, working for Walmart, the bottom dollar is king, it seems.  Customer service is not where I believe it should be. and Associate care is dwindling with removal of benefits and lack of incentive."
good,Walmart allowed me to gain customer service experience before I considered to go into the corporate world. I did not like it only because they did not compensate me enough for the amount of work I was doing.
good,Easy going for the most part. Also all the thibgs they teach you are fairly easy everything is common sense. Everything is self explanatory. My training was descriptive and brief
good,"Learned how to stack a pallet the correct way, how to stock in new merchandise, how to unload a freight truck, and how to build end cap displays. This is where I learned most of my people skills."
good,"I liked working at Walmart at the beginning when I first started. But whenever I would bring up any issue to management, it was like they didn't care."
good,This job was decent considering the fact that most people qwould say its cold inside if the freezers. This was mainly due to my fellow associates and manager being such cool and reliable people
good,The mangers do not know how to treat the associate with respect. They are so unprofessional. managers don't communicate with each other. managers need more leadership skills
good,I worked for Walmart for 17 years. I enjoyed the learning experience of going through the Management Training Program. I learned how to handle many varied situations that arise in Retail.
good,"Walmart is a type of company that you can grow in if that is your environment and if it is not then you will not grow, you can succeed but you have to not have a family because you will be working alot of hours and sometimes the pay does not equal what you go through"
good,pay is alright meet some of my closest friend working here so all in all not bad i would go back if i had too. some management is alright others not so much
good,Wal-Mart is ok I would not mind going back but only if they would listen to what others have to say or think they are fairly good at maintenance and equality
good,Store 5062 is extremely unorganized and not well put together. New management is very much needed and I cant wait until things are done so for myself and other employees.
good,the job I had to do had to do with customers coming in to get the items they needed. I rang there items up or directed them personally to the items they are looking for. I understand the duties I had to do.
good,"Easy place to work. Basic tasks are assigned, such as cleaning up the front end, putting merchandise back on the shelf and providing good customer service"
good,Walmart DC is a Fast pace environment  It's not cut throat but do Production/QA is tuff to achieve in different areas. Overall not a bad place to work & pay is higher than most.
good,"I don't really have anything good or bad to say about this job. It was an alright job, I didn't really like it but I didn't hate either. One positive thing is they are organized. Only negative thing I can think of is the managers play favorites."
good,"Wal-Mart Corporation is like many large corporate affiliations, making money is what they do...bottom line.  If you do not have the energy or the desire to push yourself beyond your limits you will not succeed here.  They do have decent benefits and are very willing to promote from within, but with those goes the need to focus strictly on a career with them.  "
good,walmart is really flexible with your shcedule im not really a fan of walmart anymore but while i did worked there the enviornment was nice and i had fun meeting and attending customers
good,Depending on your shift hours you could be able to have a great balance in between the two. With the right hours you could attend school or training while being employed.
good,Walmart offers a good work environment with a supportive and positive team. Confidentiality is critical and taken very seriously. All employees are very friendly.
good,"Es una empresa que me brindo mucho aprendizaje ya que requiere manejar las funciones con velocidad y bien elaboradas, aprendi a manejar mejor Excel y a trabajar bajo presion. Fui capacitada por mis superiores y al final otorgue un buen resultado."
good,I have worked at two different walmarts in 4 different positions. My take-away is that the company can be great or terrible to work for and it all depends on your coworkers and management.
good,My overall experience working at Wal-Mart was okay. Its a place to get customer service experience if you want customer service experience. They will work with your school schedule if you are in school.
good,"Working for Walmart was fun, we met a lot of new people every day and were able to assist a variety of people on a daily basis. There is a lot of opportunity to advance to a higher paid position."
good,"Moral is kept low, with management forcing overly strenuous work on employees, while offering no gratitude or compliments to the job. You may have unloaded a whole truck without taking a break; since it was expressed with an urgency to be completed; but you don't get a single 'good job'."
good,"Walmarts provides it's employees great opportunity to advance and grow with the company as a whole, overall it is a well organized job, and certainly it feels like a team effort when working with my fellow employees; however I want the chance to grow to bigger and better heights. without the limitation of minimum wage, because let's be honest... no one can survive on miminum wage, hence why people always strive to  put themselves in a better position, and I am the kind of person who likes to work hard and learn new things at the same time!"
good,It was a great starter position that helped get my feet wet. I would recommend to college students. It would be a perfect starting position for young adults.
good,"I liked working here because they always pushed me to do better but it was only 10 an hour for some very very taxing physical labor, which I don't mind, but also they made me pick up a ton of other people's slack which I didn't appreciate."
good,"A typical day at work can be slightly hectic but still peacefully maintained by insuring proper work technique and demonstrating excellent customer service. Working at Wal-Mart I've learned that communication is a key ingredient to a successful and productive day on the job; you get out what you put in. I've also come to learn that the management is exceptionally fair but slightly unreliable at times. The co-workers are probably the best part of the job, everybody knows everybody and we help each other get through the day. While every job has its perks, it also comes with some down-side. One of the only things I would consider to be a downside when it comes to being employed at Wal-Mart would be the constant struggle to maintain excellent work production while staying within the strict rules/guidelines."
good,Working with Walmart I have had job security in a friendly environment. Walmart puts an emphasis on customer service as well as an inviting environment for employees.
good,"my typical work day would be taking the course on the computer, then going in to check the customers items. I learned how to ring up customers items, providing customer service. The management is not too bad I guess I can say on  my part the one only thing I had an issue was to change my schedule for the reason being that it was hard to get off from work. no buses run in area and I didn't have any source of income to help me get home after I get off, they didn't understand, or was willing to try to change my schedule so I can make it to work. the job isn't hard just trying to remember what you learned and to apply it to the customers. the most part that is enjoyable is enteracting with customers."
good,"Typical day is like working for other corporate america corporation where you are required to work but for more than regular 8 hour work day. If you are in the right group, you could learn very much since technology is not an issue. There is this mentor system that translates to how you know. The hardest part is the company's over reliant on vendors to perform the work while direct employees do less that will develop their skill sets. Being in the right group/team that uses new technology stack is always enjoyable."
good,"This job would be great for anyone just starting out. not too fast paced, easy going, and easy to learn. The manager was really nice and easy going, also very understanding, would recommend this job to teens just starting out."
good,Not a bad starting job. Although it seems to be extremely difficult to advance at all throughout the company. Good for a period of time but not the best for a long term commitment.
good,"I worked over night so, not to much trouble with management and shoppers. As a shelf stocker- there were nights that were smooth and others that were not."
good,"Not very happy with this company.  I thought Walmart was a company who was a family oriented and wanted to ensure customers were looked after...Not True, Not True at all."
good,"it could be better, sometimes the way the managers work is very unfair they should care more about their employees instead of trying to belittle people"
good,Wal - Mart Has done a great job of helping me support my family. There have been times I needed time with my family they were very good at allowing me to do so .
good,There's always work to be done and half the time they give you a new task before your even allowed to complete the other. But oversell they're good with fitting your schedule and giving you lunch and breaks.
good,Walmart as a cashier is always productive and you will always have work or are moving around. It requires a lot of standing but it is a pretty easy job.
good,THis job is okay but they do not care about the employees and your hours are all over the place unless you have a lot of years invested. Not worth your time.
good,"I worked from 10-7 in the morning I worked apparel (men,kids,baby,womens) we would unbox and take off the plastic of each piece of shirt and size the then put them on the tables and clean as we go then we would do the shoes unboxing and scanning. we would do ticketing,clearance,markdowns,signing,replacement and claims. management we did not have a store manager for months we had two supervisors that both wanted to run things but were bumping heads but our night time supervisor was a hard worker she push to make the store look its best . she loved working as a time she was never afraid to get her hands dirty. as for the culture did not feel like there was one. The hardest part of the job would be trying to stay up and have a past to get the job done. The most  enjoyable part of the jobs is being able to work together as a team."
good,"Working at Walmart was a great experience. Learning how to read labels, stock things properly, and also learning how to use the cash register was fun. The management was awesome they made sure everything was up to par as far as staff and customers. The workplace culture was actually getting together it was a new store so things were actually falling into place. The hardest part of my job was when I first started I couldn't find the places where certain things were placed. A little help from the management I got easy to me. The most enjoyable part of my job was finishing my tasks knowing I did my job and can help others with theirs or start on a new one until I clocked out."
good,I like the job but it needs more employees and managers that really wants to work and not just to come to work just to get a work check it's a good company n they also pay good just need better employees and managers
good,"i learned how to correctly manage money , training was a great part of my experience , and the work place culture is very good , management is perfect with keeping up with every employee"
good,"worked as a cashier, check out customers with their purchase.  help customers find what they needed, great customers with kindness and humility.  be prices with money and counting."
good,Not a very friendly place to work. Not really good hours. Would of liked to do more photography choices then just the sit and pose. Wouldn't work there again.
good,Not very well of managing skills for employee training. Management needs more improvement. I learned 2 skills for this position buffing and pushing carts. Managers not train me for this position.
good,"is very busy"
good,"I quit another grocery store chain as a cashier to move here, and it was a surprising improvement. However, this is compared to my terrible experience at the last company, so my standards weren't high. As a high school student, this is a really good job and because it's a big store, there's always hours and shifts to take. Overall it's a friendly, casual environment that I enjoyed and it was easy to make friends. The job gets old and repetitive, and managers are constantly making pointless and annoying changes to the workplace, which ultimately lead me to leave."
good,"check my task schedule, count the number of pallets and stock items, Separate products,"
good,it was a calm work day and relaxing. i learned how to work with others. the most enjoyable part was being able to work with others. the work culture was calm.
good,"I liked working at WalMart, however, the pay could've been better. The inconsistent hours were a bummer, but remember this is retail. The management could use some work but overall I didn't hate it. It was time to move on though. A typical day would be ""zoning the aisle and making sure your register was set and ready to go. Check out customers and try to move as quickly and efficiently as possible. Breaks were sometimes late if we were really busy and lacked back up. We did have an hour for lunch so I really enjoyed that aspect of it. It's a good job to build people and team work skills."
good,Good company to work for with great benefits and good compensation package. Networking and various mentor/ mentee relationships is key to building a career and growing within the company.
good,Walmart was great at first but the last few years became in expectable Since corporate took over you were treated like a number not part of a team. There is no job security anymore. After nine years of dedicated service I was on the same level as a 6 month employee. My Managers were always awesome. But to corporate I was just a number. Very sad!!
good,"I had to work here and it was an experience ill never do again. It was alot of work for very little money. Terrible management, at least at the walmart I was at."
good,"Like any other company, working at Walmart has it's ups and downs."
good,Worked in a local retail store. Maintained checkout operation following policies and procedures. Verified credit acceptance by reviewing and recording customer driver's license number. Worked with diverse population. Operated the credit card authorization system.
good,"It is a great place to start as a first job, but is not a place i would consider making a career out of. It is for some people a small job to keep busy. It requires long hours of standing up and walking with little amount of rest during. Breaks are short and lunches are sometimes cut short."
good,Good environment Great people good atmosphere you can learn alot of new things to move up in ur position if you would like to just a fun place to work
good,we had long hard shifts. we had to transfer products from one cart to another with barely any help. there was favoritism shown only certain people got to work overtime
good,"fun place to work, productive. very busy during weekends. morning shifts are slow, not very busy. stocking merchandise on weekends is difficult. helping customers is a satisfaction."
good,the pay is good but the graveyard shift is not for everyone the graveyard shift if the time to deep clean the entire store it is not for someone with a light stomach
good,"There is a lot to do, if your department doesn't have any work to be done for the day, your supervisors will always make sure to have you busy and bored."
good,Walmart was a family is was always slow going but it gave you time to do the job right and make it look good doing it everyone was friendly and as helpful as ever
good,"Working at Walmart there were some good days and some bad days."
good,L'équipe de travail aux caisses est soudées et agréable.
good,walmart showed me a lot about how things work in that type of working field. i learned a lot about pricing and also keeping stock of the products i have
good,Loved meeting new people .. loved my csm the pay could have been better being that I was trained in several different areas on the front end over all it was good
good,"On a typical day at work I would be faced with keeping up with customers in about eight or so departments because management would schedule people for closing and I would open. Thanks to this, I have learned important skills and lessons, such as being able to do the work of a team of five or six by myself in an adequate amount of time. Which, really is the hardest part about the job, but I did love the people. Individually the people were great and it was like a close knit family."
good,This was my first job out of college.  I worked very long hours but I did get great experience and worked with very talented individuals.  I would work there again.
good,"I worked in jewelry and shoes and I was mainly doing both at the same time , I loved my job and enjoyed working with others, meeting new people and learning new things"
good,"Learned many new skills involved in cashiering, including payroll check cashing, WIC and LINK payments, Walmart's computer system, handling difficult customers"
good,When I first started the job the benefits were great and the management was helpful. After years of service things changed dramatically. Customers had long wait times for prescriptions which made them very unhappy.
good,"you have to work nine hour days five days a week, management is unwilling to work around your personal life.  you stay busy all day with repetitive tasks."
good,The job was fine but i needed a real job. I worked and did my job as well as I could. I have bills I have to be able to pay and I needed a better job.
good,"I love the people I work with day to day,but the company doesn't care for the associates like they should. They take away anything that benefits you in the slightest bit."
good,"I have learned quite a lot in my time at Walmart and I have met an amazing group of people while working there. It definitely gets crowded and hectic while picking customers orders, believe it or not. It can get really stressful and frustrating sometimes but it's kind of expected when you're working for a multi-billion dollar company. Best thing i have gotten out of my time in Walmart was the many coworkers I have met."
good,the company is great. the pay is really low for me. the benefits were okay and I had to work hard to even receive the benefits . scheduling was always a problem
good,I have taught myself everything I know about this job.I have been offered management position after 6 months of being there..I handle money and I run self checkout and customers needs
good,Expected and demanded to do a lot. This can be a very stressful environment and fast paced a majority of the time. Given a store discount as a benefit.
good,20 years ago was great company to work for . Have changed so much they are in competition. With themselves and have gotten to greedy . They want to much
good,It was a good place to work just needed to make more money so I could get my own place and a car. Was not bringing home enough to do this. Loved working with the public and co-workers.
good,"Decent place to work at, but compensation is very weak and possibility for advancement was slim and even if you wanted to advance, the amount of work expected of someone in management was much more than what the pay was worth."
good,My job at Walmart was a cashier.  It was a very busy store with a lot of opportunities for employment.  I would recommend to any one looking for a job.
good,"starts at 10pm find out were you are lowcated at like the g.m side or groceries, get what you need to start your work etc. pallet jack plastic bag for plastic garbage only. punch into your task to get started then when all done task out, then clean up and get ready to face the product on the shelves. then trry to move on to help your team members out."
good,"I enjoyed working at wal-mart, although the hours were just not compatible with my home schedule. I enjoyed the people I worked with as well as the customers."
good,"Jack in the box was a great company to work for, managment was not as helpfull with my schedule, i worked crazy hours and at the end it had gotten to overwelming. other than the hours, this company was great. it had awsome customer service."
good,"It's ok, a good place to gain work experience. There are to many managers and supervisors and team leads and they never seem to have the answer to your questions. Your constantly being directed to different people."
good,"When I  graduated from college, Management was not helpful in helping me to be successful and move forward within the company. Other than that, it was a great job to have while trying to maintain myself in college."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, pocas oportunidades de crecimiento."
good,Walmart is a good stepping stone job if you are between jobs. The company needs to take care of their employees better. Their benefits packages need to be better. They will hire you full time and only give you part time hours. They need to take care of their hourly managers better. A Customer Service Manager should not make less than a new cashier coming in the door.
good,I enjoyed my time at Walmart.  The teams that I worked with felt more like family than corporate America.  The best part of every day was watching how the business continued to grow so that we could continue to save people money so that they could live better.
good,It's a decent place to work. Does pay well and most of the time they work with your schedule. They have part time and fill time positions available to you.
good,Good pay.. good benefits. 10 % employee discount. Advancement possibilities if desired. They tend  to cut hours often if sales are down. Be prepared for constant change.
good,"Meu dia era estudar e ir trabalhar, eu gostava sim de trabalhar, aprendi a ter responsabilidade pontualidade aprendi a trabalhar em grupo, a ter paciência e hoje sei como usar tudo oque aprendi!"
good,Its a very demanding job. You have to be willing to work and do what ever it takes. Because that is what they are looking for. So if you can do that there is no problem.
good,"Manejo de efectivo a grandes cantidades, atencion al cliente"
good,"Working here was okay. It was a job. I don't really have too much to say about my employment her.e I learned that customer service is definitely  a field that I love . I went to work, did my job and went home."
good,This job paid decent but it was not enough. It was very busy all the time and I was always tired when I got off. I was about 7 months pregnant when i was bout to go on maternity leave and they laid me off
good,its OK if you do not get any what they call coachings the is a three strike  rule. my hardest parts were not getting enough help with the carts when it was needed the best parts were allot of customers were really friendly.
good,"Being a first line of management was hard. There is almost a constant flow of customers 24/7 and there seems to always be issues from them. Customers at Wal-Mart can get in your face and half the time management does nothing, at least in my experience."
good,The job had many opportunities to learn new skills but no room for advancement unless to relocate to Arkansas. There was really no room for advancement in the call center.
good,It's a good job I learned  alot.        I'm very thankful for the opportunity  to work here the customer ate nice and so re employees   quality by hssbshsb
good,"My job was easy taking care of customers, and doing whatever I could to make my customers happy. The only problem I really had working at Walmart is management didn't treat us fair. They had there favorites and treated the other employees unfairly. Management would also talk about other employees to other associates. I loved my job just didn't like the workplace that went along with it."
good,"I think that walmart is a great place to work. The work is easy, there are flexible hours for training. They also pay for training . The Coworkers are friendly and very helpful. The hardest part is working overnight. So far walmart has been a great experience."
good,Walmart is a good place to start. I enjoyed working there but some of the managers were rude. Other than that it was easy and the time seemed to go by so fast!
good,The time spent at tho job was well worth it. I learned merchandising and expanded my knowledge with stocking. I enjoyed building new relationships and helping the customers navigate the store.
good,Walmart is a fast pace work environment with room to grow good benefits as well as friendly staff and good management .great breaks and lunches and good flowing atmosphere
good,Everything happens in a fast paced work environment where safety is our number one goal all the time. Team and management are nice people to work with.
good,Es una empresa en la cual aprendes a trabajar con presion aunque en momentos te obligan a realizar actividades que no son de tu area y a estar mas tiempo laboral sin tu consentimiento....
good,The workplace is bearable. The hardest part is that it can be understaffed. It's a good experience but the change of management happen often so it is necessary to adjust fast.
good,Working in backroom have a certain number of picks on a screen depending on the day you may or may not get them all completed. Pretty easy job simple task.
good,"A typical day would be that we are short handed with a lot of call ins. Lots of returns, departments in disaster .  The hardest hardest part In management is not having enough coverage in a high volume store because you try to meet the needs of your customers and also your associates that are over worked. "
good,"This company is all for themselves. It takes up all your time. They do not have flexible hours or a fair hiring process. I would not recommend this job to anyone,."
good,Not a bad place to work when you need money. I noticed a lot of the people that have worked there awhile cut corners to get by. Management needs to focus more on the employees to see who is actually working
good,My experience indicates not all associates are bad just enough to make the expereince good or bad depending if you are in the click. Other then that good place to work.
good,"It's not a bad job unless your in management. Most managers treat and talk to you like your a child and are always gossiping and being messy. I felt as if I was in High School all over again, working for Wal-mart"
good,Was a great place to begin a retail career but changes over the years made it difficult to advance and have any real chance at a career past middle management.
good,I worked there through a remodel and then in the lawn and garden department.  Some of the employees would leave me there by myself to run the cash register and load customers cars.  Other that that working there was good
good,It was a great first job experience and very hard working. Learned a lot more about Wal-Mart than just pushing carts. Also the work environment was always cleared and most important.
good,Nice job to start your work career. It helps build your resume and character and confidienc with dealing witty customers and their different personalities
good,Everyday we unloaded trucks and stocked the floor until the morning. I learned that you can't be a slow worker with alot of stock on the floor. everything must be done in a timely manner.
good,"Seems likens good place to have advancement opportunity as well as the ability to change departments every 6 months. Also has decent benifets, stock options, etc."
good,Loved working here. At times things were tense but we pulled together and got through it. Had a lot of regular customers that always looked for me and are sad i left.
good,"I have worked at two Walmarts and I had two different experiences. The one in Onley, which I prefer is very organized and the people are friendly, and even after I had left I made life long friends. I had relocated to a different state, and before I did, they made sure that my transfer was smooth and no problems. They truly care for the customers as well as the associates."
good,"Walmart, is a great job for college students. They work very well with scheduling and operating around school schedules. The only down fall if your sick in the hospital with doctors notes they will still lay you off."
good,"really depends on the Walmart I loved my Walmart in pa hated the one in tx"
good,don't work for walmart I was a clear that was there for a new new complay over it was good place to work and it was very under staff at night it was lot of work some nights
good,"investigate fraud and internal and external theft"
good,High stress - high expectations with your hands tied behind your back.  little payroll to run daily operations of the store.  must have high performing associates or otherwise you will fail
good,Ive learned so much at Walmart how to hold in all anger in deal in listen to my customers because we all have our days in i'm not to judge just there to do my job in make sure my customers are always happy tough me how to manage money in get the paste of things but what i love most is getting to meet new people in learn so much new things about them the environment had its moments where they where dull to excitement only around the holidays but i loved my job in will most definitely go back if hired just a little about the job oh in the part about that i dislike is doing the CDL but besides that awesome place to work
good,Was a good learning experience for a first job. A lot of the employees were friendly and easy to get along with. Definitely recommend for a part time job.
good,worked for walmart for eleven years and each year the morale kept going down....managers wanted to do something about it but corporate wouldnt give them the freedom to do so...turnover is horrible
good,Is a company we're you can grow as a person and as an associate. I learned more about customer service and money management. They take good care of associates.
good,Walmart is great for part time positions and employees looking to get a start. It is also possible to further yourself in the career which is great. The job does not require much and you can learn quite a deal as well.
good,I enjoyed the atmosphere working at Walmart the people were nice and help d in every situation they could. I enjoyed preparing the food and cooking also
good,"Any position is worth having, including cashier. Their minimum pay is $10 so it's worth while for teens or college kids. It's easy to make walmart a career. Advancement is easy to come by. It has great benefits as well (quarterly bonuses, discount, insurance, PTO). The only thing that i found wasn't worth sticking around for is management. They're extremely demanding and often times confusing. It gets to the point where the money isn't worth it."
good,it paid my bills and I did learn a lot about myself and others. Thinking about it ..It gave me a sense of purpose. I didn't like my work location but I love the store.
good,"While things at Walmart have gotten better with new hires, they still have many current employees that now make even with new hires. This causes issues with employee moral."
good,"Busy work schedules"
good,That place is nice to work at but the managers are so rude and they have no idea how to run a business. They play favors so much it's not even funny and they fire the people that are hard workers but keep people that barely show up for work.
good,"Greet Customers, Help with returns and any other issues, Run cash register, Count down drawer, help customers find items, be on time stay late. Management was ok some I think weren't in the correct position"
good,"For most of the time I was working for Wal-Mart I was very happy with my direct management and understood that most of the things that they did that didn't make since, came from somewhere upstairs where people were pushing numbers around and didn't bother to come down and try the real world application for a change."
good,"The simple way to say it, is that it's Walmart. It's not the best job in the world, nor is it the best pay, but it's a safe bet you'll never need to fear losing your job, and you'll probably enjoy it a fair bit."
good,go into work at 10 pm and get off at 6 am . stocked shelves. making sure store was ready for in the morning. liked what it did but did not like working nights cause i had no life
good,"There was some teamwork but it was mostly solitary."
good,"Walmart is an ok place to work at, it helps pay the bills. Ive been there for 4 yrs now, simply a job to do during my college years. Officially graduating now I am done."
good,I mean its walmart right? You know what to expect going into it. I worked in various departments and never once had a set schedule but it was a job....
good,"Walmart is a good place to work,"
good,The pay sucks and at times you feel very overworked but in general it was a decent place to make a buck or two. Room for moving up but dont expect a huge pay increase if you do.
good,Un trabajo muy dinamico compañeros con facilidad de trato y dispuestos a enseñar lo complicado es que es un lugar un poco retirado de mi hogar lo que aprendi fue un poco mas de manejo de excel basico
good,Great job for people who like to move around constantly and help people with either products or services. Provides flexible hours for work and also has great benefits.
good,"It was kind of a mediocre place to work. My co-workers were good people, but the job just simply wasn't what I had originally had in mind. The systems were very simplistic, and management was fairly demanding despite the average reputation the store itself already displayed."
good,It was a good place to work. Feel like the pay could have been better for 3rd shift and everything you had to get done. The mangers where ok. Seemed like they didn't wanna be there
good,"I worked at Walmart for a few years. It was good for a first job but I found myself getting bored after the Christmas rush. Many of the people I worked with were fantastic, but this job just was not for me."
good,Picked out from the sales floor and top stocked on the sales floor. Management never complimented on good job. Most workers have very low morale and unhappy.
good,It was fun for me because I was a night stocker so I went in when it was slow which made it easier for me to do my job without getting in peoples way. the people were friendly and helpful
good,"very fast paced work. they never had enough cashiers to meet the customers expectations, so constantly the customers would yell or get mad at me for it."
good,I was a customer service manager at Walmart and the managers just didn't work well together and that made it very difficult to work there and succeed.
good,"Overall, it wasn't a bad job. Fairly easy work, pretty decent co-workers if you were lucky. My issue was the management. They had no problem letting you know you were expendable. This wasn't all of them, but it happened and it made it difficult to work for them when you didn't feel valued or respected."
good,"walmart deals with alot of customer interactions. alot of different jobs is done at walmart such as running the cash register, forklift driving, carry out, etc."
good,Working for walmart was exactly what you'd expect. Consistent work and consistent customer interactions. Nothing out of the ordinary would happen and my schedule was the same mostly.
good,"I unloaded freight from trucks. We separated items onto pallets depending on what department they belonged in. This took several hours. We then took the pallets out to the salesfloor, so associates could put the freight out. I learned how physically strong I was. Most of the management was great. The management was good. The hardest part of my job was unloading the truck. The most enjoyable part of my job was I made great friends, and we got to work together."
good,It's a good job. Always something to do. Great atmosphere. Some days are easier than others but it makes you a stronger worker and more wiser. Makes job easy as you go
good,"Everybody knows about Walmart, but I guess it comes down to management. If you have a good team of managers, then the job would be better. The management team that i worked with looked out for themselves and that was all."
good,Either your doing something right or not management always finds time to yell at someone if they dont meet a quota on their terms. so generally your days can end up being eh or great
good,No day is ever the same routine when in customer service. I learned to kill them with kindness and never take anything personal. The management is hard to describe due tho them having several parts of management Hardest part of the job was rude customer and trying to please them. Most enjoyable is the same satisfying the customers.
good,"Walart in itself is a great company except that the employees at Walmart all want to be the ""top dog"". It makes just doing your own work stressful. Everyone wants to be important and valued except they forget that they work at a Walmart and should just CHILLL."
good,Wal-Mart is an okay company to work for. They'll overwork you and have you cut your time so you don't get overtime. I'd recommend daytime over third. They can't keep enough help to make things run smoothly (like they are supposed to). It is a steady income and typically an easy job however there is a lot of drama.
good,Good benefits and good advancements . Everyday learning and growing with new processes and procedures. Paid time off and sick time are great bonuses. Periodic bonuses.  Extra discounts on many other companies
good,"Fue un trabajo donde hubiese preferido seguir y crecer mas, pero por razones fuera de mi control tuve que abandonarla."
good,"restocking the vegetables in the produce area, making sure that the back room is clean and a neat work environment, unloading the walmart trucks when they come in and helping customers with there needs"
good,"With the WalMart company, management is unorganized. Employees are overwor and treated unfairly in the stores. I worked the Deli Department, there were nights that no one showed up, and I was forced to run and close the department alone."
good,"Walmart was a very fun place too work. We did not get paid fair for the work they excepted, but the employees were nice. they fed us well.I would go back."
good,"My overall experience was good. Management made sure we were prepared before starting work and did whatever they could to help you. I enjoyed my short time there, unfortunately I had to move and leave."
good,This is a great job because you can move up in the company without any college expierence. Hours are very flexible and they will work with you to meet any necessary accomidations
good,"It was nice to work in there. But the management was really awful. And I was having a sort of allergy and they didn't do anything about it, just ignore me. So, I quit."
good,"Areas de trabajo amplias, buena limpieza y organización de los asociados."
good,it was a fun place mostly loved working with all the customers. They didn't let people finish their training in a timely manner which hindered the employees in getting thier raises on time.
good,This is a good company for advancement in a salaried retail career. Every store is different and offer different benefits to you as the associate i.e. can be flexible with desired scheduling.
good,It was good and helps you learn more things and you can learn how to do multiple things if you are able to leave that job you can apply else where and know how to get the job done
good,It was great working here. I had fun with my job. I loved working here. Couldn't say anything bad about it. Benefits were great. Hours were no problem.
good,You walk in and clock in to start your day. Then id go get carts and bring them to the freezer and cut open the pallets. Id stack the different foods on their respective carts and go stock them on the shelves.
good,My experience was all good. I would like to work in this store again and am in need of employment.I enjoyed the work atmosphere and job duties. I also liked my coworkers and would be happy to work at Walmart.
good,the pay is good and the hours are there if you want them but I like to stay busy and there really isn't much to do so the day just drags on. Usually ill go to other departments to help out just to stay busy but even in their departments it gets pretty slow and the day drags on.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was dealing with the customers.  The hardest part of the job was trying to locate your manager or your CSR's in order to accommodate a customer.  If Walmart would actually incorporate what was in your training classes the job would run smoothly.  My manager was not strong in communication.
good,They don't over anything but rotating schedules. Pay wasn't great so I worked to be come a manager and didn't even get a full dollar raise. It wasn't worth the amount of energy and physical work tha you put in to the job for what you get paid. But that's retail right?
good,The people were friendly and flexible hours.  Management didn't really seem to involved with employees. Not a terrible job but not great either. Good high school job.
good,The crews that are located at the assigned organization has real comradery and kinsmanship. Employees help each other and motivate each other throughout the work day.
good,Worked there for 6 years and would really not want to go back to working for Walmart again. A decent place to learn a good work ethic and decent time management skills
good,"I work from 6:30am to 3:00pm most of the day I'm just lifting boxes into trailor and shipping it out to different store. I've learned how to work with others and be more of independent at the same time. It is not the best place to work alot of times theres alot of dust in the trailor or even in the warehouse. the hardest place is that it is a heavy lifting job theres are alot of big heavy boxes, some boxes are up to 70 lbs. and the most enjoyable is that you get two 15 minutes breaks."
good,worked in the accounting office  Was busy all the time. and worked alone.  Would have preferred working with another person to help with the work load.
good,"started working as a cashier until an opening became available in the pharmacy. cashier, customer service, stocker, inventory. once in the pharmacy i filled medication for outpatient population and read scripts."
good,"Good place to work, a lot of opportunity in different fields. It all depends on what you want to accomplish & what you want your work environment to look like."
good,"Over the few years that I worked here I realized that the management team determines the whole attitude from the crew. I've worked with great managers who made me and my co workers want to give our best and I've also worked with other types of managers who make some co workers want to do the bare minimum for shift and are counting the seconds until we can clock out. If at any job I would get promoted, I would try my hardest to be the type of manager who push my workers in a positive way as so I've witness."
good,"they are very competitive."
good,"It's an okay place to work. Youvdont akways get the time off you want, but they try to keep it fair on everyone as far as scheduling and  keeping people happy."
good,ran registers on front line and in pharmacy lots of standing on feet learned alot about the pharmacy and cash office enjoyed working with the public and helping them with their needs
good,Being a greeter is great experience to me. The most greatest thing about the job meeting people. To smile at a customer when they have had a bad day and make them smile. Always willing to serve the customer.
good,"Well I left a great job thinking walmart was a good change..Shortly after arriving there I found out I "
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy.  And it's like a home away from home.  One big family.  Department managers have wonderful work hours.
good,Didn't work there too long. Was promised a promotion but never received it. Was given the hours just not the pay or teaching . Training method needs work
good,#1099 Walmart offered great benefits. The only downfall they have is with the drama in the store with employees and management also they don't pay time in a half for holidays.
good,"The job that I worked was easy fun and enjoyable, the environment was kind of crazy sometimes but all in all it was nice. If the job environment was a bit more professional I could have excelled at it better."
good,working at Walmart opened my horizons up to meeting different people. learning to adjust to different attitudes and beliefs. it also taught me my cash handling skills and how to work in a team.
good,Did not help on maternity leave. They ended up firing me because my leave of absence got deny. And I could not come back to work because I was sick. They were not very helpful
good,I don't know about all Walmart's but the one I work at is probably one of the worst ones to be in. My typical day is doing at least three people's jobs on top of unloading anywhere from two to three trucks a day. I've learned from Walmart that if your not a favorite your just a laborer that doesn't get paid enough to speak. The management at my store belong in high school and aren't mature enough to run a store. The hardest part of my job is always doing your best and still looked at like your not good enough. The most enjoyable part is my co-workers I have.
good,Some managers were ok some were not so ok. I mainly enjoyed running customer service alone. I like to be in charge and i got more done. I am a fast worker.
good,"Not really the best way to spend your life working for a soul sucking company like this, but it gets the job done. Originality and creativity aren't really an accepted thing."
good,"The job kept me busy, time flies working there, and the people were very nice. It was easy to learn every thing in the store, night stocking was the best position for me."
good,"Company allows for very quick advancement, initial employment hourly pay is not worth the work that is expected. Job tasks are simple and management recognizes potential."
good,Walmart was a good gig i enjoyed night time jobs more relax than morning jobs i jus did not see a direction were i need to be and that was a career job not a job to pay bills
good,"Management was terrible to me, they don't care about whatever is going on with you, such as personal problems & educational wise. Greenwood, MS Walmart is just unprofessional and unorganized but don't get me wrong the $10 a hour was some good money because they're the highest paying job in Greenwood, MS."
good,it's an ok place to work management pretty much sucks company wide no one really knows what they are doing if corporate comes to your store everyone is running around like chickens with no heads and SO MANY CORNERS ARE CUT but is you clock in do your job nd go home you should be fine
good,"If you like being stressed out good place to work, the people are fine and the line managers are ok, but salaried managers really need to work on their people skills"
good,"Decent job for those looking for a part-time job whilst at school. Management could make an associate mad, however its only an entry level job so do as your may."
good,It was a very fun place to work got to meet new people everyday and got to help people everyday. Every employee there are very friend and nice and treats you like family
good,Wish pay was more..start off $9 hr..schedule change constantly.. No raise or benefits for 6 months to a year..if pay was more and full time sooner might could of stayed
good,working at Wal-mart was a new experience for me but i really enjoyed working at the customer service desk. the hardest part of this ob was dealing with the few irate customers that we would receive now and then
good,"Standing on feet constantly during the shift is difficult on feet and back, co-workers negative towards their job but I enjoy meeting and greeting customer and assisting them."
good,"stocked paper,pets,and chemical aisles. Used pallet jakcs to move skids. My first job. Had a great team to work around. Positivity was our goal and we would help customers while we worked."
good,Working for the store I was at was okay some of the time. The management for the store on the other hand is poor. They are very unfair for the most part. They break the rules and they play favorites with their associates.
good,"I worked in the Jewelry Department at Wal-Mart. Helped customers pick out jewelry, was also able to pierce ears, which was available at the time I worked there."
good,"I like working for Walmart because it is easily to move up in the store as long as you do your work if you want to grow with the company. I am hired part time so there fore I don't get any benefits and I need benefits. The easiest part in the store is helping customers and putting out merchandise, The hardest part in the store is you have many managers and they all tell you to do something different . You have to figure out which one of your many tasks is important to do first so you want get in trouble. I enjoy helping customer's because I am a peoples person."
good,my experience here was a good one people were very nice management was good very strict about time off and a very cold environment but overall a good place
good,"- job is simple and expectations is not beyond standard"
good,good company but now i have heard that they took vac days away becaue you have to earn them. and policies have changed and associates have been disappointed
good,"was fun to do, gained customer service skills, learned new skills along the way. advanced quickly, friendly staff, bosses were great people, was a new store at the time so kind of unorganized."
good,Good job just hours getting cut drive to far for less hours good job just was trying to provide for family and bills just wasn't enough some days  I was working four hours a day
good,"O Walmart é uma empresa muito boa para trabalhar, saí porque pretendia mudar de cidade."
good,"Good place to start out with a job, worked here out of highschool, had two jobs Walmart is a okay place to work if your looking for job experience. There are many opportunities here."
good,"Depends in which environment you are working. The distribution center is very fasted paced and great pay. management in both were great. Store is slower paced, less pay."
good,Working in the deli we'd get regulars and I enjoyed seeing there faces returning. I'd often remember some of the meats they always ordered and would ask them if that's what they where getting. They'd smile and seem content I remembered.
good,It was a very okay first job. I got to meet some very influential people while I was there. I still go in the store every now and then to say hello. I couldn't have had it any better
good,"You do your job and management relies on you. Sometimes too much. At my store at least, I'm given room to grow and learn on the path to management. But really its just regular retail. Horrible customers, often incompetent management, very often incompetent coworkers."
good,"Me parece un buen lugar de trabajo con un ambiente laboral bueno ya que te permite aprender mucho de la empresa y desenvolverte en e área de trabajo, lo que mas me gustaba de este empleo es que solo era de 6 horas."
good,"This job was good as far as pay, but management was a little crazy. "
good,"overnight stocker, place items in correct order on shelves"
good,"Walmart was a great place to work. I also loved the people I worked with ,they were Loving and caring people from my supervisor on down. I learned a lot from the people I work with there ..How to do the job correctly and effectively. "
good,liked the benefits life balance but the management was awful.wasn't really there long enough for any advancement nut I know they have a fair policy.Would love to work there again.
good,"The company allows for a 4 day workweek that gives you weekends off and a monday off as well.  "
good,its all about the location of the Wal-Mart you work at because every Wal-mart is managed differently. so its all by location and management as to your experince
good,Worked for walmart almost three years.They are an ok place to work a lot of advancement.ITS JUST HARD TO BECOME FULL TIME.Its like they want you to work part time forever
good,I enjoyed working here. They had enough hours to pass around. They are strict with there schedule. But enjoyed the people I worked with because I never had an issue with any employees
good,"average leadership mediocre team, hardworking people, pathetic HR department, HR head only in name, individualistic character, not good for company, sales & operations teams are good. lot of scope of improvement."
good,My typical day at work is coming in the work place pleasant greeting people with a hello or good morning.Then I would follow the employer protocol of finding out what my duties are for the day such as check assignment board for employee or go to report where each shifts discuss what happen on each shift (communication) Then I would follow through with my assignment. during the course of my job I will respect others as we as receiving respect in return and most of all be a team player.
good,"From my experience, Walmart is a company that will work you to the bone. A typical day unloading freight would consist of  blood, sweat, and tears to say the least."
good,"Alta liderança sem comprometimento com pessoas, empresa pouco atrativa para jovens"
good,I enjoy going  to work i have a good relationship with my coworkers and supervisors i have good benefits but i desire to making more money walmart max pay isnt that high
good,fun workplace and good place to work the people there are very friendly and easy to work with and the hours were very flexiable and they were very understanding
good,"I enjoyed my position at Walmart, it was just filled with to many women that kept up drama but I maintain and did what I was expected to do up until termination"
good,"typical large corporation. they like to promote from within so there is always room for advancement, however they have too many employees to care about the day to day of employees for the most part. once you're trained you're on your own."
good,I enjoyed working at wal-mart. I didn't like is the hours..i kept trying to get more hours or move to full time and worked there fro almost 2 years thank
good,Working at walmart was challenging with different sorts of customers and always difficult to advance due to the favortism policy. I enjoy working with everyone.
good,Es bueno trabajar aqui lo unico que no estoy de acuerdo es el salario
good,Upper management has a lot of issues they need to work on. They do not communicate and they do not hold people accountable out of fear. Everyone just does what they want and the people who work hard are left to pick up the slack.
good,Start your night unloading two trucks then work it to the floor so the next shift can work on it then you go home come back next day to start your shift and unloading of two more trucks
good,"I would help the people who needed assistance with their products, then I would have to be at the front door to greet them check their receipts.  Walmart was a good company to work with.   The company would help me with a better way of doing things on the job."
good,The work load could sometimes be daunting. But the assistance of other employees helped greatly. Most supervisors were easy to work with. Enjoyed the other employees.
good,"The cashier position is simple working at walmart. I have been working since June and I love it. I deal with different people on a daily basis, also helping them find items they have trouble locating."
good,I worked for Wal-mart for 5 years.  It was truly a learning experience. During that time I learned how to better myself by providing better customer service.  I also worked in the garden center where I learned more about plants.
good,"WalMart as a whole had good incentives while I worked there and plenty of opportunities for advancement, but each store management is capable of ruining even the best laid plans."
good,"Walmart is of of the most disrespectful place to work there is no respect for you there. "
good,"Learned a lot from my department manager, My customer service really touched my customers in a very good way and were always welcomed. Customers were very friendly and happy with me helping them out."
good,"Great work environment, good for growth experience and career start. Every process is easy to learn, great orientation and hands on training. Managers have an awesome open door policy, HR is excellent and caring. I've learned everything I needed to be a great leader and or manager. There is nothing hard about working there."
good,"The job was good, it was too bad the store I worked at was not busy. If it was a busy store,  I might have stayed but I could get the hours I needed based on the store not being a busy store."
good,"I worked as a cashier, and I enjoyed working with my fellow cashiers. Most of the customers were pleasant, but some customers were very rude and difficult. Management acted like they were above everybody else and did not know the job function, which made it difficult to manage."
good,"Its very hard to be a manager of a department, since they don't provide a lot of employees to you, basically have to do it on your own without getting help."
good,I was responsible for my own department. Stocking and keeping the shelfs net and easily accessible. I set mods and restocked. I was responsible for customer care as well
good,it is an okay place to work..i did not work there long due to medical issues and the fellow employees are fun to work with and i would recomment this place to a friend
good,"the comapany can always have room for improvement, can be brought up to 2017 culture and tech. rules and regulations need to be updated and training of new enmployees can also inprove"
good,"At Walmart, you are expected to do a lot, all the time."
good,It was a good learning experience. It made me more knowledgeable on how to be a great worker. I truly enjoyed my co-workers and everyone was a team player.
good,"I pushed carts for the time I was there and did outdoor cleanup at the start of my shifts. You do that well and your golden. Could have moved up but opted not to."
good,"This is a good place for someone in high school to start working at to get good customer service experience. I would not try to make a career here as advancement is tough and support given to you is low. Moral vas very low at my store and the pay was not very good. It was before Walmart raised the pay at all their stores. We were short staff a lot, which made it very stressful at times. During non-holiday times it could be very slow with not much going on at all."
good,The best part of the job was not having anyone hanging over my shoulder.  I was left alone because we had no cust. comp. The only time they sent me help is when I asked for it.
good,only problem with walmart is we are always short staffed. always stuck doing to many things at one time. regardless to that it gives you room to move up fast
good,This company offers a very diverse work force with many opportunities for careers. Members of management are experienced and will guide you through your work day.
good,"Clock in"
good,This was a really good place to work great management and get to meet new people everyday. Love learning something new everyday and being able to help customers
good,Working at Walmart is okay.  The managers are cool sometimes and the associate are okay.  They try to make you feel like one happy family. It could also be rough sometimes
good,"Flexible schedule will work around schooling or other employment. Great management, great employees, and good benefits. Breaks on a timely manner. No overtime."
good,The staff was really kind and welcoming. Customer service and getting the products out were the managers and crew team main focus. Working at a fast pace but getting the job done correctly were the main aspects working in this position.
good,"I worked in apparel sales and it was an alright job. It would get really hot at times and it made me get tired quickly. My duties weren't hard at all. I just had to put clothes away or fold them.If i found anything out of place (toys,food, etc) i'd put them in a buggy and at the end of the day i'd take them to the front so they could be taken back to the appropriate areas."
good,"It was a interesting and learning expierence for me, I had a lot of different types of duties. I felt the bosses could've been more understanding and appealing but as the rest, it was great"
good,Bad management no leadership and work conditions were not ok not being able to get a 15 min break or a meal break after 3-4 hours of work . It is a place I would never think of going again.
good,"You had the option to have an hour or half hour break."
good,"I worked in the lawn and garden department and the biggest I believe I had was the loading of bricks and other heavy items into a customers vehicle. It took quite a while for them to train any of us on the forklift, scissor lift, etc. The smaller loads of bricks and such were not a big deal, but when a customer would purchase a hundred or more and no one was around with a licence for the machines, it took quite a while to get those loaded, and in turn affected the rest of our work day in terms of production."
good,"Very busy office answering phones, making travel arrangement, setting up meetings, distrusting and opening mail.  Working on various projects.  Occasional travel."
good,a typical day was pretty much waiting for people to come down your aisle so you can check them out the management had its tendency to be very bad but other then that it was ok
good,It's a nice place to work with friendly employees. Management is willing to help in schedules and emergencies. The customers are really nice as well to work for.
good,"· Count, receive, and deliver money in correct increments."
good,I've worked at several different ones and each one is different. The one thing that is the same is that you'll be dealing with idiot customers and management that doesn't really bother to appreciate you unless you're a long time employee. They will do everything to keep you from getting the benefits.
good,Me gusta trabajar con publico. Apredi a trabajar con diferentes situaciones y a tomar desiciones rapidas. Es un trabajo que requiere concentracion y rapidez y sobre todo estar alerta ante cualquier oportunidad.
good,"Fast pace working environment, constantly busy, customers coming back for the service and the staff. Staffs are friendly and welcoming. Overall, clean store, friendly staffs, and good customer service."
good,WAlmart is a fair place to work if you dont want to advance or have unique ideas. The company has strict standards of operation and does little to reward ingenuity.
good,"Fun place to work, use reach lift to store and move supplies to designated area of warehouse. Verify, scan, and label all receiving merchandise. Fill orders by deadlines."
good,"As far having the products you need Walmart is great. So employees like there job but as far as working there, I wouldn't recommend it. If you need a quick job this is okay but as far as a career. Consider a degree."
good,Company doesn't live by their Hussmann Behaviors. Not equal opportunities. Too much nepotism. The company does not promote within. No strong leadership roles. Don't believe in coaching.
good,"Working for the Walmart DC is fun, and at first you have a load of fun and it's fast paced and enjoyable...But as time passes, the management plays favoritism, and you have to basically kiss their feet to keep your job. You will also be assigned one task, to only be asked to do another task wild mid task. On top of such, you will also be doing other employees tasks from those of which those employees are either lazy, or don't put forth a hard working effort. The pay is good, and benefits, but what use is it all, when you're working with lazy people and or people whom work you to your bones, for just minimum pay, or close to it. I suggest not working for Walmart, but as a starting job, put in at least 6 months, and then put in your two weeks notice and find better."
good,It's an OK place to work. Management is a little fat headed and arrogant but people you work with are OK. Other than that I really don't have much else to say.
good,"Great experience at Wal-Mart. Although, this particular location could use more motivated workers, such as myself, to increase productivity and satisfaction. It will also enhance a more positive vibe."
good,I worked overnight stocking shelves as a part-time job.  I didn't have to interact with other co-workers much.  It was an easy-going job to help make extra cash to pay the bills.
good,"There is plenty of room for advancement in walmart as long as you work hard and learn quick. They are very generous with their breaks, and with their raises."
good,I worked there as a seasonal employee. Every seemed nice. I still love shopping there. There are great deals. I miss my discount since I shop there so often
good,Walmart i started as a overnight remodel associated later switch to overnight stock clerk i enjoyed working in Walmart fast paced in environment with awesome co workers
good,I thought working for walmart would be great while Im in school but no they never took the time to work around my scheduale for school so I dont recommend worjking here is in sachool
good,It would be a great place to work if there wasnt so many management changes. While I was there....there were several new managers coming and going. Thats it.
good,"Walmart would be a suitable job if you are single. Because you will spend a lot of time at work, and you will have little time for family. Depending on the associates performance, they can remove your second day off. You'll work a minimum of 12-18hrs a day. They can change your schedule without you knowing within 24hrs. So it's best to work here if you are single and just looking to start a career."
good,Immediately assistant all customers with any concerns or questions to ensure high quality customer service. Following all procedures during the preparation of deli foods.
good,"Work isn't too difficult. However, it's minimum wage. Often the hours can be bad at seven eleven because I have to work the night shift. But if finding a job is getting difficult you gotta do what you gotta do."
good,On top of great benefits they also have awesome pay and reasonable hours.. The management team is efficient as well.  I also had some of the best co workers you could ask for.
good,"El ambiente laboral no es muy bueno, sobre todo por jefes en general. Al ser un trabajo de trato al cliente, es bastante estresante. En más de una ocasión se te requiere para otras áreas de trabajo. Pero, lo que hace llevadero mi trabajo aquí... Es la facilidad de horarios que se manejan para conmigo; pues actualmente estoy estudiando una licenciatura, por lo que sólo trabajo medio tiempo."
good,I loved my job at Walmart other then the small incidents with my suporviser I would have loved to continue working there. So if you were to work here be careful who you work around
good,"In general, the people with whom I worked brought a multitude of skills and talent to the organization, made it enjoyable to work at Walmart. Because the work culture was ""Top-Down"" and ""tightly controlled,"" there was a failure to extract maximum benefit from the major success determinant of successful teamwork -- collaborative communication. Fortunately, the Organization placed a high value on customers, however attempts to limit brand choices failed to meet expectations of many patrons."
good,You can't get too comfortable at Walmart because change is constant.  Adaptability is a must.  You stay busy which is a good thing.  The associates are the best!  They become like family since you spend more time with them than you do your own family.
good,"my job current is to make sure that the items are available to all customers and staff, also that its safe for all to shop "
good,Walmart is well known in the retail industry and teaches skills such as social/people skills. We are a very small grocery store entity compared to the much larger supercenter. We have less employees and are very under staffed. It's very important for the employees to work to the best of their abilities to get the job done before 7am regardless of the freight volume to employee ratio for the shift.
good,"I had the opportunity to work for Walmart for 3 years and  in that time, I made a lot of nice friends and got to work in a few different departments. One manager in particular took the time to really listen to me when things weren't going well and when I was having a rough day and I will never forget her."
good,they will hire all types of people that is great one of the things i live they do not look at the outward appearance they look at the heart even if they don't always get it right they give many people chances to prove their worth. the hardest part is being micromanaged by people that you trained to do this jib but you get overlooked for the promotion for what ever reasons. enjoyable part was helping people serving people and getting to make life long friendships.
good,"Bom, foi o meu 1° emprego de carteira assinada. Fui operadora de caixa e gostei da função. Fiquei um ano e quatro meses. Saí desse emprego porque eu não gostei do horário, pois três dias era fechamento e outro abertura, e assim por diante. E eu gostaria que fosse um horário fixo. E agora eu gostaria de novas oportunidades, minha  experiência maior foi como operador de caixa. Mas já trabalhei em padarias como balconista, fiquei 6 meses."
good,"Now I was able to learn alot from walmart and the experience I got. "
good,Typical Day coming from the Walmart i worked at was a little different no structure in too much of the management numerous managers lack teaching and training i did learn numerous worth ethics while working for them as well as bettering my customer service skills and mastering the positions i was in.
good,It was a fast-paced job with something new to do every day. I've learned more about my job everyday when it came to customer service on how we should always treat the customers when it came down to tending to every customer's wants and needs. The hardest part of working at the establishment was making sure you was able to get hours when you needed it. I've enjoyed my job when it came to having something new to do everyday and always keeping busy.
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart is bringing goods and services to areas typically underserved by Retail.  Walmart is a culturally iconic organization that serves all of America.
good,learned a lot during my time there.  Many different tasks expected out of everyone which helps individuals grow and become better people.  The hardest part about the job was having to not only do your own areas work but having to help others too.
good,"With my experience with Walmart, and warehouse I worked it has been a bit of a roller coaster. If you are looking for a a decent pay with no education then the job isn't bad, but if you have an education then look other places."
good,Didn't fully enjoyed working at Wal-mart. Worked there with a lot of people younger than 22 years old. People who were working there had not been working there for more than a year.
good,wal mart was a great place to work pay was ok at the time i worked there so i have no bad things to say about wal mart and the hours were great  cause they worked around my school time
good,I feel the job paid pretty decent. Overall was a good learning experience for me. I feel the warehouse job was a decent job for me while I was in school.
good,"It is a new experience I guess that I was looking for."
good,A great place to work up the ladder as far as your position with this company. They value the stores excellence in a whole to ensure cumstomer satisfaction to garuntee customers return shopping.
good,"A typical day at work would include me being a cashier for approximately 4-7.5 hours. I would assist in customer service whenever it was needed. While being a cashier I was responsible for scanning and bagging customer purchases, processing various forms of payment for goods and services and participating in promotional activities. While being at customer service I would answer the phone, return items and accommodate customers concerns and needs with superior customer service. "
good,I was not happy with the way I was treated as a Wal-Mart employee. I was promised full time after a certain length and they would just keep pushing it back so that I couldn't get benefits
good,Worked in multiple locations in my career at Wal Mart. At every location the morale in the building is all relative to how good a store manager you have.
good,A typical day's work at Wal-Mart consisted of clocking in and after doing so start zoning my area. After that's complete I would then relief whoever's behind the register and take their place. Some however I would be helping with the remodeling process.
good,"I worked overnight..It was very quiet. Sometimes the work can be a little much for one person with the time restraints, and depending on what area your working in. Overall its a decent job for beginners or someone who's trying to make a little money for the time being."
good,I would go back to this store. I always knew what the day held for me. This store isn't the worst or the best place to work at. But it is a major improvement on most of the other places in this town.
good,"I would not recommend this job to anyone. Rotating schedules, low pay, and ever decreasing work hours, made it impossible to take care of my family on the miniscule paycheck I received."
good,"The first thing I would honestly say about Walmart is the wage is ridiculous. You learn quite a bit about how Walmart handles money when you work there. It's almost like they don't want any employees. Cut hours so they can cut costs on paying employees so they can lower prices so people can save money and live better. Very greedy. This store I work at, there is a practice of favoritism, everyone has their own little groupies who can't seem to include other people in. No one likes to sit by you and talk. The scheduling can be stupid too. It's great to have a job and I don't like complaining about being given money but for a billion dollar company that makes billions every second in the day, you'd expect more. The raises are very skimpy, like being given pocket change."
good,"It's not the worst place to work. It's not my favorite though either. However, it pays well and I get the hours that I need to get me through college."
good,The place wasn't the problem manage meant was the problem I follow all the rules and policies and manage meant wouldn't back me up.that is why I want to leave the establishment.
good,I worked with the remodel crew so most of my time spent there was in a warehouse. it was fun and the crew was cool. at the time my job was temporary with the chance to be permanent. I was actually offer a permanent position but I turned it down because at the time I had just got a promotion at UPS which was my primary job.
good,I learned lots of different departments while working there. I eventually transferred to the pharmacy. The health insurance was severely lacking as was the pay. It was time to move on.
good,"Everything you need is all in one stop. Who wants to keep going places and burning gas? Everything cost, so lets spend it the right way. Wal-mart has everything you need and from there, you are on your way home. Even after my shift, i'm on my way home."
good,"Concern for employees welfare was disregarded as we'd be penalized for not showing up for work due to inclement weather. Managers weren't properly trained, profit was more important than anything, and overall work day was stressful most of the time."
good,"It's easy to get comfortable working at Walmart. However, I learned that there's no room to be comfortable, you must always stay motivated and strive to move up. To get further than where you were the day before. I can honestly say its a great place to start and gain skills that you will definitely utilize as you progress in your career."
good,"Walmart is an okay company. Life balance is a big plus for this company. They are really good at accomidating female employs, but not the males. There seems to be very little room for expansion opportunities in management. The workplace culture is also a good thing. People get to interact with other people and work 8 hours a day."
good,"The job I was doing was one of the most physically demanding jobs ever.  If you like that sort of thing more power to you.  Everyday your body will hurt, and you are working non stop for the 10 hours you work.  I loved the people I worked with though, all very relaxed and genuine people."
good,Walmart is a good place to work. They are willing to work with you on your schedule and will help you move to other departments. They have good benefits.
good,"Very Friendly atmosphere , lots of walking and standing , Lots of tasks to take care of but for the most part loved the people I worked with was mostly a family once you knew everyone."
good,"This is a good company, very challenging.  I get to work with a great team of people .  We all work really good together. Walmart has gone through so many changes.  You beed to be willing to lean."
good,"Very tedious job"
good,"It's a great job, overwhelm at times, but that comes along with learning to deal with the public. They have good benefits, and are willing to help with college."
good,"favoritism, not bad for short period. Good for a job, not necessarily the best career choice. The main issue is that the associates are often asked to do other jobs besides their own"
good,Some managers are good and recognize the great work you put into the place.  Sometimes there can be room for advancement and better opportunities.  Pay is based on your time and evaluation of your work.  Benefits are ok but coverage varies with vision and dental care but the health insurance is good.
good,It's a great company to work for; they are very organized and very productive. I would definitely recommend them to anyone that is looking for full time employment
good,"Its Walmart. Not the easiest job because as a cashier, customers assume you know where everything is. There are floor associates for that. I got a snarky attitude from someone in my first few days of working there because I didn't know how to fix the sales price. I smiled and went to my manager for help. In this job, you smile and do what is asked of you by the managers. I learned that the customer is NOT always right, but they are the most important, so I quickly learned how to tune out certain types of attitudes, and how to deal with others. Hardest part of the job was couponing in large orders. We have to go all the way back to check for the cheese its to make sure you got the right kind that applied to the coupon....and the bag is at the bottom of cart number 3."
good,Learned a lot in a few months. Worked about 60 hours per week. Too many hours required by Walmart. Good pay but worked so many hours that the pay is equaled to a department manager that doesn't have all the responsibility that a Assistant Manager has.
good,"The wal-mart distribution center in winter haven Florida was a good place to work, we had great working hours and 3 days off because we would to 4 10 hours and the pay was decent"
good,"The Wal-mart distribution center in Winter haven Florida had good pay and good benefits and good advancement opportunities, The Management  was very good and work environment was fast paced and good work hours"
good,"The job was simple. You were to make sure everything was set up nice and get people what they wanted. Management and other employees were nice and helpful. Hours were flexible, but getting anywhere near full time hours was near impossible unless you worked there for 5+ years. It would be a goo job for someone straight out of high school, but i don't see how you could make a career out of working here unless you plan on staying for your whole life."
good,"Being on the shift that I am on, which is 3rd, we basicly have all the pressure on us cause we have 2 stock the whole store, meaning we get most of freight at night. Done had a lot of terrible nights with the few people we have cause people come and leave because it's 2 much 4 them 2 handle. We have good nights but it's not that often. I've been working hard, really hard while employed here, want 2 do something eles, but have these new responsibilities, so I can't afford 2 leave yet."
good,"It is aFast paced kind of job. There was always something new to learn everyday.  It was Well organized,  with lots of opportunity to grow within the company. You also had the Option to train in  many different departments."
good,this place was difficult to work at. too much arguing and drama and not enough pay. hardest part of the job was finish unoading trucks by certain times. most enjoyable part was lunch.
good,"A typical day at Walmart consisted of clocking in, sitting through a 10 minute team meeting, and helping the crew complete tasks at hand. Management was a little overboard, micromanaged, and nitpicked but for the most part they treated us well. Mostly everybody I worked with was friendly and respected one another. A challenge when working was completing claims in the meat department due to the horrible stench of ruined meat. I really enjoyed my departments work ethic. We collaborated well as a team and would pick each other up if somebody was having a bad day."
good,"Learning a skill with electronic cash machines. "
good,its a job not to hard but can really get old really fast with few chances to move up. Very pick and chose kinda company here only want who they see fit to climb the ladder
good,Taking care of the customers was the most enjoyable part of my day. The management team is lackluster at best. They refused to help associates and picked friends to move up in the store.
good,"The environment was a good one to work in, always kept you busy. The customers and other employees always kept you on your toes so there was no down time."
good,"I enjoyed my time working with Wal-Mart but management needed work in my own opinion. I am OCD and like things in order. With everything I do I like it to be organized and planned. I feel like it helps me do my job the best to my ability. At the time of my employment, there was no organization. I only left Wal-Mart because of a disagreement with management. My grandmother had a stroke and I was punished for leaving work early without a replacement. I loved working with customers, even the upset ones. Being a people person I thoroughly enjoy working with the public. With all my past jobs, they have all been involved with the public. The hardest part of my job was being on my feet for a long amount of time. The job itself was not hard at all on me, just on my feet."
good,Buen ambiente de trabajo y relación laboral respetuosa
good,I enjoyed what I did and I would have continued to do so but the management was very unpleasant. The pay for the department was great but being a hard worker didn't mean much. Management gave plenty of criticisms and no praise.
good,"it's walmart... i did not get along with anyone there, no one was willing to help me through things as i was just starting out, everyone keeps to themselves or hangs out in their own little group. it just wasnt a great experience."
good,"I worked here a for year and it was an okay job. Cold in the winter, hot in the summer. The pay was good, though. I would like to go back if I had the chance."
good,I worked in many departments in the grocery industries. this job allowed me to change schedule to work around my changing life at those times. I was gong to school and work many side jobs at that time.
good,was ok the hours were fine the employees were nice customers were for the most part friendly the store was kept organized and clean plus the staff are real nice people
good,Nice enough company to work for. There is always work to be done and plenty of people to help you. There isn't much room for moving up in the company unless you're in good with the right people. Management has problems with favoritism.
good,"It was a solid job, workers I worked with were  fun, got along with all."
good,I worked as An overnight stocker the pay was bitokay due to the dollar deferential and but working overnight was much more stressful because You had to almost always be done putting out all the freight out in you department before morning shift came in.
good,"The job requires dedication, one must be able to balance work and family time.  One just be prepared to teach and train "
good,"They put customers before cashiers and that is kind of wrong, if you take care of your cashiers then they will take care of your customers. Learned how to handle problems very well and customer service skills"
good,Work is ok.  I would just like a better working opportunity.  I have worked various positions with this company and would just like to increase my experience.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of assisting customers, checking out customers' merchandise at the cash registers, straightening merchandise on shelves and making sure assigned department inventory was correct. I learned how to manage inventory control and how to meet customers needs properly. The hourly management was very helpful. The salaried management could be difficult to deal with at times. The hardest part of the job was when we had an issue and had to call on salaried management they acted like it was a problem to help us. That led to issues with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my coworkers. We worked together as a team to accomplish goals."
good,Walmart isn't a bad place to get your feet wet when it comes to work. You meet a plethora of people ranging from beneficial to detrimental. It's all about who you know here but trust and believe you can climb the ladder quick. I've met some great people here and I will never forget my experience working here.
good,"I was able to work in many different departments and was always learning something new."
good,"As member of management, we tour the building and find areas of opportunity, and delegate the tasks out to fellow associates for a timely completion. I have learned how to drive sales, associate relations and communication. Hardest parts of my job is completing everything I would like to in a day, finding a happy balance between work and personal and home life. Schedules are very sporadic and would be nice to have a balanced work and home life. Most enjoyable part of my job, is interaction with associates and vendors, driving sales for the company."
good,"This was a decent place to work, the employees were given the required breaks, meals were provided during those breaks and the management treated the staff with the respect that they deserved."
good,"The pay and hours are fine for a summer or part time job, but there is not much to be said for a career.  May be better if a person was seeking management opportunities."
good,if your not a supervisor you really don't have any opportunities. basically whatever management says goes and you can ask for policy to be carried out and you will be given the run around
good,"Depends on department and manager in charge."
good,"Overnight stocker I Transported pallets while uplolding safety standards and ensuring a neat and orderly work environment. Stocked shelves, racks, cases,bins,and tables with new or transferred merchandise."
good,Company involvement with the employees could be better while there is great diversity. The associates make coming to work worthwhile. The work life balance is not really respected due to store managers overworking management that report to them.
good,"The normal work day as an overnight stocker was very fast pace, all stocking was done overnight and none of it was left over for the next shift. We zoned entire store before shift end."
good,"Great job for individuals that are looking for a job to start out and generate an income. Not so great to turn this job into a career,  the hours are long and boring, and you aren't paid enough for all that you go through in a typical day."
good,Responsibilites included cleaning the store and maintaining all the shelves as well as the labels and reorganinzing the shelves. As well as moving product were it needs to be.
good,"I love love to work at a place with good people, a nice environment.easy going. I like to stay busy and help as much as I can. I've done all different kinds of jobs but I am interested in apparel and working in retail. I don't mind working long hours, as long as there are fair breaks. I have great customer service skills. While at Walmart I had trained for ""asset protection"" and learned about the security in the store. I think every job is what you make it, and even on bad days I try to make the best of everything. A typical day at work all depends on the job but I think in general it would be to stay focused, get what you need to do done, and handle every situation the best you can."
good,it was a learning experience but i enjoyed the customer service and the customers ! some associates were okay the management is not the best but i made the best of it
good,I enjoyed the staff and customers.  They provided a lot of training that prepared me for the job.  Management fell short when working with me and my schedule.
good,"really good management, if not for my home location i will surely be still working here management really listen to your thoughts and your co workers really cooperate with you to finish task efficiently"
good,striped and wax floors mostly. every now and then i would clean the restrooms when someone did not show up for work. i would do my job and not that i dont work their i can still come in and my old boss would say how i was the best person he had working their.
good,good people good place if i could get rehired i would had this job when i was younger and wasn't sure of my living situations they are structured and they work with you as much as possible
good,"At first I thought it was nice to work nights there and do what I wanted during the day, but then i realized they had task sheets that made us do 16 hours of work in only 7 hours. It was good work just wasn't my cup of tea as life went on."
good,"Working at Walmart for last 8 years has been good to me and my family, I like the work and my co workers. The hardest part is lack of communication, and/or having multiple managers not being on page with one another and us. Recently a lot of people have left or been asked to leave, that makes us short handed, and won't replace them which makes doing our job harder. But we do the very best we can to end our shift on a good note. Walmart is enjoyable due to my co workers, helping each other when someone is in need, Some of the best people I've known, I met at Walmart. My customers are great, I have some regulars that I look forward to seeing."
good,"Hard work bringing in carts in all kinds of weather conditions. Can be enjoyable at times. Helping people get heavier items into their vehicles means that, if the item is for a customer's friend\family member's birthday means that the customer will be making someone's day."
good,"Unrealistic expectations of crew members who have never done any work like that before, employee turnover rate was way to much.  Took less than two months to be offered a supervisory position, which again shows the terrible employee turnover rate."
good,I was a Photo Lab Technician with Walmart. What I enjoyed the most about this position was my co workers and the look in our customers eyes when they would receive their cherished memories.
good,"Walmart pays very good. I loved being there, hours for me where 2-11 and that was great but the support manger we had to her power to much. And was always mad at everyone for nothing."
good,"Definitely needs more work . Management completely rude and unprofessional. Overall Walmart is okay I absolutely love it but, just needs to respect people more"
good,"A typical day is ringing up customers, i didn't like standing in one spot the whole shift, i enjoyed the interactions with the customers, hardest part of the job would have to be difficult customers... it is walmart."
good,"One of the coolest jobs ever...... At first "
good,"good work, friendly atmosphere, and help is there when needed. Not too sure about making into a career but the money is there but not the time to help accumulate the funds needed to live not there."
good,"Wal mart is a good company, their are some great individuals that work for wal mart and they can be really family oriented. I have worked here for almost 30 years."
good,"The wal-mart manager has no idea what store level manager go through on a daily basis, they implement policies that are solely to  put money in the pockets of investors and upper management not there associates. Holidays are now spent in the stores rather than with their families , this is about only money/"
good,"Walmart offers great benefits and a reasonable pay to deli associates. Although, lack of experienced staff causes a cycle of turnover in this department."
good,Not very professional. You seem to lousy around more then do your actual job. also big issue with the management. When an issue would occur they are no where to be found.
good,"Currently they are pushing the overnight associates hard. Constantly yelling and clapping hands ""encouraging"" us to go faster. Expect to sweat for that extra dollar overnight bump."
good,I feel like the job can improve on professionalism and the mangers should be more considerate of the associates and they can have a better system for trainees to learn
good,"I have worked the toy department, accounting department, and the UPC department.  I have learned many things including how to look for shrinkage within the store."
good,It was fun job loved getting to know the people that work their but managemnt wasnt so supportive. Would consider as maybe a first time job but not for long term.
good,A typical day at work was i would get to work at 5am to start my day i would pull out the bread so it can finish thawing out then i would start by pulling my donuts out and putting them on racks after i did that i would put then back in freezer and put in oven. I learned how to make donuts and stock the floor.
good,for they pay they offer   the work is way above   you over see more than you can handle and take on other duties when someoneelse is falling short  but get no recognition
good,"Zoning and helping customer find what they are looking.  The worst part of my day is answer the phone. The best part of my day is working with the customer one on one to help them find what they are looking for, always finding what is new on how people like to dress nowadays."
good,They are good. But expect a whole lot when there is not much to do or give. Walmart should provide full time hours instead of part time. No insurance is heavy on some people. And no full time means no good check to pay bills. No one can survive off part time.
good,"*Typical workday was busy"
good,"it was hectic ."
good,"Great people & great place to work. They worked with me on my schedule. They encouraged you as a worker. For the area, good pay & great opportunity & the company offers great incentives."
good,Not the absolute best co workers. Just stick to yourself and get your assigned work done. Pay is good and benefits are great. Hardest part is staying busy if you finished early.
good,Had good benefits but management needs to be better.  I would go into work at 1:00pm and all of the notes the manager had for my work place had already been completed.  The manager would send me to another department leaving no one to serve customers.
good,"This store was smaller than most of the other Walmarts around."
good,I learned a lot I seen a lot I really like how they pushed me to be a better team member and also how to be kind and sweet assistant it's all apart of being a member at walmart
good,"buena empresa, con detalles como cafe y cierta libertad de accion que dejaba espacio para trabajar tranquilo, cuando uno sabe organizar su tiempo y labores(prioridades). aunque como en todos lados, uno conoce gente agradable y otras que no."
good,"Walmart has a great associate family that I enjoyed working with. You get a discount card after a few months of working there which is good for 10% off of most General Merch. and some food items! Plus if the store goes over certain profit margins and safety goals, there are quarterly bonuses called MyShare!! Although, a lot of the newer rules aren't associate oriented, like the new attendance policy, does not fit well with the point system for absences. And the offered healthcare is expensive... "
good,"A good experience to get under my belt. I learned how to help and talk to customers. Always put the customer first. Unfortunately the training while I was there for new associates was pretty bad they just throw you at the work and if you can squeeze it in you can do 15 minutes of required time put in to advance in a computer training program. Some of the time there were too many managers and they didn't communicate with each other well so I was given one instruction and then another overriding the previous instruction. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was stocking grocery, helping customers. The hardest part of the job was not knowing what my dad was going to be like every time I went in. It was a big surprise every time I wish it had more consistent you have to be adaptable."
good,Overnight stocker position is a challenging position if you are a good worker. If you are a bad worker they tend to give you some slack by putting you in easy departments with another associate. Management is too focus on clearing out the back rooms any way possible that at the end jeopardizes the way the store looks. The stores would perform better if they would make all associates work instead of counting on a handful of individuals. I once asked why do we have so many slackers and there response was that we need the bodies. To me that response does not motivate anyone to work harder especially if you can do have the work of the harder working individuals and get paid the same. When working at a Walmart store you need to make sure they give you time to complete pathways as this is a way a store gets away from giving you your bonuses.
good,"It was a great place to work, they worked with you on mostly everything.  It just depends who was working to help you. You do get great benefits though , with quarterly bonus'."
good,"I worked in the Pharmacy area which in itself was a tasking job, I was in charge of getting each customers medicine, I learned so much about different pharmaceuticals and insurance coverage."
good,"WalMart can be a fun place to work but not for a couple of individuals who just seem to want to make things difficult."
good,regular retail duties and customer service expectations   good benefits and available advancement within the company   full time and part time people will do well in the stores
good,"Management are time watchers to use of bathroom breaks.  Hours are cut from November to March each year in the retail work environment.  "
good,"work in the back unloading tractor trailers of store product. organizing by type, category and location onto pallets to be distributed throughout the store"
good,"Everyday was productive and fast paced. The most important thing I learned from the position that I worked was to live a simple and neat life. Reason being, we swept, scrubbed, buffed and waxed floors in which they had to be neat. Our goal was to ensure the store was attractive and safe. In which a person can apply those particular daily practices to everyday life.Management and our leads worked well with us because we communicated daily. The hardest part of the  job was simply consistently working at fast pace, due to the fact we had to pay attention to detail. Most enjoyable part was working as a team, because as a team we made it fun."
good,overall great place. I have nothing bad for walmart. they treat ppl really good. the benefits are great. the pay is great. the location is awesome. just great
good,"Excellent  work opportunity, Friendly environment, flexible hours, Fantastic place to make further work-related contacts, good food, must be willing to do your best in all situations."
good,Constantly helping customers fill their shopping needs. Extremely busy work environment. Co-workers and supervisors were there to help each other when needed. Pleasant and friendly atmosphere with  a lot of customer interaction.
good,use pallet jacket to load and unload truck with freight to the sell floor. I also unload grocery truck and stock grocery until the end of my shift and report to manger when I'm finished.
good,"The hours were great and the pay was great as well, but the management had some issues. It wasn't an entirely positive environment to be a part of. Some of the co-workers were fine but others not so much."
good,It was a OK job. The pay really bad. One good thing about the job you get two 15 minutes breaks and 1 hour lunch break.  Part or the job is to keep all the bathrooms clean and it is the worst thing you ever saw.
good,Great place with good benefits. Hard work but they offer a lot of incentives. They are a more team oriented place and everyone is very helpfully toward each other.
good,"Very dedicated company to work with, holding those employed to a higher standard in job performance."
good,People was great to work with but the Management had no idea what to do and it did help that the store its self had no idea what to do so it closed down.
good,I was over the freezer and dairy department. The job is very physical and involves some endurance. Great costumer atmosphere. Especially during football season. Usually cuts hours in February if you are not full time.
good,"Do your job and be a team player and you will enjoy working there. It is a place to build a career, get your GED, flexible schedule, and a better benefit"
good,Walmart is a place where you had to be open to working different jobs. I would often look forward to the hour long lunches and the fact that they give you a 3 week notice on your schedule was a plus.
good,"I absolutely love everyone i work with. the people are great. i work doing wireless sales which means i activate phones and help customers find the right electronics that fit what they are looking for. the only downside to the job is my schedule is all over the place and im not getting the hours i need in order to make rent and pay other bills. everyone i work with is really friendly and caring about one another so thats probably the best part of the job, the atmosphere."
good,"Work outdoors, lifting, bending, and crouching 100% of the time. Management was awesome until they brought in the son of the owner. Afterwards all policies changed."
good,"Walmart is a safe company in terms of job security.  It is the worlds largest retailer , and they show no sings of slowing down.  I've worked for this company for a combined total of 16 years."
good,Not too bad of a company to work for.  The people are the best part.  A good portion of the managers will bend over backwards to help you out.  Helping customers find what they're looking for is fairly rewarding.
good,I worked for the company for 4 years. The raises were bad and management just et the customers do whatever they wanted whenever they wanted to. The only thing good about walmart for me was the other employees I worked with
good,Walmart managers had me on edge at all times. I was always getting plucked away from my department to perform useless other tasks that could be considered grunt work
good,"Fast paced.  Fun place to work.  Good wages.  Lots of opportunity at many jobs available in the warehouse.  Inventory, security, order filling and forklift driving."
good,I liked working for a fast pace job some of the customers are a kick the hardest part was listening to the kids running up and down and screaming Management was ok.
good,"I kept busy and stayed productive. There was always something to do, between cashiering, straightening end caps, and helping customers. It was fast paced and that is something I enjoyed about my job there."
good,"Walmart is retail at your finest. Despite what others think, Walmart pays well for a job to gain experience in. Good for first time employment, and can quickly advance."
good,"Handled multiple transactions for returned or exchanged merchandise, sorted the merchandise to the"
good,Walmart was a fun place to work.  I moved all over the country for them and lived and worked in several different states.  At that point in my life it was fun.
good,"Answered customers' questions and addressed problems and complaints in person and via phone. Helped customers"
good,Working at Walmart is an average retail job. The hours are very flexible and management is pretty understanding about scheduling changes. They also pay above minimum wage and every associate gets a nice bonus every April. The job's not excellent but it's great for students or people who need a little bit of extra cash.
good,"very interesting place to work at. Surrounded by alot of people every day. Stocking position was always lifting so never had time to stand around, good insurance and other offers"
good,"retail environment with ups and downs, decent breaks and associates were my favorite part of the job. Management can be tough at times but that's expected in the environment of retail."
good,"I needed an income and took the first one that came my way. What I liked is, the company did work around my school schedule and had as much passion for my growth as I did. However, I was just another number to them and they did not have the same visions toward success as I would have preferred."
good,"Worked in pets by myself most nights. Management wasn't very helpful, they were more concerned about other departments. The hardest part of the job was managers did not listen to the needs of the employees."
good,A typical day at work is getting slammed with a few trucks while getting told your not working fast enough and the managers could do it faster as they just stand there. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the managers
good,"Great work place."
good,"A good job for those new to the workforce. Customers can be difficult, and the managers are not always qualified. You generally make a few cents above minum wage, and have good job security."
good,It is Wal mart and everybody knows Wal Mart. It was fine for the time. I enjoyed the work for the period of time I worked there. I had some good team mates.
good,I worked at Walmart for my first job. The first store was great and I had amazing coworkers. I ended up moving to a different state and didn't appreciate the management at the new store at all.
good,"Once you are in the deli at Walmart don't expect to go anywhere. Your hard work will go unnoticed. Just don't do it, because it doesn't give you an opportunity to show leadership skills that would get you a job as department manager or higher."
good,Estabilidad laboral. Pero con problemas para obtener otro turno y mejor calidad de vida
good,"I enjoyed working there. The whole atmosphere was upbeat and friendly. Everyone liked to help each other when needed. There was some favoritism for long term workers, but not much."
good,The culture within this organization is great for students looking for work-study placement. You can learn many skills about publishing and journalism.
good,"a good job if you dont know what you want to do. this is job directly serving the public, helping sutomers with there needs. not one of the best jobs but stable."
good,Being a customer service supervisor evolves a fast pace environment and being quick on your toes. I worked close with other management closely and supervised many associates. The work place was nice but there is a lot of drama and rumors that go around. The hardest part was having conflict with co-workers and not having management back-up. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to spend one on one time with customers. I have learned how to delegate many tasks and how to accomplish all of what is needed within my shift.
good,Typical day depends where you work in the store. I learned how the business is run and how to manage your associates. How to deal with irrate customers and disgruntled associates. work place culture is normally happy but also stressfull. Hardest part of the job is the stress. The most enjoyable part is making customers happy.
good,It's not mentally hard. Physically can be. The customers are usually nice. Its a bit repetitive. The management is mostly good.
good,Job is easy if every one is responsible for there work.There are some great mangers and other sucks.Its short and to the point take care of your work and be on time and you will be good
good,"It was a very decent job for my first time in any work force, the people were very nice and the management was harsh but also friendly and nice when they needed to be all in all a job place to work for your first job."
good,"A typical work day would be me greeting customers and helping them find something if they are not ready to be helped yet, if it's not busy. But if it is a busy work day I would be on the registers ringing up customers items and conversating with customers until the business dies down."
good,Constantly changing company with room to grow. Lots of opportunity to learn many different skills. Generally flexible hours. Environment fosters teamwork.
good,Salary of the associates are not enough for works they are doing. Underpaid. That's why people need to do extra job to support their needs
good,"This place was a good place to work, very fun but people there were rude and at times hard to deal with. Overall a great place to be employed and good pay"
good,very enjoyable place to work. was promoted due to hard work and perserverance.  management was definitely supportive of advancement
good,Basically they work their workers way harder than they're paying them for. Especially overnight. They don't give you enough training for the job.
good,This job allowed me to meet some amazing people. My coworkers were awesome and my bosses were too. I was paid decently and it was a great experience for my first time ever being a cashier.
good,Was good place to work but the management never stayed for long and you always have to learn different expectations of new managers which would be fine but not all management changed so some were still wanting different things and it made it hard to do your job
good,Outstanding job position. Very outgoing and fast work. Friendly co workers/supervisor. Very hardworking management very motivating uplifting crew with a smile
good,"Its your typical big corporation, which is great for job security but the pay is very lacking and yes you can move up in the corporation but in a place like this the gained responsibility is never worth the pay. I so somewhat enjoy my job in sight to store even though it has some very slow times but I like being able to get to know the store and dealing with the people that are at least smart enough to work a computer."
good,Great place to work. The management really works with you especially if you show initiative in your work.  You get an hour for lunch and you can use that time for yourself. You can leave the area and go anywhere. Great teamwork environment and also a great way too meet new peopke and make good friends.
good,"Honestly, it was years ago, places change management and staff so often that my review would not be valid.  Sorry I could not be of more help to everyone."
good,"Working at the company gave me the opportunity to learn my craft well and to help the everyday consumer. It's a great company for anyone looking for a start. However, I would not advise anyone to stay with them long-term as work/life balance will continue to remain an issue. From experience, there's the culture the company thinks it portrays and then there's the real side of it. On the bright side, you feel an attachment to the work you do because deep down you know that it helps the person in the store to do their job which trickles down to benefiting the customer. Yet, unrealistic expectations from direct supervisors ruins the morale of the associate despite giving them feedback."
good,You clock in and start straight on a cashier machine and begin to check people out. The customers make the job. You check out people stock shelves and clean up work stations. Then go home.
good,"This job is a hit or miss. It all depends on your personality. You might like it if you really enjoy working with people. If not, then this job is not for you."
good,Walmart has a large variety of opportunities all over the world.  They make transfers convenient and easy.  The pay is ok and work is fairly fulfilling.
good,Can no longer stand for long periods of time at cash register.  The company offers longevity and promote within.  Benefits are an option if you work enough hours.
good,"Nice people in the photo lab. I enjoyed working in the photo lab. Cashier was hard, mad customers,never happy. Good insurance rates. Pay sucked"
good,Working as a TLE tech for walmart is an easy job and fun place. Slow and fast pace work. A typical day at the TLE shop is about the same everyday and night.
good,"muy entretenido, capacidad de adaptarse ya que depende de las contingencias del negocio el dia a dia"
good,Everyone works together well. Most of the work is common sense so it is not too difficult. Having to work holidays is one of the downfalls though.
good,"I had this job awhile back, and at that time the store was in a bit of a mess. I, and fellow coworkers, did not know who our supervisor was as we ever saw them. Instead of telling us themselves, nearly all the managers would send someone to us as their messenger. Because of this, we barely knew the higher ups. However, we would assist in the back to help the trucks unload, so it wasn't all just one thing. But I do think the store could have used some improvement."
good,"Disfruté el trabajo pero se requieren auxiliares para sacar el demasiado trabajo como cambio de precios, etiquetas, acomodar el área y atender a los clientes... Y lo más grave... Cumplir con las ventas diarias. Con el bajo salario no podía estar consumiendo en la cafetería por lo tanto tenía que trasladarme a mi casa para los alimentos. No se respetaba la hora de salida por atención al cliente..."
good,"A day at work for me is simple. It's a two step process, first we unload the truck, followed by stocking the aisles throughout the store. I learned that having coworkers who are passionate to there work helps you get through your work day. The hardest part of the job has to be doing 10 hours of work a day in a 8 hour span. Besides the normal workday i enjoyed receiving free donuts in the break room."
good,did not enjoy the environment management need more communication and teamwork. didn't like working night shift its the only downside .don't have much to say than that
good,Walmart was a very good place to work I love the customer service and the customers I also enjoyed helping people as well as having a job that lasted a while
good,helping employees through the day meet their goals. great management team. good employees still keep in contact with.
good,"The people were great to work with and it was very enjoyable being there a lot of the time. Management never wanted to resolve issues or go by the rules. I would constantly be scheduled outside of my availability and was told I would never get full time in my department, but didn't want to let you move to a different department."
good,What I learned working with the public is everyone is different and has there own opinions. Most enjoyable part was meeting new people and working to help them find what they were looking for. Along with Filling the gratitude of helping the person and making there day.
good,Check out forklift for safety make sure lift is operating properly get zone from supervisor or area manager. Do putaways in that zone and replenisment
good,"Management was never on the same page and rules kept changing.  Working overnight is hard work, but I enjoyed working here."
good,Working at Walmart taught me many things and they even gave me cashier experience. I had excellent hours for my first job ever. I usually worked long hours 2PM-11PM 3PM-12AM and they always kept me busy but it was very simple in all honesty. My only problem i had working there was making my schedule a little flexible (Mon & Wed) for college and they refused to answer my request.
good,I don't really have much to say about work at Wal-Mart other then the discount was fair for the employees. I only worked here for about a month or so while I was going to school
good,"My typical work day included mopping and cleaning the floors."
good,Working at Walmart is very chaotic but very rewarding. Managers usually acknowledge your achievements and gently reprimand your mistakes. overall very friendly workplace
good,"Management was not difficult to employees.  They were very good about giving breaks, not bothering employees on breaks, not working off the clock.  Very good benefits,too."
good,"I was cross trained in every department while working at Neighborhood Market, and even though I took leadership steps and strides to work there, I was denied the opportunity to advance and it was disappointing. I first learned the cash register here, and every day was different since we had to constantly work on new projects and got new inventory, but I eventually learned how to do everything in every department. My main departments were dry grocery and pharmacy/makeup. I was often in charge of managing inventory and making sure everything was correct and up to date within the system. I was often chosen to work as acting Customer Service Manager when the one working had to go on lunch and had to multitask while doing so."
good,Fue demostrar que las cosas no son fáciles el atender al cliente es difícil ya que como norma el cliente siempre tiene la razón pero a veces tan solo con un por favor y gracias en pocas palabras un saludo amable hace mas ameno el trabajo ya que el cliente es mas sutil hacia el empleado
good,Too many stressful situations. Management was divided and a little out of order. The job required a lot of work for so little pay.
good,Typical plant work  not much to it. I was working through a temp company so I received average pay. Great job great people as well
good,Available for customers and cashiers to help with questions and problems.Checking customers merchandise in a timely matter. I am trainable in many areas of rental.
good,"I enjoyed working at Wal-mart. If they would have paid more, I would have definitely stayed out there. Scheduling wasn't too bad, except they would short staff you sometimes. Work was easy and fun. Good people. Overall, a good place."
good,"I have learned about my self, how strong I am."
good,"Just a job for those not looking for a lot of hours and low pay.  "
good,"You're on your feet all day other than break time. It gets hit with rushes when everyone is off of work. I was mainly a cashier, the hardest part for me was standing around waiting."
good,A typical day is a busy day where you learn to know your customer preferences. It is always good to place your items in a perfect order. The hardest part is to deal with a difficult client while the most enjoyable one is to meet the client's expectation
good,Typically Walmart Pharmacy on E. Washington St. is extremely busy. I have learned many things at Walmart considering this is the first time I work at a pharmacy. There is many managers and many departments to have an actual opinion of the management team. The workplace culture is super diverse and I enjoy translating when I get the opportunity to do so. The hardest part of the job is unhappy patients due to them not feeling well and wanting speedy answers. The most enjoyable part of the job is hearing all the sincere thank you's from patients and regular customers even for the smallest thing.
good,I worked for this company for 3 years and found management to be something very poor.  The management staff really need to learn how to talk to employees and realize that their home life should not effect the way they act at work.
good,I already knew lots of the customer's from working for the bowling center they all shop at Walmart.I also liked learning all depts.
good,"If you've worked for the company for over 10 years and you have no intention on moving up, then they will find any way to get rid of you. This place is okay if you need a part time job."
good,It was a pretty cool job. The best things were being able to build relationships with co workers as well as regular customers but that's as good as it got.
good,"Al llegar ala tienda pude aprender fácilmente las actividades que me correspondian, la atención al cliente, cambiar productos, verificar precios, imprimir etiquetas, poner rótulos, acomodar artículos, frentear y llenar producto."
good,"Great Experience"
good,is just a typical day at work with supervisors getting on you. you doing some else job and not getting appreciated for it. culture of the workplace was okay.
good,"walmart was a good opportunity, My work there was multifaceted, though i was hired on for one position i ended up training for all. in general its a great place to work"
good,"Working at Walmart was good at times and bad at times. As a sales associate, I soared above and beyond my job expectations. I always provided quick and friendly customer service and I kept my work area clean. I found that certain managers made my job more enjoyable than others. For a while, I had one manager that I felt was sexually harassing both me and my sister, along with our other coworkers. "
good,"Manejo de mercancía, inventario, papeleos "
good,The work at Walmart was challenging and they sometimes expect a lot. But if you are willing to just work hard every day you will be content. There is nothing special here it is just a job.
good,"Good company to work for with great vision. "
good,While at Walmart many of the employees were not friendly. Also while working there the managers really did not care about what you were doing or how you were doing anything.
good,"Walmart was a steady day-to-day job, the other employees didn't like me much. Partly because they did a lot of things that were wrong and inappropriate for the work place and i would inform management."
good,Very poor not fair employment horriblr managers at the store I was at it was ridiculous working here I would never work at Walmart and they don't pay nothing at all
good,Te apoyan y se ajusta deacuerdo a tus necesidades.
good,always loved the people working at Walmart just the compensation and pay was not even close to being able to survive in the Houston market. started there at $8 per hr. after 3 yrs of hard work only was able to get to $10 per hr. I was lead on for 2 years that I would be getting a leadership role even though I was already doing all the work for that role I didn't get the position. Being an overnight employee you don't get any recognition for any hard work you do because the main management who matter don't see you.
good,Filling orders for multiple Walmart stores. We started the day at 6am and ended at 4pm. Some management was better than others. Chance at advancement was good. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the heat in the summer time.
good,it is a good job. set schedule and a good atmosephere. the only thing is that they do not work you any more than 40hrs a week. during the winter its 36 hrs
good,Always meeting new people great way to learn customer service fast good place to work csm are nice and help you learn the computer and the system overall good place
good,Very busy and fast-paced place to work. Learned to multi-task and devise plans to keep register lines to a minimal. Enjoyed working with my fellow co-workers.
good,"the job is not so bad, and the employees and managers are really nice. There are some days when you'll run into so very rude customers. One thing I don't agree with about the Walmart organization is they don't offer full time positions to everyone. They'll give you part time hours so they don't have to give you benefits."
good,"If you have never worked retail then Walmart isn't the best place to start. It's difficult and not for everyone. I personally enjoyed my first year and a half, and then everything starting declining as if the employees were no longer being taken care of. The company loves to hire people at a decent starting wage and continue to bump that pay up which is great but every 2 to 3 years they will hire a bunch of new people to replace you at a cheaper pay rate."
good,"Love the envirnonment. Friendly workplace, understanding,awesome place to work and shop. Enjoyable moments are working with customers."
good,"Working for Walmart was not a bad job. The income is pretty good but most of the people that work their are all about causing issues. Working as a cashier is fun, due to helping a bunch of people and meeting all sorts of people. Working over in the deli, you get the experience of food and different types of people and their tastes. The only thing that is the hardest part of the job, I would say is the fact you have to make food and a lot of it is already old or looks old. And the portion sizes versus prices are a little ridiculous."
good,"Gostei de ter trabalhado nessa empresa, foi minha primeira oportunidade de carteira assinada. Só que não me adaptei para a área de televendas."
good,"If you want a job that is easy to get into and you only have to work enough to actually earn your benefits, Walmart is your kind of job,"
good,"Stocked shelves overnight"
good,"A typical day at work, what I learned, management, workplace culture, the hardest part of the job, the most enjoyable part of the job all three stars."
good,"typical day: problem solving , cleaning up after other's , tasking work load , holding meetings , following up ,what I have learned is to  multitasking , patience and a lot of understanding , and you have to know whats going on at all time ,management not easy and don't always realize the fastest way to get things done may not always have the best results. work culture : high stress, unfriendly,hard work. the hardest part of the job is watching good hard workers brake down , seeing over load of work being add to whats all ready an abundance of work, not having enough people to get the job done. and a very high stressful environment.  the most enjoyable part of the job is  to be able to give exceptional customer service, its a great joy to help over's . and  know that I can make a difference..."
good,Worked in a productive department with good people and great customers. Love servicing the community by watching the customers leave satisfied everyda
good,"Good starting pay.  Physical work so you must be ready to put in a hard day.  Work weeks are short, either 4 ten hour days or 3 twelve hour days.  Employee discount."
good,I sale shoes and shoes accessories to hundreds of people. the benefits are good and the people are kind. I learned to work with the public.
good,"I enjoyed working their helping people and assisting them with their problems. I am a peoples person and I do enjoy helping people."
good,"I worked for the company for 10 years, two different stores, and I noticed many changes from the time I began work there. The changes are not what I expected, therefore I'm looking for work in a different field. It seems the company is not family oriented as it was when I first started work there. When I first began with the company you felt as though you were part of a team, it does not feel that way now. Not everyone is included in meetings, information is not shared equally among associates, and some are treated differently than others."
good,"Load pallets with orders given."
good,working at wal-mart was alright. depending on who your manager was for the day.you could either have a good or bad day. depending on how they feel which is annoying.Or working with employee that just like to play around. But most of the time it was do your work and go home.
good,Employers need to be required by law to post notifications where locations are being monitored by security cameras.  This will help reduce the harassing interactions from security personnel as they exhibit unprofessional communications and behaviors to intimidate and provoke employees.
good,"Scheduling Audits"
good,I had fun working here. Nice people and crazy customers the perfect place to work as a teen. There lots of room for growth if you are willing to put in the work.
good,This was my first real job before the ARMY it was good for what it was but it has serious lack of communication between its employees no one was ever on the same page there
good,"Very busy store but can be very satisfying. Great Team atmosphere."
good,"los malos entendidos"
good,A typical work day involves stocking aisles and making the store look presentable and meeting standards of company during my active shift which was 3rd shift.
good,They are an ok work place as far as fellow employees go. The management has no respect for anyone at all. They are not as family oriented as they make out to be
good,"A typical day at work waiting on customers making sure I'm fast and friendly."
good,"At the time i worked there the pay was low but its went up, there was too much stuff to store in their bins and we were forced to stay until we found room when there wasn't any sometimes."
good,It would be even better if it was more organized and collaberal. Higher positions really take away cooperation when they abuse their power. But i like work with my crew.
good,"Good associates and good ams at the stores"
good,I loved working for walmart..i was great at my job and i got along with everyone. I would definately like to work back there in the future i would just need a different schedule..
good,It was a decent place to work with decent pay.The coworkers and management were fairly good people. I enjoyed working there while I did
good,"A typical work day was facing products and restocking the isles."
good,"Would not like to comment, though I had a long career here. Leaving in the manner that they dismissed me was not a good experience after almost 16 years."
good,"I was forced to do unimaginable things , managers only cared about each other , I was never listened to especially when it really mattered .  I still loved and cared about this job . The job was easy and could of been better if the managers understood the importance of help that was needed ."
good,Walmart can be a crazy at times with only a few registers open but over all I made a ton of friends and the management is beyond amazing and understanding
good,Typical day requires returning stock to shelves and helping customers with the purchase of electronic equipment. educating customers on new products and features.
good,"they were aware that I have a learning disability that has to do with math and telling time, they were not very patient with me"
good,"I've worked in three different locations, spanning six years, and feel that Walmart isn't as 'friendly' as they claim to be. The associates who work hard are always pushed harder, while the lazy associates get away with doing nothing and no one holds them accountable. All management teams I've worked with in each facility seem to struggle with the same thing; accountability. You're either told they're handling it and they forget, or nothing happens at all. Store managers themselves are rude and have very unrealistic expectations, I constantly felt like my managers wanted to see me fail more than they wanted me to succeed."
good,"The company has a rich history, but is struggling to find a way to compete with Amazon. The infrastructure in Bentonville is outdated--making it a bore to work there."
good,"If you want review answers regarding a companies performance, get a job through them yourself. I will not divulge my personal feelings or thoughts."
good,"El trabajo es sencillo, pero con el tiempo se te pide más. Recomendable como primer empleo,"
good,A typical day in Walmart was me going in to the back room unloading the truck trailer and placing the boxes in the backroom in certain places. I was also assigned to certain areas in order to unload the boxes into its proper places
good,Working at Walmart provides the chance to work with a variety of different cultures and It is a busy place to work. Horrible hours and pay for the amount of disrespect the employees get from customers and management does not provide much organization or assistance when something needs to be done.
good,"The is great, you work hard but employees don't do their jobs which makes bad work environment. Hardest part of the job is trying to keep the lot clean."
good,What I liked about Walmart was the training it was fast easy and skillful.It was a fast paste job that i absolutely loved.everyone was so nice.
good,"Work is hard, hours can be long, challenges are great.  Ensuring the associates are happy, have the tools they need to accomplish their daily tasks, have a strong and healthy environment to work in and a management team that cares about their success is vitally important to the success of the company."
good,"I enjoy working for Walmart; that is, when it seems that managers are competent (of which I've had many) but not when you feel that you have to do their job (of which I've had a few as well). Overall it's a very professional environment where you can move up with hard work, good presentation, and a degree."
good,Walmart is a laid back work environment with plenty to keep you busy. A great customer base and wonderful management team. There are always different task to complete during a shift
good,"Walmart is a nice place to work.Management is not so well.They want to dictate your life.When I started there nine years ago they never hired me full-time,when it came to hiring me they said they wasn't  hiring any more gull time people."
good,I like it except the company would say we had insurance even though we didn't and we were still paying for it. As a cart attendant I was nearly ran over multiple times a day.
good,good place to work but like most places is has its slow season but if you can weather the storm there are lots of hours. good people and challenging work depending where your are. keeps you in shape.
good,"Empresa possuía uma excelente cultura empresarial criada pelo seu fundador, porém aqui nos Brasil, mais em especifico em todas as lojas do Distrito federal absolutamente nenhuma seguia a cultura."
good,Desempene mi funcion de repositor en el sector de soff line sin problemas.trabajaba 36hs semanales por un contrato de tres meses.el cual termino.tube un buen reconocimiento de mi desempeno y una promesa de llamado el cual nunca llego.
good,This is a very physical job. There are several different areas to work. Some jobs are less physical. Usually a 10 hour shift.  The best part is you can switch positions every 6 months.
good,We would come and might be stop and asked to check out returned items or overnight manger might have something broke. If nothing going on would go check on needed displays to be built. We pull item and build them. Sometimes projects or customer to build items.
good,The environment was good the work and people there were fun and friendly. The tasks were reachable and fare for everyone the customers were mostly kind and understanding. The facility run fairly with chance to move up.
good,"Good place to work! friendly and professional managers, great benefits and plenty opportunity to advance. fun and courteous employees who provide great customer service"
good,"Working with customers along with stocking shelves."
good,"I did not work there for very long.  At the time, the Walmart I worked at had poor Management.  The job was just right for me at the time.  I would work their again if it was part time."
good,"Maintain Clean checkout area. Check customers out at speedy pace. Put up inventory when not busy or I don't have any customers. Assist customers with photo print outs, passport photos, and instant prints."
good,I loved working with some really nice women. I really didn't like that we got payer less just because we are cashiers. The management was all right. The hours were not the greatest
good,I am currently a receiver at Walmart and I am supposed to take in any deliveries but some days I don't see a single delivery because I am told to go do another task in a different department. Some managers don't let me help out my partner when he is overwhelmed with the number of deliveries and same goes the other way.
good,Fun place to work to meet and interact with people of all cultures and backgrounds.  A typical day at work is to be able to adapt to change.  Management is there to answer any questions.  Hardest part of the job is to be able to find work when not busy.  I learned how to interact with people of all intellectual backgrounds.
good,I loved working with the people there for he most part though i did not like the boring aspect of it and eventually i just couldn't spend my time there without hating it.
good,When I was working there I worked in housewares as a stocker but the job also comes with many other tasks like going to the back to help out unloading the trucks and going to the grocery side to help Zone I even learned how to mix paint in Hardware department so yes it was a pretty challenging task but also it was fun
good,Very good I just don't agree with the PTO in that company they are very unfair wen it comes to working and have an emergency to leave they are not very understanding
good,"There is no ""typical"" day, focus and needs change quickly.  This is a highly diverse company that gives you exposure to many types of people and business areas."
good,i worked night so it wasn't to bad. I had to sort stuff in carts and one clean up around the cash registers stuff like that had check customers out and multitask.
good,typical day at work was going to a warehouse unloading trucks for the most of the day and having about an hour lunch then around 4 i would go home some days included i go to the store and put up partitions and displays and restock sometimes i would help customers with what they needed. I learned how to be able to work with others really well and i loved working as a team. The hardest part of the job was working in a truck that was sitting in the sun most of the time. The workplace was helpful and if i needed help i could ask someone else to help me and help teach me.
good,Always checking on merchandise movement and sales.  Management was no help and I had to learn everything myself.  I was in charge of 70% of the store yet I was given the least amount of employees to work with.  The hardest  part was getting everything done in a timely manner.  The most enjoyable aspect was accomplishing tasks that management thought was not possible.
good,"If you have AMAZING availability and flexibility you'll be taken care of.  If not, then you will be minimally taken care of.  You get from it what you put into it."
good,this is a god place for a high schooler or just out of school person to take on. it will help them learn the responsibility of keeping a job because if you mess up one too many times you are gone.
good,"Pay is ok, Hours are ok. But the people you encounter while working for Wal-Mart is rewarding. You build a sense of connection with coworkers and customers."
good,enjoyed my time at walmart. it paved the way for my career so far. fast paced team-oriented place to work. Always a way for career advancement.
good,"Validação de processos de Seleção interna, deixa a desejar."
good,A typical work day was very productive we were mostly always busy. I learned that teamwork and patience is very important. The management could be better but I enjoyed getting my work done. The hardest part of the job was the customers who decides to give me a hard time but patience and respect was always given when I shared any complicated conversation with a customer.
good,"it wasn't a bad job, it was easy just the pay was not good for what me and my team had to do each and every day. mangers didn't care about us tbh. benefits took forever to get."
good,"Working at the Walmart is definitely a great place to work, great benefits, and awesome way to get your foot in the door. Lots of space for movement within the company. I enjoy working here and could definitely see myself move up within the company."
good,I really enjoyed working for walmart but i just wasn't able to move up in the company.  The customer and most employees loved me and i loves them back.
good,"It was ok working here, I didn't mind it I was allowed to learn pretty things in pretty much every department in the store if I asked even if I wasn't in that department. Managers were nice and professional as long as you did your job like expected there usually were no issues."
good,"You have decent job security when working at walmart, but with strict policies and sub par wages, with not much room for raises it isn't the greatest place to work. At the walmart I worked at I definitely noticed a trend of taking advantage of good people."
good,the people you work with become family but the management team is unorganize to many people to lising too and what need to be done to fix a problem will never be done because to many people running the show
good,At this job we where so busy we where running around like chickens with there heads cut off. We where so busy!. I don't know if the customers where more upset or if we where more upset at there attitudes.
good,"Lo grato es la compatibilidad de vida familiar, horarios flexibles y beneficios para los colaboradores. Lo que debiera mejorar equitativamente son los salarios de acuerdo a las labores realizadas."
good,"At walmart the employees would always make the customers came first in every situation even if they was wrong, and they always came to work with a positive attitude"
good,"The work of a typical day includes putting received goods on a cart,then pull the cart on the floor,and put every item onto its home on shelves.Sometimes,because of the lack of truck unloaders,I would be asked to unload trucks."
good,"I liked working here because I have good customer service skills, however the management would always schedule me when I specifically said I couldn't work and vice versa."
good,I'm really good with people. Need a full time job one I can stay at for a long  period of time get the job done. I'm also trying to better my life and making a life for my kids. I'm trying to show myself I can do this. Get the stuff I need in life.
good,The management is not very well established.  Not at all family oriented or friendly. To many Clicks in the employees as well as the management staff. so its not easy or possible to work your way up in the company.
good,a typical day at work consists of bringing all the carts inside the store and also making sure the carts are organised. I help customers with their purchases  as well. the hardest part of my day is usually being outside during the cold alberta winters.
good,"Pushed carts  at Super Wal-mart in Monticello to  keep the carts         available for the Wal-mart customers to shop"
good,From unloading the truck to stocking shelves to helping customers..all around a decent place to work. A new experience each day. It's a good retail job for someone who likes to do it all.
good,I just would say this was a  great place to come to everyday in just work.Because to me i felt the management could do better job organize assignments for there employees. And they need to have a better system on there (point of sale) software.And they hire people that don't even take job seriously.I here a lot of my friends and family don't even want to go in the store to shop because so many issues happens at Wal mart.
good,Overnight stocking is loading up the produce is the customers in the morning. We also reprise items & make them look good for the customer so they don't have a hard time looking for what they want.
good,"Stand at Cashier counter, check out customers, clean area and restock.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers and the least enjoyable was 1 of the management ladies over the cashiers."
good,"It's a nice place to work.  The cutting of hours after Christmas is a total bummer.  Employees are worried about how they are going to pay their bills all of a sudden.  Not cool.  Working in apparel you are never bored. There is always something to do.  "
good,I worked as a meat associate and was required to re-stock meat repeatedly during one shift. I was also required to conduct a regular temperature check as required by company policy in order to ensure all of the products were being held and maintained correctly. My management was a little difficult in terms of schedule flexibility because it was hard for me to balance a 25 hour work week being a full-time student. This was actually the reason I had to resign from position.
good,"Empresa valoriza bem os funcionarios, com premiação mensal para aquele que mais se destacou no decorrer do mês."
good,"meeting new people every day was the best thing about this job , helping people in the need , participating in company events like CHKD events and more."
good,Walmart has taught me a lot of customer service skills as well as having an excellent work environment and wonderful co workers that are helpful and great examples of customer service
good,This company tries to be very structure. If you follow the rules (policies) you will be fine . There's always room for growth if you want it. Depending on what store you work at your days can be full of excitement.  Also  stressful . Its a very diverse company . Always put a smile on your face and make sure you say hello !
good,Enjoy driving forklift and assemby with fellow employees. Its a good work envirnment. Good competitive pay. Flexible schedule
good,"Its an ok place to work. U get an hour lunch if your a full time employee which is really great, so u can go home for lunch or out to eat. The coustomrs are amazing to deal with and they are always super nice."

good,Días con mucho trabajo debido a la clientela que existe en ése lugar.
good,Hard work good pay this job was good to me but required a lot of physical strength. I do recommend it to others looking for a job.
good,Working for Walmart made me more responsible and I realized there that I enjoy helping others. I like that Walmart treat their employees as family members.
good,"I was given an extreme workload attending carts by myself, could sometimes be very extreme conditions but enjoyed the challenge"
good,I worked in the bakery and was a cashier.  The reason I left this company was to have a child and then I have been a stay a home mom till now.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart. Meeting new people everyday. Helping customers with their needs. Although, I did not like that the most famous product was sold during the holidays was cough medicine, you could only imagine."
good,"The hardest part of the  job was lack of communication, but I,ve  always have done what ever I could have done to make sure I would understand what was expected of me. It was a fast pace company and I never stood around. I have learned  to become a better customer representive for this company and I have always enjoyed a well done job at the end of my shift."
good,"I think Walmart could be a great place to work. The main problem I see in this company is the lack of communication between management and the associates. Management will have one goal, however, the associates could care less because it doesn't affect them at all. If you work hard in the company, there should be at least one manager that notices this and they will try to move you on up the ladder."
good,"Worked on registers handling money/ cards and checks. Helped customers with their every needs and giving great customer service skills. Worked in electronics department helping with computers/cellphones and as well helping in other departments,"

good,"walmart is a good place to work, good second job, work hours were ok, you can move up in the company, its a good teaching organization"
good,"Friendly staff, and managers were easy to work for. Would have like to have seen better incentive for employees. Insurance coverage was average but pricey."
good,I enjoyed coordinating different projects between recruiters and colleges of pharmacy and optometry. Walmart is a great place to work and I appreciate them very much. I am just looking to fulfill my passion in another position.
good,I still work at walmart as a overnight stocker but im looking for a better paying job. Its easy for me to do my job when i have been trained and have time and space to handle my task.
good,Walmart was a nice place to work. I worked there over the summer. You got two fifteen minute breaks and one one hour break.
good,I left because of their unfair working ideals. The most enjoyable part of  my job was the customers. My co-workers were not at their stations quite a few times and I felt intimidated by them. I really enjoyed learning how to use the cash register and working with the public.
good,too much changing policyies and proceedures and not making sure employees understood what the changes were till someone didnt follow the change then it was only for that person.
good,I didn't work here long enough to be a good judge from what I saw as a temp it's a decent place to work I noticed a lot of childish behavior in the store but as I worked outside it didn't effect me
good,"All about making sales and profit. Some very good people work here. They recently merged with another company and changed the entire dynamics, work flow and culture and need to work now to fix that."
good,"long hours outside in the weather. I have learned great customer services skill and how to deal with customer problems. the hardest part of the job would be to work long hours and theirs no help at all, but that help you work harder and faster to get the job done. the most enjoyable part of the job is that I would be able to pick the time I take my lunch's."
good,did a lot of work that wasn't in my job description and was constantly asked to help out in other departments. very understaffed all the times I've worked there.
good,"Wal-Mart was a experience you meet all kinds of people in customer service. Working in different departments like clothing, grocery, and electronics. Helping customers"
good,Walmart was a easy job and it wasn't to much overbearing work was also not to long. They also gave you enough hours to make a decent amount of money
good,Management is not the best can be rude and not very understanding. Horrible about giving people hours. wont make anyone full time unless there for a very long time. I did enjoy some of my coworkers in automotive
good,"I didn't have a problem per-say, but I LOVED the people I worked with and the customers I waited on. However, I misunderstood the attendance policy and that is why I got fired."
good,Working there was a challenge but gave the change to look for a better job. For me here was no real teamwork. But I learn to cope with them learn fast paste environment under alot of pressure. Learn to multitask and give good customer service.
good,"I gained experience in customer working for this company. I became more outgoing as person working for WalMart.  A typical day working for this company was cashing customer out, making sure my register are was clean and neat, and providing great customer service."
good,"There were no typical work days, there was always something new that would come up, and you had to be able to think on your own. I really enjoyed the problem solving, it made me feel good to be able to keep up with the job requirements since I hadn't worked in so many years. The most challenging part of the job was holidays which were hectic but manageable."
good,The company seems to be reactive about a lot of things rather than proactive. This can make it a challenge to succeed there.
good,"I have worked for Walmart on and off for 8 years. I have no comments at this time. They have a coaching for improvement policy that I don't agree with,they take the word of an assistant manager over an associate. If you have a coaching you are not able to transfer or lateral over to a position with the same pay grade."
good,"Walmart is a place that has a lot of opportunity for advancement. During peak times, management was pretty good about coming to the front and helping to get customers served and out the door."
good,I loved walmart easy work great people n all around great work place n i like the corp n i like how the business they are al about family n helping tge custmer but they do have some employees that need more work
good,its a ok place to work as long as you dont have any health issues they only care about you coming in on the clock sick or not even if your pregnant and about to deliver they will not care
good,I learned a lot about retail and everyday changes that are made in the retail environment.  Sense of urgency will be a mainstay for the company.
good,I enjoyed working here but night shift was all that was available for me. That was difficult after my daughter was born. I ended up having to look for another opportunity that was more flexible.
good,"A typical day required one to have experience with difficult customers, and all types of attitudes. I have learned a great deal of patience on this job."
good,"In walmart things are not so great to be honest because management is not the best. Managers there instead of trying to have a similar opinion about something they have different opinions and someone says something to you and another persons says the opposite so its confusing. I enjoy my co-workers they are fun and hardworking. The hardest part of my job is my salary, because I believe my work is worth more than what I actually make. A typical day at work is mostly busy because in the pharmacy theres no free day even though some times we have little costumers, but theres always prescriptions to fill etc."
good,Ok place to work. Not enough employees to handle the work load on most days though. Raises were changed and have made it harder to stick whit the company.
good,You get assigned a department that need help the workers from the back bring pallets to area they wanted I believe you to unload at least 10 pallets a night
good,Helped many customers locating items. Also helped customers that where not happy with previous purchases. Did the best service possible to help the have a better day.
good,I started out being a stocker and then a doorgreeter.  With the stocking job I was expected to complete my work in a timely manner.  WIth the doorgreeter I did the assigned tasks and anything else I needed to do as instructed.  I enjoyed my job with being able to satisfy the customer's requests and making sure they did not need more help
good,My time has come up to see what is in store the company is wonderful. Great company I work as customer service manager for the front end of the store handle customer problem
good,"It's a great place to work. "
good,There is a lot to Walmart and I'm not saying that I'm was bad however I wish that there was more opportunities that could have been provided. I do give them credit for giving me the training that they did cause now i can take that and hopefully better my future.
good,"easy work task, how to organize and display product on the sales floor. management tend to favorite some employees. workplace culture is friendly clean and organized. the hardest part about my job was the hours and having to adjust to the sleeping schedule. meeting new people and learning new ways to display product"
good,It's hard work but you can get it done. Working with shipment you need to be able to work fast and pay attention at what you do. But over all it is a great job
good,It is a good place to work with great people. They are always trying to help customers but also help their workers at the same time. Glad to have been a walmart employee.
good,"As a cashier, the job was chill, it was easy going, there were times where there would be a bunch of customers but that is expected of the job. I'd recommend it."
good,"fast pace, productive, reliable sales associates, chances at career progression, huge selection of merchandise and convenient. Store is clean . diverse background of employees, military friendly, ensures workers get their breaks"
good,"Baking cake and donuts, decoratin sweets, dealing with customers and difficult management. Often left to do 5 peoples jobs alone. Easy job just stressful"
good,Walmart is a very good place to work you learn different things meet new people.the hardest thing about working at Walmart is when they make you go from one work place to another the best part about the job is when they ask you to do things with other workers
good,Productive work place. I love to help people. Hardest part of job was standing on feet all day and customers had no respect. Meeting new people. Seeing all the new products.
good,"Its an okay job"
good,"customer service answered all customer questions, helped customer locate items they need. "
good,Working for Walmart was simple and steady. It was a fair exchange. The policies and procedures were available from day one. I enjoyed the management training whenever I wanted to grow.
good,"When no one else would give me a job without work experience. Walmart did, im really thankful for that. I have a daughter to take care of. I finally can take care of her cause of Walmart!"
good,"It was okay, nothing really special about this Walmart besides the hilly slopes under the parking lot. Liked the food places around though, nice plaza to get away and take a break"
good,"No Communication . Very short staffed threw out hole store . My job duties were Price changes, mods , processing and working freight  , paper work , phones , zone and cleaning , cashiering, customers service, helping cover departments."
good,"No real complaints, management was fair as are the policies. Hours range from 14-35 hours at a little over minimum wage. Good job for in-between or students."
good,"The hours were decent as was the pay, an appropriate amount of breaks as well as proper sick leave time. all in all a company i could recommend."
good,Not a great job. Slightly better than working at McDonald's (sometimes) Greedy corporate entity that refuses to pay an acceptable living wage.
good,could of been better if they had the staff to cover all areas and if the management would be more helpful it would of been a better place to work at.
good,"Great place to work good pay, and people are generally very kind hearted. It is more enjoyable if you have an interest in the subject matter of the job and arent just there for a check."
good,"working for Walmart was exciting as you get to meet all types of people from all over the world of different cultures, working at Walmart improved my customer relations skills as well as my punctual task."
good,When I first started walmart our manager had been there 21 years. About 3 months into working he left and they replaced him with a military enthusiast and he and I never seem to see eye to eye. I am looking for a job with high pay and mandatory work similar to Walmart distribution
good,"helping me find a new job"
good,What you learn from this company is if you show up and just do your job like asked. They will not bother you. I would refer a friend to come work for the company
good,The job is okay for people who plan on staying with the company for a while but some goals are unrealistic. I just don't see myself making it my career.
good,um lugar bom para se trabalhar porem os funcionários são tradados como lixo
good,"Once I got in at Walmart I was starting top Stocking and the we had to do live at 5 to zoning up the grocerys , we don't get to do returns until 8:00pm. "
good,I certainly felt lucky to be working specifically in the pharmacy. The pharmacists were good to work with and I got the opportunity to have greater exposure to all aspects of pharmacy work.
good,"Walmart is a very demanding job as you climb each echelon of the management rail. Every day there were specific tasks that had to be met, no fail and you were given the opportunity to showcase your talents."
good,"This billion dollar company drove its bottom line, by squeezing the man hours in order to profit. Hours very long, on your feet a lot and a lot of personnel that lack training."
good,it was busy most of the time. I liked being able to defuse situations. I loved to be busy and help where I could. Not a very rewarding job but I like to interact with people.
good,"Learning experience, busy atmosphere, lots of phone calls, customer service, ordering supplies, accepting orders, dealing with insurance. Management is fine."
good,"customer service cash handling skills, helping customers meet there needs to help the companies growth as wel as problem solving"
good,"The work is not bad once you learn the ropes. Management does not communicate very well, especially with workers, or between shifts. You do get benefits if you are full-time so that is one benefit."
good,The pharmacy is unorganized making it difficult for employees to do their job. Friendly managers and co-workers. Friendly customers. Fast paced environment.
good,Working for Walmart isn't a bad thing to do but it's also dependent on who your management team is on if it's going to be a good fit for you.
good,"es una buena empresa te enseña a trabajar e equipo, buen aervicio al cliente , se trabaja rapido y fuerte"
good,"OK place but expect same amount of work out of fewer people. Use to do alot of fund raising for CMN but not any more. Upper management seem to not care about the workers, Use to see them alot on the floor but not any more"
good,"Walmart has taught me how to be more patient with customers and other. Working there helped me with my communication skills, the employed are very great and helpful."
good,Wal-Mart was quit an experience for me it really went step by step with me they were very patient with even after putting on the floor they were very sensitive with the loss of my baby and It really help with my grieving process
good,"I made good friends there."
good,"Culture is on the right track, but you never know when you will be part of a reorg.  Professional environment with people who act like adults.  The most enjoyable part of the job are the people you get to work with and come to know."
good,If you are looking for the best place to have earned the most job skills this is the place for you. Great working environment for ages 18-20 or for ages 30-60.
good,"Retail job that involves dealing with the public and spending the majority of your time on your feet. Long hours with not enough pay. However, employee discounts are a benefit."
good,"a typical day is very busy "
good,I was  injured while working at Walmart. I was only offered Tylenol and sent back to work instead of receiving emergency medical attention. Management then made the decision 3 months later to terminate my employment.
good,"I am only adding text here because Indeed mandates me to do so. I am not in the habit of ""reviewing"" employers, nor do I think it is necessary or relevant to searching for a career."
good,"A pretty productive job that will keep you busy, as long as you're always keeping up. Becomes more busy during the holiday season which can become overwhelming for some but not to bad when you stay on task and do what needs to be done."
good,They give you all these things you need to get done in the time you're there with no help and then they cut your hours by five hours week and we're still expected to get all that done and help the customer I love my customers I love helping the customers it's just a very stressful job trying to get everything done they want you to get done
good,while working for this company i did not have too many negative things to say about them. they worked with me and my schedule with my kids. also they are very flexible on the hours which they will also work with you on.
good,Walmart only prefers to have part time employees because they don't want to offer benefits to their employees. That alone says a lot about the company.
good,My view of working for Walmart was that management needed to be changed in my opinion and also I feel like the pay rate could have been higher considering all that they ask of you.
good,Not a good work culture due to apathy and bad employees. Being given busy work was the worst thing. It was worth it for a while still just because the pay was so good.
good,"A rotina é bem tranquila e pelo menos no meu setor sempre tive autonomia para exercer minhas atividades."
good,"Walmart is fast passed, standing, walking, bending and lifting required. Breaks and lunches are required. Vacation time is most always approved. As long as you do your task management will leave you alone."
good,I love working at Walmart. I just wished they treated the people with respect. The strore I worked at gave out 4 and 5 jobs to one person and expect you to get them all done for the day shift to come in and take over. The day shift didn't have to do much at all threw out the day and night shift would come in and start it all over again.
good,I go to work and try to stop the crazy customers from stealing. i learned a lot about customer service. management has its ups and downs some know what they are doing and others don't have a clue.
good,Besides being constantly short handed the overall job was well and handled quite professionally. I loved working for Walmart.
good,"It is a great company to work for.  You meet all types of people from all kinds of background.  The co-workers were all friendly and helpful.  On the downside, they do not like any overtime not even 1 minute, any time over you are required to take that either on your break or lunch if not both."
good,Trabajar en Walmart significa tener compromiso y responsabilidad y tener un buen desempeño y y ser respetuoso.
good,More to learn as work in different departments with co-operetive team and good management and to learn more with dealing customers.
good,Good place to work wish they would care for their employees the way they care for their customers. They don't take doctors notes when you are sick and when there is ice in the ground they still want you to show up not caring about the well being of the employees.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking shelves, keeping them neat and straight.  The hardest part of the job was moving from location to location in the store, I didn't have a dedicated isle like most of the workers.  Also tried to get on first or second shift and was kept on the overnight shift.  Needed second shift when I started school."
good,"committed to providing superior customer service and a pleasant shopping experience.When you have a problem it got fixed, they listened, they supported."
good,"I did not have good experiences,I had few coworkers i could actually talk to, some of the managers were rude and or did not know what they were doing."
good,"If you have no experience and are looking to start a career in retail, Walmart is a good way to go. It has gotten a lot of bad reviews in the media, but its not as bad as it seems. It does however have it's cons... I will say that."
good,"I learned how to handle money and work in a food environment. As cashier day to day I would greet customers, ring up their merchandise, and take their payments. As a bakery associate I would bake bread, bag bread, and label and sell bread. I would stock the floor, providing merchandise for customers. As cake decorator I would ice and decorate cakes, label cakes, and take customers order to provide merchandise to their expectations."
good,"A typical day at work was good , It was very enjoyable, I learned how to help customers better with anything they asked about, I learned how to be a better employee, The management was good, they were very fair, The culture of the workplace as good, The hardest part of the job was not helping customers when they were having trouble loading something or looking for something, And the most enjoyable part was helping the customers out when they needed help loading something that they could not load themselves"
good,"Working at Walmart was a good experience for me, I learned alot about retail.  Most of my supervisors was okay.  They needed more training at that point and time."
good,"Relise diversas actividades tales como: limpiar mi area de trabajo, vigilar las distintas areas de trabajo apoyandonos en equipo y organizandonos, el trato entre jefes y compañeros siempre fue respetuoso, lo mas dificil era terminar el inventario de electronica ya que no conocia bien las marcas,"
good,"It is a great job, the managers are some of the best people I've ever worked for, they have big hearts and are fun to work with. However you are incredibly underpaid for the amount of hours and work you put into the job. You have so many responsibilities and have to deal with a lot of backlash all for minimum wage. Aside from certain managers who are always appreciative there are quite a few who do not recognize the things you do and take advantage of it. I found myself working 55 hour weeks trying to help improve the company and I barely received any thank you's."
good,"The coworkers and the management were enjoyable. decent hours to begin with, and an easy pay in raise after a certain amount of time worked with the company."
good,"I've been at Walmart for over a year now and my department has no problem keeping up with the company expectations, however, the amount of work the managers have you do at the same time cutting your hours to benefit the business just doesn't seem correct to me. Walmart has treated me pretty well though they gave me promotions throughout the store from being a regular associate to a customer service manager and now a department manager, on top of I have regular hours Monday-Friday 630-330 weekends off and they give me all the vacation time I want. Over all I enjoy the company but stressing out daily to keep your department in order then coming in the next day to have it be a mess again and having to take the blame since it's your department isn't really for me. I would like to expand my horizon outside of retail, I know there's more and better  opportunity out their."
good,The people at the job made it a fun place to work. The management as well was fun to work with and weren't to overbearing in the way the interacted with the employees. All in all it was a good place to work and I enjoyed my time there
good,"Walmart allows their employees to express themselves through appearance liking. Hardest part about Walmart are the amounts of customers who need your help. Learned that you need to be bilingual to be able to handle most situations on your own. Management is okay, but be prepared to be moved around the store in areas that aren't yours to do or know."
good,It's a good company to work for but some of the management were rude and didn't take care of certain problems associated would have. And customer service was great.
good,Walmart is a company is very flexible with their employs as long as there is a good management team. They also are very kind to their workers and their customers as well.
good,"loved working in morning and in lawn and garden "
good,"This company has plenty of opportunities. Nice company to be apart of. People are great, managerments are respectful to others and there needs. There is room to move up. Theirs company has no limit."
good,"-The main issue with me, when working there was the people, and sometimes employees. Some of them just see this job as a chore so you will be dealing with really unmotivated people."
good,A very rigorous job to work but it was a great job. Management and workplace culture were also great! The benefits that they offer are also great!
good,Starts at 7:00 and is a steady stream of customers.  A fast pace daily for 8 hours.  I really like my Supervisors and people that I  work with.  We all work as a team to help each other
good,"Its all according on the location you are working for. Employees, staff, the personnel makes the place. IF the personnel sucks then, the business sucks."
good,"They taught well how to get a certain amount of work done in a certain amount of time. Because of this I have been able to utilize my organizing skills at other workplaces, and they have always received good feedback due to it."
good,"I was a temp on the final line, so I don't really know too much about the inside of the company, but overall it was good money and a set schedule every week"
good,Kind of fun yet challenging and stressful. I am able to successfully multi-task tasks to complete on time. I believe the hardest part of the job is staying calm in a collective manner to not show emotions. The most enjoyable part of the job is just being able to talk to new people everyday and just connect with people as they finish shopping.
good,It's an OK job for people who are barely starting to work right out of high school or any school. It's a fun place to work and a great place to learn new stuff
good,"Originally I applied here for a sales floor associate/stocking job and it was what I would expect from a retail job. However, due to the fact that this place tended to be low on workers, I was placed on almost every part of the store. To list most of it off I worked in: groceries, stationary, sporting goods, frozen foods, dairy, truck unloading, cashier, stocking shelves in respective aisles, as well as working in the back of the store. It was kind of a shame how to make up for lack of workers that they have the associates do all types of work. Perhaps I was moved to all parts of the store since I adapted quickly and the managers saw that, but that is mere speculation. The jobs for the most part were straight forward and easy to understand. Management for the most part wasn't really a problem till they kept changing management to the point where eventually even the workers didn't like the change that was going on. I'm not sure if that is a problem now but when I was working I disliked the ""new"" management that took over. At the very least, I got a board array of skills unintentionally from that job."
good,There are no typical days at Walmart as each day brings new and different challenges. You learn to change with the job as it changes around you. The management tends to have a hands off approach until they are needed then they are micromanagers. The culture of Walmart is pretty basic; each departments employees help one another. The hardest part of the job is the changing shifts. The most enjoyable part of the job is the daily interaction between customers and employees.
good,"When i worked at Wal-Mart i noticed that they didn't hire the helped and personnel that they needed, they never had enough employees to cover any of the registers so all the other sections were penalized there and had to fill in even though we had our own job and section we had to watch and keep control of."
good,Need lot of energy if you are on the floor in the store. Good benefits and great if you are fit. Store is always busy lot to do. ----------------------------------
good,"meet different types of people.very busy work environment.working on cleaning store in very chaotic system.I perfer to work with"
good,It was a good starting job but Mangers are horrible. You pretty much learn from mistakes rather than being trained. My first couple days I was thrown out in the field with no prior knowledge of my work.
good,"A typical day at work is very hectic, I've learnt how to use the pharmacy software. However, the best part about working there was doing every thing I can to help the customers, while the hardest part is dealing the with unfairness and not being able to help a customer."
good,Understaffed in every area required most employees to overwork. Rewarded for hard work by job advancement. Lower management handles all customer service. Teaches patience and ability to handle mutilple tasks at one time.
good,"Work was simple enough, management was very inconsistent.  Different managers enforcing different rules in their own way. At one point received an attendance write up for missing work when rivers near my town were flooded preventing travel."
good,Wal-Mart was hard to work for due to the few chances of being able to succeed. very few days to be absent in such a long period of time while you work for the company. miss four days in a row you are gone it is very unfair.
good,walmart edmonton is a great place to work theres good people from staff to cutomers and all duties are not difficult u can make great advances to get higher pay
good,"Trabalhava com o gerenciamento de preços, possibilidade de crescimento a longo prazo, cartao alimentação da empresa. "
good,Sent i was only hire for the seasonal i love working it my kind of thing. Nothing stop me i am very up beat gal love to learnd new things every day. I wish i had the job now cause i am not me without work.
good,"This job is a mixed bag of everything. Some days are great, while others are terrible. Believe it or not, the customers bring the most influence on how well a day goes for associates. The environment is very dynamic, with each day bringing forth its own challenges. If you get a chance for advancement, it is certainly worth it in the long run. You have to fight hard to earn full-time, yet alone, advancements. However, those advancements come with great pay once you get beyond a department manager, as well as job security. I wouldn't stay on the bottom of the totem pole for long, unless you desire part-time work."
good,"Task focused work environment with teams of associates to get things done.  A day goes fast when working because there is always work to be done with always changing of sets, prices, stock levels. Workload did not always match cost of wages for associates."
good,Walmart employment was a time when I needed a job to support my son. I enjoyed working with a variety of people an stocking shelves loading and unloading of  trucks. I was not pleased with their training methods since I am a bit slower than others
good,I enjoy the associates that I work with. I am looking for a new adventure and have learned many skills at Walmart that will help me with my search.
good,Not a bad place to work for. Training needs to be properly handled better in certain departments. Scheduling is not properly laid out for each employee.
good,"the workplace was really busy at all times , but i had many friends working there so it wasn't so bad but the management could be way better, be prepared to never have weekends of."
good,"I had to do bread break out. take cake orders. clean bakery area."
good,"Walmart is one of those places where you stay at because you're content. If you'e looking to move up, you need to come in strong and stay that way. cool"
good,This job provides great experience for a first time sales associate. You learn how to work the cash register and definitely how to deal with unhappy customers. The management is poor.
good,"Inventory Control Specialist"
good,"I would show up, clock in, go to my register, check the drawer and money,make sure I had what I needed at my register. Turn my light on, and go ""red line"" looking for customers to get through my aisle. After waiting for a while we would zone our aisle, and the areas near our register. We would also stock shelves, and help other cashiers checking out customers by bagging for them, or running codes for them. Working there I learned a lot of customer service, dealing with issues and just talking to people in general making them feel welcomed. I also learned time management, and working with a quickness, when you all have 7 customers in your line and its only building up you have to move quick, and when your going to get off in 5 minutes and you have people with full carts walking up, you have to know how many you can take and when to turn your light out. My co-workers were all great! we had a very fun, super friendly, hard working group. The hardest part of this job was, staying busy, in a smaller slower store your run out of things to do. The most enjoyable part of this job was the people, the people I worked with and the customers were always. As long as I stayed positive and kind I never had issues with anyone."
good,"Too work your best, and focused on what's important, never give up. Make sure you listen to details. Hard worker and just want to make a change"
good,"A typical day was fast paced I learned how to manage time wisely and delegate and associate with people in a calmly matter to organize and get through the day. As a past employee I dealt with the majority of interpersonal communications and fixing a variety of problems. Working with coworkers means remain professional with friends as well as other you may disagree with , always remain respectful even if other worker is not. There isn't a time of day I could define as enjoyable."
good,I was in charge inventory the stockroom and all major projects. I also managed store. Made sure it was zoned stocked and clean for next day to open. I fixed many problem stores.
good,i enjoyed working foodlion 7 years exp as bagger frnt end i help shopper alot load unload groserts find things in store at food liopn i had as many 100 shoppers put in good words about my performace to management evert day was different i learn alot emplyees management best part job thankfullness of shoppers to me for doing a fine job hardest part trying get store face up clean for corp managers coming to stoer
good,"• Un horario más flexible para calidad de vida del trabajador"
good,The time that i spent working was okay because it was hard to move up or move around the store. I tried going to my direct manager and got no answers from her so I would go to the next manager above her and he would send me back to my direct manager. I worked hard and ended up getting laid off before the new year.
good,It's Walmart what are you gonna expect. It's an okay workplace. Good staff and employees worked well together. Good hours
good,"Great high school job or first time job to learn the retail field. Definitely not a career job, but a job that can get you ready to get ready for a better job."
good,Walmart will always have something for you to do. It could be anything from stocking to shelves to pushing shopping carts.
good,It's an ok job for those people that want  first time job.  It's a good starter.  You meet good coworkers and not some nice coworkers.  you also meet pretty interesting people there as well.
good,"They changed my job position a lot within the 7 months that I was there. That's only because I worked at a small neighborhood market. "
good,Enjoyed my time there before moving to other things.  Appreciated management at the time being great listeners and leaders.
good,A typical day working in Walmart consisted of walking isles over and over again making sure stock was aligned properly and prices were correct. i worked directly with the customers and set up cellular devices and gave advice on computers. This job taught me how to make Larger more important sales for the company and the convenience of the Customer.
good,I liked working there because of the people. It was my first retail type job. There was too much of a turn over rate in management and other workers to have a good opinion of them.
good,The people in charge would go out of their way to make sure you knew and understand the job! They would work right next with you until they feel you know what you are doing!
good,Walmart was a great opportunity to work with customers and have a fast pace work environment. I loved making sure the customers were satisfied before leaving.
good,"I liked working for Walmart because I met a lot of wonderful people. There was a lot to like about Walmart but they expect too much from employees, such as 12 hours of worked crammed into 8 hours. I was given physically challenging work without, promised, help. I managed to get my work done but it wasn't easy."
good,"A normal day would consist of clocking in, then going to find what your suppose to do that day. Most of the tasks would consist of recovering aisles, making sure that items on shelves are straight."
good,good place to start work but not the best hours. holiday times is the best time to work there for hours. get quarterly raises every 3 months but overall good place
good,Wal-Mart is not what they set their selfs out to be. They say they r family orantied but that's not what i seen when I was there. I understand having a job requires to work weekends but at Wal-Mart u would work every weekend n when u have kids u don't get much time with them but management gets to do whatever they want n that is not fair to the other workers that do work hard.
good,"We started the day bu getting our scanners stretching and then we were assigned our job for the day. I learned how to work with different scanners , proper warehouse skills and how to work in a fats pace. The hardest part of the day was finding places to put away the products."
good,"Not a very high paying company to work for,but has great benefits.Sometimes not enough hours for a full week,but overall a great company to work for.There are other fields of employment at this company."
good,"It was okay,  decent place to work, I made friends and worked with everyone. Cleaned everything,  bathrooms, hall ways, rooms"
good,working at walmart was alright. gave me good experience in back room. the managers dont care too much about the back room employees and try and put too much on them.
good,Walmart had its pros and cons just like everywhere else. They have there favorites and most of the time if you are not one of them you will not get a higher position and sometimes not full time. They expect you to come in even if there is a serious family emergency.
good,In the deli there was a lot of who can do what faster and I am just there wanting to do my job I love the people and the fast paced and always having something to do I loved working there I didn't like being told by multiple people I was always wrong and that the other person witch was the boss was wrong it was very confusing.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of coming into work talking to my manager for about 10 minutes and getting my day started. I stocked shelves, conducted inventory, greeted and assisted customers. The management is ok.  You have managers that work really hard and other managers that do not do as much. I had an awesome Manager that helped me and was very knowledgeable. Beside the store manager, my manager was great. I can not speak for every manager that works there, but like I said I had an awesome department manager. My co-workers were amazing as well. I experienced some ups and downs at times with co-workers, but everyone knows what they are there for and this is a team effort to help the department. The hardest part about the job is job enrichment and enlargement. After a while the job gets repetitive and there is absolutely little room for advancement. The compensation and benefits are ok for young adults. Management can be a bit useless and a nuisance at times. Managers are not on the same page and you have a lot of miscommunication. I actually had the opportunity to enjoy the good and bad side of entry level retail work. You learn about sales, marketing, how to use the SMART system for inventory. I learned a lot from this company. The most enjoyable part of this job is the people you meet become your second family and this job can give you opportunities to other jobs that you want in the future."
good,This place is bad about getting their employees clocked out on time. Had to work anywhere from 20 to 30 minutes over until your replacement showed up.
good,"You always have work to do, but with the implementation of new systems, higher ups expected you to know what to do without any idea of what is supposed to be done."
good,"The work was alot of heavey lifting, pulling pallets out of store room to stock shelves in the area you were assigned to work that night. Returning products to store room at the end of your shift that would produce overstocking of your area"
good,"Developing positive relationships with co-workers, working well with others and accepting constructive criticism increases your opportunity for success in a highly pressurized environment."
good,walmart was a good place to work go in to start shift clean register count money make sure had enough bags ring customers up call csm when needed hardest part was when people would call out and not getting breaks on time most enjoyable part was seeing customers come back to my line chatting with them
good,Moved inventory from system onto pallets and sent out to the sales floor for replenishment of goods. Once product was replenished and sent back I put it back into the system keeping accurate counts of what came back into the back area
good,"People I worked with were good people, company itself had leaders who were not very good(no longer with the company) and this store did not show very well."
good,"While I had worked here for two years previously, I came back and asked for my job back, and instead, they gave me a temporary position which they terminated within two months of re-hiring. I'll never work here again if I can help it. If I do, it won't be in the low class neighborhood stores."
good,Stocking is a easy task to do once you get the hang of the locations of where the products belongs. I learned that you have to be on time and work at up beat speed. My co-workers are very respectful people to work with and learn from to pass down to future associates. The part of the job is to make sure you bend your products in the backroom and taking from out the top steel. The most i enjoyed about the job that they feed the employees and give out surprised gifts and etc.
good,Was a fun place to work but could use some more help on managment and other parts. High turn over rate because you werent treated equally
good,Great opportunity to learn and gain experience with the different Fugifilm machines. Great chance to interact with many customers and gain plenty of customer service experience.
good,I got to experience  many things while working  there. Learned  how to do pat downs and call for back up. Management was ok willing to compromise with certain situations.
good,"It helped me be more productive. However, I did not approve of the mixed schedules it had. Sometimes, I would have to work most of the week, or even eight days straight."
good,"The overall job was fine, it was easy to carry out the job whether it was scanning items at a checkout line or picking up items customers left behind. My co-workers never seemed to interested in their job as they slacked off but were kind. Management gave us safety pins in hopes that Walmart employees would inform customers of 'Walmart credit cards'; managers would take away safety pin if they caught you not asking customers (employee punishment). Managers at cashiers took their time when reacting to calls from employees. The hardest part of the job was trying to calm customers down if they didn't accept Walmart policies. However; the most enjoyable part of the job was being efficient at clearing lines and reoccurring customers that talked good about you to your managers."
good,I learned at Wal-Mart Customer Service and claims also more methods on operating the cash register . A day at work would be greeting customers checking them out and helping them with any other issues if they had concerns.
good,Keep to yourself and do your own work duties Couldnt transfer to fit my transportation.Management is picky they choose who they like and dislike.Everyone dont get treated fairly at the job.
good,"Easy place to work, good people to work for, Decent benefits, flexible hours, many different types of jobs to do; weather its inventory management, to unloading truck, or janitorial work."
good,"Customer interaction is a requirement while working in retail. Everyday customers come in needing assistance with finding their desired items, and having knowledge of the store helps them find what they need in as short amount of time as possible."
good,"scanning coupons, applying discounts, processing payments, and ringing up sales on computerized cash registers. also take responsibility for handling returns and answering questions about merchandise, store policies, and ongoing promotions"
good,"management was not that great but I met a lot of nice coworkers and also customers. Its a great company, they just have to value workers opinions aswell as management."
good,prep backroom and get the products scanned and ready for shelf life. organize and zone product. time management is definitely a big part of the job as well.
good,every day at work is definitely a repeat theirs no way around it the best part bout the job is you can meet some pretty cool fun laid back people c workers customers etc.
good,"Supervise front end cashiers.  Ran cash registers,stocked and cleaned register areas.Enjoyed helping customers and working with the cashiers."
good,"It was ok, As far as working their. Just be ready to work. It does not matter what department you work in, if they are short on staff, they will place you somewhere else."
good,Fue bueno estar ahi pero hubo muchas cosas que no me parecieron justas como los incrementos de sueldo no fueron parejas
good,It was a good experience overall. I enjoyed a lot. management was friendly and people were cool.I learned a lot.specially my manager was very nice person.
good,As long as you are on the same page with management you'll be set. Annual raises are a plus. Communication is the key. Customers can be rude but that's all part of retail.
good,When I was working there I got the job through a temp service. Its was a job job while it lasted but the company got bought out and everyone lost there position
good,It has its cons and pros. It's a nice place to work but the problem is after the holidays your hours are being cut dramatically. Overall if you're looking for a friendly place to work it's great.
good,"Will be better if we have a standard schedules and full time job based on our experience and at least two years of work."
good,"If you are able to secure a job as an order filler on the Dry side, NEVER go anywhere else via transfer... It's never worth it. "
good,You get to see different people each and everyday some be regular but it still would be nice to see them. It's so many things you can do nit just one. That was one of the main things I liked.
good,"A typical day at work doing my duties pulling trash sweeping the floors, moping,and scrubbing the floors with the floor machine,and cleaning windows.What I have learned is how to do my job the best to my abilities and treat people with customer respect and trying to answer their questions to the best of my knowledge.I think i have managed to handle each situation properly and management has helped to do this also. my co workers all have different personalities about them good most of the time, with helping each other out in assingments and task. The hardest part of my job is training new comers on the floor machine.The most enjoyable part of my job was getting to know new faces and people and lives and making new friends within the job."
good,Not too bad of a place to work. Pay isn't much. People at the Poway store are really nice and management is ok.Don't really have anything else to day.
good,the stores was a good place to work and deal with customer and assist them in looking for what they needed and making sure they was satisfied
good,"Co-workers can make work go much easier, and sometimes management isn't the most competent. I have assisted different stores with their inventory audits. It was fun helping new stores and making new friends at other locations."
good,"8 Hours a day on average"
good,"Checking out customers at the register. Counting cash drawer at the end of the night. Sometimes greeting people as the entered. working the customer service desk,"
good,I personaly hated to leave my job at walmart but honestly had no choice. It is a great job for someone who is learning major responsobilitys.
good,While working at walmart I learned many new things and met alot of people. There was alot of good and bad things about working with walmart. The good thing was the friendly co workers and the pay raises every so many months.
good,"typical day at work involved restocking the sales floor, cleaning sales floor and department, aiding customers with whatever questions they asked"
good,"1. there wasn't enough help. "
good,I liked meeting new people every night and the rush from stocking items. We worked as a team by helping out in all areas to ensure all freight was done by lunch. Organization and paying attention to details was essential to being productive.
good,ok it was a long and educating experience. I would recommend this employer to others. it has great pay with wonderful hours
good,Afternoons and evenings were always fast paced and busy. I became very knowledgeable of the merchandise in the store and familiar with the cash register computer system.
good,"Empresa boa, onde a "
good,I learned a lot working here and met wonderful people. Working here helped improve my customer service skills and cashier skills. I believe that Walmart employees should be paid a little more then what they are receiving.
good,Walmart was a fun and productive workplace. We worked as a team to satisfy our customers. We treated each other as family and we treated our customers the same.
good,if you need hours this is the place to work since they work you as much as legally possible. standing for hours on end kills you but they make sure you get your breaks too
good,"The workloads were either really hectic or really slow, and there were always people having issues with one another. Management did not know how to spread their employees out and there were decent examples of conflict-of-interest with managers and their friends."
good,I believe that I was not compensated appropriately for the type of work I did.  I was pushed to pick up the slack of other managers by doing there work on top of my own because said managers were not motivated to do anything.
good,It's just like any typical Walmart you have all your sections that you could work at as a stocker I want a lot of locations I also met a lot of people working at Walmart and the pay is not really that great but it does help
good,the job was okay. i learned how to work a cash register. Didn't learn too much from the job. Pushing carts was easy. Management wasn't the best
good,"I enjoy my position as a department manager, I just want something more challenging that provides more opportunity for growth within the company that I am employed with."
good,Walmart his a great place to a as a young person looking to move up and make a career. Its a good place for an older person looking to make a little extra money
good,Trabalhei pouco tempo para avaliar os conceitos da empresa
good,"It was very easy work but I learn lot of difference of kind items like food items or clothes, shoes, hardware, motor  and all general and serve people"
good,The company is very fast paced and energetic. The workers are very professional and always helpful. The atmosphere of the environment is overall positive.
good,Its a good place to work you can make a career out of it if you are good with retail and customer Service. Working there has its ups and downs but so does every job i have had.
good,"Wal-Mart is a good place to work at. You will have some days you want to clock out early but, you have some customers that will make your day better. You have co-workers that you can relay on to help you under stand your assign job. And Management that can count on you to get the job done."
good,the hours for working aren't too bad and the pay is good but its very very poorly managed and is based on favoritism and for the 8 hour shifts there is only a 30 min lunch unless you work in the department at the far end of the warehouse then you have only 20 mins for the whole day. Some coworkers are amazingly awesome people while others jump at every opportunity to backstab you for their own entertainment. I do not suggest this workplace to anyone unless they have blinders on and only focus on work
good,Mainly working doing stock bringing product out onto the floor but once and awhile I would get on the register or help someone in layaway .
good,"This job is good for anybody that's looking for their first job. Walmart is great company, the only issue is that the pay isn't that good and moving up is difficult."
good,"The work at walmart can be very dull and monetizing with not even the tiniest hint of diversity, inthusiasm or happiness with manager keeping watch over your shoulder and complaining about the smallest of things"
good,the staff was rude. i will not work at this place again unless i have no other possiblities. i loved the people i got to meet but the work enviroment was terrible.
good,A typical day at work would be coming into work and clocking in and going to your department manager and seeing what they want you to do today.  Some days i would be in the womens section other days i would be in infants. Basically zoning the area and folding clothes and putting back returns. Management was amazing and easy to deal with and work with. The co workers were the sweetest and make work enjoyable. The hardest part was putting out new merchandise because we would have to make room for the new items. The enjoyable part was working with my co workers.
good,"I enjoyed making cakes, and working with my co-workers."
good,"this is a ok job for someone who is still in school. you wont make any money unless, you are apart of management. its a good job to get your life back on track but its definitely not a final destination job."
good,"Nao tenho muito o que falar da empresa, pois fiquei apenas um mês."
good,"Some days are very slow where not alot of customers come in, where as other days are very hectic and full of people. Those are the days when the day goes by quickly. Co-workers are 50/50. While some are nice and like to meet people, others do not seem to want to be there at all. Over-all it is an okay place to work"
good,"Managers are not trained to lead "
good,i would help customer on purchasing fish/hunting licence and help them in any way i could with questions about certain item they would purchase in my dept.
good,Walmart is a great company. It has its flaws but what job doesn't? I enjoy working with my co workers. We are a team and we make sure assignments are complete. Management slack on being supportive but there's always room for improvement.
good,"Nothing to talk about, good store to work for i love working here the store associates are friendly and great, the benefits are good and so is the pay"
good,It was a good place to work sometimes life tales you down a different path.different work schedule everyday you would go from running your side of the store to running the whole store in the matter of hours.
good,"The department manager is responsible for product availability to customers.  We scan departments' ""outs,"" retrieve backroom merchandise for the sales floor, and stock the merchandise.  We ensure the stock inventory is correct, product orders are completed, modulars and prices are changed when required, and the sales floor is clean, safe, and easiest for the customer to shop. We are also responsible for reports worked, recalls, returns, claims, and security matters.  The most driven factor in retail is customer service. Mr. Sam Walton was very aware that the customer drives our success, so customer service is crucial."
good,"A typical day at Walmart can be stress free majority of the time.  I was cross-trained for different departments within the store I worked at.  Overall the management team can be indecisive on some necessary tasks.  "
good,Walmart was a OK place to work. the management was OK depending on the shift you had to work. shuddering was a problem did not let you keep schedule days off.
good,"i would not refer to work at walmart to any of my friends or family, i had a bad experience with them. Firing me for no reason, but thats what walmart does unless you are a manager or of other higher ranking."
good,"Walmart was a great place to work and they worked around my school schedule. Had no problems with scheduling or getting the days off I needed. Walmart also is really good on working with the different departments you want. The management is really nice but will work you hard, they are very professional."
good,you have to be able to withstand stressful situation and take direction very well as well as show initiative fairly easy to advance the ladder if you can show up and work hard.
good,Walmart was a good and friendly place to work. I learnt a lot of new things in sales department all over the store. the management at that time was good. the hardest part of the job was pulling back the pellets.
good,We were always kept busy which was a good thing. There was not much down time. The registers would sometimes go down and there would only be a handful of cashiers on the clock during busy hours.
good,When the managers are in a good mood then you have a great workshit. If they are in a bad mood then you have a bad work day. They are great with customers.
good,"My co-workers in my department were nice and helped me when I needed it. There was a lot of times I was left in the department by myself due to managers calling my co-workers to other parts of the store. I had to take care of all of the customers there, which resulted in many of them getting mad because they weren't getting helped. The managers of my department gave me trouble whenever I had to keep telling them to adjust my work schedule so it wouldn't overlap my college schedule which wasn't many hours. I had to keep telling them every week to fix it the whole time I was there. I did get a couple of 15 minute breaks plus the half hour/hour long lunch breaks which was good."
good,"Love my job, just not wal-mart. They care more about money and customers than their employees. A happy employee has happy customers. They cut hours so short that there are not enough employees there to handle the customers much least  the work load.  Long lines, customers complaining etc."
good,"It wasn't necessarily that the work was exceptionally difficult, but more so that we weren't properly trained on so many aspects and were expected to know how to do things. It was a lot of tiring work, and customer service is a must. Supervisors would frequently ask lower workers to help them with their jobs. Overtime was a frequent, and not worth it. I learned to appreciate manual labor, and give amazing customer service."
good,as a cashier you had to stand long hous in the same place. it can get repetitive and boring. sometimes the managers would be late on your breaks. often there was no coverage.
good,"I worked in the electronics department. So it was pretty fun being around all the different products, telling customers about them, etc. I worked as a sells associate each day and did some stocking and cashiering. I learned more about some of the electronics while working here. Management was kinda disorganized since the place was brand new. My cowokers were pretty cool. Everyone close to the same age. The hardest part was how busy it could get and keeping up with the keys to all the products back in electronics. It was like a HUGE deal of the keys were missing. Managers scrambling to figure out where they are. But yes it can get very busy especially during the holidays. The best part was that it was pretty busy each day. Makes the day go by faster. You see all types of people come through Walmart."
good,A typical day at this job is very redundant. We unload and process freight off shipping containers and truck trailers.  Its hard work with great pay. Some  Management is very easy to work with while others can be tricky to work with. The hardest part of the job is the manual and physical laor.
good,"Its a job and Pays the bills.Management could do something about the shift rotations. I have worked nights ever since getting hired. That gets depressing after so many months,"
good,"A typical day working as a fresh associate at Walmart in the produce department during the night shift consists of culling expired product, cleaning, customer service and stocking product to the sales floor.  Working here has taught me to have thick skin.  There are a lot of times when my work has been criticized and this is often times not balanced with any positive or really substantive feedback that will help me to improve my performance.  When I've done well the management is good about thanking me for my work but it is always a very general thank you and no specific task that I have performed well is ever elaborated on."
good,"As an employee, you will work closely with a team to meet the needs of the store. Whether that is working in your department, another department, or even another store. If you prefer predictability and consistency, I highly suggest you do not work here, because every day is a new learning experience."
good,"Wal mart was a fun enviorment the first fiv years but later after Sam died it went down hill."
good,They try to be flexible with your hours unless it's the holidays. Work at walmart for almost 1 year and still getting $9 an hour due to completing pathways but changed jobs so was given more pathways and they also have an excuse for everything like not getting your bonus. Overall just get on your supervisors case about finishing your pathways if you want to get better pay and bonuses because they wont ever let you go do it until HR gets on both yours and their cases.
good,Walmart was not the best place to work. A lot of stuff was happening behind my back. it was just not a healthy environment to work in. I do not ever see my self going back to that Walmart. I personally do not even shop there.
good,"The job was not stressful, good working environment.  Would have preferred a little more upward mobility.  I enjoyed the four months spent remodeling a store in Austin."
good,"I enjoyed chasiering for this company . it defiantly kept me busy , of course there were so days but that's expected.I did like the fact they took advantage of my availability. But I did like the other cashiers !"
good,"It's a good job with decent pay and good overall people."
good,"Expect extreme stress when working in the pharmacies at the super stores. The prescription volume is similar to mail order business except there are less helpers. Counselling involves few words such as  ""yes"" or ""no"" from pharmacists."
good,it was a fine place to work at always busy the co workers were ok they weren't to bad the customers were excellent great experience
good,"This was a fast pace working enviroment,Taking customers orders and preparing them in a proficient and timely manner,Clean fryers rotisseries oven slicers and floors."
good,"i like that i stayed on my feet. and the hour long breaks. i think the mangers go under a lot of stress and cause them to mistreat associates. the do provide great hours and can be flexible. and can also progress quickly with this company with a lot of hard work and dedication. you can also find a lot of great mentors, people worth looking up to."
good,"Typical day at Walmart as a department manager starts with finishing the freight from the night before. Then, prepare your work area for the day. Next, scan your area for any items that are missing in the shelf. Pull all items from the back room and work to the floor. perform ant price changes that have been downloaded, as well as general cleanliness of the department. usually, your direct supervisor will give you a list of tasks to be completed by the end of the day. Throughout the day, greet customers, help them find anything they may be looking for, suggest certain products, assist in selection of products. Patience, time management, and problem solving are the three lessons I have learned at my time at Walmart."
good,"A typical day at work would include assisting plenty of people with whatever they may need, I learned quite a bit about food, I worked in the deli. Management was never the same when they decided to rotate them, everyone did things differently. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I encountered on a day to day basis."
good,I loved being a cashier and I was very good at my job. The customers loved me because I was very friendly and hardworking as well. I made sure that the customers were taken care of in a friendly way. I enjoyed meeting new people and making new friends as well. The thing that I enjoyed about this job is that my coworkers were very friendly and helpful.
good,"Boring and not very nice people, lots and lots of labor and abuse would not recommend for anyone very long hours by yourself"
good,"I enjoyed the people that I worked with and what I did. Overall, the company is a good business but not one that particularly cares about their employees."
good,"Good job, just not enough hours. Management was poor. Pretty easy job. Co-workers were okay. They weren't good with scheduling and sometimes we were short on workers."
good,"was a good place to work, fast paced, friendly and clean, enjoying the customers and the employees and the environment, i loved working there"
good,"a typical day of work was cashing out customers and cleaning my register area, also doing drops throughout the store. i learned fast paced work and how to deal with different customers."
good,"At Walmart, I was given an opportunity to learn how businesses this size operate. I had opportunities to meet with store managers and upper management and discuss what they do on a daily basis. It is what you make it."
good,I learned everything in the whole place like i worked in every single department and was even training other managers plus taught myself how to use the rf gun
good,"Good place if you need work, hire you in at temporary at first for six months, then evaluate you. Great people, hardest part is to smile and be friendly when a customer is screaming in your face."
good,"it was a calm and quite job I was a sales advisor in the fitting room, helped customers with clothes put clothes back they never wanted as well help them find clothes they couldn't fine the environment was very safe and fun"
good,"Bad management. The manger didn't care if there a snow storm outside if your car can't drive in the snow are there no taxi to take you to work, there still want you to show up to work."
good,Supervisors were very rude the job was cool and easy. Never had a problem with coworkers or customers. For the most part everyone that was working there was very friendly.
good,Fastest company to grow nice people to work lots to learn if you are a hard worker you will get promoted good benefits and salary great managers fun to work
good,"Management at Wal-Mart are hard people to find and communicate with.  They are not typically worried about the individual worker, but instead focused on the task Corporate puts on them."
good,"I had such a great time working at Lids, even though it was seasonal it was such a great experience and a way to get my foot in the door and ready for the real world."
good,"I would check customers out in a polite manner. took care of their needs. Made sure they left with a smile on their face. I also worked up at the customer service. I cashed checks, made money orders, sent money to different states/countries. Took care of their needs."
good,Good job great friends to work with and suprisingly enough customers are more friendly then angry. The work is simple enough most of it is memorizing things you have to do and there is a lot of things to remember but you end up having it down after a few weeks for working there and the managers are easy to work and and where very willing to help me with any and all questions I jad.
good,"If you are looking for a simple job to help get by Walmart is the perfect place. A typical day at work will provide you with reasonably paced work, consistent breaks."
good,Had set 8 hour shifts and planned breaks and lunches which made the time flow. the management was shaky as different managers had different ways they used people and different approaches to nightly tasks. Co workers were great on average but there was some bad blood between two fellow workers .
good,"On a typical day working at walmart, it was always busy. no matter what time it was. in my opinion was good because my day went by fairly fast. Although management was not so helpful."
good,"typical day includes working with people that you will love, doing a job working with customers  that you will find extremely frustrating at times. but overall an ok place to work."
good,"Interesting place to work overall. However, lot of pressure!"
good,As a Walmart pharmacy sales associate you constantly interact with people helping them get there medicine in a time fashion so they can get on with there day. We deal with insurance problems on a daily basis
good,Low pay rate for high quality work and most of the management team does not provide their staff with customer service excellent reports.
good,"This job is work. Employees are not the second priority of this business, as they should be.Breaks are given appropriately but unlike customers, employees are not taken care of like they should be."
good,I enjoyed working at walmart. I like the hours and managment is very helpful. They give you good opportunities to grow withthe company. The benefits are also good.
good,Muy buen ambiente de trabajo con compañeros buenos horarios solo que los sueldos son bajos
good,I just wrote a review on Walmart  i'm not understanding why I have to re-write a review of the good place to work a chance to make more money the longer you're there. Point system
good,"I learned to become a better person in serving the general public, Well versed in Company policies, most enjoyable part of my job is the customers and their smiling faces."
good,"Happy to work at Walmart Pharmacy as a certified Pharmacy Technician"
good,management could have been better but it was very bad. employers where very hard workers and dedicated to there jobs. I loved the opportunity i was presented. The hardest part of the job was trying to coup with the terrible management other then that the job was a blessing.
good,My time with Walmart was enjoyable. I love people and there was a wide range of folks that shopped there.  There was never a dull moment.  I would work there again.
good,Typical day at work is pretty hectic. The management team is alright to an extent. My co-workers are great to work with. The hardest part about the job is when the customers are screaming and yelling at you and you have to keep calm and not yell back. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the customers when they come into the store.
good,stock shelves and made the store look presentable but staff was rude and nasty always yelling  they always gave Task With unreasonable time limits but the pay was great
good,schedule was random and sometimes they would cut hours. Only in the holidays is when u get a good set of hours. They were very strict of everything even how you dress.
good,"Work Was Amazing The People Where Always Jolly And Everyone Came Together As One To Get The Job Done "
good,walmart is a great place to start work and gain experience. can teach you how to be a lead roll in your department. flexible hours and safe enviornment.
good,"I was seasonal so I just did what I was told to do for the day, people were nice job place  was good did not really get to do much since I was a seasonal worker"
good,loading and unloading merchandise from inbound and outbound trucks everyday as well as bringing product to and from the store floor binning abd sorting product in the warehouse
good,"Work was pleasant, I learned that Virginia is a vey friendly state, management was accessible, my co-workers were helpful, hardest part was learning to use the coin machine but the most enjoyable part of my job were the hours."
good,I ran registers and at night sometimes I would pull cashier draws for the day with a CSM. Its a busy place and I think I would have stayed if it wasn't so much drama between co workers. The store as well as bathrooms stayed dirty. I liked working with some of the other cashiers and CSMs there but I wouldn't go back to that specific store. I love Walmart as a company though.
good,this job is sort of boring and is for those who prefer to be alone. there are plenty opportunities for advancement. shortly after 2 months of work i was being trained for management.
good,"A typical day at work involves a wide variety of duties including customer service, cashiering, cleanliness of store for customer and associates safety and shop ability, putting out freight.                             "
good,"I admit, I struggled when I first started working for Walmart cause I worked at a thrift store when I was 18. But I'm glad I worked there to learn more in retail."
good,This is a good place to work to learn a lot about retail. I enjoyed the experience of learning what it is to work for the biggest retail store.
good,"A typical day at work is smooth.  You ring up customers or help with the little things they may need, and before you know it, it's time to go home.  I learned how to better my customer service skills, how to effectively use a cash register, and how to interact with people better.  Management is firm but fair. They will work with you. My co-workers were awesome! The hardest part of the job is having to enforce the store policy when a customer may be unpleasant. The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment.  You see all kinds of things working at Wal-Mart. I will keep those experiences with me for life."
good,Good lace too work. Management sucks at times like at any job. The pay is nice. They were flexible with my schedule. The co workers were nice and helped when i was lost
good,The supervisors were messy. They sat and talked about the employees and chose who they wanted to give the better hours to. Because of this the employees felt uncomfortable and uneasy.
good,Company was average not too hard of a company to work for. Complaints work hours was long pay wasn't worth the load of work. Terrible management and coworkers would not work for the company again.
good,"I worked at Walmart for several years. I enjoyed it and learned a lot. As a college student, my hours were revised and set to revolve around my school time. Towards the end of my time there, hours were being cut, and some managers weren't conducting themselves in a professional manner."
good,es una gran empresa pero no se preocupa mucho por sus trabajadores
good,"helped scan grocery items that were placed in customers baskets, long 8 hours, with the ability of standing for long periods of time, and at times the AC was not on"
good,"If you look at the videos on u-tube and the like...they are true.  Since I have not been there for any amount of time but because this is the busiest season of the year you get to see a lot.  "
good,It's a decent job if u can handle the management. I love working with customers. They make the job worth working. I loved working here. Made some of my best friends working here.
good,"Good starting job, learn a lot about a basic sales associate job and have fun. People are always nice and hours are great and flexible"
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for overall. A typical day at work consist of interacting with customers, helping customers find items, answering customer questions, scanning and bagging groceries, taking groceries to cars  and cleaning."
good,If you apply yourself and have a good work ethic it is very easy to move up the ladder.  Customer service is essential but not the only aspect of the job.
good,"Hard labor at times very "
good,"This job included an assortment of different things to be done, it usually depended on the day and where we were in the month! The most important overall was making sure customers were happy and had a good experience with you as the individual. The management was okay at the Walmart I worked with. The only reason why I say that is due to the fact that they never handled problems with co workers that I had come across. I never found anything hard about my job except for the people I worked with that were constantly negative and had negative things to say, other than that I loved my job! Being a cake decorator was fun, as along with the busy work I had! I love being busy and having an abundance to do!"
good,"a typical day at work is performing oil changes, new tire installs, flat repairs, headlight installs, fuel injections treatments, and headlight restorations on cars and truck with."
good,"Walmart is a ok company,i really don't have anything else to say about  walmart,it a big company with lots of store,lots of employess,all items are sold at a discount price."
good,"I didn't really like this job at all. It was boring and slow. I often found myself trying to force myself to stay awake and i'd worked midnight shifts before, but this one was different."
good,I enjoyed meeting new people and assisting them with various things to improve the overall profit of the company. The management is great but also about their job.
good,alright job.  Just not enough people and lack of staff.  The pay was decent and the healthcare was afforadable.  Hardest part was the scheduling.  best part was free food and good people to work with.  I learned how to stock and unload trucks
good,It was a nice place to be. A typical day I checked in all of the vendors and mark down all of the damage goods. I would assist with the unloading of the trucks and ensuring that the on-hands of the merchandise was good.
good,Liked the people I worked with but the hours were outrageous. The management was okay to an extent but they didn't teach the employees much.
good,"not really room for advancement, it can be hard because sometimes the customers tend to be kind of difficult. I had some pretty good co workers"
good,"Great place to progress and learn new skills, job roles and responsibilities. Asda is good at training people on various different departments. Good work life/ social life balance,"
good,"run register"
good,"go in at 10 at night and get out at 7am and just stocking and off loading trucks, management was really strict the hardest part was getting used to overnight the best thing was the coworkers"
good,"There is always something to do, but for the amount of work they expect not always going to get done in 8 hours. otherwise its a decent place to work."
good,When i first started Walmart I thought it would be a great job and fairly easy. But it was the exact opposite because the management there was bad. They didn't care about anyone but themselves.
good,"In my opinion, working at this particular WalMart was not the best experience. I did not feel like my supervisors actually cared about their workers."
good,"The management could use improvements as they only think in the ""here and now"" for lack of a better phrase. The most difficult part of the job is having to stock shelves and help every single customer within 10 feet and get all the freight worked by 10pm"
good,Great company with a lot of great benefits. Very family oriented and centered around their culture. Opportunities for advancement really depends on the department you are in.
good,Walmart was busy my coworker were good people the hardest part was standing on my feet for long times the enjoyable part was working with different people
good,This job was very competitive and fast paced. The hours were very long and management was not supportive. My coworkers were great but the pay did not justify staying.
good,Good place to work. Some of the workers there are really nice and are always ready to help no matter what and they love to provide great customer service.
good,it gave me the opportunity to earn money and gain some basic skills that i still use today. it was part time work  I ended my employment when i left to join the military.
good,"I paid bills edi,"
good,"I would do overnight stock from 11pm to 7am, I learned how to price products, load pallets and unload pallets, help customers with their needs. I loved this job because it was a fast moving pace, everyone worked as a team, and we help each other out, there was really hard part of the job."
good,"Clock in, receive task to do and get started. Help customers in need of assistance with items or purchases. Stock shelves neatly and zone department whenever you have the chance. Return items that need to go back onto the floor. "
good,"Good place to work, and you will always be busy.  The only downside is that there is very little room for advancement. There are plenty of jobs to move around the store but the manager jobs seem to open up rarely."
good,"Company needs to more in touch with management .  Help  with hiring management.   Hirin g more within the ranks .  Better training for up coming management to assure they are ready for basic Walmart culture. "
good,Walmart wanted more than should be asked of their workers. Some days depending on your area you had 12 to 15 scheduled hours of work to get done in maybe 7 hours. The company did not like giving overtime or allow you over your set number of scheduled hours. It seemed that workers too care of each other more than management did.
good,"Customer Service Skills daily."
good,"their is really not much to say but i have an great experiences working at a company with trusting and orderly customers and a lot what i would call our usual customers, those you see every other day or everyday , and really get to know , while your scanning their products or just walking around helping them look for all their daily needs."
good,"I like customer service work. I liked doing my job to the best of my abilities, and also being appreciated for my contributions."
good,The hardest part about the job is the long hours with minimum breaks. Its a great job and you have to be productive. Stay busy at this place or you will be fired. Although i have met some of the best people in life.
good,Tacos are very very very nice. The other associates are friendly and easy to communicate with. Some of the managers need to be released or sent to other stores.
good,I didn't like that they didn't want to work with my school schedule so I can go to school and go to work at the same time. but it was a decent paying job
good,"one day at work went one of two ways. Like a breeze, or it dragged on. everyone in the workplace had smilies on and everyone joked around with everyone. the hardest part of the day was keeping the customers happy. the most enjoyable was having coworks that were enjoyable"
good,"Excellent job to teach people the value of a hard day's work, and to help pay those stressful living expenses."
good,Did not like working for Walmart but it paid the bills. I had several positions but in the end almost was laid off because of cut backs.
good,I had a great department manager who was eager to teach so you could advance in the company however there was a lot of favoritism within the store which made it difficult to advance
good,"Let's get one thing out of the way: the hardest part of the job will always be making the customer happy. However, it does not make working at Walmart too difficult. Actually, it can be quite satisfying making someone's day a lot better because you helped them. Your work will also not go unnoticed; the managers will show that they appreciate the work you do. If you go into the right store, you will be going into a workplace that appreciates you for what you have to offer."
good,"•	Coordinate and manage the acquisition of content and imagery for the jewelry department for Walmart.com"
good,"It was ok but the management was horrible to me as they are with most starter jobs. Now did I learn some lessons yes, but would I go back no."
good,"was a wall mart job, it was as expected, but not  very bad. boss was good and understanding of personal matters. other workers were also not overly bad. minimum wage job was as stated, as expected."
good,Great work experience. Some customers are easy to get along with. boss is very understandable of needs and time off if needed. easy learning experience.
good,"I like that they hire people of all ages and all ethnicities. I don't feel that they should call themselves a family company because, when I first got that job, I had Pneumonia very bad and had to be on 3 rounds of Antibiotics and 2 rounds of Prednisone and had to go to the Hospital and even with a note from the Dr at the Hospital, they still wrote me up for being off. Which is ridiculous because, when you come in sick you end up infecting more people and then more then one person ends up being off sick."
good,My most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers. It was hard to move up in the company. The job wasn't hard at all.
good,"this is a good place for an entry level employees. The jobs are not hard but, the customers make it hard to do your job. Everyone knows about people watching at Walmart."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work, its a place you can meet incredible and outgoing people. I've learned a lot from there that i can improve on."
good,I would scan items all day long. sometimes having to clean other areas of the store but that wasn't typical. You pretty much keep to yourself. It's nothing fancy but a decent job for a teenager starting out in the work field
good,It's a job just over broke they raise the pay and cut the hours to make up for it then they like to write you up for someone else not doing their job.
good,"Not a bad place to work, getting full time can take a while, unless they are in need. There is plenty to do to keep you moving."
good,Good place to work but the point system should be changed. Good environment and good people to be around. They should start taking dr excuses also. But a good place to work
good,"The work was easy, some of the people were actually very nice. A good first job for somebody. Some of the people made you feel like an outcast because you were new. But overall it's a good company to work for."
good,Walmart is a fun place to work! Interacting with customers is a bonus! Lower management is very nice and accommodating to your needs. Hardest Part of this job was the customers who wanted to yell and scream at you.
good,"this job at wal-mart was very easy, we worked as a team, and got things done quick, this was actually my first time working as a tire and lube tech."
good,"Customers and associates can be great to work for and with. However, some aspects, associates and management members can be difficult to deal with. Yet, the pay is fair and balanced."
good,"At first , I enjoyed working at Walmart but after the store manager left , everything and everyone was unorganized with the work. Managers took advantage of their job and that's the reason I left. I didn't understand why it was changing but I moved on from there"
good,"Enjoy my employer, but no room to advance. I am busy with my job and am often asked to work outside of my job description. The hardest part of the job is collecting trash without risk to needle sticks. I feel accomplished. I enjoy my coworkers, but have had difficulty with one asking me for a fight in the parking lot."
good,"Great people "
good,"Operated cash register and gave correct change,checked customer I.D. For cashing checks,cleaned and stocked shelves.I enjoyed staying busy and being able to help and leanr in other departments"
good,They did not give employees time to count cash drawers before opening up for service. Customers where friendly and kind.
good,"In retail the most enjoyable part of my job would be the customers."
good,"Hardest part of the job was the impossible task of completing the combination of overstocked items and incoming stock items in the amount of time required ."
good,"It was great working here, I learned a lot about myself and how to manage a business.  I would recommend this job to anyone that is curious and eager to learn."
good,"I loved working at walmart, there was plenty of new faces and familiar that I got a chance to see. Its a very good environment to work in. Fast paced, great pay and even greater managers."
good,"At Walmart we had a lot of worker and for the most part everyone got along and tried to make our days at work as easy as possible. i learned how to drive an electric pallet jack, how to work with other people. the hardest part of this job is when someone is not present, someone else has to cover the shift which means double work but other than that it wasn't really hard. i enjoyed the workers and the times we had."
good,I liked going to work for wal mart you had people to talk when needed if u needed help you had the help there if asked. It was an all around experience for me.
good,"followed labor laws plenty of break time and decent lunch period. management could be better so managers were good at their jobs co workers were great,"
good,No complaints. Just your ordinary grind. Nothing hard nothing easy just really no room for moving up the ranks. nothing more than just a job really. everyone is usually pretty friendly.
good,"Had my own personal likes and dislikes. I was working part-time and still in school. Well recommended jobs for teens looking for something to do after school and is trying to make a quick buck. This will definitely teach you life skills, and help you value a dollar."
good,"Overall i enjoyed working for Walmart, just that management was that great, to much favoritism... I loved my cashiers, and the sales floor employees... Just management need lots of improvement or they need to choose better people for their management team."
good,A typical day at my store is dealing with associates that don't come in for their shifts and making sure all areas are covered for the best customer service one can provide. Management not all being on the same task directed from higher ups. Hardest part of my job is not being able to achieve the needs of running a program to provide Great Customer Service for Customers and Associates. Most enjoyable part of my job is meeting and helping Customers and teaching and training of associates under me and helping my higher management team achieve their goals. Want a work life balance and more customer service driven and less task driven.
good,"Everyday is busy and productive."
good,Would rather not work at the particular store I had before. Weird policies for anything management enjoys to micro manage everything you do.
good,"A typical day is helping customers with their problems, organizing store shelves, Taking your lunches and breaks when managers designate them, and doing what they tell you to do. Management were often easy to deal with, except the cashiering, front store managers. They typically were frustrating to deal with. Coworkers can be fun sometimes, but they were typically boring to talk to, and they were just there for the paycheck. Hardest part of the job was no variety, never learning new things. Most enjoyable part was the paycheck."
good,"-good company"
good,"Walmart is a place where all they care about is sales, they don't give the employees enough attention, they don't care about their health and will make you work even when you are sick or hurt"
good,"If you've worked in about any retail store, you know what to expect. it had some very nice employees and workers and some not so nice ones., Scheduling and such just wont be easy. You do your job, the way you would expect. So overall just an average place to work."
good,It's great. As long as you remain on top of all the orders and the staging of the orders then you will be fine. Customers are usually okay with their purchase.
good,"Can be fun place to work at times enjoy meeting all kinds of people a real friendly environment to be."
good,"A typical day at work would be zoning my area, working the freight provided, fixing watch bands and changing batteries. I have been employed with walmart for six years. During that six years with the company I have learned how to do price changes, accept counts, process claims, send rings out for sizing, and pierce ears. While being employed at Walmart i have not only learned the jewelry/apparel department. I have learned the site of store department which is online orders, binning merchandise and making sure customer is satisfied with shopping experience. My management team at Walmart is pretty cool as long as you're working to your best ability. I was offered management positions but at the same was more focus on my schooling. My coworkers and I get along excellent. I'm not a hard person to get along with so i usually make work fun but in a professional way. I would say the hardest part of my job is that they give me three task and would expect them to be done at the same time. But what makes it enjoyable is proving to them i can get the job done and correctly at that."
good,i enjoyed doing my job. walmart is like a job where u go to start just to have something under your belt. you dont say there for long. the benefits suck
good,"Retail is usually the same but Wal-Mart has its own special blend of customers that make working there an every day learning experience. It's not a bad place to work as long as you have a sense of humour, a good crew and having thick skin too."
good,"Es una buena empresa y cumple con sus días de pago, muy buena la remuneración y las condiciones de trabajo."
good,muito bom trabalhar na empresa por conta das pessoas que la trabalham
good,"great benefits, good pay , work cashier register assisted guest also worked customer service desk assisted customers with returns ,layaway and restock shelves as needed"
good,Great training and pay. Safe work place. Good pay and flexible hours. Good management to go to. Great benefits. Great discount.
good,"Walmart is a fun place to work,  You can enjoy working there most of the time,  there are times when it can get really hectic.  management is ok,  co-workers are really cool."
good,Its was always busy at Walmart. It had a good work environment. I also got along with the other empoyless and management. I also learned how to deal with customers everyday.
good,There's always an opportunity to advance and excel with this company. Nice Pay. This job requires lots of team work in order to get the job done
good,"The work/life balance here reaaaalllyyyyyy sucked. Its as if walmart didn't know what a day off was. But my checks were always nice. If you're a cashier, 9/10, the other cashiers will be female, and they start ALOT of drama. I think their minimum wage changed from 7.60 to 9.50, but all the hours you put in, your check will be very nice."
good,"Was an alright work place. Nothing to special.A typical day was just to come in, sign in, and start pushing baskets until the first break. Had an hour lunch break not paid. It was an alright job."
good,"Most managers were crooked, we've been through 2 store managers who left on suspicious terms."
good,"Honest work self centered management,Treated like you are to stupid to put your own shoes on.After 9.5 years fired after one accident,thats how they cut cost"
good,"It's okay. It's been a long time ago, I don't remember much about it. I worked the night shift for 8 years. I decided that I didn't want to work nights anymore."
good,"great job for all ages, plenty of opportunity for advancement and a lot of good people employed there that make for a comfortable work environment. thumbs up"
good,"I enjoyed working with fellow employees, we each had different knowledge of the job and could ask questions if problems came up.  I enjoyed working with the customers helping when there were questions.  I was raised on a produce farm in New York and worked with customers throughout my life, and have assisted people whenever needed."
good,Managers could of been better. They feel they can abuse they power over you. But overall the workplace is good i formed many friendships that i still have even after they let me go.
good,"every day start with 15 minutes about a safety in and around the warehouse,learned a lot about safe work,do the job with no incident,all people around ,management or co-worker a very nice people ."
good,"Quick filling"
good,"Working for Walmart was a great experience. I learned a lot at Walmart like: Remodeling section and aisles, Reading and Printing Labels,Using Telxon, Stocking in multiple areas,etc."
good,It was a busy place to work checking out customers purchases. I learned how to bag up groceries and use a scanner to scan the items. I got along with my co-workers and the hardest part of the job was checking IDs with the speed they wanted me to go. The most enjoyable was interacting with all the customers that came in.
good,"At first liked working there, then manager started letting another manager get by with stuff that if a employee do it they would be fired, so I went to a new place"
good,I loved working for Marietta Wal-Mart. Management there was awesome and always listened to their workers. They were also willing to work on conflicts if there were any. Nacogdoches Wal-Mart is completely different. Managers never listened and mainly looked out for themselves.
good,Great workers little pay to much cross training without the pay.The do have lots of company events and they feed their employees
good,busy times and hardest part of the job is that mostly all days are the busiest days especially holidays what i have learned is to find out what the customer needs help with
good,a typical day at walmart is cashing customers out in a timely manner and maintaining a positive attitude. Management is nice and willing to help with anything you need.
good,"helpful kind management "
good,Great pay but very bad benefits.  Hardest part was being to able accommodate my associates.  I learned how to manage inventory and a team of over 400.
good,Depending on your experience you get paid decent money but i dont know what the pay rate is now. You get paid every 2 weeks and they can cut hours for part-time employees
good,I would come in at 4 o'clock in the pm and unload as many trucks as we had to do that day. 2-3 truck and take the product off and put it in the correct aisle for the stockers to put away.
good,"Working at Walmart was humbling experience. I got to meet a lot of different people and provided assistance to the best of my ability. Some days I work extra long hours, but my co workers made it feel like it was easy. I had the pleasure of working with interesting people. One difficult thing about working at Walmart was having to stand a long period of time."
good,Co-workers made my job a bit easier. Always helpful but management constantly got on my case about everything without properly training me. Had to learn how to do my job through multiple coworkers and overnights didn't want to do their job correctly with rotation.
good,"I liked working there but was discouraged for other reasons and quit. They worked with my schedule and it is very college student friendly, which can be appreciated as always, however it's supposed to be fast paced, at times it definitely was, but on the slow days it's so slow"
good,This job was very active and i learned alot about produce.  I enjoyed the hard work and would like to go back to work there.  I enjoyed my management but had a problem with a couple of the coworkers there
good,Walmart was a cool job for me. I loved the customers and the co workers. Although there was a fight every Friday at the location I was working at and the managers were all for self.
good,Job was great but the management is where this company lacked. Pay and hours were manageable. The managers had problems with the employees having water in the back room while unloading trucks.
good,"I have worked here for a little over 3 years and i liked the job at first but over time it has gotten to be a place i want to avoid, i dont even go shopping here anymore."
good,Fast Paced Work Environment constantly Multitasking All At Once. Management is not the best but hopefully they step it up.
good,"a typical day at work is coming in pulling the rollers to the truck, one of us goes inside the truck and starts rolling things down the line. the rest of us put things in order, such as food, sporting goods, toys, electronics, my supervisor helped during the truck unloading,. she was very helpful. my favorite part of the job was unloading trucks. the least favorite was the hour break., it just makes the day longer, id rather just get everything done. after we finished unloading we pulled the pallets the locations where we stock them and then start stocking with the people who come overnight,."
good,Need a career and walmart wasnt helping just a job to help meet ends I started back school and they not flexible with my school but its was a great way to make money and I loved asisting customers
good,Nice job to have and take care of your family and nice people come shop and spend money and nice co-workers some managers are nice and some are not nice.
good,"I was always busy at this job which made the time go by faster. I really enjoyed the people was was working with. The tasks were easy but monotonous, I would like to break the routine and ask to be put on special projects just to pass more time. Loved being able to work with and be involved with customers all day. I could make small talk and have productive conversations."
good,"Clock in, go to the back to start unpacking boxes and start stocking.  (I was hired to work in women's so had to stock women's clothing most of the day, plus keep things neat.  I also spent a lot of time cashiering even though I was never trained to be a cashier. "
good,"Processing photo orders, cashing out transactions, assisting in other departments when needed, developing good rapport with clientele, helping to ensure safe and friendly service"
good,A typical night at Walmart was nothing it was always changing something different every night that was going on. I have learned a lot from my time working there. The management was decent. My coworkers were great the hardest part of the job was when I had to work a department by myself. The most enjoyable part of my job there was working with my coworkers and clocking out at the end of the day
good,great staff and management all around awesome place to work for if your a young student to a retiring elder person they lay a fair game when it comes to staffing
good,"I really didnt like working for this company, the staff were rude, and never were around when I needed help with something"
good,"The pay was only a little above minimum wage, but the job was easy. The lunch break was one hour, unpaid, and the were 2 15 minute breaks."
good,I walk in work clock in then I start my day. I first head to the dairy cooler and check the milk and eggs to see if they need refiling. I enjoy being at Walmart Co.
good,"Walmart is an okay place to work. It was a good first job, as I got the opportunity to learn basic retail skills, such as running a register, stocking, and customer service. The only downside to it was that the management needed to be more clear/strict on the rules, and treat the associates more fairly."
good,"Fast paced retail environment. If customer service is your best quality then this is the place to work.  The customers need a lot of help finding items or have questions about items that Walmart sells. "
good,"Typically I would come in and stock shelves if I have an early shift, afterwards I would swap handling of cash register with various people. My manager was very helpful with everything and I learned to communicate with people, however difficult a lot better. The hardest part of the job was probably the difficult hours, but the friends I became with my co-workers was the best part."
good,"Es absorvente y no retribuyen el esfuerzo personal, no se tiene un alcanze alto dentro de la empresa"
good,"They didnt work with you amd had strict guidlines. If you were good on tabacco they would move you very fustrating. Always made reason to write you up, you couldn't be that kind person."
good,"members of management can't seem to stay on the same page. one sends me one place, then another sends me elsewhere, then the original manager sends me back."
good,There are always individuals willing to help if you need it. The job itself is not mentally difficult but it is physically demanding.
good,This would be a great place to work at if you want a lot of hours and want to keep busy while working. The mangers and co-workers are great people to work with.
good,Start with a meeting placing workers into areas for the work day. Then unloading pallets of stock to place on the salves and then take over stock to the back to be processed.
good,"The job itself wasn't bad, the people that I've worked with were amazing, the only problem that I had during my time there was with how were treated by upper management at times. We were overworked and underappreciated. It was an okay experience."
good,I was the mall supervisor so i worked very long hours cause i had a staff of 8 and they worked all shifts so i was on call 7 days a week 365 days a year.
good,"leads, supervisors and management do not re-leave associates for breaks and lunches on time and if they get a lock out on the register they blame the employee and threaten firing them."
good,"Walmart was okay.. stayed busy very mean Co workers mangers were okay unless they got upset   Lots of different people"
good,"le salaire n est pas très élevés,les personnes de nuit ne s entraide "
good,"Stock, help in other areas, help ifix clothes , stock, help customers, fix merchandise and label them too!!! Work any day night"
good,"picking the merchandise for the floor was hard because the warehouse floor was so full it was hard to maneuver and get this done in a timely manner (worst part of job).  warehouse space was a premium and not all stuff could get restocked properly.  job was 3rd shift.  1hour lunch (best part of job), co-workers for the most part were easy to get along with, management was aloof and hard to talk to,"
good,Working at Walmart not really nothing out of the ordinary just restock pull pilots and help customers . Learned how to be patience with work while dealing with customers .
good,"It was flexible, ive learned to multi task a lot more. Employees were great at assisting me when I needed help. The hardest part of my job was dealing with angry customers"
good,"Working at Walmart was a good experience, I was given tasks by my manager, and be on my own or with a partner with the same task and we would work together to finish our tasks"
good,worked part time during day shift and full time during night shift helped give cstomers best possible shopping experience.
good,I only worked 4- 8 hours a week. Didn't really talk to any of the managers they was always in the back or in their offices. Coworkers were nice and seemed to be easy to get along with.
good,"Perfect place to meet various people. You can most definitely broaden your horizons working in this well known place. The customers always gave me a good laugh. Some were more memorial than other, but its agreat place to work"
good,"With being one of the most worldwide known companies, they have their strengths and weaknesses. Walmart does try to incorporate new things and ideas to keep up with the competition, however, lacks the manpower to keep up with the areas in the stores. Walmart does have several policies and recurring charitable donations to the employees in need and the surrounding community programs but often forgets the fundamentals the company itself was built on. The people who work at walmart can be the greatest people you know, or the worst but most employees who have left Walmart say they miss the people, not the company. Over all, Walmart can be a good temporary job but not the best career."
good,Ok place to work depending on location. Typical day consist of answering customer questions while stocking merchandise. Management is okay but some are not. Coworkers are easy to get along with/
good,"Management planning could add to the store success! ! "
good,The most enjoyable part about my job is being able to answer the phone and greet people in a manually order directing them to different departments in the store
good,we actually put the store together it was not opened when I started working their we loved this job the grand opening was nice the coworkers was so nice to work with
good,"Working for the epitome of 'massive retail conglomerate' you definitely get what you would expect. A very large company, where you can virtually disappear, not knowing the majority of your co-workers and even some managers. In the 2nd Instock crew much is expected of you, and though its constant manual labor, its simple, and if you have a good crew around you it can be a lot of fun and a great environment."
good,Typical day at work consisted of stocking freight for a specific consumable item onto shelves for the consumer. My co-worker were team oriented.
good,Walmart has good job opportunities with a positive work environment you always have something to do and you learn new things every day.
good,My day would start with giving directions to my ics team to distribute merchandise to departments in store. Help departments managers pick inventory out of bins and re-bin merchandise that would not fit on shelves.
good,I enjoyed the easy going workplace. My coworkers and management team really focused on building the company and taking it further. I would advise my peers to work at Walmart because of the positive and organized environment they have to offer.
good,"The work at Walmart was often engaging and coworkers made it fun, however, poor scheduling often leads to conflict. Management is easy to work with as long as one does their job."
good,A typical day is a fast pace and eventful. There is tons to learn. Management can be great and helpful or down right terrible. Co-workers are great.  Hardest part is trying to keep up with the customer demend when there isn't enough help or the help isn't where they are supposed to be.  The best part are the customers. Even though they don't get waited on right away they are understanding when they see employee working their hardest.
good,"Walmart consist of unloading trucks , pulling pallets out to floor and stocking . It was a fast pace working are where I was but I loved it because we did team work and got things done"
good,o trabalho no walmart era muito bom e deu muito tempo para eu a poveira como um modo de experiência
good,"I had fun and learned a lot of new skills that i can use everyday."
good,Management will smile in your face and stand in a circle and talk behind your back. They pretend to try to help you and then spread your personal business. Very unprofessional. But the pay was good. If you work there stay to yourself.
good,I had the best crew ever. I loved working with the 8 crew members I supervised. I think the employees work to hard for little pay
good,It's a good job night people  opportunity to grow and succeed the management there is great and friendly it's just a since of security
good,"Plan to work nights and weekends. You need people skills and a lot of patience. If you aren't on lunch or break, you are on your feet and it can be very uncomfortable if you work long hours."
good,"Your experience working at Walmart depends heavily on your character. If you're a happygolucky person, it'll be an okay place to work. If you're more pessimistic, it won't be a good time. Customers you work with can be very rude and expect the world just because they're angry, other employees will get you down because they complain about their jobs constantly, but it's alright as long as you can keep your chin up (and be able to recite policies to customers repeatedly with a straight face). If you can, find a department that is off the front end (I moved to optical from cashiering/customer service management), as it'll be far less stressful."
good,"My personal experience aside it was a good job. Well pay, good co workers, very friendly staff, great boss, it was a very great job, i recoomend it to anyone who applies."
good,"Always get rude customers"
good,"its a decent job, occassionally laid back, but not nearly enough hours or pay to feed a family. You would likely never reach full time unless you are promoted and there isnt much opportunity for that, unless you're a suck up. I show up to work my butt off, earn my paycheck, and excel at what i do, while  getting rightfully deserved pay raises. I dont have time to play games."
good,"Working for Walmart has definitely been an up and down experience, but I've met a lot of amazing people along the way. Though my experience with Walmart has not always been wonderful I would still say it has been a great learning experience. Management has been semi understanding when it comes to family matters but they've always worked with me to the best of their ability. The hardest part my job would have to be the demand Walmart has on its associates when they intentionally under staff the departments. Although the joy that comes from the people I meet and making customers happy makes it all worth it."
good,fair work place. easy going. easy staff. typical work area. not enough staff. needs improvement in some areas but overall great for people that need some easy money
good,Le programme de prime pour les associée est genial . Belle ambiance de travail
good,You work hard and you will get rewarded. I started at the bottom and worked my way up very quickly. I enjoyed my time with the company .The hours i put in were extensive though.
good,"A typical day is just like any other day"
good,Longtime associate. Don't mind the place or the work but after nearly a decade I would like to advance myself up the ladder and it's very difficult to do so.
good,"Rotinas de Farmacias, conviveo complicado, polcas cahnces de crecimento."
good,On a typical day I stocked shelves and interacted with customers.I learned how to deal with customers better.  Management can be kind of understanding and the coworkers are friendly and welcoming and fun to work with.  The hardest part would be dealing with angry customers and the most enjoyable part during my time there would be my time in Tire and lube.
good,If your not in good with the mangers then dont expect to keep ur job there. They will make the jobs difficult. A lot of vood employees left due to management. The pay at walmart is great if you can pass there new probation period.
good,"A typical day is starting a day with good people and just getting "
good,it was un loading the trucks that come in with merchandise . 2 3 trucks a day . still feel like the pays was to low for the job . im more a person of customer service .
good,"Working up to supervisor was easy. If you work hard you will get noticed. That being said, they often throw the harder workload on hard working employees and neglect the slackers. Any walmart you go to people will know the favorites and the ones that they pick up the slack for. I left when i could no longer keep up with the demands from the job. You cannot control the level of inventory the warehouse sends you, no matter what tools they tell you what help. And even though they offer breaks, you have to take them or they will work you through them"
good,"You go do work, you do your job, and you are almost getting full time. customers treat you like garbage but at least at my Walmart the management is respectful, as accommodating as they can be, and eager to help. you don't really get trained though, you have to figure most things out as you go but it really isn't that hard. the best part of the job is probably the in-between  part time and full time, as an associate you typically get 35 hours per week (which starts of Saturday) so at least personally I make enough to live and pay my bills with a little left over for other things each month, I also only have $400 of bills including rent so if you have more then this may not be enough hours for you, but personally I love having 3 days off each week, although some times they are non consecutive. the people I work with are friendly, and we get along great, the managers are friendly too."
good,The people were fun to work with. most of the management were down to earth. They solved the issues at hand to the best of their ability.
good,Walmart is a great company to work for. It was a place I called home at one time.  They need to work on how they treat their employees. If managers had more experience it would be a better place to work for.
good,"Inventory Control and daily data recording"
good,There's a lot of good and hardworking people at Walmart but sometimes professionalism was needed from the Company and we needed employees concerns heard.
good,"Management wasnt very helpful, was trained on everything due to opening store which was nice, was either over staffed or under staffed never an in between."
good,The pay was great but I was working every weekend and my shifts would go from working a day shift of 8 am to 5 pm one day and then the next day I was working a night shift of 3 pm to 11 pm. It was too much for me to handle and I was not able to focus on my 9 year old.
good,Just starting position at Walmart so unable to give details on work environment yet. So far on the days that Ive worked the atmosphere has been ok. dont have any complaints as of yet.
good,É uma boa empresa pra adquirir experiência profissional pra dar- mos início a nossa carreira.
good,"improper staffing, either overstaffed or understaffed, communication between upper and lower management to asociates is a mess, everyone is overworked, things are easier for people who like to suck up to management."
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is helping out the customers, i learned that customers are always right.. the co-workers was very friendly and helpful"
good,Would work in the market dept. and also assit in the deli and deri produce depts. when they needed me to. I am not one to miss work at all in my 2 years i worked their i only missed 1 day of work.
good,"Flexbile schedules were a plus, team members were very kind and helpful when needed. It was a team oriented environment, but did not allow for personal time off."
good,I come to work organize the boxes and unload the trucks as well. Move Item from one location to another. Fill the shelves with products.Always greet my co-workers and management when I walk in.
good,"The walmart I previously worked for was a good environment. There was no dangers, it was clean, and everyone had their specific job to do. However, the management wasn't too good. My first night by myself, I couldn't get anything done. When I got the tools I needed to complete my task, the manager had an attitude and didn't provide help whatsoever."
good,the place is fun at times and the managers are very helpful. there can be times that you will feel overly worked but it somewhat pays off.
good,"Gained knowledge in wireless industry, enjoyed working with the multi culture environment,  learned auditing, and also gain experience in the operations of the organisation like inventory management, coordinating with representatives of network providers for smooth flow of organisation."
good,Working for wal-mart is a roller coaster of a job experience I love working for the company but sadly for the amount of years I invested the compensation was horrid and the raises were just as bad....
good,The individual in the tax department at the Wal-Mart home office are underpaid and under appreciated.  The management group has no insight on how to develop people.
good,Made sure the customers were satisfied with there experience and made sure they found everything they was looking for. And also did vouchers and let them pay with checks while purchasing there items.
good,Working for Walmart TLE was a decent experience. I worked with good people but under poor management. Safety was always a concern but scheduling was an issue.
good,When working at Walmart you have to constantly train because you can be pulled to perform tasks that aren't your usual. The managers are amazing and they love to help with work and personal situations. Walmart is a family reunion each day. Your co-workers love and help along the way and they motivate out to get the job done.
good,nice place to work.... dealing with guests was nice... management needs to get on the same page... the team was usually on their own... hard was trying to figure out who was management was... the work was good...
good,Learning many new skills and for the most part enjoying the people I am working with. This is a fast pace job in which I enjoy. I also like the variety of the differ type of tasks which keep me from being bored.
good,"When i first worked at Wal-mart out of high school i made better money scrubbing toilets than when i came back after i received a college degree. No respect for any education, training, or qualifications. If they could get away with paying minimum to one person there was no hope of moving up or making better as we were all very replaceable."
good,I found Walmart very Benifit for me. When you work there over 90 days you receive an discount card the more you spend the more you save with the discount card. And I found that very useful.
good,"hard but fun. skills. nice. nice. when to take braks. the pay. i love having a job working is nice, job makes me happy. ijfoijfjajs"
good,"pocoentrenamiento y forma de explicar muy corta"
good,"A typical day consists of continuous fast-paced walks throughout the entire store to grab items for customers, trying to balance everything that management wants done and everything else that customers want from you and that regularly has to be done on a day by day basis.  The best part about it was the encouragement and happiness co-workers shared with one another to continue strong throughout the day."
good,"Walmart is changing more and more on a corporate level. Walmart keeps you busy and to me it's not a go career to go after if your starting a family. Walmart is very competitive and changes happens day to day. Not all stores are the same so if you get in a good store stay there, the grass is not always green on the other side,"
good,"Depending on your department and your position, there will be varied amounts but none-the-less a plethora of customers who will require your knowledge of products and/or the whereabouts of said products. The quicker you learn all you can about your department the smoother your day will go by. That's not to say that that is all there is to it. It's Walmart. There will be plenty of challenges and obstacles to overcome."
good,"I like working at Walmart, Im not too happy and satisfied with management there."
good,buenos benéficos al empleado. me ha dado la oportunidad de aprender y crecer.
good,"To be honest, I've been here for the past 2 years and it was a great job at first but, then it just went downhill after management rotated around and the managers were not all that friendly and lenient with what you needed. The discount was hardly anything unless you bought something extravagant and, as well as asking about the WRMC was annoying at times too."
good,The workers and associates at Walmart are amazing. It really is like a huge family. The rules and polices are fair and easy to follow. The training is easy. the opportunity to advance in your career is limitless.
good,"This was a really good job, besides the fact that they do not do anything the way Sam Walton wanted it done. I learned how to cap a bin stock shelves and use a pallet jack and mc40 coworkers where mostly good the management was ok they need to explain to you better the or maybe warn you about missing days if you are close to it and explain that they do not except doctors excuses when you are sick the hardest part of the job was getting up so early the best part of the job was getting off so early and the people i met"
good,"If u like rules and procedures to change almost daily, then work at Walmart. They do have decent insurance. After 6 months u get a discount card that gives us 10 percent off a lot of items."
good,"The best part of the job was serving and interfacing with customers."
good,We had a customer following down in Texas where they would not shop until we got there at 10:00 pm.  I had 3 wonderful cashiers and we were a great team.
good,"Enjoyed my maintenace duties"
good,My day consisted of checking out customers and making sure my workplace was organized. I learned how to use the cash register properly and i learned skills on the computer. The hardest part was dealing with rude customers.
good,There are too many bosses. You do no know who you should ever actually listen to. This job is not bad just too many people who think they are boss. I have had an okay experience.
good,"Llego veo que falta surto y organizo a mi promotoria para realizar tareas para mantener el departamento limpio y surtido."
good,"The Customer's always make my days better  no matter what attitude i had coming in"
good,Manages up to 70 associates at a time to make sure all business supply needs are met. I make sure customer demands are met by overseeing the shipment of millions of dollars worth of freight everyday.
good,it was a job I didn't really like it. it was long hours and sometimes very hard days dealing with customers. but I learned to get over it because I hae bills
good,I am noticing all companies that boast about their integrity and how it's their biggest philosophy often have very little of it in real time practice. At 7422 and 7356 they just look for ways to write you up and get you in trouble so managers can appear to be working. I miss when companies actually cared about their employees and truly trying to improve the quality of life at work.
good,"they need better mangers but for then that everything was ok the people the store was always clean. I love that I work second shifts, it was fun and love the people that I worked with"
good,"With a full work crew, this job is very manageable. The workload is usually not too heavy and the customers are mostly polite and agreeable. Management helps out when needed, provided they aren't required elsewhere."
good,Walmart was a good experience to start off my work experience. It was a good environment to be around. The people that I worked with for the most part was an awesome experience.
good,Loved working at FoodFair. They do their best to work with each employee if something may come up or there may be a change needed in scheduling or whatever.
good,"Learned multiple different components and divisions"
good,"Most of the people i work with are devoted fun people to work woth but the shop has no direction, we have been very shorthanded for a long period of time and never have enough of a supply of wheel weights and valve stems, and the store tends to not care about what goes on in automotive."
good,The company is a great for someone starting out. Co-worker are a joy to work with overall. I've learned to not taking things to heart.
good,"I talk to my customers while I'm checking them out they really enjoy me asking ""how was their day"". The kids are a bonus, they are so full of life. I try my best to make sure they get the product they came for. I will walk them to the product if I need to. My co-workers and I work as a team to get the job done. The hardest part of my job is not having the tools and the good management that is needed  to do the best job. I love that I learn something new everyday from a customer, co-worker, or management. I use the information I receive from everyone that I come in contact with on a daily basis  and incorporate into my job. I learn as much as I can about all departments and policies so I can provide a wonderful experience. I feel if I do my part and they come back then I've done a good job.  That is why I provide exceptional Customer Service."
good,you didn't know what to expect each day                                          my coworkers where great to work with                                           meeting new peole
good,"everyday I help manage between 20-30 people throughout the store, but mainly on the front end. I am responsible for getting the cashiers out for breaks and lunches on time and getting them change requests, answering any questions they may have or customers. I do mainly closing shifts so at the end of my shift I have to drop all the tills and get certain tills reset for the morning. I work with a lot of great people but I am looking for more stability in a company that will allow me to have more family time."
good,the people are great and there is fun to be had but it is not what it once was. The company itself doesn't really put the associate first anymore and it's really all about the money these days. But all I can say is I've learned so much and met so many people that I will cherish unforgettable memories with forever. If you're willing to put in really hard work it's a good place to learn how to strategically figure out any type of task someone could throw at you.
good,Me gusto mucho paro el trabajo muy duro y de madrugada más el horario de madrugada es muy malo
good,Walmart was a good place to work and I did not mind it but the job I had was just pushing carts so I left for more experience. I want to work In a job where I can stock shelfs or something like that and I want to become a carpenter one day because I am taking carpentry courses at school for a good well paying job in the future that I like to do
good,"Average day really nothing to learn other than your position with some ""okay"" management. Co Workers are fun to be around. Nothing hard about it and everythnig is easy."
good,I loooooved working for Wal mart. They accommodated their associates time schedule and made it fairly easy for the ones that had children
good,"The job isn't terribly difficult, but is often hampered by flaky coworkers and management with little to no foresight when issuing orders."
good,Working with the 3rd shift crew was wonderful. I learned so much about the logistics of the soft lines area. The management worked well with everyone . It was a pleasure
good,Was an alright job. Learned to develop better communication skills while I was Employed here. had alot of fun. Customers were always nice and I got to learn a bit about managment.
good,I enjoyed the rate at which I was compensated. Management needs more improvement. As with a lot of Wal-mart's it had a high turn over and theft rate..
good,"Most days I am given a large amount of work to accomplish for the night. Management does come check up on me and when I really need it they do provide help, usually at the last minute. My co-workers and I try to inspire a team environment in our department that makes the day go more smoothly as we plan out what and how tasks need to get done. Plus we are able to keep each other upbeat which in turn makes our interactions with customers more positive. The hardest part of the job is simply keeping within time, often my department has more work than is technically available  during the night so we often have to work very hard to get it done, leaving us exhausted by the end of the night. However, those days are often the most rewarding because we somehow managed to get it done just in time."
good,what I learned I had already learned from previous employers. Even though what I did learn from there was very good and the people were nice just some of them did not believe in being a team player with each other.
good,"productive work environment, learned all about the ins and outs of a typical produce clerk. the co-workers were friendly enough. what I enjoyed most about the job was work environment, a lot of smiling faces from customers."
good,Es una empresa estable solo que el salarios es poco hay tiene crecimiento laboral y anima mucho asus asociados
good,Walmart wasn't a bad place to work at all. Only downfall is it gets really busy and you work crazy hours and holidays. I would definitely work for them again.
good,"I have work at Walmart for a year while in high school, reason for me leaving is because my grade was dropping from all the hours I had to work. It was almost my senior year so I had to focus on school work."
good,Trabalhei no inicio dos anos 90 e tive a oportunidade de retornar em 2014.
good,Always a good time going into work! Great co-workers always laughing while getting the job done! co manager awesome! Only a couple of managers that are no good. overall great
good,"As a sales associate I would start my day by stocking shelves, and dealing with the overstock. There's zoning, which is Walmart-speak for moving items that are out of place, pulling products forward to the front of the shelf, etc. Helping customers is supposed to be the number one rule. Cleaning is usually limited to picking up trash, taking care of spills, and possibly cleaning the shelves during a modular reset."
good,The company give you a chance to have opportunity to move up and its a great company to work for helping people when help is needed for the fact that I'm a people person
good,"I give this company a three because their insurance for someone new to the company was not very useful, I had a 3,000.00 dollar deductable on my health insurance; the policies with wal mart are not constistent so it is stressful for the employees as well as the customers. Wal mart is no longer paying their employees holiday pay nor are they giving bonuses anymore."
good,"My coworkers and management team are amazing, the company how ever has unrealistic expectations. We have been told to take an energy drink every night so that we can get our work done because if you're not hopped up on something you will never finish. If you dont finish on time  you are subject to termination or other disciplinary actions. the quickest workers have trouble finishing. these problems would arise if they were ""allowed"" more staff. most issues are because of man power but with such a high turn over rate and the company paying less than the agreed amounts people tend to not want to work for walmart. I on the other hand NEED this job so i deal with everything. I dont recommend working for the company with the frequently changing policies and cheated wages but desperate times call for desperate measures so you suck it up and go to work. im guaranteed a paycheck here when many people are struggling to find work."
good,"Walmart friendliness stops at the door towards there employees. Upper management doesn't want to know you by name, they hired you to work and that is it."
good,Its a great place to work at if you like talking to people all day. I learned to have a lot of patientce when comes to helping people. All of my co-workers were close and friendly.
good,They are a very big company and they do not have enough associates to keep track of all the workers and most of the workers just want to walk around and do absolutely nothing when they have one guy doing all the work for everyone else
good,"Being a Walmart associate was definitely a great platform to start my customer service career. Great people, good enviroment and perfect opportunities."
good,"Your average job.  Go in, clock in, do your job and go home.  Small chance to advance in the work place but few can if they work for it.  Management was alright, just didn't feel like they cared about anything but themselves."
good,"I really didn't enjoy working at Walmart, it wasn't for me but the typical work day was being on your feet for 6 hours or more, I didn't really learn anything the management was okay my co workers were okay the hardest part of the job was being on my feet for majority of the work day and there wasn't really an enjoyable part of the job."
good,"es una  empresa muy responsable, tienen un muy buena actitud con sus empleados, en especial los jefes de las areas, asi como insentivos por hacer bien las cosas"
good,Un buen ambiente de trabajo pero no hací el sueldo y prestaciones
good,"When I first started to work for walmart it was a productive and fun place to work . Then it got to be not so fun . They had us doing so much every night and if you couldn't get it done you got in trouble . Some of the management team was easy to work for they respected the work you did , others didn't ."
good,Some of the employees seemed to work harder than others and I was never properly trained. If I had been properly trained like I should have I probably would have liked it more.
good,Wal-Mart is fun productive place to work for. The customers are great but some times can be a little demanding.The managers are very ethical and profesional its a good place to work for.
good,"I have learned quite a bit working at Walmart.  always room for advancement.  Management  gives too much lee way to other associate, they do not really discipline."
good,"What I enjoyed the most was working with people. What I enjoy the least was inventory. Customer service, counting money, and inventory"
good,This job helps you get strong. You must move fast to keep up. You got to learn about many different departments. You got to learn how to keep track of inventory in the back room
good,"It is very challenging to work in the distribution centers if you have outgoing lifestyles and for the type of labor you do you make great money, you just dont have to much potential to grow with the company"
good,working at Walmart can be hard if you don't get along with people. but if you make some friends they make it easier. it doesn't take long to learn how to work the cash register
good,wal- mart as company is good .  Coworkers are friendly the store are clean and they have a good training program.  The mangers in some store have there own agenda they like to get rid of associates and bring in there associates.  Not all the manager are like this but some are which could cost you your job.
good,"The company is fast paced and demanding environment The group of people I worked with were the reason I went to work everyday. Management is extremely demanding with unrealistic goals at times,"
good,a company that is constantly changing its structure and re-organzing management. leadership and company directives change all time which make it difficult to learn and grow.
good,Everyday was a different goals and activities. I learned how to work with many different personalities. Always busy with customers. Management will only be there if that person is available.  I enjoyed helping make a person feel good and helping them.
good,This location specifically caters to more favoritism and kiss ups. Not many chances to advance here unless you are extremely buddying to management. And customer service is terrible
good,Loved working with the management team I had at Walmart. Wonderful set of bosses and fellow csms. I had a great set of cashiers and loved going in to work everyday!!!! My customers were my number 1 priority and I wanted to make a career out of what I did!
good,"Typical night actually because I worked the night shift included just stocking the shelves, when I would first start out the night on busy nights I would run the registers and greet people. I learned to learn a register more then before and welcome/greet people more."
good,Good working condition and I enjoy working with people that took a interest in there job as well as helping out others in a working environment.
good,"A typical day at Walmart would be coming in and helping customers with cutting deli meats and cheeses to their required thickness. I would fry the hot food that goes into the case and would keep that filled throughout the day. If I was closing I would be responsible for putting things away and cleaning out the cases and mopping the floors. I would also help the customers to purchase hot food in the case. From time to time I would help make deli sandwich trays, cheese and meat trays and vegetable trays. I would also help to stock shelves in and around the deli. I would help to prep chickens in the cooler that was to be made in the rotisserie oven for the day."
good,"The management is not good, people is always scare about them and they just treat us like nothing just simples persons. That why I wanna leave this company, they dont give opportunities to the overnight shift assiciates."
good,"Helped customers with no real problem. Loved meeting new people. "
good,It was an alright place to work. Little money for a lot of work. Customers treat you badly. Staff was Okay. Some high school type drama
good,friendly coworkers. nice environment to come to work to everyday. hardest part of job is having numerous job responsibilities. the easiest part is that you can get a lot of help from coworkers so long as they aren't to busy.
good,normal everyday work of tire and oil changing benefits were pretty good health insurance was real good and that is important vison insurance was great
good,"I would start my day cleaning the break room , then I would unload the truck, me and my co-workers would divide the items into bins then hit the front on the store and start stocking. I had a lot of fun working there."
good,I would not recommend this to anyone as a long lasting job employment.Walmart may have been a family oriented company at one time but I don't feel that now.
good,es una empresa donde puedes aprender como primer empleo tiene un salario bajo y muchas horas de trabajo hay tiempo extra pero pagan muy poco si eres asociado tendras descuentos y pagan puntualmente.
good,Meeting new people and interacting with them was the most enjoyable part of my job experience there. My co-workers were friendly and comical. One or two of the managers could have used a class in guest service.
good,"Everyday brings a vast spectrum of different jobs to do... learning never ends. "
good,It was fun. One thing I like most about the job is the discount card.I have learn how how to communicate with diffierect people of different backgrounds. Coworkers are cooperative
good,Daily activity changed each day. You never knew what you were doing or were you were stationed for the day. No real direction as you could be in a position and the managers were clueless.
good,"Travail de routine, placer la marchandise, travail d'équipe"
good,"Fill prescriptions, dealing with customers, doctors and insurance companies. Hardest part of working here, is that there are days that are so frustrating, but as a team you get things done."
good,"This place was an interesting place to work. i went for a job until my job was ready at firestone. I ended up staying at this job because the people were good there. So the management changed and many new people were hired. No management was in the shop half the time and when they was. No managing was being done, just critizing everyone while leaning on the gate not helping when we was being hit hard. Have to say there was 2-3 of us that ran that place better then management ever did. Old machinary, old hoses, old equipment. constantly maintaining until i finally decided to leave the job."
good,"Highly depends on which store you work at. Like every job, there's perks and theres downsides. I've met some really awesome people here and some of my management are amazing."
good,I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart.  Management was fair and most of the time flexible.  I learned alot from management. They were pretty supportive and wanted you to advance in the company.
good,"It was a fine enough place to work, I worked in electronics, and it wasn't anything too physically strenous working there. The managers were nice, and coworkers were fun, but the customers that you get and have to deal with, were routinely horrible, and the exception was when someone kind said thank you, or that they appreciated your help. If you need the money Walmart's probably hiring, but otherwise, I'd say explore other opportunities."
good,"At Walmart I learned about the Walmart Rewards Mastercards, and their benefits to consumers. My co-workers were friendly and helpful. Being a student with a time consuming schedule, management was diligent in scheduling according to availability. Although at times miscommunications resulted in being scheduled against ones availability, Walmart was quick to comply."
good,"I really ended up feeling like I had a rewarding experience getting to know so many of my coworkers here.  As far as cleanliness, this restaurant suffered greatly.  The management was pretty harsh, but at least stayed in contact well with the general staff.  Customers seem confused about whether a tip is part of a servers pay at this particular establishment because it is a buffet setting, but management paid about 2.65 dollars per hour.  Servers bus their own sections of about 12 tables that seat about 4 people. Heavy busing due to the nature of the restaurant.  Very certainly the most fast paced and demanding work I had seen so far."
good,"Worked there for a very short period of time, about two months because intended for a summer job. My first time working in a departmental store so it was a very new experience to me. Gained insight on how items are managed."
good,"A typical day at work would usually pass by quickly as there is always something to do. The most essential skill you learn is how to talk to customers, especially ones that are dissatisfied."
good,It was very busy. Taking lunch breaks created hardship on other pharmacist. Pharmacist felt guilty if they took a break.
good,"Checked out customers and trained new employees. I assisted co-workers when, I help the cart pushers at times. I made a relationship with most of the customers."
good,"Workplace was well designed and associates worked well together. Learned better customer service skills and was able to learn more about money management, and how to eliminate shrink in product and profit."
good,"When I first started working at Walmart I spent my time working as a cashier. It taught me how to be fast with scanning items and getting customers out in a timely manner. I eventually moved over to customer service desk. Everyday I would take care of all customers needs. Anywhere from returns, paying bills, cashing checks, and helping out with important questions. The co-workers were all great people to work with and made it easier to have a positive attitude. The hardest part of the job was when customers would have carts full of items and a lot of price matches. It made it harder to work fast and customers in line would become angry. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting complimented when a customer was satisfied with my skills. It assured me I was doing what I was supposed to be doing. It was very stressful as far as management went because there was a constant change with managers and it wasn't consistent."
good,"Managers should be faster to respond to their associates. "
good,"Had to be able to multi task, with some problem solving. Enjoyed working with everyone. Although the varied shifts was somewhat difficult."
good,Walmart is a good place to start working as a young person. It will provide as much experience as you want to get in many different areas. It is a place where you can move up quickly if you work hard. Walmart can be very draining at times requiring lots of overtime during certain parts of the year.
good,Stable minor not too exciting on working for the company feel as if there are not too much help on getting assistance on an with issues.
good,"Good hours and pay was great, I wouldn't work over night the people were really negative and it provided a not great place to stay at like my other jobs."
good,This company is horrible to work for. They do not care about their employees only the bottom line. It is great to get employment but may want to find elsewhere.
good,sin posibilidad de superacion laboral ya que el sistema establecido por la empresa no se lleva al pie debido a ideas superiores impuestas
good,I gained useful experience while working here. It was a pleasure to work with everyone and very fulfilling to be able to help out as much as possible where I can.
good,I work really hard. I do so much at walmart. I have nerve damange but yet they don't care. I've asked to be moved departments and they said no. I'm always in pain
good,stocked shelves initially but was overstaffed and got booted to the front end to be a cashier. only worked as a cashier 50% of the time as I constantly had to push carts. moved to outside cartpushing and hated it. eventually just gave up and quit.
good,Fun workplace . Learned alot from working here. Co workers are great and managers were nice. Did sales associate and also worked on the cash register.
good,"Not fair with attendance points.. computer driven ...makes errors in computing your time, they won't stand behind you .very let down with management. And staff"
good,The managers were ok at times always busy worked in the photo lab first for about 4 years then moved to the jewelry department and worked there for 3 years. I was the jewelry coordinator I ordered special orders like class rings and sizings on rings and sent out jewelry that need to be fixed. I checked in freight I did layways I ringed people up. You know customer service all the time.
good,"Se puede trabajar en walmart siempre haciendo la parte que nos corresponde y con base a nuestra trabajo existe la posibilidad de crecer a corto y/o mediano plazo. "
good,"My work day varied depending on what department I was assigned to. I learned how to decorate caked, how to deal with difficult customers. I also learned how to lead a team. Management was ok for the most part. At all locations I had awesome co-workers. The hardest part of the job was trying to make an unhappy customer happy. Making customers happy."
good,"Walmart was a decent place to work, but most of the managers didn't care too much about employees. They would schedule in departments that you didn't know and they would get mad if we didn't do the job right. I was doing the work of a photo technician but they wouldn't pay me for that position or promote me."
good,"•	Handle issues of return, exchange, and refund."
good,"Nice Environment"
good,"I always had a good attitude about every situation the hard part is when I was put some where I wasn't used to we had a good team we worked with I enjoy working, and willing to step up my husband works six 12s. I want to help, and keep him working himself to death for our family."
good,Ok place to work.  Too much management.  Poor scheduling. Doesnt follow availability. I didnt like it very much at all and was only threre about three months.
good,"A typical day would have you doing many things before even your first break. There would be times that things would go wrong and you would have a customer yelling at you for some reason.  I learned that you cannot do it all yourself, you have to have someone to back you up when you need it. That was one of the hardest parts was the department that I was in did not have enough people and the customers sometimes suffered because of it.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the people that I got to work with and the different customers that I got to see on a daily basis."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo"
good,walmart was a good experience for me they taught me how to stock and how to do inventories and taught me  customer service skills management skills and how to work with others
good,"A typical day at Walmart consists of putting returns away for your department, zoning the department, providing customer service, and ringing register"
good,I worked here for most of my college years and actually really enjoyed it. The pay was dismal but I didn't expect much. They were very flexible about my hours because of classes and the like and offered me a few opportunities for advancement.
good,"While working at Walmart, the personnel position was very varied. A lot of different aspects of personnel management. Good support from management."
good,"great starting pay for just a normal job. "
good,Room for growth. Great benefits and opportunities if you work hard and lots of long hours.  Good to ensure you have an open schedule as moving up in the company requires time.
good,"Starting the day with morning meeting, preparing meeting notes, co-ordinating with all the associates. Monitoring all the safety features, dealing with internal problems and also with the problems arising with the customers in the store. End of the day, sending reports to the head office with the sales and performance of the day."
good,Fair work environment with fair hours. Would prefer more stable hourly schedule with employee health considered more. More chance  for employee input would also be a good thing.
good,I enjoy with the people I work with. The pharmacy is a very tough job and I learn new things everyday. It's nice to help people. It is stressful job. We get to educate customers on their medications. we also help them with their insurance issues.
good,"The hardest part of the job at Walmart was that there was always a time where you had to overcome difficult situations; between the corporate policy, the"
good,This job has its ups and downs just like any job. There are many difficulties and many blessings. Typical day is running a report of outs in your department and bring merchandise to the floor.
good,I love the job because it is  very fast paced. It is a physical job. I have a lot of responsibilities. I have learned how to do cost inventory every month.
good,This job needs more sense of care to employees at the workplace. I basically got fired for talking loudly in the parking lot because of another employee slapped me in the face. Even though I was able to win the report and case # I chose to stay away from the negativity at that specific workplace.
good,"I will clock in on time. I was greeted by coworkers. I would receive my tasks and finish my tasks before the work day was ended. The task were simple stocking shelves, helping customer with any  questions that they had. I learned how to stock shelves rearrange shelves and items. The most I enjoyed of work is that the tasks were different everyday and coworkers were very friendly."
good,I came into work as a cashier. I enjoyed it. I learned how to run their cash registers. The hardest part of the job was worrying if you had made mistakes.
good,Productive and fun place to work.  Management is easy to get along with.  High productivity times are my most enjoyable part of this job as well as helping customers.
good,Great teamwork and management. I  learnt a lot in terms of relating to customers and supervisors and also learnt to work for longer hours and extra shifts
good,Good people easy work for a part time job. Management can be a little more engaged in lower workers ideas and skill set though.
good,"Gosto do trabalho de caixa, e também tenho grande facilidade com os clientes. E também tenho muita rapidez de aprendizagem."
good,My CO-workser made the day go by fast. my managers was very nice and understand when it came to school. i would tell some to work at Walmart especially if they are in school.
good,I worked at a store in Kingsport for quite some time.  I watched it become a much less tolerable place to work during that time frame.  It was sad to see it fall so far.
good,Managers never listened u had to know someone up there to get them to listen to u such as managers an there favorite  will explain  further in interview
good,"Es de mucha actividad, se aprende mucho en cuanto al manejo de la mercancia y demas actividades los jefes son en general personas con disposicion a ayudar la parte mas dificil es el abastecimiento,"
good,"Going overnight into Walmart it being my first job for three years, I very shy at first didn't like to talk much but I learn that you must have a voice and know that your not just an on anybody and its okay not to know something but its not okay going around not learn when it can very helpful for you to assisting a customer. the co-workers are like family, I also learn which I love that made the most impact on my life, is that title doesn't matter but leadership does, leadership out weights titles anytime I worked with mangers who couldn't teach you because they didn't have a clue on what to do an didn't care, but I worked also with mangers that came in an that didn't know a lot but was willing to learn from people who wasn't in management and honor them and knew that they could count on them."
good,"it is hard  labor  and is best for younger individuals . the managers were professional "
good,"A good place to work for a short time. Learned a lot, it was an experience that I will remember throughout the rest of my career."
good,"I been at Walmart for six months and its a new experience..but I need more room for job placement..i ready o move up to bigger and better position, At Walmart will never happen..so I looking for a new job."
good,How to greet customers and help them locate items everyday.Where the fastest route to take to stock supplies at.To make new friends and open up more..
good,I would always restock the fridge and make sure that all the items were there in the right place. Showed customer around if they were looking for a specific product.
good,"Empresa bem organizada, porém com poucas oportunidades de mudança no setor profissional."
good,"Working at Walmart was a great career to learn about customer service. After working for a couple years there I received the opportunity to become a front end Customer Service Manager. Learning the everyday skills of communication, management, time-management was great to develop skills. Overall it wasn't a bad position but the opportunity with a new employer came up"
good,Great Experience With Responsible For Department Area. And Taking Care With The Customers. Keeping The Store Nice and Clean.
good,The department mangers should get paid more than expected. There are a lot of favoritism that goes on in a Walmart that should change in the near future.
good,"Cooking, serving customers and learning codes for the foods was a typical day at work in Walmart deli. Things were difficult to learn by as the days went by it kind of got easier for me."
good,customers can be pretty rude and managers can be disrespectful. if you don't mind doing repetitive things and don't mind the rude people its a decent job and you can make a living off of it.
good,"Meu ultimo emprego foi na rede nacional mercados como cargo de padaria e atendente de balcão, onde trabalhei 3 anos e 2 meses, tenho bastante experiencia desenvolvia toda a parte de receber e colocar as mercadorias nas prateleiras e embalagem e fatiar os frios entre outros, nesta área onde pretendo atual novamente. Assim como também estou disposta a aprender novas funções e cargos."
good,Good Company but can certainly be challenging as an external hire. The more long term associates the harder it is. Especially upper store management is either great or horrible.
good,"I worked at front desk, cashier, and customer service for over 2 years working with customers on the floor, and during check out times. fast and effective."
good,"any job at Walmart requires a lot of customer service.  Each day you meet lots of different people, some not so nice, and some that make you smile and appreciate what you do.  While working there I enjoyed working with my coworkers, and the work overall isn't difficult."
good,"Pretty busy no breaks, but enjoyed meeting new people. No day was the same. Never knew what to expect going to work. They were very flexible with my school schedule as well."
good,My first job and by far the worst of all the money wasnt worth all the trouble and time I took into doing everything I cpuld as a team member I even.worked extra hours and took people fays if they cpuldnt come in
good,it was a good job at wal-mart it always had me on my feet. I would recommend this job to anyone how ever they did condense the employment openings soo.
good,"You are expected to do too much as a department manager every day. It's really only you working your departments because communication is difficult. Especially between management, the morning shift, second shift, and third shift people. Everyone blames the other shifts for the disasters and the lack of work being done. Certain coworkers make the day a lot more fun than it would be. Time management is probably the biggest issue with this position though. Trying to pull products from your bins in the backroom, work your reports, do price changes, and ect on top of consistent customer service is rough."
good,When I started I really enjoyed the job.I  was helping people in hardware which I know really well.the company has cut benefits and cut hours.The atmosphere is not like it was in the beginning.I only want to work 25hours but I have been off for two weeks.I wish things were different  but I'm not the only one in this position.
good,Meeting different people is a great opportunity to become social and have a good work relationship. Making hours by helping other departments when authorized by management is a great way to learn new traits.
good,"I had to transfer and the differences in the stores were different due to the city types. I liked the work but they would not applaud good work, only notice negative. Even if you are helping customers you have to stop what your doing to take your lunches or your breaks less you want to get written up. I believe that it is a first job type of place or a certain type of person type of place to work."
good,"I learned how to think for myself, how to regulate tasks and how to lead a team mostly through my typical day being the ""reliable one"" of my department. Management is mostly on the level, but as always favouritism is a problem and some managers and associates were too close and gained too many benefits from such relationships. Furthermore managers often showed themselves to be ineffective at even basic things such as maintaining the schedules and dealing with irate customers, often pawning off those management duties in low-rung associates. That said, the best part of the job was the ground-level staff, they are kind and welcoming and the job itself was quite simple, if unfulfilling."
good,tries to promote a caring atmosphere. good associates to work with.  multitude of various jobs with various skill levels and various schedules with 24/7 operation.
good,Walmart is good place to work if you're in school but not as a full time job or career. Underpaid for the amount of work assigned.
good,This is the second time I am asked to do a review of this company. Why did this happen? Work is steady but monotonous. I stated this already.
good,"On a typical day at work, I provide exceptional service to customer. Over the years I've learn many things from taking calls to training employees. The management team is difficult to understand. We as co-workers are like a family. I wouldn't say i have a hard part at work. I enjoyed interacting with my customer and providing great service."
good,"Walmart is always busy in the mornings and as Cashier I was able to keep the lines moving without having to slow down. I learned how to communicate with people, no matter how upset or confused they are. Unfortunately the management did not respect cashiers and only decided to help us out when it was convenient for them. This made me learn that I needed to stand on my own two feet. The hardest part of the job would have been operating Self-Checkout with eight stations and only one person managing it. The rules for Self-Checkout state that there should be always two people in the area instead of one. What I enjoyed the most was making the customers happy and carrying out a pleasant conversation that makes them smile."
good,I have learned so much since starting with this company. About the job and people. I enjoy working as a team and accomplishing so much more in less time. Also there is a sense of pride and community.
good,"A typical day for myself starts off having a meeting arranging where all the associates will be working in all of the areas. Followed by the nightly register pulls while also assisting customers or running a register. Over the years I have learned better ways to handle customers in tough situations, to be firm yet gentle. Then turning around just to be ambushed by more customers or associates. I've spent the last two and a half years as an Overnight Support Manager. I'm now looking to further my knowledge and take my skills to another company where further management would be an interest for myself."
good,"Terrible training, was not impressed by training program. was not educated properly on how company works,. was thrown in and expected to learn on own about the business"
good,Customers & associates are great people. It is a fun place to work if you are all about customer service. Management needs to support and help out their associates more.
good,afternoon shifts i got in and got all carts outside and in and then checked bathroom and all trash in facility management where allway helpful and co workers where all good workers
good,"Se aprende a trabajar bajo mucha presión, estar enfocado siempre en exceder el resultado, gran trabajo en equipo, me ayudo a desarrollar gente y hacerla crecer."
good,I have heard that Wal-Mart is a great place to work at but this one in particular is not the greatest. The management will act like they care but in reality they dont.
good,"I worked as a cashier. My day consisted of standing at a cash register helping people, by answering their questions and putting their belongings into the cart."
good,"Walmart was a good company to work for. "
good,"My typical day consist of checking daily sales and making sure that my department is ready for the customers."
good,If you like working long slave hours and always being on you feet then only making minimum wage then this is perfect. You will make great long term friends at this job.
good,I enjoy working here. The customers are amazing and the managers are excellent. The hardest part of the job is leaving. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping the customers.
good,"This position provided me the opportunity  supervised, training and support the store to drive and achieved goals. This included sales, employees relations and establish an open door policy to be available to all the staff to provide  an excellent management."
good,"Overall, it was a fun experience and it is fun to meet new people on a daily basis and assist customers with help they need."
good,"The floral department was somewhat isolated from the rest of operations allowing me more freedom to be, relatively, independent. I had responsibilities in ordering and receiving and in cash register transactions, and also in creating new retail stock such as  fresh and artificial arrangements and wreaths, ribbons and bows, and Christmas decor."
good,i liked working there .i had another job so only wanted part time hours it became to much with the way my schedule worked.it was a fast paced company which i liked
good,Working in a supermarket gave me all the experience and skills I now possess. I now have excellent customer service skills as well as being hard working and learnt how to work in a fast paced environment.
good,on a typical day at Walmart I would greet people and help them with their checkout process. the place is well manage and organize for the customers.
good,"The Saginaw Walmart was great the people there always wanted to help each other and the management was like no other. I will never find another store like that they where willing to work with me and my family and I had so much room to move up in the company."
good,This job was nice and it was a good work environment. We as employees were encouraged to work as a team in order to help the customers as best as we could.
good,"stocked new product, straightened, waited on customers, back-up checker, worked fitting room and answered the phones, put up all returns"
good,"trabajo en una sección solo, con la cual llegan todos los productos que se deben ingresar al sistema para el botado de cada uno de ellos, el lugar debo mantenerlo limpio, todo el tiempo debo hacer devoluciones a los proveedores de las distintas marcas.no es mucho lo que pueda decir de ellos, no todos tienen mis colegas capacidades, lo cual dificulta algunas tareas con ellos pero se hacen igual. lo mas dificil de me trabajo es tener k ver los desechos de carnes, en el puesto que estoy fue por ayudar a la empresa ya que no contaban con una persona que hiciera este trabajo y el apoyo seria por unas semanas el cual llevo cumpliendo 4 años, aparte cumplo con recuperar los productos buenos y devolverlos a la sala."
good,Fun place to work got to meet alot of different people. I learned how to deal with different personalites. Also I learned how to handle money and how to be precise to the tee.
good,"Long, hard work. Can be difficult work if you get a customer that doesn't speak English. Long hours on your feet. Can be very difficult on your feet, legs, and back."
good,Very good training. The work was tough but the training was second to none. It gave you the opportunity to interact with customers while learning new skills.
good,"Have open hours."
good,"Wal-Mart is very face -paced, establishment, the most enjoyable part of working at Wal-Mart is the customers who come in everyday, also some of my co-workers are very helpful and have great team work, The hardest part of working at Wal-Mart it is no stability and hard to move up in the company."
good,todo mundo se mete onde nao se deve e cheio de brigas em uma area onde todos deviam se ajudar...
good,"Start off with the whole team for the meeting then right off to work. Very fast paced and lots of heavy lifting. Co-workers are great and very friendly, willing to help if you need any assistance. Managers will do their best to understand and listen to you and your concerns."
good,"Typical day at work was routine. Get work details from MOD, retrieve shopping carts 2 - 5 times during shift, then help out at register whenever needed. Pay was decent and management was exceptional. However, co-workers were often rude and generally poor workers. The hardest part of my job was working with said co-workers due to their poor work ethic. The most enjoyable part of my job was working with managers and supervisors who understood the job that needed to be done."
good,"Bons conhecimentos adquiridos nesta empresa. Trabalhava no turno noturno e isso gerou um desgaste muito grande, sem disponibilidade para mudancas de horario , otima equipe de trabalho , dificil lidar com a alimentação fornecida e o horario , bons conhecimentos adquiridos ."
good,I did not enjoy working at Wal-Mart because of some of the people I worked with. Most of the cashiers were very friendly towards and I am still friends with people I used to work with at Wal-Mart but I dread going there because of the mangers and other associates. However I learned a lot from the job and will always use the customer service skills that I was taught.
good,"They give you good Hours if you want them. Friendly people to be around, always approach you with a smile and nice attitude. Good money. Great place to be."
good,"Clock in, start my daily tasks, if needed to be somewhere else manager will send me, clean, cull bad food, one hour lunch break, work for 9 hours overnight, zone towards end of shift and clock out."
good,I would first start my day off by doing inventory that includes stocking pallets full of food and materials once i have the inventory complete i would pull everything to the floor to be stocked through out the night we are stocking shelfs.
good,You get to work on computers. You refurbish them by replacing bad parts and you get to install the operating system. It was a good experience
good,"most of the people that work there are okay some people are very bossy but most are good, some customers are rude working at this company is good but it is not as easy to move up"
good,"A typical day will consist of a nightly meeting with the team and the manager for that night. They will give you the department(s) you need to complete for the night along with any notes from the store manager or new policies. Once the meeting is over, unless paired with another associate, your work is all alone. Your freight will come on a pallet, and it can vary in size each night. You then are to go to the price checkers and scan your badge to start your task, on the task screen you are given the amount of hours to complete that task. I would always gather the things id need before ""starting"" the task. (Top stock cart and plastic bag) You then go to the pallet and down stack it according to aisle. Some tags on the boxes will tell you were they go, some do not. As you learn the department it becomes easier to separate items. Once you have filled your cart you then go find it on the shelves and stock it if the ENTIRE case will go out. (Only a few departments stray from this rule). Once you are done you take your cardboard to the baler, clean up any remaining items, and bin your overstock. (Only a few are binned daily by stockers). After the freight is thrown, then you are assigned a zoning task. And that's where you fix up the aisles, pull everything forward and take out what doesn't belong. Management can get a little stressed, but is usually understanding. Co-workers generally keep to themselves but are friendly. The hardest part of the job would be pulling pallets back at the end of the night, its just hard on the body at times when the pallets are heavy. And the most enjoyable"
good,"my typical work day was packing of sold products, looking for damages, scanning of products, receiving and giving the right amount of money during a transaction. Management did not have adiquit people skills. My co-workers was very supportive and great to work with. The hardest part of the job was having to leave. The enjoyable part was the customers."
good,"Orders are to be filled in a certain time frame, everything is extremely fast paced.  Worked with some great people.  Great benefits and time off.  Great job with a lot of pressure."
good,"Walmart was a stable environment providing most of the resources required to do the needed work, and gave the required training to satisfy customers on a daily basis; Generally everybody worked well together and much was accomplished at the end of the day. Sometimes it was hard to meet expectation, as there was much to do  outside of my expected job, but the experience was worth it. The management was kind but made sure that I did my job every shift. Ultimately, I learned how to better work as part of a team and how to meet the needs of individuals in customer service. Working at Walmart was a worthwhile experience."
good,My job is ok. Most people think that working in the jewelry department is easy but sometimes it's not all that easy. I also work in shoes where I lift heavy boxes and pull heavy loads of pallets to the floor.
good,"Having merchandise on hand, availability and access to products for customer puchases, to ensure repeat or repetitive business practices. Identifying quality merchandise for customer purchases. Management Teams were knowledgeable in their positions. A enthusiastic team player with strong work ethics, flexible and adjusted well to change. I worked well with co-workers and enjoyed the camaraderie. I found to be the most challenging were the earlier hours and the weight of some of the produce loads. I had an overall pleasant experience with this Employer and looked forward to seeing and helping customers"
good,the over night shift is extremely hard if you are not used to it.trying to stay awake when counting large lump sums of cash is a huge responsibility.coffee needed
good,"walmart is a great place to work if you are looking for stability, the work isn't to bad i love my coworkers they make it easy to do my job , the mangers are ok i should say !"
good,made sure to get as much as I could do done. mrs.nan didn't know English when I was a cake decorator so communication was hard because it left me to handle any communication in bakery
good,"•	Greeted guests, received orders and processed guest payments"
good,"Day shift is mostly customer service, but the job isn't like it used to be. They used to want you to truly help the customer, now they want you to point them in the right direction as fast as possible without knowing if you were really helpful to the customer of not. Overnights is pretty much a production type of work. So many cases per hour are required. If you don't get your cases per hour in, then management would come by and micro-manage your every move. They don't want to do much to help to improve the situation. Not very consistent on their discipline. They play favorites a lot."
good,I kept to myself and worked productively. I learned to work with others proficiently. My co-workers were down to earth and helpful. My job was not hard so I did my job to perfection.
good,It was a friendly neighborhood the teens and young youth showed me why it was fun to be around them and also they had respect for me as a counselor it was great
good,"It was a great place to work. Friendly coworkers, that are still my friends even though most of us don't work there anymore. It was always a fun time going to work"
good,"Management needs to treat everyone the same and stop with favorite "
good,thankful for opportunity will recommend to others in need of a job i suggest you be advised to check schedule at least three times a day do not eat any of the food that walmart is throwing away anyway
good,A typical day at working is checking customers out at a fast and accurate pace while providing excellent customer service. This is a family orientated work place that pushes you to use your full potential.
good,"A typical day working as an unloader consisted of coming in, setting up receiving for unloading the truck, and then proceeding to do so. After unloading the truck we went to the sales floor, stocked our departments, half pulled freight to the floor while the other half stocked. After this was done we zoned our areas to make them look good, and went home. In this job i learned how to lift 200+ lb boxes safely. Management often left something to be desired with most of all associates, almost no one saw eye to eye with them and they generally caused frustration among the workers and in the workplace. My co-workers and i generally got along absent any conflicts and could work together efficiently. The hardest part of the job was definitely throwing the truck, AKA putting the boxes on the belt and pushing them down, not necessarily because it was terribly physically demanding, but because on a normal day inside the truck was 100 degrees+ and no fan. The most enjoyable part of the job was building relationships with my co-workers who i now claim as some of my best friends."
good,"I did most of the heavy lifting at Walmart I loved it, got along with all the co-workers I work harder than most all co-workers, the hardest part would be is lifting the produce once I got tired or sore but I would push myself through it."
good,"Very fast paced and the people are alright. However there is not much room for advancing to full time and not a lot of flexibility in scheduling. I have had the opportunity to work and learn in many different areas. From the tire and lube areas to sporting goods, produce and everything in between."
good,"Walmart was a nice place to learn and have fun, learn with multitask, you work with costumers, while you are doing your other assignments, we have fun meetings"
good,Great place to work for someone coming out of high school looking for a place to grow and have career. Management was always nice and helpful along the way.
good,"management needs improvement"
good,"wal-mart in Merritt Island has became a better place , I haven't worked there in a while now but clean nice place like any other wal-mart , many things have changed i am sure."
good,I like working at Walmart but it's just not for me. just not for me as in I'm not into the people person I like more of a outdoorsman
good,"Depending on who your manager is depends on the outcome of your work experience. Sometimes we all have fun, and most the time that one manager can kill  everyone's spirit. Walmart isn't a bad company to work for. You make friends,and build relationships. That has to be the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part is that one manager thats rude for no reason. But overall I really enjoy working here. Great company"
good,Walmart provides the best environment for its associates to grow professionally and personally. I have learnt a lot in my 20 year career with Walmart.We were trained to treat people fairly and with respect. Walmart empowers its associates so that we are comfortable making  several critical decisions for the business.
good,A typical day would be maintaining assigned area and answering phones It might also be helping customers find merchandise even if is in another area.
good,"I didn't like working there at all, plus I was pregnant when I worked there and I was supposed to be just a cashier but right before I quit they had be stocking small furniture and stuff like that which I wasn't supposed to be doing."
good,its a good place to get your first job however mangers never listen to you and you never get the days off you want. however the training for this company is awesome depending on who is doing the training
good,"Fast pace, great coworkers everyone got along well; in the beginning everything is hard but your coworkers are always willing to help you when in need of help."
good,"I have learned a lot, help customers most of the day."
good,Sin problema alguno todo muy bien son muchas horas y el pago de comisiones es al mes
good,I manage the cashiers and the courtesy desk so I need to make sure that their tills get assigned and their breaks are done. I make sure that we keep the lines moving and I override prices for the customers when they say the price on the shelf is cheaper. I make sure that the cashiers have change and make decisions on returns being done with out a receipt. I love working with my co-workers as we have fun while doing our jobs. The hardest part is when we are running short staffed but I do everything I can to make the line ups move quickly. I have respect for my manager and managers of the other departments. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking with customers as we have a lot of regulars that come into our store.
good,Good had a great time working with this company but sometimes it is hard coz there's so much things to do but you can still handle it tho.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking meat, keeping everything clean and organized, etc. I've learned how to do bin audits and inventory, how to properly clean the equipment, how to organize the meat to where there is no cross contamination, and so much more. Management wasn't the best. You would go to them with a problem, and they would either help you or ignore you. There have been a few times when I had asked for help and I have received none. My co-workers were great and they were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was staying in the meat cooler and freezer for long periods at a time. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my co-workers."
good,they have a lot of favoritism. Its a place where you can work for the time being but you would probably have to transfer to another store to get promoted.
good,"Equal opportunity employer. Customer relationships. Management Training took 18 weeks. This increased my management skills. 15yrs and 2 States to receive lifelong friendships with Customers and,or Associates."
good,Generally a good place to be employed. WalMart is good at supporting the community with decent benefits. The core beliefs of the company is made them what they are today.
good,I liked working at Walmart so.e of the staff are nice funny and cuerteous things could move a little bit faster then they do there but it was alright fir me a jib is a job and that's how I look at it to be honest.
good,Working in the Vision Center was great. Pay was terrible but if you enjoy helping people you'll enjoy the experience. Loved the health insurance and bonus potential.
good,I enjoyed working here fr almost 8 years. Great company t work for. But they need more cashiers and help at the registers from management.
good,"Went from Cashier to Person Shopper, its different an fun sometimes. "
good,It's a good company to work for when you are just starting out. You get to move to different departments and advance to management if you desire to move up in the company.
good,"Walmart is not a hard job at all. Theyre just always wanting more... not that its a bad thing, they just want so much from their employees but don't show appreciation when you get the work done. Benefits are great. Hours can vary, depending on the department. The most enjoyable part is getting to know your coworkers & actually working with them. For the most part ive always been stuck with great people (in all 3 stores ive worked)."
good,"Learned a lot while working in Wal-Mart, but did not enjoy my experience there. The only benefit was that they worked around my schedule before I graduated high school. Otherwise, it was NOT the experience I wanted. I have a parent in remission from thyroid cancer, and contacted people higher up in Wal-Mart's company to explain that I would randomly need days off once in a while to drive my father to the hospital for tests. We do not choose the days that he is tested and we are given maybe a week's advance. My position was terminated because it was, and I quote, ""for me to handle."""
good,Cheerful place to work.  Lots of people work there and the general environment is a good one.  Would be nice if there wasn't such a lack of ability to advance though.
good,Ross company is awesome. The store prices are amazing which made it so much better to work there and receive an employee discount. Ross and Dd's Discount Stores provide guests with the quality clothing and the prices reasonable. love love love
good,"The pay is good and the hours are okay, however it gets hard to do your job when you have managers from other departments coming in and starting trouble for you. I was doing what my manager asked me to do and the TLE manager came over and informed me I needed to put a broom in my hand, so I politely told her I was doing something my manager asked me to do. So then she is going to act like I am wrong to talk to her like that, and goes and turns me in to higher management."
good,"Walmart is fun, but can become stressful at times. Management and  Co-workers are fun, reliable, and customer friendly. Anything can be bought at affordable prices."
good,"A typical day wasn't fun (it was hard), all that was enjoyable were the people I worked with."
good,"My typical day at Walmart would be arriving on time, clocking in to my shift, letting the CSM know I had arrived, and beginning my shift. I loved the interacting between customers and co-workers, the social aspect was definitely a plus to working at Walmart. I learned how to work with others and problem solve. The management team was very unorganized and uncaring, they were not flexible towards their employees schedules. In my opinion the hardest part of working at Walmart as a cashier was dealing with the customers that had no respect for others, they could get aggressively mean and disrespectful towards my co-workers and I."
good,Good job to have liked working with others mad the night go by faster. Dont like when they over order and expect for everything to be stocked.
good,Ok place to work.  Loved the manager at the time  Most of the people were fun to be with.  Had a great time learning about work and people.  Appreciated the experience.  Would do it again if go back in time.
good,"bad store manager, no leadership. low morale, was not a place the fostered growth. In need of good manager and lacking mentor-ship for assistant managers."
good,Standing in a little square scanning people's groceries and bagging them is very tedious. You have a lot of different people in management.
good,"Getting a 10% discount to shop there was nice, the work was easy dealing with customer was enjoyable for the most part was not fun however working on black Friday every year"
good,wasn't much to do as a cashier only when holidays starting coming that's when work got frustrated. co- workers help out if you are new answering your questions at times.
good,"Wal-Mart introduced me to customer service as a cashier and gave me the experience needed to further my work hours elsewhere. I learned how to pack bags, talk to customers, and relay information to both managers, fellow cashiers, and customers."
good,"With the understaffing issues, everyday at Walmart consist of multi-tasking and helping in other departments. Knowing how to prioritize  and just understanding  that you might have an imperative task that needs to be completed but you're assistances is needed elsewhere will help you stay positive, happy, and progress."
good,"It was a learning experience with a cash register and hands on customer service. I enjoyed my time there, it helped me acquire skills that would make me an asset to any team."
good,i learn that having a job surrounding with different kind of people is always a challange  and your always willing to learn something new no matter how hard it seems
good,Good company to work with. Although there are times where I think that certain members of the company may have lost the original vision of Mr.Walton for its employees.
good,"I was just a cart pusher, so there isn't much to say about the position, I did what I had to do, was able to meet and greet the customers as they came in. It was okay."
good,They do not care about their employees was not the best work place it was very hostile. They work in groups of who they like thats who accelerates in the job.
good,"Walmart taught me exactly how to deal with customers, and in my personal life, people, that could be considered difficult to handle."
good,It is a alright experience in that I have learned that I really need to work in order to make a living. And that is a lesson that stays with you.
good,"Welcoming customers always smiled and enjoyed my job. Take different payments. Loved the people i worked with, i really didnt have anything hard to do at either of my jobs. I catch on easy im fasted paced and easy to get along, i enjoy what i do and make the best out of every situation."
good,"In a typical day at work I was doing around 9 carts of recovery;"
good,Definitely not a job for someone who requires mental stimulation. Deal with customers or just do mindless retail things.
good,As a manager I enjoy working with others. I worked in several locations and learned a lot of leadership qualities. I plan to own my own business so this experience as a leader has prepared for my future goals.
good,Nice place to work with an excellent schedual. Managers are friendly and not afraid to go out of their way to lend a hand or give advice about the work site.
good,a typical day at work is explainable there is always something different to do with different customers to react with and new things to learn about
good,I enjoyed working for this company because of the general public. I enjoyed greeting customers and answering questions and handling any problems that he customers had. I was really hands on with dealing with patrons and cash registers
good,"Walmart was an OK place to work. definitely should listen to their employees more. Benefits are great though, and hours are wonderful."
good,"Work was not hard, but it wasn't one job I would like to talk about due to some managers. Wish I could say more good things or bad."
good,"What we do everyday is collect carts, helping customers with questions, seeing if an item is available, and helping them carry it to their vehicles. I also help other associates if they need help with a task, and if I am currently busy I usually ask them if I can finish my current task and help them after or find someone to help them if it is urgent. I think I learn time-management, customer-service, keeping a list of tasks and finding the best way to organize them. The management is always helpful and willing to listen to your concerns. My co-workers are hardworking, friendly, and always willing to help each other. The hardest part of the job is the bad weather such as rain, snow, extreme temperatures, etc. The most enjoyable part of the job is being thanked by people you help and knowing you helped them find what they need."
good,"Wal-Mart is an amazing job to have. A typical day at work would be stocking groceries on the shelves but while interacting with so many people. Management is okay. Co-workers at Wal-Mart that I had a chance to interact with were always great individuals, even though I had my lunch stolen out of an refrigerator in the break room. The hardest part of the job is getting to know where & what isle groceries are on. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and interacting with new customers evryday."
good,"Working at Walmart was decent. I started off getting pretty good hours and making a good paycheck. Be warned, it's important to have patience while working here. Customers were rude a lot of times and it was tough being so patient. The people I worked with were funny and nice to talk to. I wouldn't go back, I was there to make money while I was in college."
good,"I liked the employees and supervisors I worked with, but a few of the overnight managers were just horrible people that liked to target you for any reason, just to get you in trouble, it felt like. Great team work and good benefits, but if you have any kind of family emergency, you will be consequenced and most likely fired and HR is absolutely no help at all."
good,Walmart has a very consistent workday.  There is always stocking to be done in order to keep up with the demands of the numerous customers that visit the store every day.  Working with new persons and ideas on a daily basis are the main things that I constantly learn.  The management has their hands full every day keeping up with display changes and information from the corporate hierarchy.  The hardest part of the job daily is keeping up with the changes that are sometimes surprising.  The most enjoyable part of the day is the customer interaction.  Ensuring that the customers are happy is why we are there.
good,"The work environment was very task-oriented and focused on achieving the goals as efficiently as possible. Coworkers and supervisors were all collaborating to achieve the goals of the organization as a whole, and problems were solved in an expeditious fashion."
good,a typical work day at Walmart was fast paced and fun. I learned all I needed to know about cake decorating and I had fun doing it. The management was always on the move but they where always willing to help us if we needed it. I had some of the best co-workers ever fun to be around and always willing to help us out. The hardest part of the job was getting the cake orders done on time. The most enjoyable part of my job at Walmart were all my co-workers and the fun we used to have
good,Sitting in the back room putting things together. I learned how to put things together. Management was fine. Coworkers were fine. Hardest part of the job was the shift I was on. Most enjoyable part was working at my own pace. The pay at the time was pretty decent also.
good,"If you enjoy working with customers and helping employee advance in their career field, this is a great job for you. "
good,Wal-Mart in South philadelphia is a very busy store and requires a strong work force to fill the shelves because merchandise is constantly flying out of the doors. Management at times was very taxed and often overloaded work on certain individuals. Co workers were very nice.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job for me was keeping morale high while accomplishing what needed to be done. "
good,The hardest part of the job is my co-workers/ associates not showing up for work or shift and working doubles hours. My typical work day is includes customer service.
good,"It's an ok job, nothing special. After a while you cannot stand the place. It's a downhill spiral after you start. Always miscommunication.  Customers always complaining, associates always complaining, management always complaining."
good,its ok to work at walmart but not for long run. too much work politics and racism. specially by the  female overnight assistant manager.  so best of luck.
good,It was OK and fun.  Typical day at work come unload freight to the floor. Provide customer service. I learned how to have better communication with people.
good,"The management didn't really care for their employees. I worked overtime without getting paid for it, plus I was a minor and I wasn't supposed to work overtime anyways. But I think it was because it was a small city with no real management."
good,Staff was very easy going and fun to work with. There is lots of opportunity to learn and grow within the company. Benefits and the discount are pretty nice aswell.
good,I love my job but the customers are not very nice. As long as you can get past that part the  job itself is awesome. Always new things to learn in the pharmacy.
good,"it's okay. It gets my bills paid but I need a job that I went to school for. I learned that my customer service skills actually helped me with my attitude problems plus on top of that, I love helping other people"
good,"It is an okay place to work while in college. But, it is not okay as a long term job. This is not a career."
good,"If you are looking for experience, Walmart provides it! They are willing to train you in every department. A typical day at work is very busy so, time flies. However, it is good to have customers that remember you by name and develop friendship. The hardest part about the job is not having team players. Some co-workers may do just enough work to keep their job but, not enough to complete a task."
good,I enjoyed working with some members of the team. Some team members gave you the necessary help when needed; others were just rude.
good,"love working for walmart. handle 100 + customers daily with duties including signing up customers, retrieving customer dat, presenting relevant product information and canceling services."
good,The Walmart I worked at was always under staffed and it was hard to keep people to work there. Most Walmart's get quarterly incentives and the one I worked at would've gotten one any time soon. I like working there but it got frustrating at times when you feel like you're always doing someone else job and responsibilities.
good,"I learned a lot working for walmart while I was in college. Working helped me a lot while i was in school. It was one of my first jobs, and  I was able to work all different types of shifts."
good,"My work days always started with opening the deli. I worked with alot of great people, and for the most part enjoyed my days at work. I learned alot about myself and alot about how to handle certain situations. The management at the store were nice. The hardest part of my job was holding my tongue when things would happen that werent right or fair for all parties involved, but the most enjoyable part was helping all of my amazing customers, even the ones that seemed to be having a bad day."
good,Walmart was a decent place to work.  I worked there when my course load was at its highest and since i was still in school and not full time I was never given more opportunity to prove myself
good,"I was an assistant manager in a metro and rural area. Working for wal-mart in a rural setting was fun. In a metro setting, it was a horrible nightmare. The demands of the job were unattainable. The morale was low. The turnover was high. The hours were long. My advice is if you work at walmart, make sure you work in a rural setting."
good,I enjoyed being able to interact with customers as they walked through my line. I also liked how friendly everyone who worked there seem to me.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was nice and I would recommend it to others. Although there was a lot of favouritism that other employees noticed as well, as well as double standards for managers compared to hourly employees. But the pay was good and usually you were treated fairly and with respect."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work,  they are fair and provide adequate compensation.  they provided me with a job when I really needed one."
good,"I feel that it's weird to be happy for an entry level job that provides benefits when, in a good majority of the world, that's a given. The hours are flexible, until you put your foot down. It can be a little difficult to work with, from time to time."
good,"very busy, learn something new everyday, managers are great, co-workers enjoyable, its like one big family."
good,when I first started working for Walmart 12 yrs ago it was awesome. now its brutal no staff hardly on the floor to help customers and its dirty. I wouldn't personally recommend this job to other people I know.
good,"Long days, some rude customers, workers are somewhat friendly. Management depending on who it is isn't so bad, but needs to be more team work then self-work. Walmart isn't so bad just needs more communication. The hardest part of this job is having two different managers to tell you to do certain things because the lack of communication. The most enjoyable part is getting to interact with others."
good,"i had amazing co workers, management was amazing. everyone got along really well, everyone worked as a team. if you had a problem they would help you out and not make you feel like an idiot"
good,"Muy buen empleo porque permiten tener un horario parcial para poder seguir estudiando."
good,Walmart is a fast paced working environment that focuses their attention cost cutting and increasing efficiency. They have shifts that run 24 hours a day 7 days a week.
good,"The co-workers were very friendly and helpful with transitioning to a new place of employment. They were all pleasant to be around, and made work more enjoyable."
good,It is a pleasant place to work. Management could be better. Too much favoritism. And no one wants to listen to the team member.
good,i have learned a lot from working at Walmart from ringing people up at the cash register to doing mod resets. The co-workers that I have worked with were all great and really friendly. And the hardest part about working at Walmart was when I worked in the automotive shop in the summer when we got really busy.
good,"After we clocked in we would have a 5-10 minute report on any goals accomplished that week an discuss goals for the current week. Once report was finished, we would go to our assigned sections and begin our work. We had handheld devices that would let us know of the jobs expected of us to accomplish on that shift. Though my experience with management an other co-workers was overall good, I feel like they lacked in the importance of training. I didn't get a very good grasp on certain things like what to do if the bar codes an prices didn't match what was displayed on the shelf and other like issues. You could imagine, it made the job itself less productive, and therefore that much more difficult for me. However, I did enjoy the learning about the people who worked there for years, and gone through the changes of the store. I was overall encouraged by their hard work, and the work community they had established."
good,"* A typical day at work would be checking people out. I was a cashier. I helped customers if they couldn't find a item they needed."
good,Fast paced with friendly associates for the most part. The hardest part of the jo is a lot of turnover.  Have a lot of seasoned associates who are willing to teach.
good,"I enjoy my fellow employees and our regular customers. The atmosphere is generally fun, but like any job we have our share of bad days. some customers make for a terrible day and some rules are unclear"
good,this place is ok to work at. it just depends on the management. coworkers are usually cool but there is times you just can not trust no one.
good,while I have been with the company many years I wouldn't call It a permanent job solution. I'm full time and only get the minimum promised hours ... some weeks part time associates get more hours than I do.
good,Does not work with schedule and works you way too much. If you are late back to work even 1 minute you get points taken. Overall it is ok because it pays good.
good,"I'm guaranteed to out perform my peers."
good,Working here was alright. I felt like i had to drag myself to work though and it seemed like I was there forever. I didn't enjoy stocking at all and the staff was always in each others business.
good,Walmart has a weird way of working they give dept. for you to work in but management gets mad at you if a product that your trying to restock is full if you bring those products back to the overflow they gets mad and they put points against you but other than that its ok to work for.
good,The job wasn't hard real easy the customers can be real overbearing though other than that its not bad.
good,I unloaded trucks in Receiving. The job was not hard I picked up on their Routines pretty quickly it was just a lot of labor but it was not anything that I was not used to. Afterwards we would help stock shelves for the remainder of our shift. My experience working there was not to bad I did not really have a bad relationship with management so overall it was not to bad.
good,"Challenging and educational.  While working here I gained a good grasp of retail and merchandising.  I also get to work with some really good people.  It is a continuing learning curve.  Some suit in Bentonville comes up with a ""new system"" every week or so, and while it may work in a big store, it will not work in the smaller ones.  I work in one of smaller stores."
good,"The Color Technician position was not what I expected it to be.  It was somewhat tedious, however, my job performance was very good.  I compared color swatches for clothing."
good,The co-workers and management there were very nice. If you can deal with the cold then I would highly recommend it to anyone. It is great pay. They have a very nice break room  with a very large room full of vending machines.
good,"Come in go get a register assignment, it sends you to a register sign in and start ringing up customers, helping them out by asking how is their day and asking them did they find everything okay and helping them get carryouts if they need them."
good,"Typical day would start with your routines daily priorities."
good,Walmart's employees were pretty rude to other staff members and to the customers.  The supervisors that I had were very knowledgeable but they lacked a courteous attitude. Some of them were great at their job and very nice.
good,"Work with a smile, do the best you can do at all times. Don't call out. Stay positive. My job is a wide range of different things, all day."
good,I worked in the Jewelry department at Wal Mart and it was a really boring job that had daily meetings in the middle of shifts that were annoying
good,"Dealing with the public, brings joy to my day and allows me to enjoy going to work daily. Being able to help others make their shopping experience a good one is my duty, and I take pride in pleasing the customer."
good,"A typical day at work for me was coming in getting on a register, counting my draw, greeting customers, and taking back returns. i learned alot about different people i also learned how to managing different things. All my managers were helpful and kind towards me, helped me if i didn't understand anything. My co-workers some of them were nice then i had some that was alright. The hardest part of my job to me was nothing everything came easy. The most enjoyable part of my job was talking to the customers because you had different personalities."
good,I usually stocked the pharmacy and accessory areas overnight. The managers came around every hour or so. The job was easy and enjoyable. I was taught how to order supplies. The hardest part was managing the heavy machinery.
good,"A typical day for me insists on ensuring that everyone is working safely, as well as making sure the correct paperwork is ready for receiving high ticket merchandise as it is unloaded off of the truck nightly. I also walk the sales floor to detect any shoplifting that is going on. I also utilize the PTZ cameras to follow suspects. I pull up video for management and law enforcement. The hardest part of the job is the part that i like. I like to work and stay busy. The most enjoyable part is working with the people who make my job great."
good,The work experience was fun if you make it fun but it  was like the management did not care about us and they never wanted to listen to what we had to say or our reviews but i always made sure that i get my work done.
good,"I love the cashier job part get to meet a lot of customers and experience and fast pace. Sad, I had to leave, because of my right hand was taking too long time to heal recovery."
good,Filled orders for local produce/grocery stores. Stacked grocery items on skids to ready for shipment to grocery stores
good,The most fun place to have worked but by far the income was low. Not enough hours and not enough benefits for all. The learning experience was good but do not like the way management runs things or should I say the CEO.
good,"As a cashier I didn't really work with other employees unless they were cashiers. Day to day I would give great customer service, help customers check out and push carts once every time I worked."
good,"Has a great reward system to keep employees motivated. Worst part is dealing with the customers, but management is usually really helpful"
good,You get to stay busy during your whole shift even on slow nights there are stuff for you stay busy. Some nights you are expected to do twice what you normally do and can put stress on you.
good,My immediate manager was awesome but higher up could care less about family emergencies. All in all if you are a hard worker you will work 5 peoples jobs with little recognition
good,"A typical day as a Walmart receiving employer would include receiving shipments of merchandise requiring great effort and dedication to complete. I have learned how to operate work related equipment using a great deal of safety. The management at Walmart is good. My co-workers are friendly and I easily bond with every single member of Walmart. The hardest part of the job would include heavy lifting, when it comes to heavy merchandise. The most enjoyable part of the job would include working with friendly co-workers."
good,"Great team. Having each other's back when in need. Very busy store. Had fun. Learned new skills., helped customers. Enjoyed my work"
good,I would recommend Walmart for someone looking for s second job needed in the evening time or for someone without a college degree to be able to work your way up into mgmt for a very competitive salary
good,Un buen lugar de trabajo. Atractivo y con muchas facilidades para apender cosas nuevas.
good,"Zoning and looking after merchandise was of huge importance, at the expense of teamwork and customer care. Perhaps, this was only going to be the case since their goods are very affordable and cheap. A typical day would include zoning, interacting with customers and working on shelf placement. This job showed me how much I desire to remain in the Tech Industry. Management was always helpful also quite strict. This ensured they would get the best out of everyone for the business to flourish. Hardest part of the job was being unable to communicate with other co-workers about the company. The most enjoyable part was the discount on just about all goods."
good,"Walmart has been good to me for 14 years, but I am seeking a better opportunity outside of retail. Weekends and holidays are very stressful."
good,Handled anything that costs the company money. Managed and executed all safety procedures and MSDS. Reviewed camera footage of associates to make sure all company policies were being followed. Walked the sales floor as plain-clothes security in order to apprehend shoplifters and maintain a safe work environment. Kept in contact with law enforcement through monthly meetings to review new information. Communicated and worked with all levels of management and associates to eliminate unsafe conditions and save the company money.
good,"the company is not very loyal to its employees, management treat employees unfairly. the work environment is unbearable to some degree and they treat their elder workers worst by barely giving them any breaks"
good,"Working at Walmart had its ups and downs, but I was still able to get through the day with a smile on my face. I learned how to deal with customers in a proper matter and made them leave with a resolved issue."
good,There were no air conditioning the folks there always yelled at you made you felt like you couldn't make it and the pay was lousy
good,Get old stock out to the sales floor. Relay information for managers and takeing care to deal with the employees friendly even though they are usually upset from taking orders from someone who isn't a supervisor.
good,"Working at Walmart was very enjoyable, We were very much like a family and all got along very well. The management is fun and easy to talk to, and respectful of staff. It was very rare to have a hard day at work there, customers were great and friendly and there was very few rules."
good,The management was not the best when I worked there and the company is more focused on the benefit of their profits than some of their employees. The opportunity to move up was very judgmental in my opinion.
good,"WalMart is a great place to work at. Hours can be flexible and reasonable, Pay is also good and has great benefits."
good,The most enjoyable times is when I got see and talk to my fellow associate. I enjoyed a sense of accomplishment when my areas was neat and presentable for the customers. You work hard but when the customers gives you a compliment for your hard work it is worth it. I had a lot of goods times while I was there and also some very trying times. But if there is anything I can say positive about my experience there. I got to meet a lot of interesting people young and older
good,it was an okay job. I never felt like i belonged in this job so i worked here and wasn't too thrilled to be here. one thing I did like is that if you were full time you were guaranteed 40 hours.
good,"Started out in shipping/receiving/layout centre for 1 year then moved up to a Supplies Analyst. Fixtures, Equipment and Supplies."
good,"start my day by getting the tools and notes for the day. Getting stock out on the floor. helping customer and  assisting in sales. i ring a cash  register from time to time. help customer to find what they need, keep place clean and stock as much as I can. The hardest part is not having what the customer needs. I enjoy talking to customers"
good,I loved coming to work with my clients. We lost a client and lost hours so I would have to say they were not that stable. Other then that the company was ok. I never received a raise
good,"The most important part of the job was interacting with Customers"
good,handling dogs and cats was fun. I also like helping the groomer at times when she needed it. It eventually got to working long hours and no down time between this job and Cub Foods.
good,"the learning experience at the job was great. a lot of team work. however the high ups need to be in check, but the crew members are what hold the place together."
good,I enjoyed my time working for Walmart. Easy work! My favorite part about working there was the customers. Everyone was pretty friendly and considerate. I had no conflicts with co-workers and customers. I looked forward every day to getting to know the people who shopped there and came through my checkstand. I would definitely work for this company again.
good,Working for Walmart you have to be customer service focused. During my tenure there I learned how to read a modular and set them. I supervised for a brief period of time. My fellow associates were very friendly and respectable. The hardest part of the job was having to cover multiple departments. On a day when we don't have coverage customers become impatient while waiting. You have to be able to multitask. The best part of the job was interacting with customers.
good,walmart has advancement but employess should have better insurce for the amount of work that is put out and managers work like robots and not appreciated.
good,"Average retail experience, greeting  customers, making sure check out goes smoothly and when it doesn't there's always a customer service manager."
good,Worked in the fabric Department . Just didn't get enough hours to support myself . Friendly staff  I loved with with the customers.They eliminated the fabric dept
good,A typical day at work would begin at 2 p.m. with 7+ people pulling merchandise off of a freight truck and sort it out onto pallets. This usually takes 1.5-2.5 hours depending on the pace of the associates and the amount of freight on the truck. After we sorted the entire truck we would go to an hour lunch. After lunch we would take the freight we pulled off the truck and pull it's right place and stock the shelves. We would do this until 9:30 p.m. with two 15 minute breaks during that time. After 9:30 we would take the remaining freight and pull it out to the sales floor with pallet jacks.
good,I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart it was a very exciting place to be. The hardest part of my job was not being able to help every customer.
good,"Its a job with OK pay.   We are micromanaged a little too much.  Can get written up for just about anything.  Just keep your head down,  work, and go home.  A  job none the less.  Not a place I see a career for myself.  Too many hoops to go through to move up."
good,"A typical day would be clocking in, unloading pallets, and restocking empty shelves. On other days, some are required to build and organize feature displays, count inventory and recheck prices. You learn very quickly how to be efficient or work with others to stop tasks from piling up. The attitudes of co-workers vary widely."
good,"Took care of customers in multiple departments, floated departments when needed. Enjoyed learning different departments and learning new skills."
good,"Did not have enough workers for the amount of work that needed to be done.Once you start using the medical benefits then they use any excuse to get rid of you.When I started, it almost felt like family,but that gradually gave way year by year."
good,Walmart work schedule just did not work for my growing family. I needed a consistent regular schedule and I was not able to achieve that at walmart.
good,"Walmart is a job well suited for someone that doesn't have alot of experience working. It offers various types of jobs and work levels. However, this job is not for someone who wants to be proud of the work they accomplish as tasks usually run into the next without any sense of completion."
good,That place is best when it is working with the public and meeting new people.that you becomes friends with the managers are OK but not the best managers that i meet. The customers is the best part of my job there.
good,"You come in to co workers and managers telling you that they where not able to restock your shelves because that were moved some place else or they didn't know where the items go, or the managers saying we didn't have time to do your department so this is what we left you with."
good,I didn't enjoy this job as much as my other jobs. There is always ups and downs in a job. I would say the customers were one of the things I really enjoyed here. Most of the customers were very polite and I learned a lot about some of the customers that came in regularly. The management would try to make everything go really good even though sometimes it wouldn't. I learned very good customer service here.
good,"- Over worked and isolated "
good,"You clock in whenever you worked ,then you go be a cashier then you get a break and come back to work and stand there till you are done."
good,Made good long lasting friendships.  Enjoyed the work as an overnight stocker.  Good group of people.  Good benefits and flexible scheduling.
good,Fast pace which I loved keeping busy and meeting a lot of different kinds of people. Never a dull moment! I just didn't like how I was able to spend time with my family as they needed.
good,My typical work day at Walmart consisted of stocking and cleaning the shelves at night time. I had very nice and helpful co-workers who made my job easier to learn.
good,Need to treat their employee's better. Too many chiefs above the Indians. Needs to make sure all are on the same page on what needs to be done.
good,Walmart isn't as busy as you would think it would be. most of your shift is spend folding clothing tables. day really drags on.
good,"It's hard to expect much from corporations as large as Wal-Mart in places as small as Lacey. The family-oriented employee aspect was a big bonus as to the atmosphere of working there, and a sense of together-ness was the best part of showing up for work."
good,"I liked working at Walmart except for the customers that get rude with me over something I can't control. I liked the hours, and the management. Co-workers aren't bad either if you can learn to not mix personal life with work life."
good,the company is making several changes im not sure if its to benefit me as the employee customers or the company. it has been kind of intense with trying to adjust to all the changes.
good,My co worker are great to work with.  What I have learned there is how to multi-task at a fast pace.  The hardest part is maintaining production percentage.
good,this was actually a seasonal job the time was very short but really enjoyed working there most of the time I was a cashier don't have much to say about the job because I was only there for a short period of time
good,fun fast pace job with great co-workers to be with. day goes by so quick because you are constantly moving. overall its a great thing to work as
good,"As a cashier, I had to scan and bag the customers items. Often times the customers had 50+ items and would sometime became impatient and overly rude. HIGH STRESS"
good,A goood enviroment were you can grow and be part of a team also has a lot of oppunity to be a part of a comany. The benefits are great depending on your position
good,"As the overnight support manager my crew was responsible for stocking the incoming freight and cleaning the store before it opened in the morning.  I gained great respect for the hard working employees that kept the large store running at minimal wages and much disconnect between their shift and management.  Being a very large company I saw how little authority management had even within their own store.  The corporate office micromanaged every aspect of the store making it hard to meet employee's needs or help them advance.  There are many hard working individuals in the store I worked at that I respect and applaud for their work ethics.  They helped  me learn how to have pride in everything I do, no matter how small the action seems."
good,when I first started working there it was pretty hard but the last couple of weeks have been ok. I'm in a new department and its way less stressful. I've learned a lot from this company I feel if I went to another retail store I would be productive. Management sucks they don't set realistic expectations for there employees their isn't enough staff to finish the job so at the end of the shift the work is never done. My co workers are ok I try not form personal relations at work. The hardest part is not being able to get all our work done. The most enjoyable part of this job is getting paid.
good,nice company to work for. management was well. store manager was very professional and easy to work amongst. I enjoyed working for the company
good,Overall working here was a fun experience.  Employees are fun to work with and very understand staff. I enjoyed working there.
good,"productive and unreasonable workload for one person"
good,"I learned how to communicate with customers as well as co-workers."
good,"Working at walmart taught me alot , how to be strong careful and generous to all customers nomatter what they do or say. Set a good example to other workers."
good,"A typical day at work would involve working a assembly line for multiple hours on foot"
good,"While working there, I had very good relationships with my fellow associates and was happy to work there. However, I was terminated for being absent due to illness (diabetes). Working here with diabetes was a very big challenge."
good,A typical day for me was working in the apparel dept. by myself most of the time. They just need better management skills I think.
good,"Take me back a few years to the approach of our trade agreements with China. What was the thinking at the time that we went into those trade agreements? What was the rationale for the trade agreements? What did we expect, and what was the mood here in Washington?"
good,"Everyday at work my goal is to satisfy my customers at a higher level than i have done before. Working with the company i've learned that there are dialy challanges, but also a solution to every problem that arises. Management can be good mentors, when looking into taking your career higher within the company. I love taking on all daily challanges that come with my job, and sharing my knowledge with fellow co-workers."
good,"The management at my Walmart is terrible they really dont take note of how hard you work for them, however other then that i love the people i work and its a fun all around"
good,"hard work but can be enjoyable, it can be a good place to work, i learned about phones, my co worker i become friends with some of them, the hardest part of the day  was when someone would be upset and you cant do much to help them out, the most enjoyable part of my day was talking and meeting new people"
good,Somewhat boring. moving clothes around all the time. Can get annoying at times. really heavy. booooring.
good,Working at Wal-Mart was like working at any other retail sales job. The coworkers at Wal-mart are friendly and sociable. The management could have been a bit better but over all adequate.
good,"I found this environment to be focused on generating an entertainment mentality geared toward the client.This is their version of customer service.They are very flexible with those who are starting over ,or may not be at the top of the group in competitive mentality. They have done an immense amount in giving back to their local community,and their benefits are associate friendly.The store I was at is definitely the place for fast learners,and is designed so that associates are encouraged to teach each other the ropes."
good,great job everyone was nice I was young helped me pay for college. did not stay long. management was laid back and relaxed
good,"Wal-Mart was a great company.   I enjoyed my job and the people I worked with, but in the last few years they have come to expect more and more out of us and do not give us the tools we need to complete our duties.  There is not great manager-associate relations."
good,Loved working with the public. i did enjoy working with the management they were every nice and accommodating. my co-workers where very nice and caring.
good,"Hardest part of the job was the amount of work dealing in Softlines"
good,"The associates are the foundation of Wal-mart, they are the ones who interact with customers, stock shelves, and make sure the store is clean. That being said, as long as you have a great team Wal-mart is an excellent place of employment."
good,"Clock in go Hit the floors looking for anything that ain't right like products in other places than where they would usually be.  Mostly happy there times when everybody was having a off day but they kept on pushing an smiling while helping  customers.  Was making sure you had all your elements an typing the cases in properly.  "
good,"1st shift produce associate: "
good,Management is contradictory sometimes to one another. I learned how to multitask very well in this environment and time management skills.
good,Es una cadena de super mercados  tiene buen ambiente  para trabajar
good,"Fairly friendly work environment, somewhat lacking in leadership. Also lacking in communication. Job security was pretty good, and lots of hiring up within the company."
good,great company to work for while going to school. The only bad thing was having to clock out for an hour lunch break which ment you only got paid for 7 hours of work.
good,"baking, how make cookies and cakes and cupcakes, management has lack of communication, hardest part is lack of set schedule, most enjoyable part is baking cookies and decorating cakes"
good,Its a big project with tons of contractors and vendors. No best work culture one can see there. But cheapest place to save money.
good,"It's okay if you are a people person. Fast pace, but not enough pay. You learn to be patient while working here. It's not a job I would make into a career."
good,Company has changed considerably over the years. Management's engagement with employees is minimal. Employees don't feel valued.  Open door policy is non-existent.
good,its an okay place to work I reckon. It can be a great family oriented place to work but the pay is generally pretty low and hard to get full time hours. cutbacks in non season times can leave u looking for work or more hours somewhere else.
good,"Pour un travail étudiant, la disponibilité des horaires de l'entreprise permettent d'avoir un revenu stable avec un minimum d'heure et d'étudier lors de l'école."
good,"El ambiente laboral en Grupo Walmart es agradable, eh aprendido a ser más observadora y cuidadosa en cuestiones diversas como estar alerta de posibles sustracciones de mercancía, siento que mi trabajo no es complejo, me gusta ser muy activa y atenta con los demás ya que eso crea un buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,Not a bad place to work for minimum wage. I could've run the whole store by myself and I was like 16 when I worked there so its a simple job.
good,Walmart tries. It's not great. Their corporate culture is a nightmare. The best and brightest are not rewarded.
good,I started as a cashier and moved to stocking to be able to make more money. I worked over night. I had to stop working because of needing to help with my special needs grandson.
good,it was a fun place to work for at times.. but the management needed a lot of work.There was very little communication with the managers
good,"my day at work was always busy. "
good,This job is very busy and you meet various people everyday. I would recommend this job to people who need extra money but not as a priority job to pay bills.
good,"There is really no typical days as everyday you are assigned a different department to work.  There is nothing really hard about this job at all, you do go-backs, department sweeps, retrieve department good from sorters and assist customers when asked."
good,"I worked evenings.  I was a csm where I ran the front end.  I handled the customers as well as the cashiers.  "
good,I loved my job! Until they found out I worked at Wal-Mart and Family dollar and I Didn't know they were in competition. So they fired me.
good,Good place to work at. Good hours. Everybody is very friendly. After 3 months of working there you get a discount card. Awesome breaks 2 15 minute breaks and 1 hour break. Bad with the healthcare although you may work full time hours to qualify for insurance or any benefits you must be considered a full time employee.
good,It was a bad experience because no one now want a master card having very little benefits. Your manager will be pushy on you for his target.
good,"People that work there are very nice to you, especially management. They do care, but there are not a lot of workers in most Wal-Mart environments that do make it tough to work there."
good,the hardest part of the job at Walmart is dealing with lazy co-workers. when everyone is determined and ready to work you can get a lot done.
good,"its an ok place to work, and get to know people, learning how to correctly use the registers and computers at Walmart, the other equipment was harder to learn though"
good,Still fairly new to the company. Training was severely disorganized and management seems to disconnect from the front end and gas station.
good,I was a cashier and CSM at Wal-Mart I helped check out customer and count down tills at night I would stock the shelves when needed and I would help the other cashiers with their tills. I would also make sure the front of the store was clean when I left at night.
good,"walmart seems like a great place to work, until you miss a day at work for being sick and they still want you to come in. walmar5t doesn't care about you being sick. if you are alive they want you at work even if it may kill you. Had an incident were items fell on me and had to go to the er. was told my er bill would be paid but i got a biol in the mail and my bill was never paid. not to mention they put you as part time so they wont have to give you benefits. they will cut hours and not have help when its needed, other than that walmart is a great place to work. Good Luck!"
good,"A Typical day at this job  meant cleaning, customer service, and production. I had no skill in the area hired for, so all of my training came from the job, Management is clear about what they want and expect to see that no matter what. The hardest part of the job is being expected to do it all even when the staff is short. The most fun times happened when we worked as a team."
good,I loved working for Walmart but some things could be better I learned a lot about how specific customers were about how they like there food bagged I'm the same way.
good,Walmart have a lots of up and down u dont get alot of hour on weekend crew.U do a lot of climbing bending  lifting The break and lunch not long .The supervisor r great and coworker r very nice
good,"overall good company, diverse, depending on your management if your working experience will be a good one. Hardest part of the job is when areas are under staffed. Enjoyable part of job is when you put a smile on a customers face and when you are recognized by your hard work."
good,"Falta de motivação para os funcionários, alguns funcionários precisando de qualificações melhores."
good,Ability to improve customers shopping experience. Clean well displayed product area. Kept fully stocked. Training on product knowledge. Ability to help customers find and gain help with their needs in a friendly environment.
good,Great place to work. Co-workers were great. Management spent most of their time finding ways to justify their existence.
good,"As long as you work hard you will always have the opportunity to be employed at Walmart. Though it is a huge company, they do not treat you as though you are expendable. Members of management, teams, and staff all work together to make the employees feel that their work is valued at the end of day. A typical day at work always included me leading my team through the night is completing the set of work handed to us. I was great at delegating tasks, organizing, and helping to keep my team members on task; assisting when needed. I worked with this company for four years and I would say the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting such a diverse range of people from co-workers, to customers. It is a great place to work and grow."
good,"Typical day is 10 to 15 hours a day"
good,"I had morning shifts so I enjoyed entering and leaving early from 8am to 5pm. Just what really sucks are the customers, Walmart has like the worst customers. I was always friendly and kind and regardless, they would always treat you horrible. I liked my managers and the job itself is easy and doable."
good,"Experience working with Puppet Enterprise and Puppet Open Source. Installed, configured, upgraded and managed Puppet Master, Agents & Databases. Integration of Puppet with Apache and Passenger."
good,It is a great company to work for. There are always someone to help you when needed. Awesome co-workers and customers. Learn something new everyday.
good,I learned alot from helping customer to stocking and cleaning with this company the only thing i could say bad is the management and schedulinng
good,"Walmart's a pretty okay place to work if you absolutely need a job, no matter what. When I hired on, training was almost a non-event, so I basically learned everything over a couple months. Nowadays, they have a new Pathways program, but I have not experienced it firsthand."
good,"The most enjoyable part bout this job is the co workers and mangers, on a regular day that turn a bad day to a good by making you laugh."
good,The experience working at Walmart has its ups and down. The people are also add a roller coaster effect to your work experience.
good,I like helping people with their tax returns and giving advice for the next years taxes and how they can get a better refund legally.
good,"Worked 6 to 8 hour shifts."
good,Most of my co-workers are kind and very friendly to work with.The enjoyable part working here is helping out the customers and getting to interact with other people
good,"Bom aprendizado. Ambiente tranquilo com acessos bons."
good,Walmart has been very good to me but my resent change in my life has made it to were the schedule i have is no longer working for me. so Im currently looking for another career.
good,"Brand new store with to small  backroom for incoming freight, shelves may be empty because what I ordered cant be found. The customers where fine, but I had to many departments to handle and assist customers. Most of the co workers are spread to thin."
good,Not the best job. Treated employees shabbily and without regard to their needs. STufff things whatever why wy why lkad;lkasf;lsdjf;laskdv;zxlckvaoivj;lvkam;
good,Not a place to work as a career.  I thank them for the opportunity but I left to pursue a career in the medical field. Thank you for the opportunity.
good,At the time I had this job there was a lot of health problems with my wife. I had to take time off in order to get her where she needed to be. the company was less than understanding and I was fired for it.
good,"long hours 10h shift on days you work"
good,The work and helping customers is great. Need better benefits and pay more reward for good work shouln not be based on sales
good,"Typical day at Wal-mart is quite a stressful or light one, depending on management rotation. Wal-mart usually starts with clocking in, saying hello to your fellow associates, then getting to work. Pulling pallets, Working freight, and unloading the truck. It's mostly routine days with the same objective. Clear the dance floor (Receiving) and prepare to unload the truck. My specific team, Cap 2, does a little of everything in the store. Work Freight, unload the truck, assist customers on the sales floor, and even get on registers to do a little cashiering. We even go outside to push carts when needed. I learned at work is to do what you can. Do your best every second of the day. Especially at my store specifically. Management changed almost completely within a small time frame. About 3 months we lost about four to seven managers and got them replaced within that time. It was....an adjustment. Management before the new managers was good. Laid back, asked us to assist them, and also offered us overtime and such when they was really short handed. An honest way to keep everyone on the clock who wanted to work. When new management hit, everything became...tighter for the lack of a better word. Strict hours, and the work ethics became scattered. Almost like everything fell apart briefly before slowly being built back up. It was quite an experience, though I learned to adapt to the job and keep being positive In the work place, so everyone can stay happy and motivated. My co-workers are the best part of the job. ""Teamwork makes the Dream work"". That was our teams motto, and we stuck"
good,"Tienen represaría al trabajador, sobre explotacion, el trabajo segun es familiar y un buen ambiente de trabajo, cuando en realidad no es asi, solo buscan el beneficio para la empresa"
good,"Aprendí a trabajar en equipo, colocar llantas y baterias a automoviles."
good,"On an average day, I zoned, stocked, checked prices built shelves, end caps, and displays. Sometimes I couldn't get everything I needed to get done due to them calling me to be on the registers. I learned to be patient with very bad mannered people both employees and costumers. I learned how to mix paint, change prices, pick and stock items. Some of the management was very understanding and very helpful with my life outside of work. Their Associates were kind and helped me through many tasks teaching me. They even helped through many problems outside of work like while I was in training as a Cashier my house burnt down. The hardest part was getting past my social anxiety and working with everyone. The most enjoyable were getting through the anxiety while meeting new people, and making new friends."
good,"i worked for walmart twice, both were considered temperary because i was hired over the christmas rush. i worked in electronics, jewlery, as well as front and mall cashes. its a fun place to work"
good,i stock groceries and i unload truck i help customer find what they are looking for and i made friends with a few people i work with
good,I unload trucks and stock grocery i made a few friends and the hardest part of the job was not messing up
good,"it's not minimum wage, and you get to work in the AC. It's a pretty laid back place and you can meet new people. As a cashier, it's not too bad. It's a pretty easy job, you just have to be able to handle the repetitive motion."
good,"It was a decent place to try to cut your teeth and get used to the idea of a ""real job"".  The co-workers were generally kind and easy to get along with."
good,"overwork and under paid, management was poor and not professional , I feel like it is all in who you know, management would log onto the phones and you would do the job"
good,ive already done one of theses so it was good good pay friendly people and I alwayss had 40 hours a week it was a lot of work but I got paid 11 dollars a hour so I was okay.
good,"Walmart is by the book only when it benefits the company for the time being. At times, Walmart would NOT be by the book if they feel like an exception can be made. Everything about Walmart is personal. Whatever THAT store's management team feels, is how the day, week, month, and/or year would go by."
good,i really enjoyed working for this employer i looked forward to coming in to work every night and the pace of work was steady
good,"Todos los días en el trabajo aunque son casi las mismas actividades son totalmente diferentes, es una empresa muy dinámica y asi se desarrollas las actividades diarias, se aprenden muchas cosas desde como tratar con los empleados en su diferentes gamas asi como con los clientes, te vuelves muy detallista y analitica para generar ventas principalmente."
good,"A typical day at work would be us working hard even though we was short workers everyday. I learned hard work ethic, even if it was difficult some days. The management just didn't know how to cooperate with co-workers. The hardest part of the job was unloading trucks with over 3000 pieces with just three people. The most enjoyable part was stocking shelves at night."
good,"Started with MWR as a maid was not a vary good one. Then went on to be a fix it person that time was the best had a great boss, then was transferred to another crew it had tis good days and bad"
good,"Ha sido una buena experiencia, mas no enriquecedora. No es una empresa que se destaque como formadora de capital humano."
good,Seasonal Position - wasn't good / bad. It was work to get extra money for my son for the holidays when I was in another low paying job / temp work. (This was a second job to bring in extra money for my son since my husband is diabled and I'm the only bread winner.)
good,It was a good job for someone who is going to school or retired. It has the potential for someone to make a career out of but it won't be an easy step. Depending in the management at the specific store the hours can be stable.
good,"Being a cashier at Walmart has given me the opportunity to meet and interact with a lot of people.  I enjoy serving the public, getting to know customers, and meeting new people.  I also love the people I work with. "
good,my first job after 18. you can advance quickly but I can be stressful. I live my experience there. management team was terrible though.
good,"I have learn great customer service how to greet people when walking in the store, taking out the merchandise with the pallet jacks and restocking all my departments double check them everything is all into is place."
good,I enjoyed working there. the people where nice and I made some good friends there.  The work days were long and drawn out but at the end of the day it was worth it.
good,"I can't speak on other Walmart's but I can say that a typical day at my old location is a 65% chance their will be order. "
good,"I enjoyed Working with the company, fast pasted and friendly.  I worked as a cashier and in customer service with this company. Work was fun because you dealt with different people everyday and you got experience different personalities."
good,Come in clock in go straight to a regester  and help costermers all day. I did learn alot about how the company thinks i agree with few things but it is not my company to run tho one day i  hope too run my own buisiness .
good,"I love what I do, I first get to work I go to my designated post read my emails and start my roving duties which do my checks and walk through around the building."
good,"Typically an opening shift requires removing all deli items that are out of date, refilling with freshly made sandwiches, salads, wraps, & pinwheels. Cooking rotisserie chicken & hot case food such as wing dings , potato wedges , cheese sticks, etc. Maintaining a clean work environment is important. Also make sure customers are taking care of. Slice meat & cheese. "
good,"Good place to get what ever retail job skill you looking for, to get to a better paying job somewhere else. Hard work, working with good people, dealing with customer, and managers"
good,At Walmart we strive to bring excellent customer service and take care of our associates as well as our profit line. It is a very challenging work environment.
good,"depending on the location of the store walmart can be an enjoyable place to work."
good,My day would start after I had gotten out of sports practice in High School I would drive to arrive at work from 6- 10 pm.  My duties would consist of providing customer assistance area clean up count money cashier returns and sales invoicing and close down procedures fro the end of the night.
good,fast and friendly environment. learned how to cashed checks and make money orders and enjoyed answering the phones. learned about items customers bought and where items were in the store.
good,"Great for entry into the work force, like Mcdonalds. Not a place I would work for a long time unless advanced to a good paying position."
good,"I was over worked and treated badly. My manager was not a good one and every time i needed her she acted like i was bothering her and as if it wasn't her job to help me. She would act as if she was too good for me. I had to leave the job as soon as i could, she made me feel belittled. The job was not fun, or exciting. This job made me feel miserable."
good,"Loved the customer service side of this, and the co-workers. Sadly Walmart is not a company that truly cares about its employees, however management and co-workers make all the difference and fortunately i had a wonderful experience with them. "
good,"Very poor support by managers and work environment could be cleaner and safer, they pride of safety first but not all that way it seems, had a pre injury and it was effecting my work performance and they let me go cause I was not there for more then 30 days."
good,The production demand on the individual can be stressful due to the different freight handled on a daily basis. No adjustments made to production with difficulty of freight. Very physically demanding work. Pay is decent .
good,Working at Walmart wasn't all that bad. I had a smile on my face everyday and customers enjoyed coming through my line as I quickly moved and kept conversation at the same time.
good,It was a good place to work. I liked all my coworkers. I couldn't keep the job because I found a better job opportunity in saman insurance company
good,I had to resign when they could not work with my college school schedule. I needed some mornings and night off and I was assured that they could work with my school schedule.
good,"insuring that each customer leaves happily is my every day duty at Walmart, along with keep each line at a fast but friendly paste."
good,"At both Wal-Mart locations that I worked at the management wasn't all that great. Wal-Mart is supposed to put the associates first, but I didn't feel valued as much as they talk it up to be. Plus, overhead in management was very disorganized."
good,I really loved my job at wal-mart. it was something I looked forward to doing I did have one co- worker that like to bother me while I was doing my job and that made my job hard. the most enjoyable thing I liked about it was it was challeging .
good,"It was less social in Walmart. Highly Demanding, But The Pay Was Good. It was a very fast paste working enviornemt with good benefits"
good,"Normalmente no es pesado el trabajo, pero cuando se junta si te puede generar mucho estres."
good,"It was a safe environment, clean most of the time, I learned how to do invoices, make orders, management is very poor, they need better training/trainers for associates and managers, the job was very easy for the most part, customers were always nice."
good,I've been there for a little while now and I have experienced four different store managers. They all come on board with there own ways of doing things. which isn't always favored by the working force.
good,A lot organizing needed within the company. New management is definitely needed. The typical day at work was very stressful but with the co-workers being as friendly and polite as they are made work much easier.
good,A typical day at wal-mart would include working your department and others. Working at Wal-Mart is not very challenging but can be at times because the lack of employees. The hardest part of working at Wal-Mart is balancing life.
good,its an OK job but if you are a person who does not want to go the extra mile. i would not recommend it for you because it will test you and you will grow.
good,Learned a lot about the business . was able to become certified in power lifting equipment and later certified others to use the power lifting equipment. lots of room for growth
good,"This job will suck the life out of you, no matter how good of a worker you are or how positive you try to be. They ""save money and live better"" by making one person do the work of 3. The only time management ever speaks to you is to ask you to do something, so as soon as they greet you, you think, ""What do you want?"" Nothing you do is ever good enough and no one ever says good job, they just pile more work on you. Paid holidays have been taken away as well as annual raises."
good,"I loved to work with the people, so much to learn. Everyone worked to help what needed to get done. also learned that treat others the way you want to get treated"
good,"Overall not a terrible place to work but specifically at my store the Management was terrible, didn't listen, and one of the more Sadistic Co-Managers literally gets a thrill out of firing employees and thanks to my falling Ill I became a victim of this too, but the management was vindictive and never believed for once that the employee could have good ideas and never gave me a chance to defend myself. It turns out that I was Hypoglycemic and Work was actually killing me. But when I would slow down on the job and suffer they would be right there whipping me and lecturing me. Rumors run rampant in such a large environment which I believe ultimately led to my downfall. It was when rumor that I did not do any of my actually work and was just lazy spread that I noticed Management so far down my back and knew I was being discriminately judged. Unfortunately I can't say that was the only spreading rumor, I heard gossip everyday and about everyone. Overall I would say the environment felt like High-school all over again."
good,"I have many different experience at walmart they are all well handled working customer service my job is simply to satisfy my customer, the object is to keep my customer happy and willing to come back for another great experience. A typical day at work is usually customers in a hurry who either want to make a payment, receive money, or make a return they are usually angry until we provide our great customer service coming up with different ways to help our customers. Ive learner so much working customer service  but one of the most important things ive learned is to let the customer know you are concerned and your there to help. Even though co-workers and management are usually not on the same page I have to stay focused and do my part. The hardest part of the job is to make sure every co-worker is willing to be a team player. The most enjoyable part is getting to meet new people and being able to satisfy the customer at all cost."
good,"I learned how to be calm when dealing with customers an how to help them with whatever they needed when they needed it. if i di not know the answer to their question, i directed them to my supervisor who was able to answer their question."
good,"Th e job was always busy and up beat,I've learned how to work independently and quickly.Always standing and cleaning .dedicated yo serving the customers"
good,"I have learned that there is a lot of possibility for career opportunities, always room to move up in the company. Management was very professional and courteous to other workers, I have met some very nice people working for Walmart."
good,The job entails a lot of organizing knowing your merchandise in your area.Keeping in stock is the most important part in your area.Great customer service is a must. Every day there was something new the company rolled out or changes that you  had to implement. It was a joy of meeting new and different people every day. you had great workers that helped make your job easier. Some good managers that would guide you in making good decisions.In all the job taught me a lot on how to run a business and the demands of great customer satisfaction.
good,"The job always brought something new each day. "
good,"Being in various departments depending on where assistance was needed. I have learned how to handle various situations with a variety of people in a very busy atmosphere and because of this I now have 3 years of  retail experience. I had a good management team they really showed me that they appreciated me.My co-workers were some of the best people in the world we worked together as a team is supposed to. The hardest part of the job was when the demand for you as a sales associate is so big and its not enough team members to get the job done.The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help my customers, helping them uplifted my day."
good,Walmart is a good company. But certain management team needs work. The management was horrible didn't talk with other people and seem to always talk down to them. CSM were almost the same but that were some that didn't. There were some that helped and got to know as a person
good,"trabalha em equipe"
good,good as a summer job or students. high expectations from management regarding the master card signups. customers tend to take frustrations out on cashiers
good,I loved working hear but I had to take a two week leave for a death in the family out of state and when I returned I had no job. I would love to apply again.
good,"Walmart was a great place to work. There were plenty of ways to earn more money. The only downfall is that the hours were too flexible and it became a inconvenience for me. I am looking for a something more consistent, (9-5 M-F)"
good,"Management needs alot of improvement. but the hours were great, the pay is a lot better than most places. and the work environment can also use some improvement as well"
good,Walmart gets mixed reviews from most people but i had a great experience there.  Management does a lot of motivate their associates.
good,this job is great for a first job you learn a lot of basic skills management was ok but the co-workers were always there and made the team work.
good,I enjoy working at walmart easy to take off for vacation etc. Pretty easy job . I like the job.... Apply......... Easy fun job
good,llegar con entusiasmo y aplicando los conocimientos que uno a adquirido en los trabajos y con la dispocision de aprender mas
good,people are productive and stay on task for the most part. some nights are high labor intensive and others can be more tedious smaller jobs.
good,I believe that this company is not a company that focuses on the employees and how they are the reason customers come to shop there. This company focuses on themselves and the amount of money that they bring in.
good,I liked working for Island the food is great and the restaurants are clean and well cared for. Islands has set a standard in the food industry.
good,"The company gave me a wonderful opportunity to begin my career in Information Technology, but immediate managers seemed to look down on me due to having no degree even though my job performance was more than others possessing such degrees and certifications."
good,"Good first start"
good,I would arrive at work earlier than required start time so that I could walk the store to get an idea of what work is to be done that evening. I would then check schedule to see who is working with me that evening. I would then talk to management to talk over the evenings plans. I would delegate our maintenance work between myself and my team members and then start our shift. Throughout the shift I would stop my maintenance job to check on team members to see if all are on schedule or if they require any help to complete their tasks. At the end of my shifts I would write a summary of shift's completed tasks.
good,"Wal-Mart is a good place to work for younger people who do not have the responsiblity of raising a family."
good,Very unorganized and the management were unwilling ti work with my school schedule because they did  not respect the times that I was unavailable due to my class schedule
good,"Lots of customer interaction, Learned How to maintain Customer Satisfaction as well as maintain tidiness and organization of work station"
good,I liked working for walmart but the schedules were crazy and I honestly believe that you cant have much going on in life if you work there. The customers were great and I loved to work.
good,It is mostly busy around noon to 3pm on weekends and weekdays.  You work with many people and also communicate with different customers each day.
good,"you would learn the different products and where the big variety of groceries or goods would be placed in the store, the hardest part of the day would be when you could find a item or didn't know where it was to assist your customer the best part was at the end of the shift"
good,Working at Walmart was not hard because my personality was outgoing.  I stock merchandise on shelves and help customers when they need assistance.  I checked customers out when they finish shopping.  I enjoyed my schedule because I was off on the weekend.
good,working here in the beginning was great I worked as a IMS/stock clerk in the back. I usually count all the merchandise throughout my day make goals on how accurate I was. When I got pregnant the told me I had to work as a cashier since they are liable if I got hurt. I got sent to the front and they had so many cashiers but not a lot of customers on certain days we would stand and just wait for customers. I like to move around and just standing waiting or doing things other than what I liked didn't have me feel happy with my job. When I was told by my Dr. that I can sit every so often. Even with the Dr. note there was still drama and jealousy because I sat down certain times. After I went on maternity leave I decided to stay home.
good,this place was full of bull and the manager was smelling theyself to much didn't want hear they employees.but I was cool job either then that I couldn't be mad
good,"Decent job requires alot of energy"
good,"Loved being around other people, making friends, and helping people. Liked being at work and having something to do everyday. Had fun working with my co-workers."
good,Well I work in electronics and my co-workers and I constantly deal with customer service. We assist customers the best way we possibly can each day. I work with a great team and we all learn things everyday. We receive great satisfaction when we help a customer with their shopping but it's very hard when you have customers that aren't satisfied with the products we sell or use to sell. Besides all of that we have wonderful managers to help us associates out!!
good,"Its a good company to work for benefits and medical, but I don't like they way they treat long term seniorities those who worked over 10years. I had to step down being a Department Manager in Sporting Goods, they treat Department Managers bad.."
good,"Customer Service, Cash Handling, Multi-line phone system, Basic Office Equipment, Stocking, Zoning, Build Displays for products, Maintain Inventory, Pricing, Security and Safety of area."
good,Great place to gather experience in a call center for collection fun place ok pay. Co worker and management are fun and respectful ad good place to learn and grow.
good,like to help customers and learn new things helped where ever they needed help at assisted in merchandising by setting up visually appealing displays
good,"Worked her for awhile as a cashier. It is nice as times, but they are usually short staffed.  Management isn't too bad at times."
good,"Wal-Mart is not all that bad,  the work is tiring but some days its okay."
good,excelente empresa da muitas oportunidades de crescimento.
good,"A typical day started with usually oil changes, I didn't really learn much about cars working there but i did learn about Torque specs for each car and I can now remember most of them by memory now. Management its hectic because you have store,Main, Bay ,general managers all telling you different things. My Co workers we're the best i ever had at any store. the hardest part of my job was dealing with Irate customers. the most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know new people"
good,"shifting items on shelves."
good,I enjoyed the customer interactions. I enjoyed the job. Pay and benefits were a bonus. This was my first job fresh out of high school so I've matured since then and am thankful for the chance to have worked there.
good,"Working for Walmart was a learning experience. It taught me a lot about time management skills, priorities, interacting with a variety of people and the importance of having organizational skills."
good,Customer Service is a number one goal. I enjoyed the fast pace of the work. There is always something to do you can always transfer to different departments and learn new things.
good,Working overnight for a couple years I was able to create a fun scene with the other employers and stay busy everyday.  Working busy makes the evening shift go quickly and being able to create friendships also helps in the working field.
good,HR Dept. was face paced..handled intake of new employees. Vetting process..Giving personality tests for placement vetting.
good,"Easy to go above and beyond expectations, as they set the bar pretty low. Easy to get promotions if you want them, especially to low-level management. If you work hard and like your job, this can be a great place. Management can be very forgiving, if you are worth it."
good,all in all Walmart is a good place to work. Management is fair for the most part. I enjoy working with my co-workers. We always manage to have a good night at work regardless of how the night starts. Hardest part of the job is not letting 1 supervisor or manager burst your bubble. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with friendly people who make the job fun
good,"The overall job is enjoyable. I enjoyed the fact that is was a hands on type of job, you got to meet lots of different types of people. the best part of the job was seeing the smiles on your patients faces when you have help them and made the process so much easier for them. The thing I didn't enjoy about the company was that their policies and procedures changed almost weekly. You are held at a level of accountability that doesn't match the job."
good,Overall it was a good part time summer job because of the pay but the company or management does not work with college athletes so it was not that beneficial.
good,"like the workplace environment love the work i was doing, also love to get to interact with the customers helping them on the shopping experience."
good,"A day at work is fun, I learned how to pierce ears, my co workers were very creative,hardest part was piercing baby ears,the most fun part was assisting customers."
good,"Having to deal with all types of emotions, characters and individuals. Truly a position for those that are not easily offended."
good,"This job is good for people who do not mind working various hours. I liked the job and the benefits that it entailed. I wish the ""leaders"" would have actually lead and taught instead of bossing and delegating."
good,"Never got customers s needs addressed, had to wait long periods of time for tops of liquor bottles to be removed, coupons, terminals always malfunctioning."
good,"As a CAP Team II associate, I would help set up the receiving room so that we could begin the process of separating all the merchandise that was coming off the truck.  I enjoyed the physical aspect of the job, as it required me to use muscle to lift and move heavy items off the belt, including cat litter and canned goods.  I learned how to use the Telzon (scanner) for various activities, such as logging the arrival of high ticket items or the arrival of merchandise that customers had acquired through site-to-store.  I was also in the middle of learning how to navigate and maneuver the electric pallet jack.  It was not difficult to learn, however, making it move the way you wanted it to didn't always work out. "
good,"Employees are friendly and easy to get along with, and most managers are pretty easygoing, but my experience with this place in regard to the workload was very intense. There were several different occasions where I was performing three or more tasks at once (i.e. customer service while dragging loads of carts, while managers were calling for spill cleanups and washroom cleanups, etc,)."
good,Most times i was by myself. Sometimes i had alot of rude customers and the management was all so great. One thing i took for working at Value and Variety is communication skills interacting with the customers.
good,I've been with Wal-Mart through my college years. This has been a great way to either pick up or drop hours depending on my class schedule.
good,The managers was rude and they rarely checked up on you. My co workers was no help they would leave whenever they wanted to and nobody would know because no one cared to check.
good,"Cheap products, often understaffed, co-workers are nice but fairly unintelligent, learned the importance of higher education, management was fine"
good,"unorganized and very stressful"
good,Typical day of work included pulling orders for 8-14 hours a day in a -20 degree freezer. Had great co-workers that made non enjoyable work conditions (-20 degree freezer) much more enjoyable. Learned to be more competitive. Hardest part of the job was definitely the toll it took on your body. Management could have been better by being more understanding when people were injured from going above and beyond the day before.
good,"Working at Mc Donald's I have experience a Nice staff, good Management, Great Job and a Fun environment. Walmart was on of my first jobs and I had a lot of fun here."
good,"a typical day at walmart started out always being understaffed, so had to double up task on the hard workers. you learn quick who you can count on to get the job done and who is only there for a paycheck. i learned a lot about stocking, how to build features, running power equipment,how to order freight, using the telezon (hand scanner) how to uload trucks and check in vendors. for the most part, i had good managers when they were able to do their job. the hardest part of the job was being able to keep the good hard workers because they kept getting more added to them daily to pick up the slack of the non workers. the most enjoyable part of the job was filling accomplished at the end of the shift knowing i had done my best and completed all my task and was able to move on and help out elsewhere."
good,"A typical day was doing tasks that a Release Manager does, setting up meeting and following up on issues and making calls for the current and next release cycles."
good,"Customers make this job, not management. The revolving door of managers makes this job incredibly difficult to put up with depending on where you work."
good,To obtain a human resources management position where i can effectively utilize my expertise in employee relations and staff recruitment.
good,"This is the Walmart where careers go to die. They send people there to try and fix the store which in turn causes the store to fall apart so the fire that person then bring someone else in to fix the store, rinse and repeat."
good,Great place to work with a lot of potential to move up in the company. Can be very stressful at times but that comes along with working in retail. Very fast paced.
good,"the store was good but people looked as they wanted to get something better, they were not happy with what they have, but also they didn`t want to work harder to get a better possition."
good,worked and 8 hr shift at night. management was ok they was pretty nice. hardest part of the job was trying to be everywhere at once. enjoyable part of this job was talking to all the people.
good,I most enjoyed the friends I made there. In the pharmacy I liked being able to help people get the medication in a timely manner.
good,"trabajo tipico"
good,"responsible for stocking shelves, provided excellent customer service, stock shelves, clean up spills and restrooms. Reface shelves, general cleaning of the store."
good,"I was a cashier that had great customer service skills, handled all cash transactions, and bagged groceries.  The hardest part of the job was keeping a smile on my face when customers were rude or mean."
good,"Learned the different departments very quickly. I'm a fast learner, know how to work in a fast or slow paced work environment."
good,"Greet the customers by asking direct questions to provide service so that you know exactly what they need and want to assist them in there needs. "
good,"really enjoyed working there, until i had a knee injury that had gotten worse due to walmart not allowing me to sit for 20 mins at a time per the dr's request i worked in the money center behind a tall  desk no one would have noticed and i was very efficient in my job , and enjoyed it along with my customer, i appealed walmarts decision and was still  rejected the dr's request which forced me into giving my notice this was the only issue that i had with walmart very disappointed when some door greeters were allowed to sit due to injuries "
good,Pay is good but be prepared to WORK. You ride mobile equipment and use electronic headsets to fill orders in a certain amount of time. You'll get multiple trips with different times you have to complete them in. Must maintain an average of 95% or higher. This is the order filler position and most common in the warehouse.
good,Milieu de travail bon pour les étudiants. Il faut être polyvalent et avoir une facilité d'adaptation aux changements
good,"you pretty much do Walmart things. management is awful. hours get cut more than they ever need to be, pay is decent if you can handle the management"
good,totally enjoyed working here as a cashier.  I had friends here and miss working here.  I would like to come back to Walmart.  We had one manager that was aweful. Angela.
good,Walmart customers and employees are wonderful. Management are not good at communicating with each other and employees. Walmart does not care about the associates needs.
good,"it was a job, not bad worked late at night in the back room close knit group. you would get chemical burn on you hand from the chemical boxes that came in and the smell in back of chemicals is insane"
good,I would say that Walmart is a good place to work although it needs improvement of how things are managed I feel I was terminated unjustly and the environment was not positive in many ways
good,Walmart is my first job. I working for clothes hanging. I work there for a year. good management and boss... I keep focus on my job. I was at school that time. After school I went to work. It's good to learning to work...easy job.
good,"Es una empresa que te ofrece estabilidad laboral y se preocupa por sus equipos de trabajo, en ella puedes desarrollarte y recibir satisfacciones si eres comprometido, el trato con la gente es de manera cordial y de comunicación, de manera general es una empres donde puedes trabajar."
good,"Good work environment, liked working with my fellow employees. The hours worked great for me and my busy schedule. The only thing I had an issue with was work was completed early throughout the shift and I felt I was standing around a good portion of the time not doing anything."
good,I would greet every customer with a smile. learned how to count money learned good customer service. Over all it was a fun and easy job.
good,While working here I was able to gain the experience of customer service and improve on my communication skills among others.
good,"loved this job meeting new people, assisting customers, management was great love ups and down and fixing all problems and making customer experience great"
good,Walmart was a decent place to work. It was always a busy working environment. Never not had anything to do. I would reconmend this job to someone wanting to start out with a first time job.
good,"I stock the shelves, help customers, and organize the department. I work with my fellow associates and managers in order to keep the department clean and safe and help customers."
good,Company has good Work/Life Balance. Has good training opportunities.Co-workers were easy to get along with and were willing to help their co-workers.
good,its all about Customer service.... remember the motto is the customer is right. there are a few exceptions but homestly... do your best to please the customer and you will do ok
good,workplace was ok steady hours. management did not help much some did most didn't. job was easy  depending were you worked.
good,"My coworkers are nosey, my days are always different and my managers are hypocrites the hardest prt of my job is not being able to give the customers the attention that they require"
good,"Working it at walmart has its ups and downs. Im in the pursue of a nice job because working as an unloader at walmart we are over worked because we are always under-staffed and often have to stay overtime to finish the work and most time don't get some our breaks or breaks are cut in half. The job is also extremely physically demanding, constantly unloading heavy boxes up to 100lbs and moving heavy skids throughout the day."
good,Walmart was great. it was comfort and really respectful. I would go back to Walmart to work there if still lived there. walmart is wonderful for a job in many different ways.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers. I love helping the elderly most of all because they are kind, and funny."
good,"A typical day at work consists of scanning and bagging items for customers, red lining, and zoning my area. Throughout my year at Walmart I learned how to operate the cash register, how to check prices, change item prices based on our scanning code of practice, void items, split payments, and load gift cards as well as other things regarding the cash register and Walmart protocol. My management have rotated during my time at Walmart and all have been friendly and fair. My co-workers have become my team as well as my friends, i depend on them to assist me when needed and vice versa. The hardest part of my job would be the physical toll of standing all day, and sometimes strenuous lifting. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers and giving the best customer service I can, it is rewarding when a customer leaves feeling satisfied."
good,"It has been very interesting working for wal-mart, I have learned to handle a variety of situatoins.  Working with the public exposes you to all sorts of people"
good,I liked working for this company. they definitely kept you busy and let you know everything you needed to know about the field before you started. good group of people to work around and i learned a lot from working for this company
good,I was only there for christmas rush. All i did was put returns away and face the section i was working at. Also worked in the fabric department.
good,Management asks too much from employees and do not pay them enough or give them good benefits. The employees were nice hardworking people. the management team did not want to help in any way.
good,"They were ok, I worked there for 2 years and just decided I needed a change. Lots of hours and above minimum wage pay, the give you some great training too. It was a pretty good first job but I just got bored."
good,"Hardest part of this job was the time limits given on when tasks had to be done, but it was not unreasonable. A ypical day included unloading one to two trucks then sorting the products according to department, then either stocking or moving products to the floor"
good,"Solid 3/5.....good starting out job... Quit due to bad management of a floor Manager who, sent employees home causing an understaffed environment.....that manager is now gone though so....."
good,"I started as a cashier,then became a customer service desk associate and then a customer service manager. Great advancement opportunities."
good,"Good job for people only needing part time, pro and con is working with the public! Some people are great, some people are rude."
good,"I have 10 years in the job with Wal-Mart; I worked as a supervisor and as a regular associate. I train, and help my coworker. I'm very productive person, very punctual: I never been late or called off. I love working with people, I go above an d beyond for my customers to get the help they need."
good,It is a nice and organized work environment.  There is pretty much a set work schedule as well.  It is a team environment and I get to interact with customers daily.
good,"muito boa de se trabalha  com muito profissionais  qualificados "
good,While I enjoyed my time at walmart they require too many hours and the job has no work/life balance.  It is a great job for a young person with no kids.
good,"While I enjoy working at Walmart, it is time to begin looking for something else.  Working as a manager at Walmart is a young persons job and as you get older the hours they demand get to be a burden."
good,"The environment and management was good, they worked with my schedule and were very helpful. They offered benefits and discounts, it was a nice place to work."
good,very few off days and a lot of hours worked due to the city that this particular store is in. store was always busy. all of my coworkers were very easy to get along with
good,Great retail environment to learn about different work environment. I gained lots of experience by working with diverse group of people.
good,"A typical day at work would be pushing shopping carts forward in the shopping cart bay, spot sweeping to keep entrance/exit looking clean, pulling out shopping carts for customers as they came in while also scanning shopping carts exiting from checkout - asking to see the receipts from any customers who had items not bagged in their shopping cart to see if those items were included on the receipt. Management changed the position's job duties from greeting customers as they entered the store to checking out customers as they exited. The hardest part of the job - there was two things: when it rained and there were not enough shopping carts for customers coming in and then trying to dry off wet carts that were retrieved from the parking lot. Also during this time, trying to keep the floor mopped as much as possible to avoid accidents. The other hardest part of the job was having customers accuse me of accusing them of being dishonest or a thief or harassing them or cursing me for asking to see their receipt. The most enjoyable part of the job was greeting regular customers who were a pleasure to see again."
good,"A little disorganized, very busy at times, culture diversity and poor management. I didn't really learn nothing new at this job particular"
good,"sliced meat, served customer, put out product, stocking inventory, clean... Job could be stressful at times when you have a rush of people but other then that a decent job."
good,i was great working for this company... enjoyed the work and the people that i worked with. I would go back if offered. now im rambling because i have nothing else to write
good,This job will definitely challenge your customer service skills. It was a demanding job but I worked with some great people that made the job a little better. Advancement is not as easy. You can be asked to do things that are not apart of your job description
good,"Company itself was fair but position was high-stress and too anxiety-ridden to be handled by my disability, was often given extremely high production goals that I was unable to complete by myself"
good,in all good job learned many new skills but for the pay it wasnt worth what we had to put our bodies through and the hours were never set
good,"Support Manager – Managed 40 associates to include training.  Ordered merchandise for all departments, wrote employee schedules, drove transfers to other stores throughout New York and New Jersey.  Unloaded trucks, maintained records, operated registers, operated forklifts, scissor lifts, walking stackers and electric pallet jacks."
good,job was well but was forced into a position  was not hired for and after being forced into it i was treated poorly and never got proper training
good,A typical day of work consist of a high volume of phone calls in a very fast pace environment. I was educated on many different areas of this company. I provided many different skills in various positions.
good,I would go to work and I would stand at the checkouts to assist customers in their checkout process as well as handle the money transactions. It was a good job for a 15 year old kid and thought me great responsibilities.
good,im a hard working who likes to learn as much as i can to better myself i try my best every day at work and try to better myself every day
good,this is a good place to work specially when you are working overnight they just ask to much for the paid when you work during the day the payment its miserable
good,"I've been working for Walmart since 1998 and still active . I'm just looking for something different.The hardest part of the job is the training, you learn as you go and calling your co-works from different store for answers. I'm a office associate that work with paperwork all day."
good,Please do be careful when working for Wal-Mart. Not everyone's experience will be the same but just take note that Wal-Mart as a company has one of the highest turnover rates of any store. try to think of employment as a last resort...
good,It is a good job but it tends to change schedule on you constantly without your knowledge. I worked mostly on the floor found that certain employee's were not helpful when working as a team and management never seemed to push those who did not work. It would have been great if they would have mantain their schedule and had better help
good,Good place to work not much more to say even though this site wants you to say more . Not sure how much ore this site wants me to say but I do not have much more
good,its a ok place to work depending on who your managers are and what they are like. can be a bit irritating and annoying and doesn't pay that well especially for the things you sometimes have to go thru
good,"Ok place I was glad to find something else.  Pay was min wage, worked about 32 hours a week, still considered part time.  Some of the managers were ok most were not."
good,"Good opportunities for people who have many different skills. Customer service, stocking, cashiering, or many other positions are all available here."
good,"This job wasnt bad, If full time was available to me I probably would have worked there longer. The only thing I didnt like was working overnight and I manged to deal with that."
good,Walmart is a good company and professional with policy requires alot of work hours in management must be very organized and dedicated to suceed
good,"Many of the younger employees are very enjoyable, helpful, and want each of us to succeed. But the current older assistant managers as well as the personnel manager are rude, uncomfortable to talk to, and only care about the work place looking neat and tidy without consideration for the limited amount of employees under them."
good,"Walmart is a place that it varies on experience depending on your store's location.  Some places it is great but others, they just need to close them down."
good,"Good Human resource office, Management is driving, co-workers or nice people. really good cleaning crew. The hardest part is long hour, during the holidays and not enough breaks for workers."
good,"Coworkers are usually alot of fun to be around, but if you are reliable and a hard worker Walmart will take advantage of that. Be prepared to work full time shift hours without benefits."
good,Walmart DC is a fast paste hard working environment. Management was not very organized as a department rotation was out of control not being fair to others like being in a double for a week straight not going by the rotation rules on the shift. co workers were good people got along with a lot of them. the hardest part about the job was being in a double and getting all the jams on the conveyer belt its old and was not very affective on its job. the enjoyable part about my job was helping other people on there lane conversation while working makes it a lot easier to do.
good,"Cashiering requires a person to be social and caring towards others while moving quickly to not aggravate the customers. You have to be happy all the time even if a customer is particularly rude. It is a good job during college. "
good,Started off outside rounding up baskets.  Then I moved to become a daytime stocker. My last position was an overnight unloader.
good,"Great place for a part time job, they will work with you schedule wise, coworkers are pleasant to work with and management is easy to work with."
good,"This job is very much what you make of it.  A lot depends on your management, if you have good management then your job will be good.  I however am not that lucky."
good,I have no comment about m Walmart experience of all kind. Its was a great company to work with and for. I recommend Walmart to any of my peers.
good,Wal-Mart being the fast paced store it is makes working there a little hectic. However many managers are very understandable. the hardest part of the job is having an outside life.
good,at walmart i enjoy for a few month until the management has a fav. person  they like and that the reason i gave yall a 3 star. this was my first job i ever had so it was hard on me they did work around my schuale when i was going to school.
good,"Llegar y reponer toda la mercadería que a sido vendida durante el día, es un trabajo tranquilo, siendo nocturno porque no hay publico sacando y sacando mercadería interrumpiendo la labor de uno mismo, la compañía laboral no era muy buena como todo trabajo al nuevo lo mandan a todo, por eso aproveche mi nueva opción laboral"
good,"I learned a lot about prescription types and classification. The importance of customer profiles. The technicians and pharmacists were always helpful during my training. We had on going jokes between us to keep us laughing. It was a high energy, high output pharmacy."
good,If you are low level then it is a great job to have when searching for another job. The hours are flexible and pay is not great but it will supply a steady pay.
good,"Wal-mart has a reputation for being a poor place to work. The work you have to do is physically demanding and the pay is mediocre. The only plus is one hour lunches when working third shift. The benefits are also not as bad as they could be. Overall Wal-mart is a fine place to start off when trying to obtain some working experience but as a ""career"" it is not the place you want to be."
good,understanding for the most part. pays above the minimum wage even at entry level position. friendly management and reasonable hours ..
good,A strong sense of patience and humor is a must for this job as well as task management skills and multitasking. Every day is fairly unpredictable other than cleaning bathrooms and interacting with customers. Some co-workers can be enjoyable while not so much others. The most enjoyable part of the job is the allowance to free roam the store to complete tasks as efficiently as possible. The hardest part of the job is receiving a task and before finishing that one receive several more from separate managers at most times of the day. Communication is key in this position although some co-workers do not participate as often as others.
good,"i would find keys, so i can gt in the safe to count it, we had to count the safe every hour, assign registers to cashiers, go around the store and get all the tills at night"
good,"A typical day here was to patrol and look for shoplifters while maintaining a cover as just another shopper. I learned how to blend into the background, identify potential thieves, blindspots and areas that would attract thieves."
good,"Trabajar de secretaria Gerencial requería de mucha paciencia, tolerancia y trabajar bajo presión, ya que eras la mano derecha del Gerente, llevarle correos, redactarlos, tomar llamadas, ayudar a los sub Gerentes y al personal de la tienda cuando lo necesitaban, era mucha presión. Pero me enseñe a realizar diferentes actividades al mismo tiempo, a trabajar en equipo y lo mas importante cuidar un empleo."
good,"fun and friendly co workers, working environment was nasty at times when it rained or snowed. easy to get pay raises and benefits. good bosses."
good,"Working here you get to meet new people each day. you also have your regulars that you get to know. It has been a fun experience working here. It is a 24 hour center so they are best to be able to work with your schedule, but there may be times that they may not be able to."
good,"Terrible company to work for.  No work life balance at all.  Has great benefits, but upper management is terrible period."
good,The managers weren't friendly and made work life daily very difficult. They act childish by calling fellow co workers names.
good,Very busy on a daily basis. Learn a lot from mgmt and coworker. Enjoyed helping customers and coworkers. They try and work with employee if there is a issue with your family.
good,"This is a very good company to work for and they are always willing to help me in times of need."
good,A typical day at work would be me coming in and punching in to start my day.  I would prepare the slicing of meat for the deli and prepare the hot foods that Wal-mart sells.   I got along with most employees and I took care of costumers.  I was happy there. It was a great time. Co-workers were great and most of them were easy to get along with.  The hardest part of the job was trying to make sure the costumers were happy with what they wanted and how they were treated by the employees. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I was good and still am good at is being myself and enjoying and getting along with others
good,"Liked my job, however the Walmart Core Values were not always followed by management. A good learning experience for me."
good,"It's was a nice place to work though management was NOT on the same page."" To Many Sergent's over one trooper"" probably won't go back personally"
good,"Walmart is a retail job.  You will have customers be nice to you, make excuses to you, yell at you for things that are not your fault...even spit at you.  All this while being at the mercy of managements whims."
good,"Ok place to work, but the people in management seem not to care or understand outside life ex. school, children and that unexpected things do happen."
good,"The hours were great, I liked stocking and arranging shelves, helping customers and receiving a decent paycheck.  Some of the customer outfits were comical."
good,"My main duties included basic register functions, price matching, customer complaints, as well as stocking grocery items. My co-workers were reliable and displayed hard work ethic like myself. Management seemed to be unprofessional at times and had difficulties following policies. The hardest part of the job was when management did not follow procedure. The most enjoyable part was seeing new faces everyday and making a positive difference."
good,go in and clock in and find out what have to be done that day work as a team  my co-work great. I work well with other.I worked department
good,Very disorganized implementation of the small neighborhood Markets. Lack of adequate training. Poor management. High turnover rates.
good,"Walmart is a job, for anyone, who coming out of high school and this will be there first job to get the experience. But they should move on after a year."
good,"I love the night time salaried managers. They're very understanding that life happens and try to be flexible. I love memorizing where all the product goes, yet ironically the hardest thing is being assigned to a new department. The nice thing is that most everyone motivates their coworkers."
good,They are willing to work with my school schedule.  I am grateful for that since it's hard to find employers who will do that.
good,"Walmart was a good start for me overall. It was fast pace and after each day I felt very accomplished, especially on busy days. I've learned a lot from working there such as being independent and coming up with more than one way to do things that could help others and myself. The hardest part for me was being on my feet all the time and some of the customers, but just took them day by day."
good,Great addition to resume as it deals with leading a team of high performing managers in compliance related culture building activities.
good,"Walmart is a popular clothing store, so the work was fast pasted, I liked this about Walmart."
good,"The managers here do not like it if you can show them up and they will show you. They pay more than minimum wage which is a plus, and you're in air conditioning."
good,"good benefits, good pay if you can get hours. Not good with people with handecaps. Poor Manager help. good healthcare. they want you to do almost everything."
good,"Please, make sure you are going to school or have another job if you work for this company. Terrible managers, benefits aren't that great...but at least they have some."
good,"my job was to clean up the store behind the customers. All persons worked together to maintain the floor. Great people, fun workplace, great environment."
good,"Working at the Wal-Mart DC was a good job and I enjoyed my time there. If you want to work for Wal-mart the DC is the place to work. Set schedule, good pay and a great bunch of co-workers."
good,"A typical day could get pretty busy. Receiving anywhere from 1-3 trucks a day, always throwing freight. Management was friendly, along with my co-workers, we were like family. The hardest part of the job would be some heavy lifting required at times. The most I enjoyed out of this job was having co-workers that I got along with and was always all about helping one another."
good,"productive, best co workers ever. ok pay, off major holidays. close drive from home, good healthcare coverage, offers stock options"
good,"it was good but not excellent. they had bad organization. I use to cut myself a lot when I would go to the back to grab TV's. how they had a little person like me get big TV's that weren't even  stacked up good. they were all falling. but coworkers were good and friendly. I learned a lot of customer service and cashier, and a lot of sales."
good,Stocking shelves for next day customers 5 days a week. unloading trucks safely with pallet jacks. must finish before daily deadline.
good,Fun place to work but very frustrating. It's like we have 3 store managers and they all have different agendas. Nobody is on the same page.
good,"friendly management staff, co workers work in teams. learned a lot about time management. Top down level management style."
good,"typical day consists of tidying/stocking shelves, assisting customers with finding products, operating a cash register. Learned layout of departments in store to assist customers in finding products or found an associate in that department to assist customers. Found management approachable to answer inquiries and worked as a team with co-workers. Found the hardest part of the job was losing a good team member. It was most enjoyable helping customers finding the products they needed or checking when it would be approximately received at the store."
good,"Ive learned a lot working with wal mart I started off as a cashier and moved on to a different  department after six months.  The overall job is not hard at all and I actually love my postion.  My only problem is the scheduling, not enough hours."
good,"during training I was by myself, I learned I can't do that job. management was terrible. co-workers were snotty, hardest part of the job was lifting. most enjoyable part was nothing."
good,"Enjoyed helping customers & providing them information needed, Job is less stressful & easier to balance with school & social life."
good,working for the company was ok but the mangament needed more training. Some of the coworkers were ok to work with. some of the managers were educated beyond their intelligence.
good,"Most people who ever worked at a Walmart would Know that some of the mangers could be difficult to work with. Irradiated customer's I can deal with, Mangers being petty I can't deal with."
good,"Working here was fun at first, but after while it got pretty bad."
good,"A lot of work, work as a team. learned about retail and profit markups. merchandising product building communication skills."
good,"Would assign tasks for the day to my overnight associates to complete for the night. Management pushed me, but that only made me a better supervisor. "
good,"Walmart is a great place to work. the only thing I did not like about it, was how the managers played favorites and how mean some of the customers where. Although they forsure need to have more than two lines open at a time."
good,Helped open a new store.  Wasn't trained very well.  Left to do things on my own without actually shown first.  Co-workers not willing to help.  Management not helpful
good,"Positive environment"
good,I really liked Wal-Mart but being the fact I was pregnant it was getting hard to stay on my feet all day after I had baby I was more focused into warehouse work.
good,aprendi a tener paciencia la gerencia no es correcta ya que el gerente no te atiende es prepotente mis compañeros tratabamos de apoyarnos en todo la parte mas dificil fue tener velocidad para cobrar me gusto el compañerismo y hasta la fecha las amistades que logre tener
good,Working in Asset Protection was a day to day challenge. No day was ever the same. Everyday brought new challenges and learning experiences. It has definitely been a learning experience. My co-workers and I established a family like atmosphere.
good,I was a cashier at Walmart. The typical work day started off great most days and went downhill a lot. I got along with most of the managers. I got along with all my co-workers. I learned how to use a cash register and kept trying to meet new people. The hardest part of this job was the rude customers.
good,"Given much heavier load to carry than other areas in the store, expected more from the backroom employees covering other areas of the store while attending to the normal jobs."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work on customer service skills, no matter what position you are in. They may pay better then most minimum wage jobs but the problem is that it's hard to get hours and there are a lot of different managers which can make things difficult because they all want you to do what they want even if they are not technically over your department, which makes it hard to get all of your tasks done on time."
good,"A typical day working in Walmart is cashing out customers, cleaning your station, and also organizing/restocking your zone aisle. I learned a lot working here such as learning how to pay bills and taking different forms of payment. My management and co-workers were strong willing and hard workers committed to finishing their work."
good,"Wal-mart provides a job  that  offers competitive retail wages, good working environments, and decent management."
good,"excellent work experience, did a lot of on hands projects and dealt with different customers daily. management was always on top of things but at the same laid back"
good,I wasnt there long enough to thouroughly review but the money was not sufficient. I didnt mind the job but I needed more pay to support my family
good,Walmart was busy. I always had something to do that seemed to my the shift go pretty fast it was also close to where I lived and easy to catch a bus if my car broke down.
good,"It was an alright job also, my first work experience. I learned to become more patient and to work more productively.The management was alright i did not have alot of experince working with them. The hardest part of my job was unloading the truck at a exceptable time while still keeping it in order. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and getting my first job under my belt and trying to experince more."
good,My typical day at Wal-Mart depended on whether I worked day shift or evening shift.  Either way I assisted with putting product on the floor and keeping the shelves stocked.  During the day I baked and bagged bread; in the evening I prepped bread for the next day.  I learned a lot about the operations of a grocery store and how to handle specialty customer orders.  The hardest part of the job was the struggle to get enough hours and not always having enough floor space to put the product to sell.
good,"Typical day at work consists of actively helping customers and doing repetitive simple tasks. Fairly flexible with their scheduling, really nice staff and you get to meet alot of people!"
good,"being a department manager at walmart consists of price changes, price reviews, stocking freight, inventory, reports, customer service"
good,"I enjoyed this job because I got to work with the employees,"
good,"Monday through Thursday are pretty slow at night after 12am."
good,"Being a cashier here is a bit boring but that's just because you're standing in one area. Required to clean area, make sure trash is emptied, replace receipt roll, keeping up with getting change for your register, handling cash, and unloading/reloading customers credit/debit cards. Management/Supervisors are O.K. they're not as patient and kind when it comes to questions or help. Especially if the store is busy. Training is mostly on the computer and some in person for a day if that. They expect you to grasp everything very quickly and also get customers through your line very very fast even if it's all entirely new to you."
good,"> processing in coming returns and exchanges"
good,"loved working with the public."
good,A very fast paced job that I enjoyed. I learned various skills that I was able to use not only at work but to also use in the future when working with a team.
good,The duties of this job is to make sure all the packages that go through the Richmond Hub have the correct weight on them and the shippers charge themselves correctly.
good,"Job responsibilities were often compromised in lieu of other projects put in place by senior management.  Inadequate support from senior management."
good,It served its purpose while I was getting a degree.  It was a fast paced job that kept me busy and made time go by quickly.  The expectations were fair and I would recommend this job to someone in a similar situation to myself.
good,Working at Walmart was a short yet fulfilling job. I worked there for a month as a temporary cashier. It was during the winter holidays so the store was always busy and as a cashier there was always something to do. In a short amount of time  went through the basic training and learned how to operate the cash register and learned the basic conduct for Walmart employees. When the lines weren't busy i would help organize the isles or help processing in the back. The management was always fair and friendly and they never gave anybody a hardtime.
good,They have a flexible schedule. Nothing hard about working there. Overtime sometimes available. Employee discounts are nice. Great job for people with small kids.
good,working as a cashier at wal mart is like working the mouth of a beast in perpetual consumption. i loved every second of it.
good,Ambiente de trabajo amistoso. posibilidad de crecimiento laboral. mucho aprendizaje
good,McDonald was an ok job. Great for teens its a wonderful learning experience..keeps you grounded reminds you of where your at in life.
good,"Walmart is a pretty decent job, a good portion of the people I work with are amazing they know how to get the job done and they get it done without complaining unlike a lot of others that do, overall its a good job"
good,"-Loading shelves is a typical day"
good,"I learned how to clean well and also cooperate with others while satisfying customers with their needs. Management were always nice and enjoyed having me as a worker there. Some co-workers went to my school Lincoln College, so it was nice knowing some of them and getting to know others. Good job overall"
good,The hours are very flexible. The people are very cooperative and is a good work environment. The managers are helpful when they need to be.
good,"A typical day of work consists of checking the customers out after they are done shopping. Price checks, bagging groceries, zoning aisles maki8ng sure everything is stocked properly."
good,"Always moving, Rarely any down time. Learned to prioritize responsibilities so that all the work is done. Currently Understaffed and hiring people to train. New employees are coming into the company making more money than the people who have been there. I am currently searching for another job because i feel we're being treated unfairly"
good,I love my job but the management is bad.  They need to be retrained in how to treat and listen to their employees. Not family oriented at all.
good,"The co-workers are really nice and can help you if you are new there."
good,Working for Walmart was difficult at times you have timed assignments and at times the freight took along time to stock. I learned to work at a fast pace since we had to get the freight off the floor at a certain time. I enjoyed working with a lot of the co- workers and they gave us a reasonable lunch break.
good,"Typical day varied on the project.  Some jobs I was just a carpenter; other jobs I was the Superintendent.  I dealt with subcontractors, timelines, blueprints, customers, scheduling and deliveries.  I also handled change orders.  My coworkers varied depending on the job.  Hardest part of the job was inconsistent work.  The most enjoyable part was running a project from beginning to end."
good,"I've enjoyed working at walmart, but as of right now i am looking to expand my work experience. We all know Walmart is a very well known store that gets busy a lot which makes me have to work twice as hard making sure that the customers have carts, an helping the ones that need help with carry-outs an propane..etc   "
good,"Working overnight, for me, is really stressful. There was a phase we went through where the managers, one specific manager that is, was writing people up for small, unnecessary reasons. I haven't had any problems from her in a couple months. But I still don't enjoy working there because she gives me such an uneasy feeling. I just don't believe you should make your workers feel unappreciated because mostly everyone works their butt off. I personally don't like stocking, in other reasons, it's not my forte. I've been doing this for 9 months and I despise the job more and more everyday that I walk in there. A typical day at work is pretty easy. But on other days I get thrown around the store to many different departments and it's exhausting. I don't enjoy having a job where I don't know what I'm going to be doing before I get there. The environment is not peaceful. It's very tense. I don't feel like I belong. And I miss out on a lot because I have to get sleep during the day in order to have energy to work at night. I hate sleeping during the day. I have become a morning person because of this job. Some can tolerate it. And some are not fit for it. Although I do hear a majority of the associates complaining about management. So I'm not the only one that feels this way. It's not the best job. Very depressing and stressful. I really don't see how people have worked there for so many years."
good,"It was a great place to work until I got hurt on the job, then I got let go and put on the no hire list, and that isn't right to me"
good,"A Typical day is going 100 miles per hour, haven't learn anything I would use out side of the company, Poor management never goes by the book so all can be on the same page., Co workers we are all in the same boat, we all have a common unity. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the right hand trying to figure out what the left hand is doing. Greatest reward, having customer come back to me because they had the best customer service."
good,"when it came to working at walmart, working hard to the point your sweat, even when you are in the freezer, just isnt enough to keep you, as well as voluntarily working through black friday in the electronics department"
good,"While working for Walmart I would deal with customers all through out my shift, while I checked them out at a rate of about 700 bags per hour. I would meet and greet customers while providing excellent customer service"
good,good job worked around my schedule everyone I worked with was friendly. Everyone was helpful to other employees. HR associate was very kind
good,Since I have been at Walmart I have experience multiple job related problems with other workers. Now as I have matured to communicate with others my work days are no longer hard for .
good,"Good working environment in itself , management can be a little on edge and straight forward, a little harsh at times, should be a little more understanding of their employee's personal business"
good,"light and routine job"
good,"Well to begin with I was hired for stationary/crafts section which wasn't too bad but later transferred to dry food stocker. Things got better, such as better pay and more work. "
good,"A typical day is very busy, which makes time go faster. A job is what you make of it. The people I worked with and management were very nice and surprisingly accommodating at times. The hardest part of the job is the scheduled hours and trying to get a break on time. Sometimes I would be scheduled until midnight only to start another shift by 6am. The most enjoyable part of the job I would say was proving how fast of a learner I am and getting recognized for it by moving from cashier to customer service and offered a PCM position which is in charge of cashiers and customer service associates."
good,"Everyday was different, it a pretty standard job, it was fast paced and very social. I learned that not everyone is meant for this job, and I also learned that retail is pretty fun. I also learned how to work under pressure and on a time limit, I learned how to do things I never thought i'd need. Management was okay, I felt like they could of done a better job as far as listening to their associates more, but they tried and had a lot of other work of their own. My coworkers were fine, some better than others but that's always how it goes. The hardest part was probably the schedule changes, but it wasn't anything too crazy. The most enjoyable was making the customers happy and exceeding their expectations."
good,"The loss prevention field is an interesting field to work in all the way around. Besides being interesting, it can also be dangerous and both mentally and physically exhausting. This job requires you to have excellent communication skills with both store management and the local police department. It can get very lonely walking the aisles day in and day out searching for shoplifters so try different techniques to stay alert and focused. Keen observation skills are an absolute must but can be learned on the job training. You'll quickly start noticing the smallest details in most everything. You must have a strong sense of safety as this job can be extremely dangerous."
good,"I loved meeting and helping different people, i didn't see anything as the hardest part of my job it was a learning experience. I liked the people i worked with, we worked well together with the same goal to get our load complete before deadline."
good,"Typical day at work was very repetitive though always introducing new experiences with customers. Management seems to lose focus of their workers as they get wrapped up in the busy environment of the store, and often has hard time relating to the employees. Overall, good place for students looking for their first entry-level job, with all required training and opportunities, as well as postie environment for anyone looking to work part time."
good,During all-night shift; Me and all the other team members and management worked hard together to complete our instock team work task.
good,they want for walmart to be your first priority and they don't care about whether you are going to school to better yourself or not. even though at time of interview they were inform and when it came down to it they just care for filling that spot for that time frame on their schedule.
good,wal-mart was a job that set high standards that you have to meet. Some of my manger were respectful and helpful. My co-worker showed me things that I needed to learn to be more successful at my job.
good,little pay but the job was fun as !!!!!!!! would consider it if u need a second job or something like that maybe even for a college student
good,enjoyed learning new things. co-workers were great. Always busy doing stuff. got to help customers when needed. learned how to mix paint
good,I love Walmart it has great sales and deals for our customers. I do feel like the stockers could do a little more work when it comes to keeping our lines clean.
good,"Wal-Mart, can be a fun place to work if the stores had the ability to make the decision when employees work.  Where I work now  It is part-time. There is few full time jobs.  AS a part -time  employees my hours are set at 5 to 5.5 hours 3 to 4 times a week.  Established Various times a week.    This is based on how you list your availability  to work.  The (computer program) choose when you are schedule to work.  Often times providing one with various times day and evening through the week."
good,"Although I enjoyed the fast paced and challenging work, the corporate culture from top to bottom tends to demean and undervalue the workers.  As the nation's largest employer, Wal-mart needs to set the standard in human resources and employee relations."
good,"High Paced, High Energy. Sometimes difficult because things are constantly changing and they just expect you to know from one day to the next without warning. There are a few kinks in the system but the people I work with are pretty great and that makes a world of difference."
good,"I have been with Walmart for almost two years, and it has taught me how to manage people. My job was to unload around three trucks a day, to stock product on shelves with a team, and do some inventory at the end of the day."
good,"Walmart is pretty decent job,besides the point system,and the schedule.Ive became an excellent cake decorator and have gain great people skills.my co-workers was awesome,the hardest part was dealing with upset customers"
good,"A typical day of working at Walmart included interacting with customers, stocking shelves, and ensuring that there were no safety hazards in the auto shop while doing oil changes and changing tires."
good,"With in Wal-Mart there are many jobs that make the store run, starting with the people greeter to the floor associates to the cashier to management.  Everyone is just as important as the next."
good,Great for stundents. Hours are very flexible but pay is fairly low compared to average in the market. High standards with very high expectations.
good,I've been an employee part time for them for going on 2 years and they've been pretty fair . Good team and atmosphere. Offers benefits and flexible work scheduling.
good,The doctors I worked with had a great disposition and help out when we had any customers that was having a problem with their glasses. These doctors would do the troubleshooting if I was to busy.
good,Walmart was an alright place to work it was just to cluttered and it seemed like you would never get your break on time. there would be days where i would work and not even get a break which was hard on me. they didn't treat their employees to fair either.
good,"My days at this company were filled with procuring and arranging pallets of shipment, followed by sorting all stock items then placing and organizing them in their designated homes. Though the tasks were simple, management did not always make performing them just as so. In spite of that, working along side my co-workers was as pleasant of an experience as any."
good,"Overnight cashiers, unlike dayshift cashiers - had additional responsibilities besides manning the registers. This included stocking shelves, helping to tidy the area, and other tasks normally filled by customer service employees during the day shifts."
good,I would have my days good or bad. I learn how to work on being a cashier and stalking up items. Management wise was okay. MY co-workers were good and good to work with. The hardest part was trying to deal with rude customers and how to deal with them. Most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and working with some of my co-workers who always find ways to make me laugh at work.
good,"Management was good i had good co-workers that worked hard and help out when help was needed. i learned how to work as a team and also be a leader. most enjoyable part was just working hard all day and doing my best, hardest part of the job didn't have none."
good,this is the best place to work. especially if you like to work at a fast pace atmosphere. my co workers and mangers are all nice and are easy to get along with.
good,"I had a fairly decent experience while working her when it came to day by day tasks and the people I worked with consistently. The majority of the workers I was with had an amazing attitude along with being respectable individuals. Unfortunately, I did not have a similar experience with their management team. There is a consistent lack of communication between not only them and their associates, but with other managers as well. This led to consistent a back and forth with direction which tended to leave the associates in a bad place when their tasks couldn't be completed due to constant redirection. Their promotional process is also fairly questionable. Feeling the need to advance up the ladder after two years of working in the same department, I applied for several department manager positions only to be met with either complete silence as to why I hadn't gotten the position, or unacceptable excuses such as ""the position was open, but was re-closed"". At a point, I had in fact waited for a position I had knowingly applied for only to see it posted back on our board about a month later. Overall, great people on the hourly scale, but management is something to watch out for."
good,"they pick and choose their favorites to give the better jobs to. "
good,"All the workers are very hard working, every day there is a lot of rude customers coming by but the workers are always patient and nice. The management was slow on routine but eventually at the end of the day everything goes by well"
good,Plenty of room for advancement.  The job is pretty easy and the pay has increased recently which is also nice.  It is very okay.
good,Walmart was a place where there was a lot of favoritism and a place where there was a lack of advancement due to the favoritism with managers and employees.
good,The job overall is easy. The difficulty of the workload varies depending on the night and other employees. Mondays are the easiest days. Tuesdays and Thursdays are the hardest. Graveyard shift isn't for everyone.
good,"Very busy store always plenty of work to keep you busy."
good,new managers walmart is not like i though it would be and i speak off experiecne the were horrible the time i did work for this company
good,"Unload truck, put out freight, always check prices first before setting an end cap, co-workers were loud, hardest part of the job long hours, most enjoyable part raises."
good,Had a good group of co-workers on my maintenance team. Team watched out for one another and aided each other when neccessary. The hardest part of the job was when we were understaffed and asked to do additional work. The most enjoyable part of the job was when the team would work hard together and complete additional tasks well.
good,can be a very fast paced day. i learned about people skills and management skills. most the people are nice. the hardest part is the mental part because u can be demanded to do more in less time. talking to the people was the best part learning about peoples lives.
good,"Generally speaking, this job is good for college and high school students, or people trying to earn a little extra cash. There is room for advancement, but the entry level job really doesn't pay well. You will learn how to interact with customers, basic knowledge on using computers, how to run a cash register, and how to face shelving. These things give you a general sense as to how other retail stores work too. "
good,Walmart was a flexible employer that was able to work around my school schedule. the overall work environment was good. i enjoyed the people i worked with.
good,"I gained knowledge and knew how to do everything in the building aside from what the Assist. Managers and Store Managers did. A typical day would include a lot of customer service, stocking inventory, backroom inventory control, resetting aisles for new merchandise, cleaning up aisles such as putting items back where they belong, merchandising/feature management, and I was a Temp. Department Manager for 6 months which gained me more experience in the retail world. As any job, some management was good and some was bad, overall in my opinion the Store Manager focused on non-work related things and let a lot go unfinished. Some co-workers were bad and some were great. The hardest part of the job would probably be the communication between Assist. Managers and other associates. I had the most joy merchandising features, resetting aisles for new merchandise and making the customers happy."
good,i really enjoyed working with the customers and my coworkers. There were many times that we needed loss protection but they were never available when we would request their presence.
good,"my typical day started off with me unloading merchandise from the docked trucks. for that I would use a forklift or a pallet jack, I would then separate, tag and palletize the product. in addition I would take the palletized product on to the show floor to be re shelved."
good,"i like working there but they don't pay enough for me to stay in the company anymore. but beside that they have great customer service as always, where customer always right no matter what. where you can save money leave better......Walmart"
good,clock in first clean bathrooms empty trash cans all around the store even outside and gas station. sweep floor  if any department need help like for example if they need a cashier or someone at self checkout or customer service i would fill in. loading and unloading truck throughout the time whenever a truck shows up. using a pallet jack to unload or sometime the forklift. Send products either on the floor or the freezer.
good,I enjoyed working customer service desk along with being cashier. Getting to talk to everyone as they checked out was very good to pass along notes to higher management.
good,A typical night at work. I would pull my freight to the floor and work the pallets in a timely manner but also had to be neat enough so customers could shop around without any interference.
good,"Greeting customers, keeping a big smile when helping customers out, stocking and remolding the store. Cleaning and making sure the store is nice and clean. Building and taking down counters and registers. Helping the store make a difference. Hard-working and face paced. Providing information about the items sold in the store. Making sure that every customer finds what they are looking for. Making sure the customer leaves with a smile and is highly satisfied with their purchase."
good,"L'expérience que j'ai eu à Walmart n'était pas la meilleure qu'on pouvait avoir. Le salaire de Walmart est minimum, mais le travail demandé était plus dur. Reste à dire, qu'il y avait beaucoup d'heure disponible."
good,"I honestly appreciated the job for being there when I didn't have one. The fact that the pay was amazing at the time and the many of traits I learned in due time. However asking me I wouldn't expect anyone who isn't a Warehouse Veteran to work there ,, Mainly because the Boss at the Time at least wasn't really cordial with his fellow employees. Also its very fast pace like any warehouse should be .. However its not your typical fast its EXTEREMELY FAST so severe that you will lose your position if you're not quick enough."
good,"A typical day involves cash handling, customer service, employee supervision and coordination, communication with other team members and handling customer returns.  The hardest part of the job is Black Friday.  The most enjoyable part is teaching new hires what it means to be part of our team."
good,"Good place to work, great team work and great relation between associates. A lot of micro-management. I enjoyed the customer service part of my job"
good,very good company equals oportunites for mens and womens good pay very good benefits and frienly co workers and safety place high technologic
good,"Walmart was my first and only job out of high school.  A typical day at work was fast paced.  While working for Walmart I learned that working hard for my money was rewarding and paid off.  I liked my co-workers, as they made each day enjoyable.  The hardest part of the job in my opinion was, the manual labor.  It was hard to have family time after shifts, because I would be exhausted and wanted to sleep.  The most enjoyable part was knowing that I put in the effort and earned my paychecks."
good,A typical day at work consist of assisting customers with any questions they have. Taking care of return carts and putting them on the shelves.
good,I would handle all cash overnite and the rude customers that would come in and management wouldnt care if they treat you horriable all they care about is the sale and bring in the money
good,"working solo while stocking shelves, while management can never be found if found completely belittle you as if you are uneducated. the hardest part was re moding everything 2-3 times, the best part was when i clocked out"
good,"Its a great place to work for, you meet new people everyday and for the most part they make you laugh and I enjoy helping the customers. My co workers and manager are awesome just sometimes you have a whole week without being on schedule thats the hardest part"
good,"Hour lunch break is annoying, prefer 30 minutes. Very boring job, they don't even have you work in different aisles, same aisles every night."
good,"Typical day - front end cash"
good,"It was ok working there. Most people were friendly, hard working and able to work with. The place was clean and mostly organized."
good,"I love this job, been there over 6 months i work in inventory and i would recommend this job to anyone, great bunch of people at independence"
good,la empresa es buena y tiene claro sus mision y vision pero algunos de los lideres e incluso gerentes no.
good,"My time at WalMart was stressful, but I honed my skills as a leader and a 'go-to' person when I worked there. I had a lot of perks while i worked there."
good,"Overall Walmart is a good place to work during times of emergency.  Their pay rate is a bit too low as compared to the competition.  One of the biggest challenges is having to deal with the wide variety of personality types.  Other than that, most of my co-workers have been very nice people.  The hardest part of the job is being under too much time pressure.  Walmart is not a hospital.  I believe the stress levels are very unnecessary.  One of the most enjoyable aspects of the job is being able to learn a wide variety of other tasks and positions.  You are not stuck just doing one thing over and over again.  I probably won't make Walmart my career type job.  It is a great place to work part-time only.  I would highly recommend people choose Walmart only as one of their final options."
good,Friendly co-workers and a flexible schedule makes Walmart a great place to work. Walmart also offers many different Associate discounts form all over the country.
good,I love service writing at Walmart. I have learned many things with them. The people I work with is amazing and Walmart has a lot of opportunities to advance in your career there.
good,It got too hectic for me at that certain time for me. I wish the manager had enough time to have properly trained me and had not left me to run the bakery myself since my first day.
good,"Un  dia normal en la empreas es realiazar tus actividades de rutina, aprendes hacer una persona multifuncional con sentido de urgencia, la gerencia nos ayuda  a lograr nuesteros objetivos, lo dificil  no hay cosas dificiles todo se puede lograr con esfuerzo y dedicacion, disfruto interactuar con personas con diferentes estilios de vida"
good,"Performed moderate-to-heavy labor. Primary job duties included loading and unloading shipments, organizing backroom spaces, constructing displays and stocking shelves. Responsible for putting merchandise on the shelves during hours when stores are either closed or don't have much customer traffic. Performed lifting heavy objects in excess of 50 pounds. Knowledge of operating heavy machinery such as forklifts."
good,"C'est l'endroit idéale, pour un travail étudiant. Les horaires sont flexibles."
good,I have had good experiences and bad but I really liked my job. I have learned how to be a leader and more understanding. I learned to strive for nothing but greatness and give a hundred percent In everything I do.
good,"meetings, greeting customers, ordering merchandise, management was ok, nothing hard about the job, its was a nice place to, just have to keep a smile on your face."
good,"You work hard as physically possible, yet still pushed harder. High turn around. Negative environment. Always seems short staffed."
good,"In a typical day it was tiring, I learned not to have an opinion in this workplace, as management did not listen. However, my co-workers were amazing."
good,"Quick money, will be hard on you to improve your performance to a faster time, fast paced, apply if you have experience, some people were fake"
good,Cart Pushers make the least amount of money out of everyone at Walmart and have to exert themselves the most. Even the entrance greeters make more and they stand there and say hi.
good,"I order fill meaning I gather all the products that I am assigned to and stack it on a pallet for shipping. It is hard work with a little over a half hour for break. Typical days are around 8-10 hours of lifting boxes a day. It really depends on what our numbers are for the day."
good,"* Long hours"
good,Working in the deli was alright but it could be very stressful because of how low we were staffed. There was the benefit of having an hour lunch and two breaks. You could also invest in the company with your paychecks.
good,Working in the clothing department at Wal-mart had it's benefits. You had an hour lunch and two breaks. There are also 401k benefits as well as opportunities for investing in the company with your paycheck. The work environment could become very stressful depending how busy we were. Most of the time we were very short staffed so it made things difficult.
good,"with all the new changes not being appreciated for amount of time put in now a new person will make the same amount as me even though i have invested almost 8 years of my life with the company. "
good,great place easy going mangers very nice and helpful. too bad i have to leave. hardest part staying busy. goood breaks and nice people
good,"I worked the grocery side of the store.  I learned the ins and outs of that side of the store pretty well during the short time I was there.  Management stayed on top of things, I had no problem with my co-workers.  The pay could have been better, but I wasn't there that long. The hardest part of the job was acclimating to the overnight hours."
good,Its a tough job not making a whole lot and having to deal with the harshness of customers BUT if youre lucky and get a good store you get amazing managers and coworkers!
good,"Productive place to work when you keep to yourself as I've done, learned ordering and shipping process easy. Management varies based on their personality, co-workers are needed to be kept on a professional manner. The hardest part of the job was to be recognized as their hardest worker without any promotion."
good,"Fast pace, consistent. Always something to do. I learned how to be patient with customers, & co workers. Always have a positive attitude no matter what or where you are, or who you are dealing with. Meeting co workers outside of my race was a great experience, putting our ideas together, presenting them to the manager, to come up with better ways to improve our responses to the workplace, and customers.  It wasn't hard at all! The most enjoyable part of the job was standing at the entrance, greeting people as they come and go."
good,exchanging money upon sales (Running the cash register) how to keep calm during customer outbursts. some of the management are really nice and try to work with the employees my co worker were fun and easy going the hardest part of the job was trying to deal with not so nice people the most enjoyable part of the job was helping those in need
good,I learned to work with different types of people.  I did the pre-test before customers/patients went in to see the Optometrist.  I called patients to remind of their appointments.  I helped patients/customers to select and order glasses and contact lenses.
good,"Los clientes eran muy amables y en cuanto la empresa no había oportunidad de crecimiento,"
good,Busy retail job. This is my one and only retail job ever. Gets tough at Christmas time. Of course I do work in the toy department. Co-workers are good to help if you need them. Crazy work hours.
good,Management is able to work around your schedule. Job is not stressful compared to previous jobs. Close to home. Working overnight is convenient and fun.
good,"daily working at walmart was finding the merchandise from the warehouse to place on floor the start doing inventory of warehouse and on the floor. I learned how to use the 360, pallet jack and info on certain items. Management was very helpful when needed, as well as my co workers. the hardest part was lifting certain items that were on top of steel and fun part was doing my job."
good,There was no real consistency with the schedules so it made it kind of hard to create a balance between personal life and work. It's a great place to work with awesome benefits.
good,très demandant comme travaille de nuit en rénovation mais très gratifiant dois être capable de travailler sous pression constante comme caissière mais belle equipe de travaille
good,Good Hours really Great People always willing to lend a hand both mangers and employees were very friendly and Helpful.
good,I learned  tremendous skills from working here. I have also used these skills in my everyday work environment. If you are looking for experience I will recommend this job.
good,I was always busy bringing in carts so they stay full for the customers. I love staying busy all the time. The weather is a very difficult thing to overcome while working outside.
good,"Really enjoyed my time while i was here. Gave great hours, was always busy and the pay at the time helped out a lot. Would work here again if pay was better."
good,"Really liked the people I worked with and enjoyed the tasks of the job. Enjoyed the customer interactions and keeping up to date on medications, etc."
good,i did not enjoy my time at Walmart due to the fact i felt i was being judged by management with everything i did... I did enjoy learning how to edit photos and the knowledge they gave on setting up phones
good,"I am hard working, get along well with others, and i am decitated to job, i help who ever needs help and stay late if needed, and come in on my days off if and when needed."
good,As a customer service manager for wal-mart you have to have excellent Customer service skills and an up beat attitude to work with Customers and Assistant managers.
good,I enjoy my job and those I work with. Unfortunately the rewards for a job well done are not compensated unless you want to move up within the company. I do not wish to be a supervisor so therefore I would get a minimum raise yearly.  I do not want to be married to the job; just want to do my job and go home.
good,"different everyday, hard to get management to answer questions,could have a good laugh but still get work done .Hardest part is the constant change and the most enjoyable part is the constant changes, never bored"
good,"High turnover so they do not value associates as much, which is not right for people in candidacy. Just giving a false hope is not right."
good,"Trying to get job done in timely matter, while learning new things that is to make job easier, having to leave your area to help in other areas. Customers being rude and not understanding you are doing your best to help them."
good,"stock merchandise"
good,"I started working over nights"
good,"Hardest part of the job is having customers dissatisfied with you or being unable to provide answers; as in most customer service/retail jobs, one can expect to have customers yell at you from time to time."
good,"Unfortunately for me my temp job didn't turn into a full time job, Likely because I didn't make friends much. I kept to myself mostly, and it made some of the workers resent me."
good,I would be assigned an area to unload inventory and clean up at a given specified hour. I would be expected to greet customers within sight of ten feet and assist them  in their shopping needs
good,"From what I've seen, Walmart has a tendency to keep their staffing levels as low as they can.  This makes for a busy and productive day.  However, you'll also find out that certain departments actually work in several locations at once.  Electronics for instance, is responsible for the connection center, photo lab, and toys.  "
good,"the position I had I enjoyed and did them to the fullest. I love working as a otc manager as pharmacy. I made a lot of people, learn a lot of things as a manager."
good,When you work with different people over top of you it is hard because they all want different things.  When you get a good review from customers the company really doesn't appreciate it except for a few.
good,Good staff but occasional high stress due to higher ups. Enjoyed working with variety of customers. Staff was helpful when needed help.
good,"My experience with Walmart was not the worst, but also not the best. For the most part the customers were pretty friendly. Management would sometimes change my schedule the day before and not give any notification, which resulted in me being late a few times. I felt like that was unprofessional and unfair. Other than that, I don't have many complaints. Check it out if you need a job and can deal with standing in one spot all day, ringing up the same items like a robot."
good,Walmart is a great company but they don't really care about their employees. The company is so large that the manager loose interest in their employees needs.
good,"Need higher pay, full-time and benefits."
good,"Decent work environment, generally quick paced although redundant at times. My fellow employees and the management in my department were loyal and always willing to help each other."
good,working at Wal-Mart was a great customer service experience but not for the long run. customers were rude and very impatient but the main key is to keep a smile on your face through it all and don't take negativity to serious.
good,"I loved my job there but i didn't like any of the management. You would always get in trouble for other peoples' mistakes and had no say in it. My coworkers were awesome and being able to work with them was probably the most enjoyable part of the job, and the hardest part was dealing with management."
good,Task already completed on other bodied described paragraph. The second thought option for the same company is not necessary.
good,Fun environment to work in. I learned to work as a team to be able to get things done ever night. The management was friendly and understanding. And a lot of really nice people work there as well.
good,walmart is a big store i had to learn every part of it like how to pick up spills or what happens when some one is stealing some was hard but i did it the hardest part was when people come in stealing the most i enjoyed was the cashier and seeing people happy when the leaving
good,Most the people at this job were good to work with. Management was pretty good as well. Production based order filling is a very fast pace job and very physically demanding.
good,The hardest part of my job was having to stand up against a manager that was brought to my attention by a cashier that he was sexually harassing her.  I loved my customers they were the best being able to serve them and assist with solving problems that they had in a way that was a win/win for everyone was very satisfying. Training new employees and giving them the tools to be successful was a pleasure.
good,good place to work nice people to work with all ways willing to show you the things you dont know or what your doing wrong i would work mostly by my self but the was all ways some one to talk to if need
good,Taking care of the customers is a priority and providing the best shopping experience that a customer can receive. Clean/Fast/Friendly is to be driven on a daily basis without any hesitation.
good,"Working at Walmart has taught me that the paycheck doesn't make the job. I currently get paid $15 an hour, and the work isn't hard. Management always has the belief that they are above you just because of their position. You aren't a coworker, you're a subordinate."
good,Working with different people was very interesting. The activities I had  to accomplish were simple at times but other times were difficult.
good,Overnight schedule is nice for you and the only thing to worry about is finishing the stocking in the right place/department. We learn safety precautions when we see danger and do the right thing.
good,"There could be times when the restaurant was slow, but what I liked about it the most was when we were busy and we all worked together as a team to see that the customer was waited on as quickly as possible."
good,I loved my job. Sometimes it could get slow and the restriction of standing b the register could be painful.Loved the customers.
good,Well it's Walmart. The people are awesome to work with. It's like a family. Management can have it's good days and bad days. The company it's self isn't great. They don't care for thier employees.
good,Good people who are willing to help you out if you need.  Fine place to work but there isn't a lot of individual attention.  It is more know you job and do your job and all is well.
good,This was my first job working in a warehouse as a unloader. a typical day was me trying to find the correct item and load it correctly on the pilots. the hardest part was dealing with all the different item numbers
good,"My day at work is very productive it helps me stay busy. I like the all work, no play, because we are all on a time schedule due to the fast-pace environment. I learned how to be more productive by staying focus on the task at hand. Although, accuracy and speed was required there.  Management is good and the coworkers were team players.  There were no hard parts of the job.  the most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with the customers and seeing how anxious and excited they were when they receive their orders."
good,"I enjoyed the experience and the friendships I built here, but I was not with the company for very long and didn't get a chance to see any advancement or learn much about the company."
good,only worked for a short period of time for this company. management at the time wasn't really great. was a cashier for the company. they did help me with my customer service skills .
good,"Good Company to work for. But if you have a family, it may be frustrating trying to establish a work life balance, due to understaffing and long hours."
good,I somewhat enjoyed working at Walmart.Most of the people were fun and cool to work with. However working in the loss prevention field can be dangerous. After a situation happened and I tried to switch departments I was told i could not.
good,not sure just started today as a shoe packer  people don't really know me or me them so it going take time to get to know each other
good,"Typical day at work, would be go out on the sales floor and help customers and trying to please management every day. The hardest part would be trying to stay busy, and stay productive. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people."
good,I learned how to communicate better with my co-workers. I also learned that I am not a mechanic. I got along with most of my co-workers. I did not let my dis like of that particular co-worker affect my work. Management was very patient and understanding with me. They tried to give me the time that I needed to learn the responsibilities of my position. The hardest part was having to learn from the very beginning how to perform the services that we were providing. The most enjoyable part was opening with one particular co-worker and the customers.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. I enjoyed working with customers and the new things that came with everyday. Some of the Management that was there during my time of employment were childish and rude but I have not see those people in the store recently.
good,It was a pleasure to work there however our store was one of the ones that closed.  I liked the small format.  It felt more like we were in tune with the community and felt as though we had more time with the associates
good,"Steady employment, multi tasks. "
good,"Junta de 10 minutos para realizar algunos ejercicios, y no empezar a trabajar en frio,te dicen lo que vas a hacer y si hay algo importante que tratar se discute en ese momento, te pones a trabajar; aprendi a superarme porque me dieron la oportunidad de estudiar mi preparatoria para poder subir de montacarguista,te apoyan mucho pero en ocaciones se les olvida que somos humanos y no maquinas, y te exigen demasiado.Mis compañeros como tos hay gente que te ayuda y otros que te tratan de molestar de alguna forma,el no tener dias festivos para pasar tiempo con tu familia y que la descarga es muy complicada por la forma en que las tiendas mandan el embalaje o mercancia,las prestaciones estan bien te ayudan para superarte en muchos aspectos."
good,If you need a job in a pinch its OK not the best not the worst. there is a lot to learn there and you will be expected to help all around the store not just your job
good,"Fun, and enjoyable time as a TLE Lube Technician.  They were willing to work around my school hours, and I was not punished for being late on school days."
good,"Working their was very stress, and the manger were rude and mean. I didn't like working their but it paid my bills. Sometimes their were good days but not a lot of them."
good,"ehhhhhhhhhhhhh I made friends and had a job so that's good."
good,Walmart is a good place to work if you enjoy working with people. I enjoy talking to people not in my department. The customers are pretty awesome especially the new ones and the ones I know we talk bout things together and we laugh
good,"Walmart is a great company to work, but can "
good,"Es un lugar que varea su ambiente de trabajo cuando hay una visita exageran mucho al grado de dejar de hacer tus actividades y hacer otras "
good,"es una buena empresa, lamentablemente el sueldo es bajo y aunque las prestaciones que ofrecen son relativamente buenas, no permite el crecimiento dentro de la empresa."
good,they are an ok company to work for but I would never go management for them. they abuse you in time you have to work. Also they force you to do fund raising.
good,"I like the job, but it's not a place I think I want to advance my career In. It is Okay. I feel I good do more with the skills that I have."
good,"Walmart is a fast paced, get it done no matter what type of environment. It is geared for the best multi-taskers in the retail world and a strong solid work ethic is necessary to succeed within their environment. The daily routine is set with high expectations of what needs to be accomplished by the end of each workers shift; regardless of the amount of staff that is on hand to assist or the number of customer issues that must be addressed. Senior Management is known for its direct, often abrasive and focused approach in order to be successful within their operations. There is an apparent lack of training and teaching for success mentality vs. a just get the job done and let the chips fall where they may approach within the operations. The hourly staff is, for the most part, focused and willing to do what is needed to help in the daily accomplishment of those set goals, however in this environment workers attendance is the main issue when it comes to the accomplishment of those set goals. Proper staffing is also an issue, while hiring goes through phases and increases or decreases seasonally, the work load or expectations does not adjust accordingly. Recently, there has also been a redirection of company goals and the direction it is going in as the world's leading retail establishment; which is yet to be seen as successful moves by the company. Overall, the most enjoyable part of this company is the people that you work with on a daily basis, while there is not a good balance with work and outside home life at times, it is the people that you work with that makes it an endurable"
good,walmart is a good job where one can move up in the company. easy to learn work and plenty of opportunities to learn new things.
good,"In this job, I learned how to make a long day productive. I tried to do task a head of time, knowing that they needed to be done."
good,It can be hectic at times but the co-workers that i've turned into family know how to cheer people up. Friendly staff that I will miss dearly.
good,"Walmart makes working in retail seem like it is terrible. I enjoyed the people, they were really nice. However, when I worked for them they needed some guidance. They seemed very unorganized and blamed their workers for it. Managers accused workers of being lazy when in all reality the problem was that they were pushing impossible tasks off on associates because if how unorganized they were. They needed to come together and be more of a team."
good,"Stepping stone, that teaches a lot. Great for college students. You will learn how to interact with customer and how to provide solutions to problems."
good,Walmart environment is ideal. Management is a little over pushy and seem to only add stress to job but customers are easy to help and great success company.
good,"Served in multiple high-volume, metro and non-metro stores, with 18 direct reports, approximately 400 associates, inventory of over $8 million, and sales of over $97 million annually.  Worked with numerous corporate innovation team project managers to develop and implement process improvements leading to cost savings across multiple departments."
good,"The job of an IMS, Inventory Management System, Associate starts with scanning labels of the products that are out or of low inventory counts on the shelves for customers. Then we use our MC40 handheld device to locate and retrieve the needed products for the sales floor so that the product can be stocked. IMS associates also assist in the counting and processing of inventory to ensure that the store is receiving the proper products from the distribution center. It is a fast paced job that requires the associate to quickly process storage locations and product UPCs in order to get the necessary product from the back room storage to the sales floor for the customer."
good,This company allows movement very easily. If you are a good worker it is relatively easy to move up in the company. It is a good company to make a career out of if desired.
good,"Aprendi a atender a los clientes acomodar mercancia asi como la limpieza de esta misma, y el trabajo en equipo."
good,The company policies are fair and the benefits are good. Management makes the experience good or bad. Had great experiences under some management and bad experiences under other managers. If you are willing to work hard and learn other areas of the company you can move up all the way to store manger if you choose. Basic retail.
good,I enjoy the people I work with and the work atmosphere. The work is constant and busy. Great place to work and build your skills.
good,Place isnt a good place to work always short staffed. Taking in patients that they cant even care for. And management is never there to help.
good,On a typical day I could assist 100 customers or more. The hardest part of the job was finding a balance between appeasing unruly customers and busyness needs. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my coworkers and helping grateful customers.
good,"Walmart is a great job if you need to pay something off, but not really a long-term job. The reason I say this is because most of the management are horrible."
good,"the people that works there was fun, energetic, and very caring. they helped me out with a lot. management went out of their way to help you out."
good,"While I enjoyed my time working for this company, I do believe that they should have tried harder to keep their good employees a part of the team. I learned a lot and met many people and can truly say that I am disappointed at the way such a global corporation handled their decision to shut down hundreds of stores and leave their employees jobless."
good,Worked with some good people and had fun. Learned Money Center duties and performed them to the best of my ability. was very enjoyable when customers were friendly and outgoing.
good,This company is a very productive company.  It has a very diverse group of staff members.  Everyone is very nice and courteous and is always willing to lend a helping hand.
good,"un día típico de trabajo era llegar puntual a la junta de 10 minutos empezar con una porra de la empresa y dialogar sobre lo que había pendiente por realizar, terminar la reunión e incorporarse al área de trabajo, para empezar el día checando correos y asignando tareas a los asociados a mi cargo."
good,"C'est un très bon emplois pour les étudiants, mais sans plus"
good,"I feel the upper management are the ones that don't have enough of a interaction with the employees. In the store I worked in I rarely saw the manager. I did see the Asst. sometimes more often. Co-workers were great, loved working with them. The hardest part for me was lifting the heavy 30 packs of soda, and the huge water packages across the scanner, if possible I just learned to ask the customer to please just leave it in the cart and I will gladly come around and use my hand scanner.  I so enjoy working with the public, I have always been a people person and I talk, I guess you could say ""a lot""."
good,il a un point négatif il n'y a pas de temps plein et les horaires change toujours de semaine en semaine
good,"El ambiente con los compañeros de trabajo es bueno, me gusta poder resolver problemáticas y dudas de los asociados, la parte difícil del trabajo es realizar actividades sin haber sido capacitada, lo cual me obliga a aprender. "
good,The training videos where worthless mainly because the people who are supposed to be the leaders (management) were way too inconsistent.
good,Walmart was a decent place to work for. I enjoyed MOST of the people I worked with. The managers were not the best. I loved all the hours I was allowed to work.
good,Being in a work environment that is fun vast and that keeps me learning and doing something new from time to time that not also expands my knowledge in my computer degree but also in everyday life
good,I was employed here for 10 years. This was my first job. I was introduced to many people and learned various new skills. There is  a chance for advancement.
good,"A lot of heavy lifting, going up and down ladders, precise measuring to make sure the aisles were straight. The co-workers there made the night of hard work short."
good,"me agrado la forma en la que me recibieron, era un buen equipo de trabajo y aprendí bastaste de uno de mis superiores el cual me transmitió sus conocimientos."
good,Wal-Mart was an educational experience for me. I learned new things that can help me further my career. It was basically just a typical job for me.
good,"Walmart allows customers to come into their stores and find all of their needs in one location.  They can have an enjoyable experience shopping there and know that they will be able to find what they need.  Walmart tries to create a family atmosphere for its associates. I've learned, due to a recent family crisis, that our family at Walmart helps its associates during the most difficult time.  When an associate is at a loss of what to do during such a devastating time, the human resource department steps in to help guide the associate.  There is a lot of advancement for Walmart's managers if they're willing to relocate and put forth the effort.  I would assume that the hardest part working for Walmart is to keep that family atmosphere.  It's such a large company and when a company gets so large it becomes impersonal.  I love to see the effect that Walmart has on a community that has been devastated by a natural disaster.  Walmart steps in to help supply water and other supplies without expecting anything in return."
good,had a great opportunity but it was short due to the opportunity given by a different employer. but it was very relaxed with few problems from the public
good,Lack of Benefits but flexible work schedule and bonus potential are items to consider if you want to work here. IF family man forget about it.
good,"Busy days filled with challenges everyday. One can learn to set mods, run top stock, fulfill customers' needs all while making friends and contacts for life."
good,"They failed to compromise on scheduling issues with my school and doctor appointments, even when told in advance. The most fun I had was leaving to go home."
good,"During the five and half years I have worked at Walmart I have had the opportunity to work in several positions, always handling large amounts of money.  I enjoy working with the public.  My favorite position is working as a cashier.   Working in the garden department "
good,il y avait quelque injustice mais sinon jaimai beaucoup cette job
good,"It was fun to learn about retail. I am not the biggest fan, as some co-workers can be very lazy and rude. The customers are also difficult to deal with, but I showed the best possible customer service I could produce."
good,I made sure the meat racks were neat and straighten and all times. I stocked inside and outside of the freezer daily. I also worked on the cash register sometimes when needed.
good,"its definitely a busy place to work with all the customers and wide variety of people. there are many opportunities for someone who is dedicated and willing to work hard, you can move up in the company or take advantage of the flexibility to where in the store you want to work."
good,"I received little formal training, and my supervisors were expecting me to complete works for 4 during a single shift despite my inexperience. I was 18 at the time and fresh out of high school, so this was something of a culture shock."
good,I would make sure the meat and frozen items were up to part and clean for the customers. I stocked the frozen meat in the freezer. I was on the cash register at times also.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. I had the oppratuty to move up in the company I also learned a lot about retail. I loved interacting  with the customers. my management team and coworkers were awesome. I enjoyed a lot about my position.
good,"Walmart is really what you make out it. Its a great job if you can get the hours. I learn how long certain meats should be out , and what temperature the meat should be before it goes bad ."
good,"It was an ok job. It was very stressful and a lot of work to do. Some of the time you get good hours and some weeks you don't. A lot of favoritism was going on, other than that its an ok job to work."
good,"Bueno lo que mas fue que me desempeñe en este trabajo fue darle ayuda a la gente como promotora y reponedora ."
good,Received great money and hours but was disorganized and could use restructuring. Would consider working for them again if weren't for the management
good,Was a quick paced environment. Having to learn new things & work with excellent co-workers made the job a lot easier. Hardest part of the job was facing understaffing issues.
good,"At this time I would not be a person that takes the customers happiness for granted. I was able to greet shoppers and often give out things for the shoppers to have, pens, buttons, Alll that make the customers happy.   Find a shopping cart for the customers."
good,"A typical work day would be organizing meats and labeling them according to expiration dates. Overall, I have learned how to be patient and deal with customers that demand immediate attention and need. I seek to move upward into a management position. The hardest part of my job is not having meats available when requested by customers due to the lack of distribution on a daily basis. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help the customers and placing a smile on their face."
good,"Learned character and skills from Wal-Mart. I definitely learned patience and how to not only treat customers, but all people. I enjoyed the new faces and new things you learned just by working there."
good,"solo fue trabajo temporal,una promocion para impulsar productos de la marca propia con espacios adicionales ,exhibiciones,colocacion de sttopers entre otras cosas."
good,"As a student, Wal-Mart's willingness to work with my schedule was extremely beneficial. Attending class during the week and working on the weekends helped me obtain my Bachelor's Degree quite comfortably."
good,Enjoyed my time there for the most part. Great people and decent pay. The annual raises and merit raises could be pretty good. Benefits weren't too bad.
good,"Wal Mart was a fun and friendly environment. I enjoyed meeting and talking to new people on a day to day basis. The only things I didnt like about it was that the breaks were too short and they didnt have a set schedule for their employers to work, you worked different hours and days each week."
good,"I enjoyed working here. I rang up customers orders, answered questions, cased checks, counted money. I put away merchandise and sorted carts to be put away."
good,"did not like huddles, enjoyed seeing new items to stock, liked meeting new people, was not a cashier, did like all the walking"
good,"Really enjoyed working with my co-workers. I had awesome managers during my time there. Management could be a little more consistent, but overall they were fair for the most part."
good,"Walmart is a very secure place to work,  They have wonderful benefits at a low cost making it affordable for everyone.  Working with a variety of people can be rewarding especially when you can make a positive impact on their life."
good,this was a good first job. got to meet lots of people and work in a growing workplace. this job also offered lots of advancement opportunities.
good,"stocked and rotated items in the dairy department daily,learned alot of things like dealing with the public being a leader,teamwork an how to properly due the job duties that was to be performed.had great co-workers.hardest part of the job was making sure all the dates were still good in the whole department.loved the job in general."
good,"Zoning the departments, helping customers as needed and answering phone calls as needed. I learned how to respond to customers needs instead of emotions. My coworkers were friendly and got the job done. The hardest part was doing a lot but barely getting paid. The enjoyable part was working with friendly people."
good,"despues de checar la entrada y saludar a los companeros verificaba en la pc cuantos trailers estaban por llegar a tienda para planear la descarga o en caso que no hubiese trailer por descargar asignar al personal a mi cargo en otras areas para acomodar,resurtir ,etiquetar etc el almacen  si se descargaba se separaba la mercancia por area y se enviaba a piso de ventas para surtir la tienda en mi caso ademas de eso trabajaba lo que es administrativo en mi area reportes de merma etc. me gustaba mi trabajo por que no era monotono siempre habia que hacer cosas diferentes la gerencia cambiaba constantemente y habia que adaptarse siempre a otros puntos de vista y formas de trabajo,siempre hubo una relacion de respeto con colegas y companeros"
good,Working with customers was my favorite part of the job. We cashiers were always willing to help each other. The Front Cashiers were helpful as well
good,"I would start the day stocking the shelf's, then if needed I would run the cash register. Help with cash drops and I would help customers to their cars with heavy bulk items."
good,"typical day was coming in and opening shop, getting paper work ready. putting stock away. most co-workers were there to do a great job."
good,"At this job I learned to be more assertive when I was with other people (customers and co-workers)."
good,I enjoyed working for here. I learned to multi-task and work independently which I enjoy. Greeting and helping customers.  My co workers were easy to work and  communicate with. The company tries to motivated you to learn and grow
good,"A typical day as a deli associate included taking care of all fresh food, keeping temps normal, making sure the area stayed clean and sanitized at all times, provide great customer service and be available for stocking at any time. "
good,"It was great working for Walmart, meeting new people was so awesome!!! I enjoyed my time their, I have really learned a lot from working their."
good,This is a good job for someone after school who needs to make a little bit of money. Not a life long job unless you can work yourself into management.
good,"work was not overly hard, management in my department was great, but overall management did not know how to work together or get on the same page. i was a seasonal worker and once moved out of my original department, it kinda fell apart for me"
good,"Assisted customers to assess their needs and provide assistance. Identified and explained different types of products.Assisted customers and educate them on the product they were about to receive.Delivered a high level of operational excellence in all areas."
good,"customer service"
good,"The work was always manageable, no matter where I was. I learned how to deal with any kind of customer, whether they were happy or angry. Management was hard, but in a way to help you get into your work so you can succeed. The co-workers were the friendliest people I've ever met in my life, they made the nights go by so much better. The hardest part was the larger truck nights with very few staff, but I always managed to get my work completed. The most enjoyable part of the job was making customers happy."
good,"Assisted customers "
good,"My daily work is to help customers find what they need and make the department look neat."
good,"They depend on the night shift way to much, and managers lacked a back bone. Typically the left hand had no idea what the right one was up to."
good,"conteo de mercancia y negativas"
good,"My experience at Wal-mart has overall been a good one. The job itself isn't much to write home about but it is a career that you can grow into. My only qualm with the company is that you can just get stuck with the worst managers and the company is almost loathe to do anything to fix the issue. Don't misunderstand there are some amazing managers that I would walk through fire and back for because they are that awesome, but most are not them."
good,"Contracted to work for 4 months worked 12 hour shifts . Learned new system just developed , processes , training , co-workers were great and worked as a team. long hours on your feet, enjoyed meeting the challenges and exceeding the goals. Set the standards for future plants."
good,Walmart is a very cool and professional place to work. You learn how to work in a professional environment and work well as a team. Learning how to inter react with costumers and employees to make the store a better place.
good,"Aprendi bastante del area administrativa y de operaciones"
good,"Worked as cashier."
good,great place to work for great people great management had a blast working there I only left because I found an other job the hardest part was the hours that I worked
good,My Walmart is smaller than most and likes associates to learn as much as they can.  I learned so much like how work in 10 different departments and how hard customer service can actually be.  The hardest part of the job is when hours get cut and it gets really bad sometimes.  My typical day at Walmart is helping out up front with checking people out then going and throwing freight out of the back room and working as many pallets as I can.  I sometimes do little projects from management.
good,"ok, I was working their just to pay for my personal expenses. It was just supposed to be a summer time job..............................."
good,"A typical day at work is physically challenging. A lot of energy and effort is exerted on a day-to-day basis. A lot of heavy lifting, climbing ladders, and working with power lifting equipment is done by me here. I am trained on both the electric jack and walkie stacker. I interact with multiple customers everyday. Either it be a customer asking for a particular product throughout the store or a customer asking for assistance in a particular department. I am capable of working in every department throughout the store but I am mostly stationed in the pet department. I scan bins in the backroom, create picks to be worked/stocked, then I stock those picks. My role in the company is an important one because whether or not a customer can find a product or is able to purchase a product is directly affected by how well or poor I do my job. I often have to stop my assigned task to help customers, other employees, or to simple take photographs of things throughout the store. Employee pictures, wrongdoings throughout the store, and promotional products throughout the store are a few examples of the many things I am asked to photograph. For the most part, I enjoy my work experience here and being able to interact with and learn from the many employees and customers that come in and out of the store on a day-to-day basis."
good,Well a typical day at work consists of helping customers and working the check out lane. If it is a slow day then we are asked to do other things that needed to be done around the store. The associates I work with are fun to be around and the managers always lend an open ear to whatever problems you may have. This job is not all that hard and the most enjoyable part is the customers.
good,"I did not feel I had enough hours, Management is very kind and understanding. energetic place to work if you like people and faced paced work"
good,Everyday I had to unload trucks and it was fun because I had co-workers there that would make it interesting and I learned how to communicate well while doing other things to make the customers happy.
good,I worked weekends during the school months 7am to 3pm every Saturday and Sunday as well as some 4pm to 11pm shifts. I learned a lot about how to work independently and how to approach different customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with such great people.
good,"clocked in, answered phones while making pages over the intercome. cleaned and straighted up my work area and my surronding areas such as the purses and lingerie"
good,"The job was always the same push carts, help people get heavy items into their vehicles. I learned how to manage time between work, school and social life. The management team was very help full when it came to asking for time off and working around my school schedule. My co-workers and I were close and would decide how we were going to to the job together has a team on busy days. The hardest part of the job was walking around in the summer heat or winter snow. The most enjoyable part of my job was how may friends I ended up making between both stores."
good,"Typical day I would start working freight. I worked with a diverse team of individuals. I learned new things throm each one of them. i had a couple different managers, and they all did their best to take care of their department and meet the needs of the employees as well as the customers.The amount of work expected to be done in one shift is what i found to be hardest with this job. I also enjoyed the challenge."
good,"doesn't pay well "
good,"They mess with the part time and full time pay periods.. standing all day, in the same spot. i have learned that people are about their work day. my co-workers some have a bad attitude. think that they are better than others. the most enjoyable day of Wal-Mart, was when you could have talked to someone who understood, where you were coming with an issue of another employee"
good,"My time at Walmart was not all bad and I found my coworkers agreeable and even fun to work with, however management is less than stellar to be sure and a number of the company's systems and policies could use work. They are also reluctant to hire full time and therefore provide benefits for their employees, even those who have worked with them for an extended period. Moreover they seem none to eager to pay their employees, and by this I mean reluctant to offer greater hours and quity strict about the working of overtime—even when situations may demand it. That said, the general work environment isn't bad and so long as one can deal with the general public well one ought to be fine."
good,Loved working for Walmart. Although there have been times when we short staffed and we would have to manage with the associates we had. Overall Walmart treats their employees very well. Managers work right beside you to get the job done. The most enjoyable part was the bonuses.
good,"Management was terrible with communication, bad disciplinary system, did not listen to Associates concerns as much as they should've"
good,"Very easy start to the day, have basic needs every day but because it was constantly changing there was always something new to do."
good,I would clean backroom get ready for freight to be received check in freight send to floor do paper work also did odd jobs dealing with too many mgrs. working in my own area
good,when every one is having a good day every one came to work on time and left on time . Everyone that work there got their work done before leaving.
good,I enjoy working with the public. Customer service is one of my best attributes. It is satisfying to know that you are a help to people.I really enjoyed working with the great people too. Some days were super busy and chaotic but it all worked out in the end.
good,"During the day, you will always be busy no matter what position you choose. Sometimes, management slacks when it comes to breaks. There are different types of co-workers but most of them get along."
good,Its a great first time job. Its super easy and the hours are okay. They pay mininum wage was kind of sucked but like I said its a good first job. Moving up seemed easy. It was cool overall.
good,"A typical day includes interaction with customers, whether it is answering questions or processing transactions. The job did help with dealing with all types of people and would definitely help one to learn to control your emotions and have more patience. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers and their outrageous demands. Many days, there would be the strangest people walking into the store. I feel like I witnessed many things that I would not if I had this work experience. Overall, management was not so bad and the co workers made the job more enjoyable."
good,i have worked at 3 different walmarts all are the same they are for pleasing the customers making sure they come in to great customer service the pay is okay and can be more wit wat we have to deal wit but its a job very friendly and nice ppl to work around though
good,i loved my job but didnt like how management do their job. loved the hours as well as the wage. i was willing to grow with the company since i had been working with them for 3 years.
good,Was an alright place to work. The management team was a little bit unhelpful or unreasonable at times. The work hrs were ok. Associates were fun to work with.
good,"Work days are usually hard but bearable, I learned how to stock shelves and give customers great customer service, management is a mixed bag consisting of both competent and incompetent individuals, my co-workers are a mixed bag as well, the hardest part of the job was working in an unorganized environment, the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with interesting people."
good,"Some of the people where great, hated dealing with all the stupidity every night. Its not a bad job for people who are looking for their first job."
good,Learned a lot while working there. people in charge changed so many times to the point where it seemed almost impossible to stay on track as a company
good,"I loved working at Wal-mart."
good,"Stocked shelves, ran a cash register, co-workers were awesome. The hardest part was during holiday season, you were very busy."
good,Start with meeting and stretching . According what job you had you would need to perform said job at a minimum production rate of 95%. The only job that paid incentive for over the 95% mark was order-filling!
good,"It was good. I had nice bosses but since I was temp I was laid off. The sad part about that was I was laid off DURING work, and they STILL wanted me to finish work for the rest of the day and I had JUST started."
good,"Walmart is a great place to work; however, I feel sorry for the managers because they are constantly fearful of losing their jobs."
good,"Good place to start with , show me the right way to deal with customers and make a good communication ,give the opportunity to make good friend"
good,"While the job itself can be cool because of the people around you, the compensation as a manager does not match the hours that you have to put in."
good,"- 10pm-7am, giving the sales floor crew what they needed to fill the shelves. Anything that was returned had to be stocked. Anything that was new and not needed off of trucks were stocked."
good,I am currently the dept manager for the toy dept and from the moment I clock I never stop. From helping customers to doing paper work and working freight. I have to make sure my product is on the shelf and the count on the product is correct. Along with the pricing of the merchandise. I work along side some great people and we all work together as team very well. I get along with everyone i work with from management to the associates. The most enjoyable part of my job is that is get to work with the public. I am big people person.
good,A typical day is just standing there waiting for customers and then scanning and bagging their items. I received more customer service experience. The co-workers are probably the best part of my job.
good,"Conocí personas de todo tipo, desde las que son humanas y responsables hasta las que son tóxicas e irresponsables."
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart for me is always smiling and helping the customers with finding stuff or walking with them to show them a certain game. I learn that not everyone that walks into walmart is not happy so that's why I make it my job to always be polite and friendly and you never know you  may turn someone frown to a smile. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful. The hardest thing working at walmart is always staying positive and going beyond your work and getting your check and it does not match how much you been working. The most thing I enjoy about Wal-Mart is the positivity.
good,"Everyday is different, there is no set schedule for how the day is ran.  I love the associates and my peers, however times can be stressful especially during the holiday times.  It has taught me to be patient and quick on  my feet.  The hardest part is firing people sometimes."
good,"Walmart was a good job until some managers decided to change the rules of the store I work at. I didn't really learned anything at the job because it was mostly negative environment. The co-workers was great people to work with, but the manager was the negative point of the job."
good,My overall experience was not the greatest. I did not work here to long. But I gave heard that they are under new management and have really cleaned the place up.
good,"Hard workers get unrealistic expectations from managers. While the slower and lazier workers have the most minuscule amount of work and don't get bothered , due to the managers way lowered expectation of them. I would say the hardest thing about the job is keeping yourself sane while you and a few others pick up the slack for the entire store. Work would be more enjoyable if management enforced the times given to each task, so that one person isn't taking care of half the store by themselves."
good,"Scheduling was unorganized."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, pagos puntuales, prestaciones de ley y los pagos son por tarjeta"
good,"running a register ,answering the phone for tire quotes,stocking shelves ,helping customers find what they are looking for"
good,The wal-mart distribution center is a very well organized family oriented environment. They maintain a clean work area and are surrounded with great people.
good,"A typical day at work for me is okay. I fall in where I'm needed most in my department that day. It gets over whelming when you have more than one member of management giving you more than one special project done for that day or when you have a lot of customers and not enough staff to get your projects done. Management will help if task are to hard for one or two people. "
good,helped customers stocked shelve and worked the cashier. I enjoyed my job it wan not hard to do and I enjoyed my coworkers The management worked with the employees and were easy to talk to.
good,i mainly worked on the computer organizing files using microsoft word and excel. Overall its a laid back environment and it not bad for an entry level job.
good,Customer service is a hectic and stressful a times but the satisfaction customers get from my services is what keeps me going and that keeps a smile on my face and gladness to my heart and that is what makes my job enjoyable.
good,typical night was stocking shealves. the ppl i worked with were nice n kind. i did find that job hard it was a small store. i learned how product got putt away
good,"Better opportunities and policies are clear and available at any given time."
good,"checking out costumers  in a timely manner, really didn't learn much there, management was not the best, co-workers was fun to be around, dealing with rude people, helping people shop."
good,es grande la empresa pero confortablejjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjjj
good,Set up the pallets and start unloading the merchandise off of the truck on to the pallets. The hardest part of the job was unloading all the merchandise to the sales floor also unloading on 2 truck days and the most enjoyable part of the job was the lunch breaks because we all got together and ate in the break room.
good,"Yo era jefa de panadería, la dirigía en cuanto a producción atención, pedidos, limpieza, etc."
good,"I'm not there anymore and I dont plan on ever going back there. The management is horrible and communication sucked. My co workers  were good and easy going . I enjoyed the customers,but sometimes the customers could exaggerate situations"
good,I was responsible to loading and unloading shipments. Organize the packages. sort them by their number. deliver them to the floor. stock the shelves.
good,"A day at work at Walmart involves tasks that have to do with carrying heavy boxes"
good,Unload truck and stock freight. Not present much. Co-workers were helpful. Unloading trailers. Being able to talk with co-works while working.
good,"This job was difficult do to personal family issues that acquired. This job had not compassion, they were very inconsiderate of my feelings."
good,This Job is very conservative. Managers work with you to accompany school schedules very well. This job also gives you a chance to get certifications to advance you in the job world.
good,"Easy job to do, not much labor, although working with multiple associates you can feel a sort of tension. Other than that, it's really a nice place to work at. Just people sometimes take there aggression out on you - which puts you in an odd position. Otherwise it's awesome."
good,"I did enjoy working with the other employees. However, the management at the time was not up to par. The work was always unappreciated. No communication skills within the work place, which is always a bad thing."
good,"As an HR Manager a typical day consists of reviewing applications, scheduling interviews, processing new hire paperwork.  Included in a typical day would be processing Leave Of Absence papers, assisting associates with questions regarding Benefits, Payroll corrections, Time Off requests, etc.  I find the position as HR Manager satisfying and enjoyable knowing that I can help others achieve their career goals while insuring compliance of company SOP."
good,I liked it til the managers wouldn't let me go home while being sick which I had strep throat. They were hateful towards everybody. There is some really nice people you work with. They keep cutting hours back to where you want to quit working there.
good,"This is a demanding job.  I found that it did not work well for the family life, mostly because you work every weekend.  However it does offer great advancement opportunities."
good,"Walmart is a good company to move up in. Sometimes the managers show favoritism to the employees. Other than that, the store has affordable insurance (fulltime),401k, shares, etc."
good,"Dealt directly with a variety of customer issues, to include returns, exchanges, complaints, money transfers, check cashing, and bill payments. The hardest part was irregular hours."
good,we have to clean are areas stock the register product and also handle the money in the register and  take care of the custmours
good,A typical day at work was getting all the baskets in the store. Managers would help you if you need help. Co-workers were pretty helpful. Hardest part of the job was working by your self. Best part of the job was getting off work and getting paid
good,The company was willing to work around my school schedule and a pretty good job task But the company wouldn't give much hours that were needed.
good,"The company is pretty decent and relatively fair with individuals who are still in school or going back to school. Worked there through my high school and college years and the hours stayed pretty consistent: school on the weekdays and work during the weekends. On college winter/summer breaks they allowed full time before reverting back to weekends when school started up again. Management is decent but a few of them are sitting a little too high on their horses to really hear what most associates are trying to communicate. Most coworkers are nice, but some seem like they were hired just because they raised their hand."
good,Management here was terrible. They would always blame each other for the same mistakes they all contributed towards. Will never work for walmart again. Pay was not so good either.
good,"You as an individual may have great customer service, but not your coworkers. We always get complaints and have problems at the store. only good part is advancement and benefits ."
good,"Wal-Mart is a good place to work if you have the right mind set. It really teaches you a lot of patience. Not just with customers, but with management. It's not my favourite place to be, but it's currently helping me pay off my loans and credit cards."
good,"Cashier, customer service in appareal, and jewelry associate. Fast paced, always on your toes. Customer oriented, well worth the time."
good,"Llegar a mi turno recibir el préstamo y sentarme a marcar en la caja que mis supervisores me digan,aprender en realidad no mucho ya que faltan capacitaciones, mis compañeros la mayoría ya llevan muchos años en la empresa, mi parte mas difícil del trabajo es salir todos los días muy tarde a las 23 0 2330 hrs, lo que mas me gusta de mi trabajo es trabajar con diferentes tipos de personas y clientes."
good,Walmart was a good job things didn't constantly change out of the blue. it had great benefits and opportunities along with great starting pay and lengthy lunch breaks.
good,You dont have a set schedule. You dont have set hours. You run out of new stuff. And you seem to make alot of people mad when you dont have something in stock.
good,Walking around the parking lot gathering carts and when needed helping customers carry out items. Sometimes we would have to clean the parking lot and clean out the carts from when customers would litter.
good,I liked working with my co workers. Enjoyed communicating with customers. Was good at what I did. Company didnt acknowledge the good employees they did have.
good,A typical day at work was fine. My co workers and managers were very  nice. It wasn't really a hard job. It was a nice first job.
good,Working at Wal-Mart was a fairly positive experience. I worked there one summer while studying as an undergraduate. I mainly was looking for a job that would get me out of my comfort zone and help develop essential workplace skills.
good,"My typical day at work was unloading and putting up freight, helping unload the trucks when they came in, helping customers, checking out customers, making keys and custom paint, cleaning up my departments which was called ""zoning"", and helping out the neighboring departments. I helped out my coworkers in the neighboring departments because I thought it was the thoughtful, professional, and team player thing to do. A lot of times it required for me to learn a lot of new things on the fly especially during the peak hours of the store."
good,Stock merchandise from backroom. I also maintained order in the backroom and from time to time managed the grocery department.
good,"Management was not supportive of employees,  Store was dirty,"
good,Walmart brought out a strong side of my work ethics. This store challenged me a lot and brought a lot of pressure with it but I stood strong and got through it.
good,"I worked the 3rd shift, restocking shelves. I enjoyed working with management and co-workers, they were very pleasant. I loved being apart of a team that worked and cared for each other."
good,"I worked here for about 3 months, retail just isn't for me. It was a good job overall. I got along with all my coworkers, it had a very friendly atmosphere."
good,I choose not to review the company because i have nothing to say about them at this time and wish to not be asked this every time
good,"Interesting place to work,  Management should have been move supporting and understanding.  Sometimes it wasn't about the customer or giving great customer service but about the drama going on in the store and the employee's lives.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the customers."
good,"The people were rude, and management at the beginning was great.  After new management came in, it was terrible to work here."
good,Product selection was not very good quality and there would be days that we did not have a doctor and would sit around all day looking for something to do.
good,It was OK.  Walmart was my first real retail experience. Had some fun working with the employees at my stores.  I found out while I was there that I enjoyed customer service and helping my customers.  Would consider working there part-time to supplement another full or part-time job.
good,"be prepared to be thrown to the wolves with minimal training, and expected to know everything within a week. if your supervisor doesnt know the answer they will find a way to make it look like you should already know and say they wabt you to look it up for yourself"
good,"I operate the cash register, take responsibility of locked up merchandise and keys, take charge of site to store merchandise requests for management, stock merchandise, pull and move pallets, and assist customers with purchases, requests and questions about electronic sales and merchandise."
good,"productive and has a family environment."
good,I worked three departments a night and most of the time with no help.  I would stock the pet department alone but I would always get it done.  It was hard work but I was able to do it.
good,it's a good and fun environment to work around. the people and managers there are all great and fun to work with. you have to be on top of your game and make sure that the store is always neat and clean.
good,"Excellent experience. Lots of assignments, fortune 100 company, project management, financial management, business process analysis, budgeting, forecasting, comparisons, variance analysis and submission of hypothesis."
good,Mass production company. Always busy and interacting with people. The management was ok and co workers were friendly.
good,"I worked there as a stocker and always had fun meeting new shoppers.  Walmart is a real laid back place, but the pay wasn't that good when i worked there 9yrs ago."
good,"I wouldn't recommend it, but it does pay well. If no other opportunities are available, then it is a good job to increase your income. The hours and work load can be very erratic at times, however."
good,Locla bom para desempenhar o trabalho. Precisa apenas melhorar em relacao a transparencia nos processo seletivos internos.
good,This was a great company in order to learn many skills in retail and customer service.  I enjoyed learning about the products and the friendships amongst the employees.   While I think the incentive programs were great the acknowledgement from the top of the company was lacking.  However big corporations cant help that I suppose.
good,thinks people can live on less the 20 hours a week and give people not in the right position or pay grade more responsibility then what they are suppose to have and then treats them like the should be able to do it with no problem.
good,"I worked Walmart as a front end associate before being promoted to the vision center. When working the front end I had to maintain a clean work space, help customers with checking out, getting carts when none were available. I also had to work the service desk and money center. For everything I did on the front end the pay wasn't enough so I applied for the vision center to further my career. When I worked in the vision center it was slow at first but became fast paced. Helped customers with selecting glasses and doing contact lens training. The training could have been better for the vision center especially with using laboratory equipment. I felt so lost sometimes because I couldn't verify a prescription properly on certain equipment because I wasn't trained or it was outdated."
good,typical day at work was same thing just difeerent day different customers or same customers...management was good...co workers were ok....nutin was hard i learned how to balance tires and learned to take tires off the rim and put them back on
good,Some days are more busier than others like the weekends and holiday season. Co-workers are nice and very helpful. Nice to conversate with the customers.
good,"Never a moment when I'm not working, I assist as many customers that I can and if not I'm always willing to find someone who can help them better than myself."
good,"There was a lot of  variety in what I did each day, ranging from the monotonous tasks to new projects that were challenging and exciting. I gave to opportunity to work at your own pace."
good,"Hired, trained, and evaluated personnel in sales establishments, promoting or firing workers when appropriate. Determined price schedules and discount rates."
good,"Overall its an ok job. Some managers are really cool while others try to run Wal Mart like boot camp. A lot of times other co workers will slack off and you have to end up doing their work as well. Then when it doesnt get done, management chews you out instead of the person that should of had it done."
good,"es la cadena de supermercados mas grande de estados unidos cuenta con una gran variedad de venta de productos al pormenor desde textil, alimentacion,productos de belleza,farmacia hasta tecnologia."
good,The work is good. The Co workers are good but the cutting of hours and extending the hours on short notice isn't ideal.  The work is nice as you always learn something new.
good,The co-workers at this job were really cool and friendly nice workplace. The most enjoyable part of this job was around the holidays.
good,"como foi meu primeiro emprego aprender muito com sistema operacional aprender sabe lidar com as pessoas respeitar, lidar com as que nunca imaginei a lidar hoje posso falar quer qualquer serviço posso lidar e ser um bom profissional ."
good,"une journée de travail a Walmart est simple, j'ai pas appris grand choses.il y a une politique incompréhensible, la gestion des choses se font différemment, mais l'aspect le plus agréable que j'ai vécu la bas ce sont mes anciens collègues,eux ils ont rendu l’atmosphère un peu plus détendue."
good,"Walmart has a lot of opportunities to develop within the company. The work environment is fact-pace but enjoyable. Can be a lot of hard manual labor depending on your job description, but overall a decent place to start a career."
good,"Decent amount of groceries to pick out each morning. We start at 4 am and don't leave til about 1:30. People can order an abundance of things and often times my co workers would get very overwhelmed."
good,"I enjoyed working here because i get to meet really cool people, but management is never on track and will always want you to do everything else but your job."
good,"Cashier is slow-moving and poor customer service. However, they do not have strict guidelines, which makes a friendly environment for customers."
good,Generally 55ish hour weeks. Decent pay and benefits. Promote from within. Assistant managers are disposable. New changes are positive but it's retail so not enough people/hours to fulfill responsibilities.
good,Started as Overnight stocker and work my way up to Department Manager in Fashion. For the most part it was a good job. Worked for Walmart for 7 years.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was a great experience, working had and interacting with co workers and customers. The company has great benefits and a lot of opportunities to further your career within the company."
good,It is not a bad place to work. The people are fun and the job is ok. the only problem is that it is hard to get promoted. They promote the people who don't work the hardest just to keep the hard workers were they are.
good,"In the beginning things are going along well, until they tell you to meet unrealistic expectations with your time. Management was disorganized and unaware of the staff limitations."
good,"I liked my job at Walmart but there were some downsides. Working midnight's , you dealt with interesting characters. I enjoyed making above minimum wage , and here I also worked with really awesome people. I didn't like how predictable each night was going to be. And my nights always seemed to drag since once assigned to an area, your not allowed to leave that area. So once your stocked, you wipe everything down and no customers are in sight , you kind of just stand there and that was definitely a con for me."
good,Given many opportunities to expand my skill set and knowledge of many departments within the company. Provided lots of training to assist advancement within the company.
good,"My main job at WalMart was ensuring the general merchandise truck was unloaded before our lunch break. This included, sorting freight by department, sorting and hanging apparel, scanning in electronics items, and sorting mixed boxes by aisle.After that half the crew was sent to sort the grocery truck while the rest pulled pallets of freight to the floor. After lunch we were tasked with finishing pulling the gm truck and with pulling the grocery truck. The rest of our shift was spent cleaning the backroom, stocking merchandise, and bining overstock items. This job required our crew to work very closely to accomplish or job in the required time and our management was always available to help as well as hear concerns. The most difficult part of the job was getting the truck unloaded, while the easiest part was the clean up at the end of the day."
good,"I was a cashier for the Walmart on jungermann, the staff was nice and supporting, the pay wasn't too good. I was offered a different position that the higher ups said was a promotion, but when I did some research found that the position was, less pay and harder work. When I told the manager, he promptly reprimanded the supervisor. Lunch was an hour long every 6 hour to 8 hour shift that I did."
good,Walmart is a company that employees mostly high school kids and people who are just passing through when they are actually working for something more.  Walmart doesn't really care for their employees as much as they care about bringing in the money.
good,"Fun work place at times. Good benefits and opportunity to grow in a healthy environment. Management and co-workers work as a team. Sometimes is difficult to manage too much pressure, especially during holidays. It is a fun fast passed environment."
good,"The stores are always very busy, and although it can get crazy at times, your coworkers and some management make it bearable. As long as you have a good team with you, at the end of the day it's enjoyable."
good,"Cashier, customer service, jewelry section, media center, garden center, and dressing room. Although my job description was a cashier I was flexible and willing to learn more about Wal-Mart."
good,I work the service desk . Every day is a learning experience .Management is there to help when anyone needs help with anything. My co-workers are lots of fun to work with . Working with the public is the best part of the job.
good,"I loved working at Walmart in Pocahontas AR! I made friends really quick, as well as the pay was decent, and they were really flexible with my schedule. And due to being a single mom, that is something that I needed dearly! If I could, I would work there again."
good,"It was Fine. Fine workplace with fine management. Fine numbers and fine growth and development. Fine amount of red tape and politics, but its expected of a company. It was fine working alongside my colleagues and learning a fine amount from them. It was fine even when it was busy."
good,"I learned how to use a register "
good,"my years working at walmart I saw favoritism, lack of job responsibilities with supervsors, needs to be more organized"
good,Love the fast pace and getting to talk to different people. Cleaned isles and shelves in down time. Handled any and all forms of payment.
good,"I worked at Walmart for 3 years. I worked many evenings and weekends while I was in highschool. They always gave me shifts and paid me decent for the work I did. My supervisors were good people and I liked my coworkers, ended up leaving after I finished school and found a better paying job but I liked the time I was there. Good job for a high school student."
good,there was no order of things they didn't have much to do and the fact they kept  on getting back stock. I like shopping there but that's is it
good,"Cashiers also take responsibility for handling returns and answering questions about merchandise, store policies, and ongoing promotions. Work environments include checkout aisles at store frontends. Cashiers sometimes assist sales and stock associates with remedial tasks during slow hours."
good,"Working for the walmart in Glenpool, Oklahoma was a new experience for me. working the day shift it was a steady day every day. working overnights however was completely different, they expect a lot more out of each employee and I was treated almost as a manager, without the pay. I was given many responsibilities beyond my job code but I always rose to the occasion without being asked"
good,"I usually stock half of my shift. Then after lunch i wax floors until the store opens. I use the zamboney to scrub the floors, i also sweep, mop and clean the bathrooms."
good,Walmart over hires and has company wide hour cuts. Management is on different pages and require different things that contradict the other.
good,Counsel patients on medications and provide medication therapy management and immunizations; work in a fast-paced environment
good,Worked Over Night Eleven to Seven Stocking & Arranging Groceries. Drove A Hour To Work Four Days Out The Week. The Pay Was Good But Not Great !
good,Workplace needed lots of help. Employees were overworked and under paid. Management did not want to listen to employees and was unwilling to help.
good,"Good place to work!  Quarterly bonuses if the store does well, and a chance for manager bonus if store sales are above market sales plan.  High stress work environment can sometimes make you feel like you are drowning, but if you do your job, you are okay."
good,"Retail experience for the past 15 years.  Friendly environment, where everyone helped each other in the different departments within the store."
good,"Not knowing everyone in the store. Doing the same thing every shift."
good,"I was good to have my first Job experience with Wal-Mart, I had a chance to work with such a well diverse group of people, which I loved."
good,"Good experience working here, fun workplace, flexibility as far as hours go. Management puts certain requests off to the last minute, and do not take into consideration suggestions. Overall, Walmart is an alright place to work as long as your manager is willing to work with you."
good,Can be a bit stressful but otherwise it's a basic retail job so what can you expect? You get an hour lunch and two paid 15 minute breaks so it's alright. They'll work around your schedule if necessary.
good,I learned how to set floor plans. How to do all my manager skills on the Gemini. How to supervise my associates. I did price changes and ins and outs.
good,Work is physically demanding but they're willing to give you hours if you're willing to work them and for that I am grateful.
good,"came to work to build display end-caps and floor stacks as well as stock shelves and help customers find what they need ,also when not on the floor i worked ics(inventory control) in the back room"
good,Walmart provides the opportunity for growth for anyone in the retail business. There are opportunities to grow in management.
good,"Very stressful for hourly associates because of high work load and low wages.  Extremely stressful for all salaried members of mgmt in that mgmt picks up work load left by all hourly associates but mgmt is paid very handsomely.  Most important thing learned during my 14 yrs of retail mgmt with Walmart is that no matter what, Walmart is at the top the food chain when it comes to retail.  They retain talent at the mgmt level because they pay their managers.  Mgmt oftern times stay simply because no other retailer pays what Walmart pays at the different levels of mgmt.  But taking that in consideration, many mgrs trade high pay for high stress and a definite lack of work life balance.  So to sum it up, if you can be successful in Walmart retail, you can be successful at any other retailer."
good,"Typically I would not bad mouth any company EVER, but the management team that i worked under was not the best. Lack of communication and constantly changing the routines led to a lack of store moral and the attitudes of the employees as well."
good,Requires a sense of urgency to accomplish the goals of customer satisfaction.  A large volume store like this one needs more staffing in order to keep the sales floor ready for customers.
good,"Working has brought be great joy and having friendly, positve and up beat coworkers has made my working expericence a positve and enjoyable life experience. I did not find any hard parts of my job. Greeting people, stocking, shelves, carry heavy items out for customers was a normal day at work for me and managment was always understanding and great to be around. I learned that having many possible solutions to problems is very handy espically when dealing with customer compliants and ect... To be honest, the most enjoyable part of my job(s) would be my break, the second one would be talking to people and helping with there concerns and questions."
good,Proactive company on the front edge of compliance however that made it hard to balance and also make patient care a priority
good,a typical day at wally world is finding out what register your on signing onto it and going straight to work from there on. The co-workers I worked with were fun and energetic and got the job done
good,Not the job for me. Little supervision at night so any issues you have with other employees or customers it seems your have to deal.
good,"very laid back, but straight to the point. very repetitive but also somewhat enjoyable. the hardest part was the overnight schedule."
good,"Provided excellent customer service; Assisted customers in a variety of ways including directions around the store to"
good,an amazing place to work with amazing managers and coworkers the hardest part was making sure every customer was satisfied
good,Busy and fast paced.  Always something to keep you busy!  I like the interaction with the customers!  Management was professional and prompt to take care of a problem.
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for, be it full time or part time. There is always a job available and many ways to move up. The management is friendly and helpful and so is the remainder of the staff. I would work here again if need be."
good,Very good learning experience and training in retail management. Growth potential. Employee discount is very useful.
good,"The company is changing. There are still great people but with time, the bond between employees and the corporation is fading away due to recent organizational changes."
good,This is a company that allows for growth and placement within the business. Great for college students to start off working at
good,working at Walmart is ok for a temporary job. Not ment to be a permanate job unless you love retail. It is the first job ive ever had and I am very grateful for it.
good,"I cleaned bathrooms and helped out customers when needed ,I enjoyed being around new people it was an ok job it paid and took care of bills"
good,"After leaving 4B's I went to work at Wal-Mart, it was fairly new and seemed like a good place to work at. I started out as a cashier and quickly moved up to a trainer and to the customer service area. I enjoyed training because it allowed for more interaction with employees and customers. The customer service gave me experience with large amounts of cash and wiring money as well as the rules and regulations. The most enjoyable part of the job was going home. I left this job to go and work at the Silver Spur."
good,"working here depends on who is in charge and what kind of day they are having. sometimes you lose your head because too many things are happening and no one is organized about things are done, they have system but don't use it."
good,Great company to work for. Great culture and management. Wonderful atmosphere for committed workers. Opportunity for growth is really good.
good,"Very busy, always something to learn. Great team players. Department managers were long term and always helping out in others areas as needed. I loved being able to training new associates for long term employment. Learned something each time that we all were together working a project. Lack of management communication is alway a problem with in a big company."
good,"For walmart to be a fortune 500 company they should offer more pay as well as benefits to their employees, management was very inconsiderate of employees life outside of the company"
good,"It's mostly about the numbers. We had a couple of upper managers that seemed like they cared about us. You are on a strict time table, and if a manager comes along and has you help with something else you are still responsible for your daily task even if you don't have enough time to finish."
good,this is a fast-paced work place with supportive management.Department managers will be responsible for not one but many departments.The most enjoyable part of the job were my co-workers and fellow department managers.
good,Busy environment and not enough help to go around. They expect you to do the job of two people. The hardest part is trying to keep the shelves.
good,"I enjoyed my job at Walmart. Management was terrible. I enjoyed the people i worked with more than the job itself. The job was not hard, but i worked many hours with very little time for school, and my management did not care about my personal needs."
good,"the portrait studio was a company with in the Wal-mart umbrella. doing family photography , school photography , wedding ect "
good,"asignar puestos  amis compañeros, cierre de la tienda y taller mecánico total funcionamiento de las alarmas así como entrada y salida de las mercancía general y peresederos"
good,Help customer. making them smile and keeping the store up. The hardest part of the job at first was trying not to go to sleep on break because it was 3rd shift.
good,management could be alot better co workers could be alot more  friendly and helpful the hardest part is dealing with the crazy customers enjoyable is te night fly's by
good,"Poor management - spoke derogatorily to associates both over the walkie system and in face to face interactions, did not back up verbal statements with appropriate physical actions."
good,"management not very professional, fast pace environment, learn how to deal with different type of people. hardest part of the job was finding managers and getting them to do their job."
good,the hardest part of the job is dealing with all the political and favouritism stuff that goes on there. the most enjoyable part of the job is the customers and the co-workers.
good,great company to work with. some schedules are crazy. you will learn a lot depending on what department you work in. customers are nice but some are not so nice
good,Big company. Upward mobility is definitely possible. Work hours are always available. Sometimes difficult to balance work and life schedule.

good,"typical work day"
good,Team based work environment very focused on making sure the customer is always satisfied. Meeting great associates. Developing great resources.
good,"I worked in the backroom where it was very congested and over crowded. We couldn't stage anything outside of there when it was needed for other work including unloading trucks, causing very dangerous conditions. I mentioned it multiple times to no avail. Hence my looking for something better."
good,"Decent job, with great opportunities. Friendly co-workers, flexible management. unloading 2 trucks in 4 hours was the most difficult thing to accomplish, and pulling pallets to the floor was the easiest."
good,"I learned a great deal working for Wal-Mart.  I learned the importance of customer service and satisfaction.  I learned that if you go a little above your job, the rewards are endless. "
good,good job fast pace good workout stocking shelfs is really what the job consists of you clean as well. its ok nothing special
good,"The work was versatile and never boring. We were constantly faced with new challenges and introduced to new products. In any given day I could be tasked to work in several different departments which I love as it gave me something new to look forward to and new experience. The pay was decent and I was offered benefits as a full time employee. The discount card I was provided with was especially nice."
good,"Its a OK company to work for, good people, managers are respectful, overall it was a good company just wanted something different."
good,buen compañerismo prestaciones aunque los horarios no ayudan.
good,"Got along with my coworkers reasonably well."
good,I enjoyed working at walmart in the freezer/dairy departments cause it is a very busy part of the store. I also enjoyed interacting with the customers.
good,"I've worked for the Walmart in Magnolia AR for almost 8 years now, and at times I've wondered if company at large expects these stores to run themselves. The worst part of the job (at least at Magnolia AR Wal-Mart): Scheduling is an utter nightmare. "
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but you preform and progress. The best part is learning new skills'
good,This is a good place to work because it teaches you to work with people and help them. I was able to learn a lot about the culture of emergency medicine.
good,"I was able to go to school, work, and have a family life. The managers are willing to work with people that are attending school."
good,"Despite what you hear, working for this company is not as great as it sounds. The bottom line is that they are more concerned with making money then their employees health and welfare."
good,"Over my 13 years of service I have been able to move up within the company.  As an Assistant Store Manager operations, associates, and customers were focal points."
good,I loved  working for Wal-Mart I had a great time loved the people there and all of the customers that came in and they way the ran things were okay could have done better but I enjoyed it a whole lot
good,"Nice to be in charge of your own area for organization, order placement, and stocking. Fill up carts, take to the aisle and fill shelves, unload trucks, that's the usual day. Some fun activities would pop up time to time, cookouts, parties. Over all a nice place to work. Only down sides, Assistant managers were pushed hard. You could tell by their actions at times that they were getting frayed at the edges. Had one suspend our entire team for doing what he told us to do, help out another section for a holiday display, finished the job, then he suspended all of us, and called the police to remove us from the store before we could even clock out. He quit right after we left the store, no paper work filed after the incident. Upper management asked about why we skipped work, told them what happened, big fiasco over it.  Had another manager come in, Walmart is big on customer service, Helped a lady get help at the meat counter, was right next to where I worked, manager came over and screamed/cursed me out on the sales floor right in front of everyone, including children. I left that day and got another job. Upon my return to file my paperwork, I learned that the manager had went on a rampage because he had found out I had I left and had another job by that afternoon. He made threats to physically attack me if I was ever in the store again. He got sent to the hospital over that meltdown."
good,A typical day at Walmart was fairly easy. working the cash register and helping customers was my main task. often times I would get moved around departments and was assigned various tasks. team work is a big thing at Walmart so working in a group is not a problem for me.
good,"go.t to work 1pm filled produce wet wall. bananas, fruit and vegs. Cleaned floors at night to get ready for morning crew.lifting heavy freight."
good,"the job required a fast paced working environment- the line ups were always long and customers consistently in need of assistance. The job required me to work diligently, quickly and efficiently. Overall staff were very friendly and it was a collegial work environment."
good,On a daily basis i ensured that all assigned evening tasks were completed by the end of shift. Not all co-workers were the best to be around due to laziness and the lack of technical skills. I learned patience and delegation skills to those that are difficult to supervise. The best part of the job had to be the flexible schedule.
good,A typical day at work consisted of pulling the frozen truck down stacking pallets and keeping the meat wall full. Operating the pallet jacks. Also keeping the customers happy. I learned how to make the customers happy and meet their needs. How to maintain the workplace clean while handling raw meat. Management was okay there but they wasn't consistent on doing things. Co-workers were good. The hardest part of my job was doing everybody elses job plus mine. The most enjoyable part of my job was making the customers happy.
good,"Backroom not very organized."
good,"good workplace , knowledgeable co-workers, assisting others. Management was always willing to help and teach so I was able to do my job as quickly and with the least amount of mistakes."
good,A lot of opportunity to learn a variety of different skills and business areas.  Great area to raise a family.  The sky is the limit.
good,"I have worked for Walmart for almost four years. The compensation is horrible but the benefits are great. Great job for the younger demo, bad if you plan on working there later in life."
good,Under staffed majority of the time. Causes staff to feel overwhelmed and under appreciated and pay doesnt compensate for the duties required.
good,I work there and have been there since 2009. It is a retail store and a very successful organization end of story.I  have no further comments or remarks this company about
good,"Working for Wal-Mart made me feel young again, like I was back in high school. The staff was so diverse everyone had a differing opinion."
good,It's a new store and it is already on its second store manager. Understaffed and most of the staff it does have would probably be passed over in another town. The assistant managers are good; the current store manager not so much.
good,"it was ok for my first experienced but i learned has a young adult you need to take your life serious, that's the reason why after Walmart i went back to school"
good,"Job was good and fun to be at when working in the Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania store. Was very different once I worked in Wilmington, nc."
good,Walmart is a good place to work and interesting place to work and gain experience. it gives you the opportunity to make comparison
good,Fast paced work environment with supportive management. Flexible schedules and great team work. The most enjoyable part of my job at Walmart is working with other colleagues who also enjoy what they do. I had a lot of different experience in all kinds of departments.
good,Great first job if you are just starting out in the world. management can be a little uptight and not really listen to your problems.
good,A typical day was doing the tasks and jobs that needed to get done on a daily basis. There was a lot to learn on the job from how to deal with customers to how to deal with the warehouses. Management was there to try and help when you had a problem. Co-workers were there when you needed a helping hand. The hardest part was to tell the customers that what they wanted was not in-stock at the moment. The most enjoyable part was when everyone worked together to get the tasks or jobs done.
good,"The new management that came in is doing a lot of positive changes, The associates very receptive to the change of culture, and its nice to see the a well oiled machine in motion"
good,"A typical day at work is busy, fast-paced challenging, and filled with cash handling duties and customer interactions. I enjoy interacting with people and it is my pleasure to care for their needs and provide solutions to any problems that they may encounter."
good,"The stores that I worked with were great, but I cannot speak for every store in the walmart chain. I did receive some great training while working for the store."
good,I learned to perform customer service in a high paced environment. I learned many things about the mechanics of a retail operation.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is when you are able to meet all of a customers demands and have them walk away happy and satisfied because you know that they will be back because of the good service that they experienced with you.
good,"Concerned with numbers, not so much the well being of individual employees.  Work with great people and some great management.  Management is not the same throughout the whole company, quiet a bit of politics and inconsistencies.  The best part of my job is the strong bonds and friendships I have made.  I have learned to work consistently in difficult situations and deadlines, at times without proper guidance or equipment.  They cook out for us often as a way of showing appreciation."
good,"I do enjoy working at walmart dealing with the public and be a challenge but also rewarding. "
good,A good starting job. Worked with a lot of different people. Decent pay and benefits. You can learn a lot of new things here.
good,Great second job to add extra cash to household. hourly pay was raised within the last years which makes it better for employees and more enjoyable to come to work everday.
good,Walmart was a great company to work for overall because of the environment and the organization but fell a little short in terms of management just for the simple fact that they were not as organized as was to be expected from a large corporation. A typical day consisted of facing all product in the store and constant stocking of inventory. The most enjoyable part of the day was coming in to work and seeing all my friends who were sometimes also like family.
good,"Wal-Mart was my first documented job and I would definitely recommend it to somebody starting any type of career. There are plenty of skills transferable to other careers if you decide to move on. Money management, customer service, et cetera."
good,"The atmosphere is okay, if your on time and do your work its a easy place to work to earn some money.Management and co-workers change frequently so you cant say much about ones who are in and out but the ones who have been around for years,are generally nice and easy to work with."
good,"Wal-Mart is a good place to work, kept me very busy, which I don't mind because I like to keep busy, makes time go by faster!"
good,"Sell affordable eye wear and offering the latest brands of frames, while providing great customer service. "
good,"A typical day at work consists of a productive working environment consists with informing patients services and products we have to offer , responsible for inventory, optical sales, problem solving, measurements, checking in jobs for passing of inspections.contact lens training and sales; up selling glasses, merchandise and answering phones. "
good,At Wal-Mart optical your day can be very challenging.   Highly shopped due to its' visibility inside of their supercenters.   Pricing is always fair and in most cases below market value.   Volume is king and therefore it will keep you on your toes.
good,"Friendly and courteous professional customer service"
good,A typical workday at Wal-Mart could be very stressful by making sure your met a certain number of shoplifters by the end of the day. Everyday was different and the managers really looked over you and down upon you when the store would be slow and you couldn't see all the steps to catching a shoplifter.
good,"Working here was always fast-paced and there was always something interesting happening. The pay was not the greatest though the work was hard. After being there a year, being promoted and getting perfect evaluation scores, I still made the same as the new hires. It was extremely frustrating to work so hard to be placed back at square one. Most of the people working there were great and I enjoyed the bond with them, but the amount of work for the amount of pay did not add up."
good,I would going to work stock make sure my store was clean and work on the register. I work hard to get my work done and keep the customers.
good,"me dedicaba alcanzar objetivos a traves de retos diarios pero el reto mas grande era yo mismo."
good,Can learn many different things in one place.  They do try to promote within at most stores.  There is favoritism in the work place.  Not always enough help and too many unattainable expectations.
good,A typical day as a customer service desk associate is very fast paced. It is our responsibility to ensure accurate and fast transactions. I have learned to keep calm in very tense situations as well as asking for help when I am not able to resolve problems. A very diverse environment.Our breaks are very much appreciated.
good,A good place to work if you like a challenging work environment. I enjoy working with customers especially the elderly.
good,"I worked as a sales floor associate for almost two years."
good,"Worked with some great people there. They provide opportunities for advancement if you are a hard working, dedicated individual."
good,"Working here wasn't as pleasant but I wouldn't mind doing it again. most of the  people were great. The job wasn't a dream job, but it helped me with school."
good,It took several attempts to get a manager to approve a day off request. Some associates who should have been terminated for cause were still employed. Other employees were terminated because they were scheduled to work on an approved day off and didn't come to work.
good,"Not great, not terrible. Basically worked in the produce section unloading cargo and stocking the floor from 4am until 9am, as a part time gig while in college."
good,at Walmart my history is a person that leaned many different positions spent most of my time overnight stocking training new employees.i work well with others i lean fast. i handle money well. and know how to handle fast pace work.
good,"Great company to work for. Knowledgeable staff ready to train you on different aspects of the plant.Management were the best set of people you can find,."
good,an overall good business to work for. there is room for advancement although no overtime is ever offered to those willing to work.
good,"Ran a register, bagged items. Also worked the floor setting up mods, putting products out, assisting customers locate items. Work hand held devices. Got along with coworkers and management.The hardest part of the job is Black Friday with all those people running over each other to get the bargains. The best part is seeing a happy customer walk out satisfied."
good,"My experience here was good. I learned a lot about customer service. I became more comfortable communicating with customers. I also liked the amount of hours I received. I did not however like the management, managers were very unprofessional and rude."
good,It was challenging at all times for production. Fun working with others with a supportive management team. You had a 10% discount at Walmart.
good,ok place to work. coworkers are easy to get along with. some managers are cool to get along with. i like to interact with the customers
good,Not the best place to work. No set schedule for the most part. sometimes it can become overwhelming with the lack of competent communication between management and employees.
good,Co-workers would be rude and inconvenient. Managers weren't 100% attentive. Some problems would go unsolved. Everyone was and inconvenience to managers and higher ups.
good,Walmart can provide a person that want to better themselves in the  public relation department. Costumer services would be the first thing you would have to perfect if you want to move up within the company. That's where I learn that everybody has something to be thankful for at the end of the day.
good,This is a easy company to move up in. It is a very productive and fast paced environment. They also don't have a union which can be a good and bad thing.
good,"Working customer service I had to sort out returns and put them in the right places. Print out ,money orders as well as give money gram. Run register when lines where long and handled any customer issues."
good,"Took this job in order to make ends meet while attending school full time. I enjoyed working for the CSMs. "
good,Fun work place with supportive co-workers.Managers are unprofessional. They fire for any given reason with no warning. Met life-long friends.
good,It was a good first job and helped me get threw high school. I enjoyed it but didn't make much. I really enjoyed working in the lawn and garden part the most
good,"With this company I worked as a night shift stocker.  My job entailed but was not limited to unloading freight from trucks, stocked the "
good,It was great working with such a big retailer who has Multiple Markets through multiple channels.The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my colleagues and learning from them.
good,it was ok working there just they did not explain much as to what to do the preson that showed me around mostly just kepted on saying that if you have any question ask the person below her and i didnt really like that it felt like she didnt not have time for me.
good,"i enjoyed working along side other co-workers, and learning all there is to know about the trade. Learned a lot. great job"
good,"I worked in the bakery doing many things like baking, packaging, cleaning, stocking shelves.  I like working with people so we made it fun even though they days could get long as we didn't always know when we'd be allowed to go home."
good,I would recommend this job to someone who is just wanting something until there's a better job available. If I needed a day off I had to find my own replacement.
good,"very busy and sometimes chaotic place to work. although, I work very well under pressure, as a supervisor it can get challenging at times."
good,"the work is manageable, management themselves usually expect a lot but won't be too upset if u do enough to get the job done"
good,"Walmart is an okay company to work for. Some Managers are great, while others seem to ruin your day. They  work with your schedule."
good,"Wal Mart is a great company.   The corporation is one of the very few that cares about the working class people.  Wal Mart offers very large selection of products that you could every aspect of life at discounted prices.  It is a comfort to know that with a multi billion dollar company, value is a priority."
good,"Typical day for me would sometime always involve speed assisting customers. Sometimes I actually enjoy what I do. So many things you  can learn from customers to the associates. Co- workers I love the people I work with some may have bad Days but, we make the most of them.Sometimes the hardest part of the job is the management typically but we manage. Things I enjoy pleasing customers seeing the smiles an laughs learning something new everyday meeting total strangers and becoming friends."
good,"I learned how to do layaway and returns. "
good,"Department Manager of Pets, Infants and Girls. Customer service experience and cashier, stocking, receiving. Working at Wal-mart is good work."
good,the management is okay all around and okay place to work co workers are easy and approachable. Most enjoyable part is the salary.
good,I would open the deli and bakery bake bread and cookies for the day I would cook hot foods slice meats and cheeses for customers and assiocates make catering orders stock floor and coolers order supplies for the departments
good,same as rite aid work well with others and the times was not working for me. different hours of the day .management was ok. co-workers where ok. standing around doing nothing was hard.
good,"Its a big corporation, so they don't understand what each store need for help. Managements are good and co workers are good."
good,"Check the sale of the say before, make sure the department is tidy, check all the rupture in the department to place or orders with buyers , do prices changes and label changes, delegate work to other associates."
good,"Resolve customer complaints regarding sales and services"
good,Their could be some changes to the establishment. If the managers would listen to thoughts and ideas of the employees working there would be a little more easy
good,Very long hours and as Walmart would be it was very hectic majority of the time. Understaffed for the most part so be ready to work.
good,Started off as a cashier and moved to the meat department. Work was enjoyable mostly stocking the meat wall and helping customers find things in the isle. All in all was a good work experience for me.
good,"Wal-mart is a good place to get experience in the retail job field, but trying to work your way up into upper management is impossible. They do not pay you enough for the job that you do and continually expect more from you with less, you continually work alone on the floor and trying to get someone to cover lunches is hard to find."
good,I was an overnight stocker.  I enjoyed the variety of assignments that I was given. I enjoyed assisting customers located the items that they needed.
good,"over all, i liked working for Walmart, it made me and taught me to be a better and hard working person that i am now and also a good leader."
good,its an okay company to work for but looking for something else love my job and my co-works. But the management is not all that good they don't speak to you as you walk by them they could work on that
good,I liked working at Walmart. The best part were the people getting the job done together yes it was hard sometimes and benefits were good. The hardest part about my job was the lifting.
good,I enjoyed working with customers.  I like handling cash and making the customer happy leaving the store.  They did have great benefits and working for them was little pay.
good,Wal-mart could be a great place to work at if you choose the correct one to work for. There are many opportunities for advancement if a person is willing to learn and play by Wal-Mart rules.
good,"It's a fairly typical job, inputting info into the database and helping customers. The thing that made my job bad though was the higher ups. The PIC was always great, but the Regional Managers almost play into a clique that demotivates and distresses the employees they manage."
good,Great job when I needed it.  Loved the different challenges I had to face every day.  I enjoyed my coworkers tremendously.  Everyone is family.
good,ASDA used to be fantastic place t work now the moral has gone and it is no longer the case . Its a case of too many chiefs and not enough Indians now.
good,"teamwork is present at any moment, trying to support each other in any instance to provide the customer the best possible experience."
good,"One of the few companies where you an truly move up if you put in the time and work hard."
good,"É uma empresa regula onde eles tendes a ajudar os trabalhadores o máximo que podem, mais também  eles buscam a eficiências dos trabalhadores pra que possam te um rendimento bom de trabalho , onde ambos possam se ajudar."
good,"I have learned lots from this company and will be trying to go back to them but at a higher level. A fun but hard place to work. Some thing to do every minute of the day. Plus a great place to learn new things and a supportive upper management, and company level support team."
good,"aprendi a lindar com cada tipo de cliente, a usar técnicas de vendas, eramos uma equipe unida, a parte mais difícil foi ter que sair do salão de vendas para ir ao deposito receber mercadorias no deposito e a parte mais agradável era que tínhamos uma bom condicão de vendas."
good,all i i do at work is i get send out to do a task which it can be any task.which was for 10/06/2015 i was stocking pop and water and as soon as i was done i was send out to the paper and i got to say i did a pretty nice job
good,"It has it`s good moments, and bad moments. I worked in the deli briefly. I worked longer in the bakery. Getting everything that was required to do done in the time allotted was a challenge."
good,Walmart is a good place to work as it is flexible with your schedule if you need part time hours. Walmart is great at giving the hours you need if you have specific schedule.
good,"I like the fact that I was getting job training but I didn't like the fact that the management staff didn't really treat their employees right,, in regards to safety. The supervising staff spent majority of their time talking to each other in the back of the store and at customer service desk instead of insuring that each employee had what they needed and was being treated fairly and safely."
good,"As a student working at Walmart, I can say that it is one of many workplaces which accommodate student schedules very well. The number of hours requested is mostly respected and making changes  or  getting exceptions is relatively easy once advance warning is given. I can also say that the team environment in the company is great to work in. I can also say that the company offers acceptable benefits to its associates. Unfortunately, these benefits do not come close to being equal to those of other corporations. Furthermore, advancement and opportunities are not numerous within the company. I have found it hard to switch positions easily or to acquire many more benefits over the 3 and a half years I worked there. I have also observed a lack of organisation in terms of how the store is run. There is often missing equipment, poorly planned tasks assigned,etc. As a result, I am seeking a job which will offer a better overall experience."
good,"It's an okay place to work. A lot of hard work and no appreciation for it. They really don't care about families, especially their associates families."
good,Its a very stressful environment. Work load is extremely heavy and there is not enough staff to carry on the days work. Too much yesterdays work is left for the next day making it almost impossible to be caught up. Co-workers can seem less interested and dedicated. As a new employee co-workers did not want to do training on my first day.
good,pay and benefits left a lot to be desired. Hours left a lot to be desired. Schedules did allow time for family. The low pay and benefits didn't allow me to stay.
good,Wal-mart is a company that does not believe in employee loyalty.  They treat their employees very unfairly and there is no room for individuality in this company.  They just see their employees as working bees no room for innovation.
good,"Enjoyable work place. Enough of tools to get the job done. Great team work. Management was helpful to a point."
good,"My typical day at Walmart was excellent, my co-workers would greet me first thing and explain to me what my duties are for the day."
good,"Management is never appreciative of accomplishments. On average most new hires don't make it to their 90 days, which means lots of call-ins that leave you short-staffed. Managers tend to cover their own butt rather than taking responsibility for their mistakes. However the benefits are great and they have a lot of free food when you make your quotas as a store."
good,The work life balance is terrible. The pay and benefits are good. It is a stressful environment. Great place to advance.
good,"Walmart was an ok job. It was more manual labor. I enjoyed most of my co-workers, but a lot of the managers were not very nice."
good,Maintained store room inventory and customer satisfaction. Unloaded and loaded inventory material on and off truck delivers.
good,It is an ok work place and the support from management is satisfactory.  The best part of working here is the people I work with.  I would like to further my skills and grow in my career.
good,They have a good and friendly working environment. They listen worker issues and will adjust. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with co-workers.
good,"Job security, good schedules, company provided uniforms, rewards for all employees when a company goal in reached within a required time period"
good,the most enjoyable part if the job is when i would provide great customer service to the client and make sure that they were leaving out of the store satisfied that they came to show with our organization
good,"Fun, Fast ,Attention to Detail I enjoyed working the gams days and the holidays made the hours go by fast enjoyed the people."
good,"My time here at walmart was really hard work, working late nights is no fun for someone who use to sleep on time, staying up late and working at the same time , hard earned money. but you know , working like this is a very good for the soul if you put it on the positive side of our minds. Learning and understanding the way of life is something we all have to face everyday. but it's good. i have learned the hard way but it's all good."
good,"walmart is not a place for advancement. while i was there the would always try to cut my hours. i went from 40 hours a week in one year to 16 hours a week in less than 2 years. each time a tried to get a better position within the company they told me that i needed an extra six months before i could apply. i was a dead end with very few ways out,"
good,start off by doing the returns from the night before and any product returns vendors issue to meet deadlines. Covering breaks and lunches in receiving.
good,Wal-Mart is great company with a lot of opportunity for advancement but there is a serious lack of communication and respect but over all I love what I have learned there and the people I have met.
good,Working at Walmart has taught me a lot of how to get things organized and working hard pays off at the end. Everyone here is friendly.
good,"Walmart expects a lot from their employees but the pay is competitive.  The best part about working for Walmart is your fellow team members.  You will hear a lot from management about work life balance but they don't actually expect you to practice it.  It's only to make you feel better.  Your performance reviews will suffer if you ever put your family first.  "
good,Un empresa modelo y muy estable que me dio mucho desarrollo personal.
good,A good day. How to stock and organize items on shelves. Ok. Fun to work with. Keeping everything neat and in order. Meeting people and taking care of the customers.
good,"A typical day is at work is consistent work and helping people. The managers is hands on and helpful when needed. I enjoy working for this company because it helps improve your customers service, it teaches you different stuff in the retail business."
good,Didnt really like the job and wasn't a good place for me.  Too many things weren't right and I just didn't like the environment.
good,"no balanced lifestyle"
good,great place to work management is willing to work with you on any issue coworkers are awesome but a little understaffed greet cutomers and make sure department is well sstocked
good,no on the job training the managers barely knew what to do on a day to day bases they were always unorganized. there were some days when you came in my co- workers would do things to make the day go a little easier like set up lunch dates or have some things laid out for us to make the job not so overwhelming.
good,"This was my first job, so I sacraficed so much to make it work with this job."
good,it was a good job but while i was there the upper management had unrealistic expectations of all staff since we were so under staffed. it was hard to complete there goals set
good,This position required a high level of customer service as well as the ability to think strategically to develop marketing plans based on customer demand to improve product sales. Served as needed at the front end conducting sales transactions.
good,"make life time of friends, There is no employee value in the company.  Its hard to move up or change shifts.  It would be a benefit to all employees if they had set scheules instead of a different start and end shift each day."
good,I enjoyed working at this establishment for the most part just a couple managers. Clean workplace and tough work made for money well earned.
good,I enjoyed working at Walmart. Coworkers were very helpful. I loved helping people. I learned how to deal with tough customers to have end results In which everyone went home happy. The most enjoyable part was interacting with people while cashiering.
good,It was a job that provided income for a reasonable amount of work. Working in the garden center was by far the best aspect of the job as it allowed a shift in work from pushing carts to water and caring for plants.
good,"I enjoyed working for walmart, they are a great company and take care of their employees. I am looking for a job that I will make more money to support my growing family."
good,"Working at Walmart was an easy job, but it was tedious. My training was very short and there was still a lot I didn't learn that Iwas supposed to know. Management was available, but they were often busy."
good,Was a good starter job but isn't a long term job to support a family with. Also worked part-time for extra money as a weekend job.
good,The place was fun to work at. I was there for seasonal time. My co workers are really nice. good people fun place to work. The hardest thing about the job  is heavy lifting. The enjoyable part was helping the customers.
good,Interesting workplace with supportive co-workers. I enjoy being an employee at Walmart because I stay busy all day. Walmart also has great benefits. Everyday you learn new things.
good,Its exactly what you'd expect working for walmart. Horrible inconsistent hours and low pay. Best part of the job was the co-workers
good,"management and co-workers great to work for. Fast paced, new challenges every day.  Saw new faces each day. Decent hours and pay."
good,I learned many things at Wal-Mart that helped me with my future career. It taught me responsibility and supervisor skills and customer service skills as well as how to operate some equipment.
good,"Was not with the company long, the job was straight forward, the co workers were pleasant, and the management was effective.Training was thorough and shift bidding was helpful."
good,The work is pretty consistent day to day even with changes. I learned to work together with many people as Walmart has its way of developing a family-like environment among coworkers. The hardest part is adapting to change as the company frequently changes while all positions develop their own routine. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with other associates and being able to satisfy customers. Management could be reformed to fit employee and customer's needs better.
good,"As a manager you work a very long day, weeks are more than 50 usually. As a salaried manager you have the opportunity to make a nice little bonus. It's very difficult to reach the goals to bonus but not impossible. It's lots of hard work with not a lot of thanks but it's pretty rewarding if you make goals for yourself."
good,Walmart has it's ups and downs. The pay is decent and they offer benefits. Can be quite enjoyable at times. More thought should be put into where they place new associates.
good,"Walmart is a good company to work for, good benefits and raises every year. The stores are very complex once you really get into how the store runs. I loved working there in the garden center."
good,"It was ok working there. Long days, long weekends. 7 days 12 hours then when it was time to get hired on . no 401k.SO I felt that their was no point on staying because if something was to happen to me I would want a 401k savings for my hard work"
good,"I worked for Wal-mart for seven years, their are many positive things  about working for Wal-mart, but most were because of the employees not the management.  With the exception of the last year, I had never been written up or received a ""Coaching""  But when even I tried to move up or change my position I was always met with -we need you here.or your not the right ""fit"" for the position.  I was never giving any advice on things I could change to help me to achieve my goals to move up.  I was also many times asked to back-up cashier, or fill in for other departments the majority of the night, and then was givin poor feedback because my department was not satisfactory."
good,"The work load is significant compare to pay, Great people to work with. I personally found people , meaning co-workers to be extremely helpful."
good,Gave me a different perspective on dealing with the public. Usually I'M the customer being served but at this job I was providing the service and it help me to improve on my people skills.
good,Each day seems repetitious. There is consistency in what needs to be done. Inserts of special projects that require immediate attention and recognition of efforts to achieve goals are noticed by management.
good,if you need to save money and need to plan for ahead this will be a good place to work because the pay is good and they have good hours overnight
good,"The job is challenging, made even more so by the impossible workload and chronic shortage of employees. Co-workers were great, stress was high. Pay is low compared to how much work was expected to be completed. Mandatory breaks at certain times during shift."
good,"The workplace is highly diverse which makes it fun. Many people from different backgrounds get to come together and work together. The management is nice and it is easy to advance to higher positions. Starting as a cashier and possibly becoming a Customer Service Supervisor or Department manager, with given training, makes it a great place to keep working at. A typical day consists of cleaning and cooking. It is just like being at home but the downside is the time given to complete all cooking and cleaning tasks. Aside from the time restraint I still find a way to get it done!"
good,"The environment was good. Good people, associates, managers and customers. We had some fun nights for example the managers and I played alittle one on one basketball game during lunch break. The managers cooked us food on the grill for the overnight shifts."
good,"was responsible for pulling my own freight, stocking shelves, customer service and making the store look nice for the following day. I was responsible for my own department and kept it fully stocked"
good,"I managed 17 workers. The store ran very efficiently. Hardest part of the job was having to rework the schedule. The problems were either personal employee call outs, vacations to cover, or Walmart cutting our technician hours."
good,get my gear then proceed to the game and umpire every call and have full control of the game and do not let the game get out of control
good,The pay sucked until they took up the minimal wage. They work you to death and ask a lot of you without paying you the proper wages. But it did like all jobs. Paid the bills
good,"great starting pay, very good benefits, hours can vary depending on the time of the year. worked as an order filler and lift driver. rder filler job can be demanding"
good,I actually enjoyed working at this Walmart. The staff was easy to work with. But the pay could've been more. I like cashiering and working with the public.
good,I have worked for Walmart for a lot of years.  They have been there when I needed a job.  They worked with me when I was finishing my Bachelors and Masters Degree.
good,Was a cashier checked pt out with goceries clothes helped them get credit cards c ustomer suervice was everything like that just giveing refunds..
good,"Un día normal de trabajo era revisar los anaqueles que estuvieran llenos y plano-gramar las áreas a las que nos correspondía, revisar nuestras negativas y recibir la mercancía en la bodega."
good,"Slicing, cooking, cleaning. I learnt different ways of doing things. Management was okay. Co-workers got along pretty good. Hardest part of the job: when a co-worker didn't show up for work or called in. The best part of the job: the customers."
good,"I was put on the graveyard shift at Wal-Mart. I can't work graveyards. I have too much to do with going to college and had to quit because of it."
good,Good company to work for. I learned many new things and met many cool intresting people. Management was very helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.
good,"Walmart's benefits were below average. Management is poor, as well as corporate involvement. They need more holidays."
good,I decided to try stocking at Wal-Mart and it has been quite fun getting to learn different sections of the store every week.
good,"Fast paced environment. Great coworkers, had to have good customer service skills. I had to be responsible with money. It was a good learning experience."
good,"All my co-workers were cool, very helpful and patient. They were all welcoming. The management all tried their best to smile and speak to everyone when they saw them, gave the place a very positive and welcoming feel."
good,"I learned everyday that I worked. I was always asking questions and finding out new things. It was a very enjoyable job for me because I am a people person; Although, I have to say there wasn't much team work or team leadership. Management needed to be more strict with what they wanted to be done before the shift was over and what they allowed. The hardest part of the job was that it was a 3rd shift position. It was actually one of the easiest jobs that I have worked. I always tried to stay busy in order to pass time. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers. I loved trying to put a smile on everyone's face before they walked away."
good,The pay is great which include 90 day bonuses and pay raises until you top out. The labor is very tough because the production went up quarterly as well. It can be a very hot place to work in the summer time.
good,"The co-workers and the managers are quite friendly, barring a very few people. The schedule is not flexible for students at times and this is the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part is that I have made friends, and that I get to interact with different kinds of people."
good,"Worked six years in two departments. Never produced what they think you should. No matter how fast you work they expect more production. A manager once said ""quantity not quality"". They promote people who should not be given power over other people. You can be over qualified for many positions. People are put in positions they have no knowledge of or experience. Promotion by who you know not what you know. Some managers will go after you for no reason and harass you. Many of the managers were very nice and helpful but did not last long. Most employees would quit but have no other place to go. The store is run by Arkansas managers. Micro managed to the max. They make new rules and then write you up for not complying with them. The customer is always right and the worker is always wrong."
good,"I had mostly good managers, coworkers were easy to get along with. Customers can get rude, but most of the managers i worked with would back up the workers if they were right. Overall not bad, but there was little room for advancement."
good,You can advance your career with Wal-mart. It taught me how to be patient and polite even when people really are rude. I got along well with my co-workers and really enjoyed working here.
good,"I like the people that worked for me, but I did not like the people I worked for. I had five managers who were above me and all gave different direction on a project and at the end of the day, it had to be redone. I hate wasting time and my talent."
good,It was interesting to  meet all different people. Working here gave me an opportunity to see how people are in the world and how they treat working people.
good,"A nice place to work with a friendly cast of co-workers, always ready to lend a helping hand. It truely is a great place to work and make new friends as well."
good,This place pays well but keep up to much drama. But you do get alot of hours. When I use to work here co workers always talked about each other and the mangers never got along that sometimes it was hard to talk to them about the hours you wanted to work or work.
good,"I worked all over Walmart but it was a good experience. They are more laid back here but the downfall is that they will hire just about anybody, so sometimes you get to work with people that are idiots and sometimes the customer service isn't great because of it."
good,I learned a lot about my co-workers and learned many new things. I enjoyed going to work every day. I grew as a person and learned new ways to incorporate every day skills.
good,"Management is generally supportive, often flexible with work conflicts and scheduling, however hours are too long and can be very stressful at times.  Job is stable and there is a lot of room to grow and move up in this large company."
good,"I held a position in management and was well compensated for that.  "
good,Loved meeting new people. Only problem I had was cause of a medical condition I had just learned I had interfered with how people viewed my performance.
good,Some improvement could have been made in management and there organization skills. Fellow workers helped to break any tension in the workplace.
good,"It is a great place to work if you are single without dependents, minimal bills  and are just starting out.  It can be a very stressful job depending on the management team, how the associates interact with and treat each other and how the individual deals with stressful situations.  The pay leaves a lot to be desired. It is not possible to support a family on the average walmart wages. The company is no longer the ""family-oriented employer"" they claim to be, nor do they offer ""flexible schedules"" as they claim."
good,Walmart was a good place to learn new skills. I can now work in many different positions from skills gained while employed.
good,"I loved working with the Customers. I also had the pleasure of sharpening my customer service skills. Overall I worked at several locations so I can honestly say, if t hey hired me again I would go there in a flash!"
good,like job and environment people were fun to work with loved getting dirty learning lots of different things  like the mechanical part the best
good,I loved creating new designs for cakes.   I felt like a designer and was happy with being able to create. I didn't like stocking the freezer.  My co-workers were easy to get along with.
good,I worked with coworkers to get all departments zoned from the day. I helped customers with their shopping needs and directed them to the right area. Customers are always first.
good,"Once you clock in for the shift, you are expected to work at a moderately fast pace. It is expected that you work with people from all cultural backgrounds and deal with any customer reviews, ranging from extremely satisfied to horrible experience. Sometimes there is not enough staff to complete work tasks which puts pressure on employees that are there for that shift. Other co-workers are friendly and one will most likely work alongside another very well. Attendance is mandatory. Management may not be reasonable with deadlines, however they are with employee's schedules."
good,"Walmart is a decent place to work for entry level job candidates. They offer many levels of advancement and allow you to move up in the company as you see fit. If you enjoy working in a retail environment and have skills they can use, it may work well for you"
good,Wal Mart is a great place to work and meet new people. It is also a place that will be around for many years. Wal mart allows you to network with customers
good,"Llegando a trabajar entraba a las 6 am. y la hora de salida era a las 3 pm. Aprendi mucho por que mis compañeros me enseñaban un poco del area que sabian, la parte dificil el horario y criticas de los mismos compañeros de trabajo, lo que mas me gusto fue que ahi aprendi que trabajar en equipo se puede terminar de hacer mas rapido las actividades que nos daba gerencia."
good,Walmart is a large company with lots of associates. There is room for advancement for those who would like to do so. Management encourages their associates to climb the ladder if retail is their passion.
good,"Great people to work with. Flexible schedule. Fast paced weekends-if you like your work day to fly by. I love that I rarely get rude customers! The biggest issue is being short staffed on any given day. Walmart simply won't hire for certain departments, even if we clearly need more staff. It can be frustrating."
good,"Walmart has what you would expect from a corporation. Stability and routine, with a fair amount of job security. It is possible to 'work up the ladder' as the company will often advertise, though in many situations I've seen an influence on who you know/how well you know them situation, despite Walmart's code for associate/manager relations. "
good,Working here I worked really hard for little pay and bosses that were very impatient. Coworkers were fun to be around but management made it seem like its not fun to be at work which made it hard to enjoy to make your money
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company."
good,"Extremely busy on weekends.Big challenge to deal with certain customers. I have leaned a lot. It is a good experience working there because of multitask but the customers there were so annoying, and sometimes you had cover other departments that you know nothing about"
good,"There was a lot of buddy system activities going on. They worked you like a slave for little to nothing in pay. There was was attitudes that doesn't jell and the managers do nothing about it to resolve issues. Terrible place to work that is all, great place to shop though."
good,"The management fix the goal and gives to everyone what he has to do. I come 10 mn before the job starts and check what is my job for the day. I fix myself my priorities and start to work. "
good,"It's a great place to work, but I would like for them to pay more for the work you do. Great people, and a great enviorment to work."
good,I would just get through the day fixing shelves and helping customers with makeup or helping them find something. closing duties and helping count the registers and the safe at the end of the night.
good,I was a cashier. In a typical day I handled cash transactions and helped customers with pricing issues. The management was respectful and my coworkers were cliquish. The hardest part of my job was the inflexible scheduling. The most enjoyable part of my job was the fact I was given a consistent amount of hours per week.
good,"Fun work place, wasn't that hard of work, but the managers could be quite rude and mean. For example, a coworker of mine left work in tears many times because of the way our department manager treated her. I was also degraded many times, but not by anyone else other than the department manager."
good,"I started working here to pay rent and my utilities, enjoyed working with a diverse group of coworkers. It does seem however that more thought and planning needs to be put into the implementation of new policies and procedures to avoid issues."
good,Its a fun working place and very organized. my co-workers are nice people and very helpful.My time of work is good. Enough training is provided to prepare you well on the job
good,Not every Wal-Mart is the same but the one i worked at just was not cutting it. Management was rude or didnt care about the associates at all. All they worried was making sales. I'm suprised they even took care of customers.
good,It was good place to work at when you really need a job. You always had something to do never a stand still kind of day. Co-workers were really nice to you.
good,"I learned a lot of skills while working at Walmart. The skills that I learned could help me at another job. I learned how to place orders, do markdowns, and basically run a department if I wanted too."
good,"Very good benefits for all full time associates and management. Opportunity for advancement is limited for some, not consistent for all interested. Favoritism is common among many of the managers."
good,"I learned how to use their Telxon system. How to pick merchandise locate products and print labels. Using the Telxon makes work easier to locate products, to also assist the customer with price checking of product."
good,Depending on what department your working in and what store you work for will really depend on if you'll like it or not. Good for summer jobs for high school kids. The pay goes by what department you work in.
good,"I pushed carts for hours at a time and got a small lunch break every day. I really didn't learn anything from this job. My coworkers were very nice but there was one who was very lazy. The hardest part of the job was staying out in the sun for so long every day, it got very hot. The best part of the job was that I could work at my own pace as long as carts were available for customers."
good,"You encounter many people from different backgrounds, working at walmart provides one with an opportunity to learn to deal with these people."
good,A typical day would be stocking and selling sporting goods. what I learned was custom service. management don't last a Walmart so I have nothing good to say.
good,"I loved working with the customers at Walmart, weather it was assisting them with their electronics purchases or in the fitting room area and helping them to locate what they are looking for. I loved going above and beyond to make sure the customer was always happy when they left my department.I very much enjoyed resetting the electronics movie mods on Monday nights for the new movie releases."
good,"a fun place to work, management was good, co-workers were good to work with. learned a lot about cashiering. Loved working with the people and interacting with the public everyday."
good,Lots of work to be done. Love chatting with customers. Flexible hours and regular raises. Management leaves something to be desired.
good,"Walmart instilled in me some values that I have carried with me since my employment there. Not the best values, however. They taught me to always be wary of what your employer promises and if they say you will be getting appropriate pay raises commensurate with the position they're working you in, that you had better get it in writing, or they will claim such promises never happened and continue treating you however they wish."
good,"I really loved working there. The people were very pleasent their was always something to do. Fold clothes, making sure they items were packed properly so they can get shipped out to costumers properly"
good,"pay is decent"
good,"the environment was good, but the hours weren't working with me at the time. i was younger, and had to balance over night work with school all day."
good,everyday we walk in to the department and start stocking right away. I learnt how to manage my time. my co workers are great. the hardest part of the job is nothing actually. the best part is the communicating with people.
good,"Unloading trucks and pulling freight to sales floor. good job for the summer between college semesters, low pay but also low stress. Nice management."
good,"Work place with supportive management, all about the numbers and how you personally grow and develop.  Decent amount of red tape and politics, but this is expected of a big company.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them."
good,"years ago it was a fun place to work, over the years it has become more commercialized, and they are only looking to hire and maintain part time associates, with a minimum starting wage."
good,Quite place to work for the most part. The pay isn't that great. The people are friendly some of the time. Clean work place.
good,lots of traveling never knowing where I was heading to the next day was great but does tired out the body quickly. seeing new place and meeting new people on every location work labor was always the same but the location would always change which was a plus.
good,not a bad place if you are just starting out or if you have marketable management skills you go in get started mostly you just stock floors and rotate product
good,csm were never never to be found they have about 5 registers open at a time even though i was seasonal when it was time for me to have a break was always going late to the break so my breaks were short
good,taught me a lot about myself and got me on a path of thinking better about myself wish I was still there because every min was the best
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a variety of people; young, old, families, and individuals. I learned that awesome coworkers and great customers service help the time fly by. Most of the managers I encountered were decent and very nice. My coworkers were awesome; they really contributed greatly to my passion to remain at my position. The hardest part about my job is when I was unable to fully satisfy my customer. My most enjoyable would be being able to communicate with a variety of people."
good,I normal busy day had csm's and coworkers running. I had to deal with an extremely slow worker most days and it really put a strain on some of us at times. Other times coworkers were late or lazy. Most people were not at the job station they were suppose to be due to lack of supervisors up front. I loved my job and loved the people I got to meet. We had to deal with thieves on a regular basis though and usually they were given what they wanted because supervisors and managers only want to please a customer making employees look stupid for backing up the rules.
good,"Its a fun place to work at, you meet a lot of different people. It also  has a lot of opportunities you can move up to. Walmart is very flexible for your schedule."
good,"A typical day was working with customer's every day. I learned how to use a cash register, management was all that great, I love my co- workers, the hardest part of the job, was really nothing, the most enjoyable part of my job was working with the customers."
good,I had a lot of fun getting to know the workers there and working with them but management didn't seem to talk very often to each other. Often one manager would tell you to do one thing then another manager would tell you to do something else and then one of the two things wouldn't get done.
good,It was not a bad place to work just total confusion most of time and you get in trouble for things that were policy but they would change it for certain circumstances like inventory.
good,Learn how to sales and put bikes together. Good place too work and meet new people who are willing too help you. Picking bikes out for the kids and making sure they are safe too ride.
good,Empresa de retos diarios por lo que se va haciendo un hábito trabajar por cumplimiento de metas.
good,"I liked working here , co workers were great to work with and we had fun , management wasn't to bad no complaints there . Learned a lot working here that I took with me ."
good,Management has very little respect for other associates and corporate has absolutely no concern for the well being of all employees.
good,"Enjoyed my career with Wal Mart for the better part of my time with the company, but over the last few years the company made decisions that made it a bitter sweet working experience. It pained me to leave after almost a decade, but the company appears to be losing it's mind."
good,Walmart is a fast paced company which I love but was lied to by store management on multiple occasions about promotion opportunities and working in an environment that you can't trust the people you work for about the job is very taxing and becomes very disappointing very quickly.
good,pleasant place to work for young people who need to learn customer service and life lessons.  A great place to build lasting friendships.
good,Enjoyed working with people and helping customers with various issues as a Cashier and Customer Service Employee. I enjoyed working with many of my co workers and loved working alone or in a group.
good,I really didn't like working at Wal-mart because no one is held accountable for their actions. Other associates could do whatever they wanted without any repercussions.
good,"Ridiculously fast paced work place."
good,my co workers were amazing. Some of the management was not the best. When there were problems i felt as though some of management didn't care
good,"muy bonito "
good,"Walmart is the best job to work if you want to be treated fairly. management staff treats and shows each associate the same amount of respect. you have multiple chances of advancing through the company, and the work is actually not hard."
good,"Clock in go to assigned register, check out customers,2  hours in go on  15 minute break come back and go to new register. 2 hours afer your first break youclockout for your lunch break for 30 minutes to an hour ( depending on your schedule) clock back in and go to new register. 2  hours after luch you go to another 15 minute break, then you work until 5 minutes before you leave so you can return your left items to customer service and you go clock out. CSM's are great and friendly as well as the other cashiers."
good,it was job i really blessed to have it help paid my bills i got along with my co workers they worked around my hours the hardest part of my job was working in the customer services area alot people called out so i was the one closing and returning things that customer bought back but i made threw i didnt complain about it i got it done was post to
good,it was ok once u get set up where u want to be .but takes a while to get there.the people are like me but management didn't bother.
good,"busy and fast paced and fun place to work. customer service and quick learning."
good,The customers and my team members are friendly.  There could be more training and development of the employees.  Offering benefits would be a great incentive to making your job at Walmart into a career.
good,Wal-Mart was a good firm to work for. they treat their employees in a fair manor. at the holiday start they even gave us little survival kits.
good,It was great interacting with a different variety of customers. Working in a place where everyone is expected to do the same amount of work and get paid for it with opportunity of advancement is a very hopeful job perspective.
good,"I was working for Walmart,is busy place to work,i was sale associate in the begining and a was tranfer to be a stockroom associate,i like this position better,that why i really like working in a warehouse."
good,"High pay rate.. 12 hr days on your feet running around. Production levels are very high and hard to make. People get fired all the time. High turn over rate. Not for older people unless your fast and have no knee or back issues. Management has favorites like most places. Because of the high production requirements, everyone is for themselves for the most part. Walmart is a charitable company and will give you a chance. Its very difficult to keep your job though."
good,"I enjoyed the job fairly well when I first began. However, they began to pull away from being people oriented to ""task-manager"" oriented. You would primarily speak to your employees and assigned tasks through a computer."
good,"Very simple job love the environment and pay.I also enjoy getting to meet new people.Well i worked at night so when i came in the store was at its busiest.Typical night would start off by sitting in for the meeting for about 30 minutes,then you find a hub and task into your assigned department then you go get your tools you need to do the job then get started on the job.Love the job but various management can make the job harder than it needs to be."
good,"Very enjoyable work place, typically dealing with customers everyday with needing assistance  in finding products. Restocking the shelves when products are needed, and serving clients! Overall great experience working at Walmart and leaving the end of your shift with a smile."
good,Job included restocking shelves and providing customer service. It was a very bland job that I will not be returning to.
good,I enjoyed my position with Walmart Super Center mostly because I love the interaction with my customers. My greatest desire is to ensure satisfaction to a position where several options are available to them.
good,"At the Walmart Bakery I was responsible for decorating the cakes and taking custom orders. I took orders over the phone and in-store. I used computer software to decorate personalized cakes. I ensured the products on display were correctly priced, well stocked and aesthetically pleasing."
good,"happy to work"
good,stock freights as quick possible . we work as a team to finish all the freights  hardest part of the job is finish multiple freights at a given time but is also the best part of the job working hard together
good,"what I've learn working at Walmart, I was train to strip and wax the floors  (wood) from backroom to service desk, I've been sent to other Walmart's to train employees on the proper way to utilize equipment and the steps to complete these projects and procedures."
good,"Walmart is often seen in a bad light due to it's unsightly and sometimes shady business practices.  However; It's not at all a bad place to work.  Simplified and evenly distributed work loads mean all 3 shifts can easily work with each other and keep the store running smoothly, reducing the overall amount of work each person must do on their own."
good,"A lot is expected of any one employee. No matter how much labor is cut, they expect the same results as when there are 3 times the employees scheduled. The pay is low for even advanced positions within a store, and there is a lot of favoritism that goes on, that can infringe upon a good employees advancement. There is generally plenty of training, although they are known to ""throw someone in"" to a job they may not be ready for. Most of management is willing to help with any questions, usually. The best part of working at this company is the comradery that usually happens with coworkers. We all just tried to work hard, and help each other whenever we could. I already had a lot of grocery and retail experience, but I learned a lot about Walmart policy and their ways."
good,"I really enjoyed working for Walmart. They have a great management team and are very helpful with new employees. I learned a lot about the company in my short time there, and given the opportunity  I would love to work there again"
good,It is a great company to work for the pay isn't great. There have been lots of changes in the store structure i was younger and use to shop with my mom.
good,extremely busy days at work.  very diverse group of customers. Great management team. i learned how to accommodate many different personalities.
good,I actually like the job i have. It keeps my busy without being overly demanding. But the people I work with don't pull their weight and I feel like there is little room for advancements or raises.
good,This was a good place to work. I left personally to further my education career. Overall if you can land a job at a Walmart stick it out because they look really well on certain applications depending on the job.
good,"The job itself was fine, however the management expected too much from one person. They gave you deadlines that were next to impossible. Always short staffed and always moving you to work in different departments and still held you responsible for how your department looked. Department managers always put their work on you and got paid for it. Basically, you do 3 people's job plus yours and still get told you're not doing enough. You don't get paid nearly enough to deal with it."
good,The working atmosphere there was overall good. The co-workers were friendly and helpful. The management did their part to provide a good and safe working environment.
good,Es una empresa mundial la cual se rige por ciertas normas que no se adaptan a lo que es el taller como supermercado esta bien pero les falta mejorar en lo que es la adaptación al taller y les cuesta cambiar esos ideales
good,"It is a job, but they do not give enough hours or pay to compensate for all of the work that they want you to do. They give you so much work and are always adding things that they want you to do and expect you to get them all done before you leave without staying over your time."
good,"well it was nice working there but like many others it had its ups and downs.busy work days.management was okay.co-workers were okay. the hardest part was keeping your self busy when it got slow,but that wasn't to often.the best part was when i worked as a cashier, i enjoyed meeting different people."
good,Walmart is a tough company to work for.  There are over 200 employees that have to be trained.  It can be a little tricky when there is only one of you and things are constantly changing.
good,"I do like my co-workers.  They are fun to work with. They are easy to understand  and together we get a lot of work done as a team.  Management is not easy to work with. 3 of them are  really great, they have not been changed by Walmart's dumb rules, Associate management relations. Hard part of job is watching people steal and not being able to doing anything about it.   Enjoy my co-workers and what I do very much.  People are  fun most of the time."
good,I would show up clock in. Then i would count my till out and flip my light on indicating I was open. I would then greet the customer and check their groceries in a timely manner. I would thank them for shopping with us and tell them to have a wonderful day.
good,"We worked 10hr shifts, loaded and unloaded trucks, had to meet a certin quota by the end of each shift. they where a good company to work for"
good,"Enjoyed my co-worker, enjoyed waiting on customers and meeting new people. No opportunities for advancement, pay was low."
good,I really enjoy most of my co -workers. I liked the fact that I knew everyday before going to work what I would be doing the next day
good,"The company was okay to work with. I was a stock clerk so my job duties were small. I worked with the general public at times, but I did not see any job security or opportunities for advancement."
good,"The salary appropriately reflected my position at deli. Unsurprising, there was a decent flow of business at my station and being fast paced meant body ache and stress. Management style varied depending on circulated leader. Some were more lenient and sociable than others and it was either you loved you liked or disliked who you had. There were normal job politics and a little more drama than needed for a student balancing work/school. Walmart has a no union policy which is discouraging if you want to feel a sense of fairness from work. Overall, the pay is what kept you there but it's in no shape or form low-stress. unflexiblee,"
good,"Fun experience with great colleagues. Poor management and poor hours. Enjoyed the everyday customer interaction. Fast paced. positive work environment,"
good,"The typical work day I have at Wal-Mart. When I clock in for work, I report to the front to the csm on durety. Then, when they tell I what restger repor to. I get on the restger to serive the costume that come through my line. Also if there left bags I log them in the book, and put away items not what. They come to reless I for breaks, lunch, and when I go home that is when I clock for the day."
good,Working at Wal-Mart was very fun. It was a very fast pace environment. I enjoyed working with people that come from all types of cultural backgrounds.
good,"Working at Walmart on busy and slow days are very competitive. It's always something to do and always a challenging environment. Working in retail has taught me so much! There are days where I thought I couldn't do my job description but I always remind myself that if I didn't try I could never learn new things. I learned so much just working at Walmart in the 5 1/2 years. I've made many great friends and learning how to deal with the people and the world we live in. I pushed myself everyday I was scheduled to work just because I work with many amazing people. Management, Cashiers, Sales associates, and etc. they were a lot of great people. The hardest part of my job was making sure each and everyone of the associates I was managing was taken care of and most especially satisfying my customers. Customers were my first priority to make sure they were well taken care of. My most enjoyable part about my job was getting to know many people and cultures. Meeting different cultures and just being there."
good,"it was fun because you would see different people. The day I hated was working on Sundays due it being super busy while a handful of lines were open. Also, the first of the months when food stamps would come in."
good,"I enjoyed my time working for Wal-Mart. If yoy like a fast paced environment like I do, then this is the place to work! I enjoyed all of my co workers during my time at Wal-Mart!"
good,Work hard every day. Learn something new every day. Management is there. Co-workers are there. Hardest part of the job is being in more than one place at a time. Most enjoyable part of the job is...
good,"On any given day I am responsible for cooking rotisserie chickens, frying food for hot bar , putting out salads in cold case, slicing deli meat and cheese, waiting on customers and cleaning.I enjoy interacting with my co-workers, it makes the day fun."
good,"loved working with the people there and seeing the public, hardest part of the job was dealing with not so nice customers"
good,"I am thankful for the job, the schedule I just cant get use to, I am a single parent with a teenage Son I prefer a more steady schedule with better hours."
good,"it wasn't all to bad working at walmart, management was some of the worse but for the most part stayed out of your way, the only reason i don't continue working here is simply due to my school schedule."
good,"El salario es muy poco"
good,"trabajo fuerte"
good,It's a very physically demanding job but it pays well. The management team is very hands on and accessible throughout the shifts. Once you get the hang of the job it's very easy to stock the pallets for shipment.
good,Always busy very faced pace. Promote under 90 days depending on your performance. Managment is very understanding as long as you communicate and do your job right.
good,This company provides no benefits or incentives to it's employees and they work you to the brink of exhaustion. This would not be a problem for me personally provided they pay a wage that is comparable to the amount of work we were asked to do.
good,"My job is to push carts from the lot to the bay and to help customers with purchases out to their to their cars or trucks. The coworkers are friendly, nice clean environment and nice place to work. The only reason that i am considering leaving is to get a full time job with benefits."
good,Big company with small benefits for full-time employees. No room for advancement within various departments of the company.
good,"I enjoyed this company, I was able to work different departments and learn new trades. Over all its an ok job. Hours usually vary depending on sales."
good,Work in any of four areas as a sales associate.  Not very hard work.  Stock any items that need to be put out.  Two hours of straightening out items on shelves.
good,every morning loved coming to work every assocaite  where nice and friendly to one another management alwayd tired to help anyway they can with hours and when u need time off the hardest part was not making more with the pay and being a part time job
good,Working at Walmart allowed me to make extra money during the holidays. I enjoyed helping people find what they were looking for and the overall holiday atmosphere.
good,I discovered what work actually was. I worked the overnight shift and I had to stock shelves. It was very rewarding job. I loved all the people that I met and I learned a lot of things.
good,I did customer service work and help guest take stuff to there car and did cashier. and Cleaned the store and shovel the snow
good,was a good experience helped me to develop customer service skills.best part about the job was the delightful customers who came in .
good,"It was a good simple job that was fun as well even when people had cranky days."
good,"It was a fast paced work environment. Though it was on the repetitive side, it was still an overall good place to work. Met a lot of good people through the few months I was there."
good,I loved working here with the people i was working with. we would stock items and have a good time. there was always smiles on everyone face.
good,"When I say that Walmart is a job, that is about all I can say about that place. I used to really enjoy the job that I done. I took great pride in my job, and I still do. I currently get frustrated with the way we as employees are treated by the company. I have a car payment every month, so therefore, I have to keep my cool and just remember to breathe. My coworkers make working there fun. They are more like family to me than anything."
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of hourly paid salary
good,A typical day for me is working very hard to make sure that everything is done the way that it should be and everyone gets what they need.
good,working here was great because I got to help customers and answered any question they might have been willing to get an answer for. Also depending on how much sales the whole store made determined the amount of bonuses we would get
good,"Everything was great about the job except there was barely any hours being offered. Overall, it was a fun work place that taught me to build a strong character."
good,"- always have something to do"
good,"Wal-Mart's policy's and procedures were clear and very easy to follow. Safety is always first and foremost. A typical day started with a tour of the store with the manager to prioritize what needed to be done as a priority. After that daily reports we're run and analyzed. Worked with the cash office on long and shorts, also visited with the inventory associate. And above anything else the safety of our customers came first. The most enjoyable part od my day was teaching and training."
good,management didnt appreciate hard workers.  Benefits are good. Made good friends. Co-workers were helpful.The most enjoyable was the benefits
good,Its about the same thing every day when i was there i learned how to use the telcon and how to make my job easier than it was. Management was ok to me they had favorates but they they were ok. My co workers really want no help most of them were though not much to say about them. The hardest part of my job was taking out the throwaways and puuting up with management.
good,It was a good place to gain a little work experience while I was attending school. I learned some useful skills and was able to apply them in the real world.
good,"a day at Walmart starts with working in the back room fixing back room stock and preparing it for the floor. Then the merchandise is stocked to the sales floor. The store gets busy real fast so customers need help frequently. This can take away a lot of time for getting a project done but help from a neighboring associate takes care of that.The co-workers are friendly and help you when you need it. The hardest part of the job is the staffing, you are demanded to get a lot done with little help. I learned a lot from there like team work, being a merchant, operating machines, and being a good leader. Walmart also had a lot of good benefits which helped me save a lot of money. To sum it up Walmart is a pretty good job it can get stressful but it pays off in the end."
good,"We are going through as Walmart would call it as a pilot store. We are the ones that test the new handheld MC40. Brand new to all of the Dept. Managers and we all had to learn on our own how these devices worked, no handbooks to go by it was a job that all of us got together and figured out how the MC40 worked. The other stores are now getting them without the company and we help the other stores if they need it."
good,"Walmart was a great place to work, they give great opportunities and were very helpful. I would recommend this job to any young energetic person."
good,"I enjoyed working in the photo department, the manager was wonderful. My duties there were developing film, sales, customer service all day. the only think I didn't enjoy was the times it always changed."
good,"At my store, the management team was great. While at times they seemed to give vague instructions or contradictory requests, for the most part they gave support and were understanding when you finally sat down and talked to them. They were really flexible with my schedule and would usually work with me to get my hours. In my time there, I have seen many people work their way up, even into management positions, so there is a tangible possibility for advancement for those that want to go further in the company."
good,I would stock new shipment of products throughout the store for the next day. The hardest part was over whelming with inventory with a small staff.
good,hours were easy to obtain and the work was hard but not challenging co-workers made time go by fast with conversations and work place was kept clean and safe.
good,"I needed work. Walmart paid me. That is all there is to say.  I only worked for a bit then went back to school. I do believe there is room for growth, but it will take time and effort."
good,"I would have to say the best part of working at Walmart would have to be, working with customers. I enjoy taking, helping, problem solving with customers"
good,This employer  is good for either first time go getters or older folks. Not suitable for needed stability as the compensation is entirely to low and the benefits can only be obtained by management or those lucky enough to get full time positions.
good,The work was tedious and ridiculous. The managers did not care about the employees or their issues. The schedule was flexible but the hours were long.
good,Typical day would be showing up doing things not in my job title but enjoying the people I'm around which made everything worth while.
good,"As a member of the management team your hours are at times extensive, and I have worked on all major holidays for the past 17 years.  Fast paced, goal orientated approach in which immediate success, feedback or areas of improvement are quickly identified and adjusted.  There are some great people you get to work with and learn from."
good,"A typical day at Walmart is complete chaos.  You're constantly pulled in six different directions while being told by four different people how to do one project.  The expectations can be unrealistic at times, and you'll either love or hate the people you work with."
good,I was an overnight IMS associate. I liked working for the company but the management was not so great. The location I was in was always unorganized. It seemed like the management had no idea how to run the stockrooms and what goes on in the back
good,I had learn a lot with photo lab that its special to know. What can be do with the pictures all over. It a good job to have when it's good teamplayer in the group.
good,I loved working for Wal-Mart.. the only problem I really had was management and that the company stopped hiring full time employees so they don't have to pay you with benefits but over all not too bad
good,Alot of work to handle but alot of help was always offered. The managers are always kind and helpful on answering any questions I had.Scheduling was never a problem and a good place to get full time positions and get promoted. They also do vulenteer work to help the comunity.
good,"They're real choosy on who they give full time to, if you're a lower- tier worker like I was (maintenance) you're not going to get much respect from management, It got so crazy that a manager literally told my co worker ""Tell me when you use the restroom'."
good,"Responsible for cleaning store, including spill clean-up, chemical use, cleaning break room, restrooms, offices, floors, vacuuming, taking out trash, maintenance repair, changing light bulbs, maintaining outside presentation, sorting and recycling materials, window washing, customer service."
good,This company encourages growth and promotion from within which enhances employee morale. Sales are extremely important to everyone because associate bonus is driven by those numbers. Teamwork is very prevalent here because it would be impossible for an individual to deliver the service that this company wants to be known for.
good,It was on working there the job was easy . I like my schedule and helping people. I hated driving to Columbia for that little bit of money .
good,It is a busy and effective with helping the customers. Need more supportive and understanding management. Meet new people everyday.
good,"Working for a large employer does have its perks. discounts on merchandise, fun atmosphere, overall great place to work. does have problems at times with management, but if you stay focused, it isn't a problem."
good,"come to listen watch you have to do"
good,"You now get paid 9.00 an hour at Wal-Mart, but unfortunatly it was not the place for me. Co-Workers are nice and helpful. Managers can be helpful but some are not so much. Its an overall good place to work. Ideal for college students needing a part time to get through school."
good,"Walmart was fast-paced with customers coming in and out every hour of the day. I learned many things working at Walmart such as teamwork, determination, and communication. Management was decent and hours were fairly distributed. Co-workers were great; friendly, helpful, and encouraging. The hardest part of the job was cleaning up messes that the customers obviously couldn't clean themselves. However, the most enjoyable part of the job was the all around challenge that the job demanded"
good,"My daily work environment would consist of greeting different people in for the services they wanted done to their vehicle such as oil changes, tires,and misc items. I would greet them in and greet them upon exit. I would try to resolve a customers complaint before handing them over to a store manager."
good,"positive learning experience, good career experience, pay was not sufficient to job experience, management to worker lacking."
good,they are a world wide company so I feel they just have a lot of people that don't really care about anything outside of their own
good,"I was a cashier at both Walmart stores and enjoyed my job. The management at both stores were great. They let me work three to four days a week, part-time which is what I wanted. I had no  complaints when I worked there."
good,"i never know what i will be doing at work for the reason why, the managers and sup. always looking for me as for projects helping other co worker and other things as well never a dull day always moving and always something to do. if someone told you it was boring at work ....DID NOT DO ANYTHING or he/her job"
good,Work environment is of course never what it may seem from the outside. Wal-mart has definitely changed the way I deal with customers and just people in general. Have lots of respect for the people that have been working at Wal-mart before me.
good,"fast paced and exciting place to work. always evolving and challenging. Used to be open to free hinking ideas, but has become and direction managed business."
good,Working at the Deli has been fun when it came to cleaning up with coworkers and interacting with various customers. I liked the challenge of solving problems on the go. Multitasking and a positive behavior was a must. I have good customer service skills. I haven't had any problems with any customer throughout my experience.
good,It was enjoyable in that I did learn something new everyday. I learned how to be flexible and to multitask quickly. Learned a lot about corporate business and how much work it entails. The management team was well organized and friendly. There was always something to do. I would have to say the hardest part was keeping up with everything. Although I was happy to be busy.
good,A typical day at work included checking the products in the Dairy section and re-stocking products in the freezer and the dairy section based on customer consumption and expiration dates of the products (known as trade-offs). The work environment also consisted of heavy lifting and labeling prices. I learned the values of customer satisfaction although most of my work consisted of heavy lifting. Management at times seemed very uncaring as most of the supervision was done by direct supervisors. Co-workers were often very friendly and there was frequent interaction among them. The hardest part of the job consisted of breaking down the pallets in order to stock more products. The most enjoyable part were the breaks we received.
good,Empresa com bom ambiente de trabalho e assim desenvolvendo o meu lado profissional.
good,The job was enjoyable. I learned how to help the public find items that they were looking for and how to use a cash register. The hardest part of the day was stocking a shelf that was a little too high for me but I managed it anyway. The thing that I liked most was meeting new people everyday.
good,"As a Asset Protection associate I would maintain paperwork and data logs, assist with detecting, deterring, and investigating violaters of company policies and criminal activites."
good,"its a job to provide for my family. there were things i did like and things i did not like. I would do my job and do it well."
good,I was only at Walmart for a couple of months but I had a good experience working there during the time of my employment. They are a pretty good company to work for all in all.
good,Simple work but many heavy lifting and moving. At times very fast paced with short staff. Poor management left understaffed many times when most needed. Most co-workers were great friendly people others not so much and some definite conflicts. Friendly coworkers and and not rushed pace at times were most enjoyable.
good,Good place to work at for students or individuals who have never had a job before to gain some working experience. There is opportunity to move up with in the company but very low pay and employees are not valued. Wal-Marts dont have a very good customers service for clients and a very good enviroment to work in for employees.
good,"A good beginner job, not much pay an hour but had room for advancement. It is not a job I would want to go back to because the harsh rules that Home office implies to the associates."
good,"A good Company to work for when trying to find a job that pays more per hour, good Transitional job while looking for other jobs,"
good,"I stocked shelves and aided in the overall maintenance of the store."
good,"During the time I work it is very fast paced. The store is always packed. The customers are very rude, they have no respect for us workers. My co workers work as hard as they can but we are not robots. The management will not help you if you need, they tell us to get the lines down and stand around. The system is really unorganized."
good,"The company is unorganized and now that they have restructured, it may be a little better, more people to manage individual areas may help with organization.   The focus needs to be on better customer service."
good,walmart is an easy work place enviroment. with lots of help and guidence its hard to do a bad job. flexable hours as well as good management make for a good feel to the store.
good,"typical day at work with new workers just there for the check and not to work, they pay is ok, they want you to stay late but dont let you kep the hours, they tell you to come in late anothr day"
good,Customer satisfaction oriented company. Flexible hours in the past for students but now a more rigid schedule. Friendly atmosphere amongst co-workers and management required to bear the responsibility of ultimate performance from their associates. I almost always pick up the slack of some of my team associates which can be exasperating however job satisfaction always motivates me. I've always been customer friendly but learned more of it at the workplace and helping people or being able to satisfy them is basically my pleasure and what I enjoy doing.
good,Learned to assist customers and listen to their problems. Gained experience in the service world. I learned to develop positive customer relationships.
good,"Overall good company depending on where you work and who your team mates are. Pay is good but schedule sucks, you spend days off at work trying to provide job security. Company has implement new pay structures and create additional job position.  Fast pace and constantly changing."
good,I liked working here but it isn't really a career job. Co workers were nice and always pleasant to work with. The hours were wonderful with life schedule they just didn't give enough hours as a single mother I have to be able to support my family.
good,Most members of management didn't care about the associates. Most associates through fault of management were poorly trained. The associates were amazing people.
good,"I would cash checks, perform money wire transfers, money orders, handle large sums of money on a daily basis, made sure the customers needs were met. I learned how to handled customers that weren't the nicest of people. the hardest part of my job was that management didn't always treat all employees equally like they say they do. the most enjoyable part of my job was the friendships that I gained."
good,Fun workplace with some management willing to help you advance although it is hard to advance to a higher pay rate. Politics and favoritism showed but that is expected of a big company such as Walmart.
good,Walmart Pharmacy was a very fast paced environment. This establishment has given me the opportunity to grow and learn how to manage my time in a demanding and fast environment.
good,"Cleaned, stocked placed shelves in the stores, printed labels for the mercandise. Unload trucks, pulled and pushed carts to move the merchandise through out the store."
good,"Greeting customers, daily meetings. Manager and supervisors always helping out. Team energy was number one thing. Always something to do, staying busy was my number one thing to do, either being a cashier or a stocker or taking inventory, was great working there."
good,"Wal-Mart super friendly, manager were always asking if you need anything, information always there. Loved working cashier, greeting customer, some talk and helping out was always fun."
good,walmart is overall a good company but the management team is unbelievable. You never get recognized for the hard work you put in. They are always understaffed and they expect you to do a  job of 3 people and want the same results from one person.Then they want to hold you accountable for not completing the task.I do like my co-workers because we all work together to complete  task even though we wont get recognized for it. we jut make the best of it.
good,Walmart is an okay company to work for. They offer average pay and a variety of job options. They offer opportunities for advancement if you really work for them. Would have worked their longer but decided it would be in my best interest to further my education.
good,the work was easy and i enjoyed my job but the staff and HR was not very friendly. the shifts were flexible but its hard to work somewhere when you're not happy
good,It was a very eye opening experience to the world of Management.  I liked the environment but it seemed that there was a lack of trust and compassion between employees and  co-workers.  All in all it was a good work environment and I enjoyed managing with a company as renowned as Wal-Mart.
good,"Repeated cash handling of a register and bagging items"
good,Pay wages are not up to par with management or hourly associates. With the advancement in salaries will come more productive and proficient employees.
good,"the hours flexuate and unable to count on same hours for the week"
good,don't get me wrong I loved working here I do recommend it to some people. the work environment is fine and the people are incredibly nice. just my hours were cut and as well as any other person we do have bills to pay. just need a full time job.
good,"You go into work check what you are scheduled to do.  After, that you start work and do whatever the managers tell you.  The problem is the managers tell you something than change their mind rather quickly or contradict each other."
good,"Since I work at Walmart I never had a much problem. When I started working, you're always treated as family. Your suggestions are given consideration."
good,"Responsible for stocking shelves and coolers for the next day of business according to company standards"
good,A typical day at work was to maintain a clean and safe environment for the customers as well as my fellow associates. While providing great customer service.
good,"Working midnights can be rough at times, but the co-workers were fantastic and we really supported and helped each other."
good,There are many pros and cons to working for walmart. It takes a very strong person to stay in management with this company. Day to day operations change daily. Most learning is done on the job.
good,"A typical day at work is dealing with costumers all night, giving them a warm welcome and help them in any way posible at the same time stocking hundreds upon hundreds of items each and every night to fufill the racks so that our lovely costumers can come and buy with ease. Coworkers are family, teamwork is our key to success. The hardest part of my job is when managers can't decide the right way to guide us on what is their gameplan is and they still say is our job to make everything right. The most enjoyble part of my job is when you finish all your tasks in time so that you cann continue on with the costumer service."
good,"Helping Costumers out , cashing them help , sending western union to other cites . It was a good learned alot counting money! ,"
good,"empresa la cual pagaba los bonos segun lo recuperado, salarios en tiempo y forma."
good,had lot of work to keep me busy and the co workers where helpful and friendly. the hardest part was when working night with a medical problem sleeping at night then working the same next morning the most enjoyable was as cashier.
good,It was a okay experience and i enjoyed working as a team i enjoyed helping costumers and having a enjoyable work day ! The management time was okay nothing seriou
good,"It's ok to job to work for if you in school, or better if you have no children. Because they will work with you to a certain extend."
good,"They did not care about the employees themselves, just making money. My coworkers were fun, but that was about it. The job was simple but time consuming."
good,Everyone should work at Walmart at least once in their lifetime. It will show you the ignorance of the general public (they don't like to read what's in front of them).
good,I would operate the cash register. Put the items in the bad. Help stock items and greet customers. I loved talking to the customers and laughing with my coworkers
good,"Maintain customer vehicles, examples: change oil, filter, check batteries, tire pressure, and fluids."
good,"well for me its a very  relaxing lazy job but its the way I think...a lot of my associates give bad feed back about being maintenance however its people on the floor being over worked as maintenance "
good,I learned a lot about management. about how people can act so fake but as long as you keep to yourself you should be good just worry about yourself and not others but if you see someone struggling help them stand out don't fit in
good,"My typical day would consist of opening the store, and preparing patients charts . Keeping the store, Front desk,and keeping the store clean was a huge part of getting the day started. Depending on my duty's for the day I would either be taking patients orders and selling eyeware on the sales floor, or filing important documents such as insurance claims, or eyeglass invoices .The sales floor was everyone's responsibility and making sure the patient comes first was our main goal. My experience at Walmart has been a wonderful journey, my coworkers were always helpful as well as easy to get along with. Our patients were also very nice and always had the best things to say about there experience with us.Our doctor was is the owner and founder of the company and managed his business very well.the hardest part of my job was balancing many tasks at once while still providing the patient with the most enjoyable experience, so staying organized and efficient was always mandatory.I have learned many skills from working at Optics Soho edging jobs, and exceptional patient care, are just some of the qualities I have learned from my employment here. All in all my time at Optics Soho was great and im grateful to have had the opportunity."
good,Walmart is a good job to work for if you single but if you trying to take care of a family than working at walmart will be a problem
good,I was an overnight maintenance employee at Walmart. I started off as restroom maintenance personnel and worked my way up to the meat and produce maintenance. I enjoyed the extra overnight pay.
good,Day to day i am leading my team and making sure things get done efficiently. before this job i was more of a team  player and now i have become a leader
good,"they talk a good game to get you to come on board and then they treat you as if you need them, they don't care if you are sick, pregnant or injured."
good,I wasn't there for very long but its a fun work environment. Its essentially basic retail work. Flexible hours and various locations
good,"well one night we started with 800 picks in the RF gun, so we did all them in 3 hours.I learnd that you have work as a team in some case during the shitf. Management was okay sometimes. I love my co works they my day on third shitf. Well the hardest task was getting stuff down and read for christmas time. Well that would have too be bonus time."

good,I enjoyed a few of my coworkers.Some management seemed like the were more interested in the merchandise than the people who helped made the job possible.
good,"A typical day, walk-in, clock in and go to a register. It was a few times I had a wonderful day but other times they were ok. My co-workers were cool but i really didn't talk to everybody. The managers were mostly helpful whenever you can get one's attention."
good,"It is a great place to develop personally and professionally, while allowing you to create a perfect balance in between this two.  it also allows you to grow processional, by having training thru managers and thru training systems developed by the company."

good,"I enjoyed   My job and most of those I worked with, There could have been improvements in how some management personal treated employees."

good,"i already reviewed Walmart but again it is a stable place to work but they have no loyalties, and lack in several other areas"
good,Working in a retail environment is both rewarding and challenging. The day to day changes keeps you thinking outside the box. The most rewarding part about retail is customer service.
good,A typical day at work was fast pace. I learned how work fast and safe. Management was great all the time and had great prizes for hard workers. The hardest part about the job was nothing.
good,Working at Wal-Mart was ok. They don't care about their employees and they fired me two weeks before my daughter was born. The company is not a good place to work.
good,During a typical day at work I handled large amounts of money and provided customer service. I learned how to effectively manage a job and high school. Overall excellent job for a high school student.
good,The mangers had there favorite and the ones that sucked up to them would get the easy jobs to do especially in receiving dock instead of letting everybody have a turn on a easy trailer they wouldn't do that. They stop putting money in our profit sharing. They started finding reasons for us not to get our incentive checks. At first it was a good place to work for but when they started finding reasons to fire you especially the people that's been there for a long time they wanted out and would find any excuse to fire you. If the mangers didn't write up so many people a week then they would write them up.Its time for me to find the right place for me to work at that's there to help you not find reasons to fire you.
good,Loved the job but wasnt really for me i was more interested in selling. I liked solving problems and getting to help customers with what they needed and making sure they were satisfied.
good,"Everyday was different, from where I was working in the store to the different customers you encounter based on what area you worked in."
good,I started on the sales floor then worked my way up to Customer Service Manager (CSM). I learned about myself that I really dislike people that don't take there job seriously.

good,"Attend to customers in a warm upbeat cheerful fashion"
good,"Walmart was a great place to work to put myself through college.  Not only was this job fairly stress free, I was allowed to learn many functions and be moved around the store to prevent complacency while at work.  Walmart rarely allows overtime so this allowed me to complete my schoolwork with ease."
good,"WalMart opened a number of Supercenters in the Rockford area. I worked at one, but it wasn't such a good fit and so I was moved to another one. The job I was doing allowed me work the cash registers, work in the backroom and at time I would go and help with other departments. It made it hard to connect with people because they were always getting in Different people! And the Store Manager at the time was a 'Pig'. They did let him go after I left and the store seemed to been doing better."
good,"I've only been here a couple months, but so far it's a decent job. I get to spend time with the general public, handling their questions and helping them troubleshoot some problems they may have."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of customer service, helping customers, dealing with money, and team work. I have learned to smile and have a pleasant attitude in dealing with the general public. The customer is always right. I have register and money skills.I follow directions when management deals out specific jobs.I work great with my co workers. The hardest was smiling through the customers complaints,and the easiest is smiling when you make that customer happy. That is a win win situation."
good,"Direct and supervise twenty associates, Work with department Managers to identify and project initiatives and workload"
good,looking for more than just a job. It gets boring doing the same thing over and over again. its ok for a job. i am looking more toward a career.
good,"Organization of the storage room and clean some areas of the store, good relationship with workmates, Customer assistant in location of products or departments, and charge of money for customer purchases."
good,"Wal-Mart is not the best place work, very immature work environment. It also isn't a place to move up and get an up-pay but more or less a cut in pay. just no appreciation to go with the underpay."
good,great job to work. good company nice pay and benefits. i would work there again. lots of opportunity to grow. great benefits
good,It's overall not a bad job. It takes a lot of teamwork to get the job done. But if you work together as a team it makes the job fun and easy.
good,"Walmart was a good job for me & I enjoyed it while I was there !! I worked in the snack bar. Some people were very picky, nitpick about extras etc..."
good,cooking food washing dishes slicing deli meat. customer service cashier. the managers really don't help you when needed. they expect you to do everything.

good,"I currently am a cashier and ring customer orders,clean my area,put away procuct.I've worked in the grocery department putting product on shelves, taking empty boxes to the baler,zoning my area."
good,"As a cashier, it is my job to cash out customers purchases while also holding a conversation to ensure great customer service. Management was not always easily available when customer satisfaction issues occurred, often causing our customers to become irritable. My experience while working at Wal-mart has been less than satisfactory."
good,This was a job I obtained after high school and was able to work here until I started college the following year. It was a good job and gave me a lot of training and skills I needed.
good,"Overall Walmart was an ok place to work, the associates were awesome to work with. The only problem with management was communication. There was inconsistency with one manager to the next, some management had problems with listening to associates with concerns about productivity. Management would sometimes pull one associate to work somewhere else making another associate pick up the slack. As for the associates, they were a blast to work with, they were a hard working bunch, easy to get a long, everyone respected each others differences, if one associates troubles with getting a certain isle done another associate would come and help. I even had associates that didn't work in produce come and help me a few times."
good,I enjoyed working there. I worked nights which was difficult for me due to me not being use to working nights before. The people were nice. The environment was good.
good,"The best, and probably few good things about working for Walmart as a low-level employee, is enjoying the company of those that I work with. I am so blessed to have made friends with, and meet so many nice and unique people. Generally though, management is awful. There are so many unethical individuals who are in positions that need a high level of professionalism. Some days I tolerate working there, and others I hate it with a passion."
good,"another summer job I enjoy working the team was great. very helpful and hardworking, but a very fast pacing job....great experience!"
good,"muy buena empresa y grande a la vez con unos recursos humanos exelentes ,me senti muy bien trabajando y en el mejor momento la consultora me cambio a carrefour"

good,"Eu aprendi muito nessa empresa a como agir com o cliente ser mais organizada e mais responsável a ser proativa e a ouvir a opinião de todos, no geral é uma empresa boa com algumas pessoas em cargos errados na minha opinião deixando claro, não achava difícil o trabalho me sentia como se fosse minha segunda casa ."
good,"Well I'm not sure I had a typical day at Walmart. I did other jobs other thank working the customer service desk. I counted my draw, handled customer complaints, returns, cashed checks, ETC."
good,Hard every growing company that continues to challenge every facet of life. Big box retailer with room for improvement
good,"A typical day at Walmart includes alot of heavy liftng and constant stocking and sales floor maintance. The things I have learned is patience and being detailed oriented. I have come to understand and respect the different management personalities. My co-workers vary from different ages to different nationalities. The hardest part of my job would have to be the consant heavy lifting of boxes upon boxes of frieght that come in daily. The most enjoyable thing about my job would have to be my customers. I love my customers. The conversations, the smiles, makes my day go a little bit easier."
good,"It is not for everyone. It is very hot and cold. You work 6 days a week."
good,Management at this particular Location Did not seem to care much about their Employees. My co-workers were great to work with usually made it a more pleasent place to work. Most enjoyable part was being able to help people and meet new people.The hardest part of My job there was having to deny Medication to someone because of insurance or money issues for those who really needed it.
good,"Provide remarkable customer service. "
good,Walmart I unloaded trucks and help stocker on the floor.I learned how to work with a team.Management was nice and did a good job.
good,This is a good place to work when you are going to college because they will work around your class schedule and offer many different hours for you to work. I learned how to manage my time and how to give great customer service and how to run a department. My co-workers were always fun to be around and we could joke and have a good time at work. The downfall was that they did not offer much advancement
good,"A typical day at Walmart consist of ,making sure the front end was secure, getting change for registers, approving checks/ bank cards.  address any register shortages concerns.  I have learned that all situations whether big or small requires the same, your attention.  My co-workers and I were a team we all communicated greatly.  The hardest part of my job was when I had to explain to a customer, why I cant assist them in their situation.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when every task put forth to me is completed with grace and efficiency."
good,A typical day was long 13 hrs horribly run by managers and mangers didn't know how train very well.Good pay but be prepare for your body to hurt.
good,"Walmart gets something of a bad rap. The pay and benefits are no worse that those of competing retailers. Yes, I know COSTCO and a few others are the exception."
good,"Long work days, weekends, and holidays are typical."
good,good company to work for overall . get a 10 percent discount.raises every yea.r work with your scedule. get paid every two weeks on thursdays.
good,walmart definitely under pays you and does not care about employees its like slave labor here. So if you just need a job for a paycheck this is the place for you
good,"overall the company has great promotion opportunities."
good,was laid back and pretty explanatory of how things worked and where things went. coworkers were very helpful and social to me and to the customers. very good place to work.
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is working with my friends there, they are my family away from family. I've learned how to be quick and providing friendly service to my customer's. I often hear the compliment from customer's: ""She's fast!"". The hardest part of the job is standing for long periods of time."
good,It's a good place to work but it can be very challenging at times.  If you are a good mutl-tasker than this is the place for you.
good,"Walmart is an okay job if you have to work there, I never really had a bad experience but never really had a good one either, I think that it is far from what Sam Walton had hoped it would be, I have seen videos of people talking about how things were when Sam was around and Its far from that anymore, Hard or nearly impossible to get full time, Most of the management seem like they are having a bad day everyday"
good,A typical day consisted of driving a battery powered pallet jack up and down isles while picking and filling orders onto pallets.
good,"Walmart: Under Sam & John, Walmart was excellent at that time. But after Sam and John passed away, the company changed. I loved working for this company until October of 2008. And really through, no fault of their own;(because I really felt like I could handle the new position in security, I fell very short of their expectations for me. I was wrong. I was the wrong kind of person for security, because I was so visible on the floor by customers that often compromised my invisibility and because I did not like the intensity of the position in confrontations. So being terminated for breaking policy was inevitable result of a bad career decision. I had moved around the stores/company in various positions and felt competent enough to handle security. I was wrong and it cost me my job. Been unemployed every since. Even tho I do not agree with all Walmart's changes since my my dismissal, I bear no ill will. I loved all the opportunities they gave me to excell, to train, to learn and grow into every position I held, and I loved giving the best service to the customers and ""making their day"", by helping them find the things to fill their daily needs. That is what quality service is...putting the customers needs first and doing it sweetly, politely and in an efficient and timely manner."
good,"Facing items, taking out carts. Unloading and reloading carts of food. "
good,"This is my first place of work in the retail industry. Great team on management, out of approximately 6 managers (that i have dealt with), there is one weak link who was rude to employees regularly and was very unpleasant to work with, and no issues whatsoever with the rest of management. I learned to deal with customers, whether they were pleasant or not while working here and how to put the customer first as i would sometimes ignore my work duties to please customers. Seems like while I havent had an overly bad experience here, I have to say some of management seems to be out of touch with it's employees in that they do not seem to realize the workload they expect their employees. Other than that, not a bad place to work. Fellow employees are pleasant to work with. It's what you would generally expect from working at a Walmart."
good,I've work for this company for almost 6 years. I had no real issues with it until June of this year. I have grown and gained much needed experience.
good,Kind of slow some days. Learned about different things about pictures and different ways you can get them printed. management was good they always helped out when needed. My coworkers were helpful even came from different departments to help out. The only thing hard about it was when the machines would break and getting a tech to come out to fix them
good,"Came in started watering the plants in garden center, stocked the shelves, helped customers and ran the cash register. I learned that if you werent in the right group of people you were looked down upon, and ran out of your job. Loved most of the people I worked with but they were some that butted heads with me a lot. Dealing with people who didnt like you and wanted to run you off on everyday was the worst part of working there. I got 40 hours a week."
good,"It's typically what you would expect when you think of working for Walmart, not really much respect between management and employees. They only allow you to be late or absent if you are dead, otherwise there is no excuse."
good,The days are long but has plenty of job security. My co-workers are have been great. Good location. I have learned to many warehouse methods.
good,"The store provides a giant amount of items to it's customers and still doesn't realize that they fill a giant void in a small town. I cannot tell them how to balance profits with customer service, but they really need to sit down and think about it. Communication with associates is minimal. Thought I could make a difference...wrong."
good,Walmart was a standard place to work the people were nice and helpful and made everyone feel part of the team. It was also a pleasure to be able to help the customers.
good,"The customer always comes first. If i'm really busy and a customer needs my help, i'll stop everything to make sure they get the help they need."
good,"working at Wal-Mart I was put in very fast paced, stressful situations where I had to work proficiently under pressure and in the end I always evolved on top."
good,My work experience there was horrible. The managers treated you like you were worthless and they talked to you like you was a child.
good,"Typical day includes zoning apparel merchandise; and restocking merchandise. Sales Associates are  required to fill in for other positions such as cashier, cut fabric, jewelry associate, etc. Provide great customer service."
good,"The job can be stressful due to customers, and management doesn't always understand what it's like to work in this kind of environment."
good,"Working for Walmart can be very stressful at times.  The public is very opinionated and sometimes hard to get along with.  I worked from one end of the store to the other.  There was not a day that went by that I didn't have to go to the automotive dept. for a correction or okay a transaction.  Also taking change to the various depts.  I had a wonderful management team, they listened to my concerns and ideas.  They were very helpful with everyday issues.  I had fabulous co-workers. We worked together as a team to make sure things run the way they were supposed to.  The hardest part of my job was having to reprimand an associate.  I did because I had to, it just don't leave a good feeling.  The most enjoyable parts had to be meeting new people everyday.  You never know what to expect working with the public."
good,"Great Co-workers and flexible work cycles that accommodate work/life balance. "
good,"Every job is what you make of it.   You can't on someone else experience at a work place, to each is their own. For the most part its a very laid back company, one of the most flexible attendance policies ever."
good,I scanned all of the inventory in the back room to make sure our count on what we had was correct. I also stacked all the shelf in the store
good,Most of the employees were nice. Some of the managers didn't like me at all. The overnight people are time.  Drops was the hardest part of the job because it was boring.
good,Interacting with the customer was the best part of this job. Help and providing for the customer was always a good feelings. Inventory and cash handling was help to me have better management and organization.
good,meeting knew people is always fun. just a positive out look. checking out customers I a timely matter while engaging in friendly conversation.
good,"I was very excited to work for Walmart.  When I went to work for them, they promised me up to 39 hours a week.  The average I have worked is 28 to 30 hours a week.  Being my sole income, I cannot subsist on this amount."
good,Good work environment no real complaints. Not Much Room for growth. Nice holiday compensation. Medical and dental benefits were affordable for a single person.
good,"Constantly changing fast paced environment.  I learned how to reduce redundancy, improve accuracy, efficiency and achieve organizational objectives. I assisted high level executives and company directors."
good,It was a pretty cool job for my first customer service job. I learned alot from working there and do not regret the experience.
good,"While Working at this particular store, I am given a task and I do my best to complete that task before the end of my shift. Although management has not been that great. They are nice enough to work with my husbands Navy schedule, but they complain about and make me feel unwanted there. There is a big age difference in this store and i believe that might be most of my troubles, they see me and they see a kid, rather then an adult. My co-works have all been working with the company for 10+ years so they are all stuck in there ways and don't like to hear new or faster ways of doing things. So i try to stand in the shadows and just complete my work. The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to help the customers."
good,good pay for a part time job--flexible on the days that I need off for other obligation-providers extra income that I needed
good,"great team of people to be around, love the customers and their many different attitudes and colors. flexible hours , co workers are versatile."

good,"My day consists of all cash, debit cards, gift cards, and credit card transactions along with the ability for excellent customer service. Hours vary."
good,"People are usually fine, however, when anything doesn't go correctly the manager of the department will try and find a scapegoat to take the fall instead of taking responsibility."
good,While at Wal-Mart I learned absolutely nothing. Leadership was horrible and the job was boring. The hardest part of the job was finding the strength to show up. The most enjoyable part was clocking out at the end of my shift.
good,Great work place that gives you hours and have great pay and benefits. Seasonal worker but did enjoyed working their will love to go back
good,Fun places to work at and meet new people but they try to work you too much and not a very good pay which kind of makes you wonder if you really want to work their.
good,"It was kind of fun to work at wal-mart, management and my co-worker was alright. Customer was the hardest part. It was good to meet new people but to deal with the way management, it made the us as worker feel like they could do what they wanted, run the company how they pleased."
good,the best part of my job is providing quality customer service. I love making people happy and seeing them smile. management is helpful in most situations.
good,Its a good job if you are trying to gain experience. The most enjoyable part is dealing with the different personalities
good,It was an overall good experience. I learned a lot about having the manager role. I had fun at work as well as some tough times dealing with customers and habits but it was all worth it for the experience I have now.

good,"I enjoyed working at Rugged wear house just as much as I enjoyed shopping there. I enjoyed my fellow coworkers. The customers were sometimes a hassle, with not understanding that it was already a discount store. But I enjoyed the work!"
good,A typical day at work would be signing on to a register and ringing up costumer. If you work an eight hour shift then you get two fifteen minute breaks and one 1 hour lunch break. The customer is always right unless management says differently. Which they never do. The customer is always right no matter how rude they get with you. My favorite part of my job is bonding with my co-workers and having enjoyable conversations with the nice costumers.
good,"Walmart as a whole is not a bad company to work for, I never feel like I'm at risk of losing my job to someone else because they hire everyday and always promote from within when possible. However through the years working for them I have noticed that the companies dedication to the individual employee has diminished, some of the people that I work directly under don't even know my name. "
good,"A typical day of work at the Wal-Mart bakery includes filling shelves so we have the product to sell to customers when our shelf stock gets low.  This also includes breaking out the frozen for the nest days baking and scanning the day old rack multiple days within one evening.  We are to assist a customer if at all possible even when it is outside your department.  You must also be prepared to write on cakes and make cake orders with confirming with our back stock and the cake decorators schedule.  "

good,"My most recent place of employment was Walmart, this is a great company, with great potential to move up in management in the business."
good,"I started every morning by clocking in, I go in my station and start choosing what I should start with,  I learned that working in this field comes with a lot of hands on things, the management wasn't as kind as thoughtful when it came to working in Walmart, there was no teamwork involved nobody actually tried to help when the time was needed, the hardest part about working in Walmart was the lack of communication, when a question was asked there was never an answer, the best part about working there was that I was motivated, willing to brush past all of the obstacles that might've been in my path"
good,"The co-workers one meets at walmart are all very nice. Just like in any normal work place, some gossip goes around, and everyone has a group they eat with at lunch, but generally everyone is amazingly friendly! Everyone gets their work done as well as they are able, and trainers are well picked. Management, however, isn't what it needs to be. There are many times when a manager is needed, they aren't there, or are too busy, and same with team leaders. Many team leaders are also newer to the job, than the co-workers taking direction from them. Many issues with management and team leaders. However the work place is very nice and well kept."
good,they have good benefits but and they take care of there employees and customers I think any one who works for this company will like it
good,"Walmart was a very fast past job. I started off as a cashier moved up to a Electronics sales associate. I meet tons of different people and helped many. I learned how to handle different people and how to keep them happy. How to manage my other coworkers if they were knew and/or didn't know what to do that day. The hardest part was to keep my energy up sometimes, I had to run around a lot helping out a lot of customers when I was the only person on the floor at some points. But I did like meeting new people and making their days better."

The hardest part of this job was dealing with the difficult customers, but there were and equal amount of pleasant customers that balanced things out. Good job to have if you are going to work in retail."
good,"this is a good place to work everyone is friendly, but you pretty much have to teach yourself how to work there because of the lack of training they give."
good,"I liked Walmart as a company , however I just didn't like the location I worked at .  A lot of the managers I never even met . sometimes its actually nice to meet with the store managers to know what there expectations of you really are."

good,"Punching into the time clock on arrival at work."
good,"This was a great first job, it just was not for me once I had a baby and needed a set schedule. I did however enjoy knowing what I would be doing every day before I would walk in the door. I learned how to talk to customers and answer customer questions. I also think that was the hardest part about the day, was ensuring you answered the customers questions fully and to the best of your ability without saying ""um."""
good,"typical day full of hard work, management was rarely seen, fun environment to work in, learned a lot on the daily. Customer was some what friendly"

Lot's more to be in charge of. Was expected to be trained in a very short time. Not enough time in one day to get things done. I did work with some great people."
good,I was a cashier and helped many customers find and check out with there everyday needs. I learned how to count money and also very good customer service skills.

Also keeping the store inventory in-stock by placing orders and finishing reports. throughout my experience in retail management I've learned how to deal with various or numerous types of customers. Management positions I've held, customer service manager and department manager. The hardest part of the job is mostly coming up with new challenges to come by. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with others and achieving the goals required throughout the day."
good,I loved my job. There was always something to do and the most enjoyable part was meeting new people. I learned something new everyday.
good,Being a manager up front was a little stressful at times. At Wal-Mart you do a lot but don't get paid what you should. A typical day was making sure customers were happy and everything was running smoothly. The things that I enjoyed is how they reached out to the community to help with certain fundraisers or charities.
good,"A typical day is both predictable and hectic. You do the same tasks each day and it can range from a moderate to a high stress environment. Some management can be personable and will be very friendly and endearing which makes bringing up any problems easier so it can be worked out. "

good,"I appreciated Walmart's flexible work schedules and their attention to customer service"
good,"I would start my day running the register that I was assigned to. If needed help in customer service or money center my manager sent me in the department. Co-workers, some were hard workers and some were non-hard workers. Hard part of the job was being depended on to get the lines down or picking up the slack of other co-workers. I mainly enjoyed all the experience and new skills I was being taught."

good,the company itself is good but that particular store doesnt treat their associates with the respect they deserve. but other than that i had no other problems i loved the associates i worked with.
good,I had to get on my hands and knees to scrub old scum from the registers. I removed shelves and set them up and different locations. It was fun working with new people knowing we would only be there for a short time. There was 6 different managers I worked with from different states and they had unique personalities.

good,"It was ok. If  you were good with management, then you would move up. When I was there, there was no benefits for part time until you were there for almost a year, or accumulated a certain amount of hours. If you talked to management a few weeks before you wanted a day off you had to make sure they did it in front of you or it probably wouldn't get put into the system because they would forget."
good,"It was great helping customers and going out of my way to help them as much as I could, making sure they were satisfied. Would also open up credit cards for qualified applicants."

good,"In my typical day, I would organize shelves, water flowers (worked in the garden center), assisted customers and occasionally got called up to help cashier.  This job taught me how to deal with a variety of people.  "
good,"Great workplace with lacking management.  But i learned many things there."
good,"I love my coworkers and majority of my customers, but management loves to ""micromanage"". I feel like they are constantly watching me and negatively critiquing me all day."
good,"This is a good starter job for a person who is still in high school and doesn't need to take care of a family. If you are there long enough, you are able to possibly move up in rank."
good,"We are always short staffed any given day I will work carts, cashier, customer service,  jewelry, sporting goods while running the front end at the time."
good,Its an ok company to work for if you are in high school or you don't have anyone to take care of other than yourself.  Just not a place I would recommend for anyone trying to make a living for themselves.
good,"Worked 9 years for the company.Very tough work/ life balance. Sometimes I was working 13 hours a day, which eventually led me to walk away from the company after many years of service."
good,"The coworkers are the best part of the job, everyone is friendly and fun to work with. The most difficult part of the job, for me, is when there is nothing that can be done for a patient. Usually this is financially, and due to certain circumstances, certain types of materials that might be necessary are not feasible. I wish there were a way to help, but unfortunately, there isn't much that can be done."
good,"I love the job, customers, co-workers, and most of management. My typical day is to make sure change is at all tills in a timely manner. Count the floats of each till set for the day. Do price checks if needed, make sure the customers have a good experience at the store and leave satisfied as possible. My co-workers are great, we have fun yet get the job done. The hardest part of my job is making everyone happy. The best thing about my job is I get to talk and get to know customers as they are a person not a buyer."
good,They can be a great company if you kiss their butts. i worked for Wal-Mart for 2.5 yrs and because 2 co-mgrs did not like me i was fired. I started out as a cashier and got 2 promotions. Upon my 2nd promotions is when things went bad. I was never late from any break and the one time i was i got wrote up even though theres people there late from their break everyday including managers. They have decent benefits but just watch yourself
good,Every day I enjoyed what I was doing. Season in retail are a great experience. Great crew always finding ways to better myself and others
good,It was a fun job but pay was horrible. the only thing that is goob about the job is getting to talk to people on a daily basis. you especially have to be a people person. supervisors suck!
good,my main function at work was to take orders for cake/cupcakes and to make those orders.  I was a very artistic outlet that was always growing in ideas and talent.
good,learned how to resolve third party issues. Very stressful during the last 2 years working there management was difficult to work with. Many tasks put on certain people to do with no extra help.
good,I enjoyed working the registers when the store was busy. Having a steady flow of customers kept me focused.  I preferred the morning shift but was assigned lots of late nights. It was an experience.
good,"working at walmart was a down home feel you spend more time with associates then family-therefore they become your work family.you have your regular customers who get to know your and appreciate your service to them.another thing with the walmart company they are so widely known people from all over the world stop in while traveling,enjoying the famialar surroundings they have back home in their own store-and it is very rewarding to meet out a towners who are enjoying your store and the area and getting feed back how perhaps their store is simialar or different from what they are used to."
good,"Responsible for maintaining supply inventories, stocking shelves and keeps store clean. Answered telephones, transferred calls, took and relayed messages accurately. Assisted customers in fitting; took care of some customer mistakes; rung out customer purchases with the aid of a cash register; issuing lines of credit; assisted in opening and closing store by counting funds."
good,A typical day is very productive. I've learned alot about customer service. Management is very reasonable and compitant. Iget along very well with my co-workers. The hardest part about my jobs is dealing with hostile customers. the most enjoyable part of my job is connecting with customers and helping them to get exactly what they need.
good,"Willing to teach and expanding you learning. Can be fasted Pasted. Work in different areas of the store. Co-workers switch a lot, management is willing to work with you."
good,"Es una empresa de alta importancia asi mismo creo que el salario que ofrecen no es el adecuado para los cargos que se tienen La gerencia nefasta cuando tenias un problema no te daban solucion alguna solo la que fuera de su conveniencia siempre sales debiendo pues si estas en cajas y por cualquier razon se puerde dinero en la caja te lo descuentan y si de por si el salario es poco terminas con la peor quincena "
good,"While this wasn't my ideal job, I can honestly say that it wasn't horrible.  My immediate supervisors were great. The higher up management not so much. They were rude and just didn't seem to care.  I learned to be skeptical of people."
good,There's always something to keep you busy while working here. Never bored. If Walmart payed more it would be more a more enjoyable job.
good,"This was a good place to work.  I stocked shelves (looking for other employment).  The people were fair and friendly.  I not only stocked shelves, but was responsible for moving and remodeling areas of the store, as a team player.   The job was ok."
good,i would start my day in the dairy department helping stocking dairy products frozen goods as well as in dry grocery or chemicals if needed
good,"I am second to the department manager of pharmacy.  My co-workers are great the ones that I work with.  I mostly work with the dept. manager and we always are having fun.  There is always something to do stock, zoning, and cleaning."
good,fast steady pace deals with customer returns deals with recalls paperwork associates management associates deal with customers
good,"Por ser do comércio varejista, é uma empresa que exige bastante do potencial de seus funcionários de domingo a domingo."
good,Overall it is an ok job. It pays but they lack incentives and benefits for employees. Starting pay was low considering the fact that I was certified and went to school. Certification was included in the actual basis of pay but not education
good,Working for this company had its pros and cons. A typical work day consisted of scanning a customer's purchases. The management here was good at handling customer complaints. Overall it was a good work environment.
good,good people and a nice pleace to work. The people are good to you and working at walmart is ok but some of the people are not nice at all becaues some are not nice to some people.
good,"The company takes good care of there employees,but only if not a temp worker.The temp people only get to work at busy times of year and then are let go."
good,Wal-Mart trys to do the most with the less. There appreciation for employees is not good. They usually are always under staffed on purpose.
good,"its an okay company to work for.  Management is okay.  The pay is minimum, you do get a discount for working there.  I would recommend this job to a friend though."
good,"Working for the company of Wal-Mart can be deceiving. I work 3rd shift so a lot of the tasks are thrown on us. I have worked for two stores now, and I must say both have shown disappointment. I have learned a lot in business, ever since the 8th grades, and knowing that the managers made it too their position baffles me. My general work night is supposed to control how much inventory goes out, and in the backroom warehouse. It would go swell if we were staffed. We are always understaffed, and the ones that are here are expected to work twice as hard to fill those spots that management decided not to fill. Every night i have to almost drag myself to work because I know what is in my future."
good,"You have to be able to work very hard, if you let up you will be written up until you are fired. definitely not a job for everyone but i can do it."
good,A typical Day was working at a fast paced. I learned stocking is something I like doing. My co workers were more team workers then anything.
good,too many workers and not enough managers or shift leads to keep up with everyone other then that this a great job great hours but the pay is not so great because you always have a lolt of extra work to do
good,"Not much different from Kroger or anywhere else, the main con to it are the costumers themselves. Management was pretty understanding and would work with you, but end of the day working retail will wear you thin."
good,I enjoyed the customer service part of the job. I didn't like how some people weren't being held to the standards of the other people.
good,"Typical day involved engaging with customers and making them feel welcomed and appreciated for shopping at Wal-Mart. I was taught how to handle trouble customers and how to efficently solve problems with resolutions that could benefit us as a company as well as the customers. Management was really my only complaint. They seemed to all have different methods of accomplishing the same task and would repremand employes on ""not doing it their way"" which led to much confusion among newer associaties. I loved being able to interact and talk with all sorts of people all day. You got to meet some really amazing people and started to notice having ""regulars"" that would always come through your line, which is a very nice feeling"
good,"Llego checo en el reloj mi entrada, checo la bitácora de pendientes, empiezo a programar cajeros de turno a que área irán este día , recibo el valor de la caja choca para fondos de cajeros, les indico su área realizo pendientes de bitácora mientras visualizo a cajeros para apoyarlos en sus dudas eh inquietud de algún cliente, hago cortes , entrego valores voy al controlador a checar los reportes, vació datos en correo, envió correo capturo las ventas les doy su puntuación a los cajeros de su turno, cierro sistema y mando los reportes para el siguiente día.. Apredi mucho de sistemas, la parte mas difícil es ya en la salida que estamos contra reloj para enviar reportes , lo que mas me gusta es la interacción directa con los clientes."
good,"It was an okay place to work. Managers were okay, coworkers were awesome, Hardest part of the job were some of the rude customers that came in. Best part were the coworkers."
good,"The company was a great place to learn how a large fortune five hundred company handles itself.  I love the people I work with they are a hard working group of people. They are loyal to the company."
good,I performed daily maintenance tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with great co workers who share my optimistic demeanor and enjoyed spending time conversation while getting the job done.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job is doing a good job well done with the teammates. I learned how to off load trucks, stocks and pick merchandise. Management and co workers are very friendly. The hardest of the job is when you don't know any other departments beside your own department."
good,A typical day at Walmart really depends on what department/area you work in and varies greatly.  I thought it would be easier to move around internally than it was.  My favorite part of working there wasn't my daily job but volunteering each year during shareholder week when associates from all over the world descend on Bentonville.
good,I had fun working with the  unique individuals at walmart it was truly and educational experience. The managers were professional and caring.
good,"During my employment at Walmart, the cashiers were required to assisted customers with any store-related needs, as well as ringing them up at the cash registers. We were responsible for keeping our area clean and welcoming customers to a friendly store environment."
good,not always the best at walmart. heavy work loads and not alot of time to get the job done. need to treat the workers better.
good,"The job at Walmart was a well paced labor job, it had its downs, but had its ups as well, as all jobs do."
good,"mi dia a dia era de mucho control. en todo sentido, supervisando las tareas que se me encomendaban en conjunto con las supervisoras de cajas."
good,"As a cashier, I would provide customer service at the register. I would keep the work area clean and help keep isles clean."
good,"• Greet customers as they arrive at the store and provide them with information about products and/or services"
good,"Some co-workers were fun to work with, but when it came time to take on more responsibility management would over look you."
good,hard working and safe environment. i learned how to use a scanner and printer. i learned how to bin. co-workers are friendly and hard working. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the -10 degree freezer.
good,"This job taught me how to become more organized and how to achieve that organization and also to make the work area less cluttered when the job was finished.  I learned that balance is necessary when working with large amounts of product that need to be put in their places.  Stocking shelves may not seem like the highest job but a lot of effort is required to be fast and efficient to be good at, and fortunately I was given the opportunity to do just that.  What I enjoyed most was that feeling that I made accessible to customers the items they needed and product in that store sold very fast every day."
good,"Overall, I've had a pretty good experience at Wal-Mart. I know people say that Wal-Mart is a horrible place to work but each store is very different from one another which means that individual experiences can vary a lot. The effectiveness of management also varies from store to store. I'd say the managers in my store were decent. They weren't bad or great either but good enough. Its a good job for a teen, someone starting out, or a person who wants experience in customer service but its definitely not something  to make a career out of. Customers are difficult and can be down right horrible sometimes no matter what store you work in and in some stores even the management is horrible. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers (the things some people will tell you) and also your coworkers. The hardest part is dealing with irate customers."
good,"Very easy place to work at. Friendly co-works. Reasonable pay. Work schedules are not that great, but they are willing to work with you."
good,Loved the interaction with co-workers and customers. Really helped to sharpen my communication skills. Management wasn't the best but wasn't the worse either
good,"No steady hours, inconsistent managers - pulled in one direction by one and another by a different one. They do not have consistent top-down support, which would lead to more productive, happier employees. "
good,"não fazia nada de Administração "
good,"A typical day at work involved stocking eggs, milk, yogurt and other dairy items.  I learned that this job wasn't suited for me.  Management was cooperative, flexible and easy to talk to.  My co-workers were honest productive people.  The hardest part of the job was the temperature in the freezer.  The most enjoyable part was paycheck"
good,"clock in and get items needed to do job."
good,When you start your shift you start cleaning your workstation. If a customer comes up while you are cleaning you stop cleaning and take care of the customer. When it is slow you would red line your station which means that you stand at the front of your station and help customers as well as aid them in what they are looking for.
good,One night temp for black Friday It was just one night for Black Friday Sale It was only one night thru a temp agency.It was a fun working enviroment clean and same . Was offered a job but didn't take because of location
good,I would have stayed if i were not in school at the time. I was very convenient to work overnight with a guaranteed 40 hours every week.
good,The compay is so concerned with its customers sometimes looses site on the associate.  Overall the company leadership does differ throughout the country and I witnessed it from state to state and from store to store.
good,"Good job for high schoolers or those needing supplemental income; Did not stay very long; lots of work, low pay. Went to school for better future;"
good,"I enjoy customer interaction and the ability to learn new skills with the ability to promote, I like taking on the responsibility of taking charge and maintain two large departments in the store, I really busy at work, but I do not let that stop me from reaching my goals, management is okay, could be better and more motivating, my co-workers are social and goal-oriented, as well, the most difficult part of my job is being expected to complete certain tasks in a given amount of time, I do enjoy my job because it allows me to take leadership and show my capabilities, I believe my departments reflect my work, therefore, I do all that is needed to keep everything clean, prices updated and so on, but I do like expectations of my work"
good,I worked at my on speed and it felt great for nobody to be riding your back about what you was doing or what you had finished.
good,"Big company, poor pay. People were fun but treated poorly by management. A job not a career. Demanded loyalty without showing loyalty in return."
good,"Checking out customers with a smile and the right attitude. Assisting them with their questions and needs. As soon as I turned my aisle light on, customers were ready. I learned that the cashiers are the last people that the customers see. It is up to the cashiers to show them a great checking out experience so they would be sure to come back."
good,"Time spent working both as a cashier and over-night stocking; I enjoyed my time at both positions, as each had their merit. Working cash on busy days certainly made the time go by faster. While some overnight shifts could drag on, especially if we were waiting for a new truck to show up, and had to work overstocked items, most of which ended up having to be put back on a pallet as soon as they were taken off. "
good,"Fun working with co workers."
good,"A typical day at work would involve working the front end registers and also working whatever other areas that might need covering like jewelry, dressing room, etc. there was also cleaning and returns involved. What i learned there was being able to adapted to ever changing situations."
good,"Unloading trucks that contain merchandise. Help new employees on learning their roles of their jobs. The job is great to start your first work experience, but with a degree you should want more for your-self."
good,I worked as a cashier/supervisor for Walmart from 2008-2011. The job was very remedial but the people at my store were wonderful.
good,A typical day at this job included helping customers with their questions and zoning and stocking store shelves.  The job was enjoyable as I was able to effectively serve customers.
good,"I checked out customers, straightened shelves and anything else that needed to be done.  I learned that there are all different kinds of customers.  The management was pretty good.  Co-workers were nice and polite for the most part.  The hardest part is dealing with the rude customers.  Helping customers was also the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"very dependent on the quality of management at each store."
good,"The hours were all over the place, there was no way to make plans or have a set schedule. There was too much work to accomplish in the day. The people in grocery were also in charge of the pet department. It was difficult to cover both areas successfully and stock as needed. Coworkers were fun and most of the managers are too! I was trusted to work alone which was nice. I could focus on my tasks without worrying about much else. It is better to learn the entire store though, so you can help customers with anything they may be having trouble finding. I did not get to take care of the fish as well as I wanted. I hated seeing the poor guys suffer."
good,"Open printer, clean lab, dust, sweep, mop if neccessary, help customers, make suggestions, ring items and take different payments, pull items from backroom, operate handheld computer, make shelf and inventory labels, set up mods,  stock shelves, complete CBLs(computer based learning modules),  be aware of potential thieves. Our photo and electronics depts. work very well "
good,I did like working in retail.  I worked with customers everyday while stocking and organizing merchandise.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers.
good,Management was not very good nor where the employees. Expected you to do so much in so little time. Constantly being rushed and watched.
good,Was pretty busy with things to do always. The management wasn't very nice and they worked us very hard for the least pay. Wouldn't go back
good,"long hours"
good,Solid place to work when properly staffed.  Management is a bit incompetent at time. Most associates are good to work with.
good,Opening registers for the day. Assisting clients/patients with their prescription requests. contacting health care providers and insurance companies to rectify issues with prescriptions.  Everyone works as a team to deliver the best possible care and service to clients/patients. Maintain proper recording of documents and prescriptions. Ordering product as needed to meet the needs of patrons. The most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction derived from helping others.
good,"On a daily basis I would check for lows and outs. Fill what needed to be filled from freight in the backroom. Complete price changes in a timely manner and make sure to complete all modular in timely manner. Order any outs and fix on hands if counts were off. I have learned how to manage others with a positive attitude and explain and teach them when questions or uncertainties arise."
good,"Being a cashier at Walmart is what I assume is typical of many retail positions.  There are a couple days of training (less if you're already experienced) and after that days get pretty typical quickly.  I worked mostly 8 hour days in which I arrived and punched in, and worked registers in two hour spurts with 15 minute breaks and an hour lunch in between.  On occasion I would be instructed to re-shelve returned items, which we called ""go-backs.""  This broke up the monotony of register work.  During those times I also sort of doubled as a sales associate, assisting customers with the prices and locations of products while I re-shelved and organized items."
good,Progressed my Walmart career from cashier to Department Manager. The constant change of policies and hours were a burden at times.
good,it was a good experience.needed more structure & communication. managers never communicated much with the employees to inform them on whats going on.
good,"Each day my job id to provide services to customers in a delightful way and to ensure that they are pleased in such a way that, they would always return.my co workers on my shift are fabulous. the management listens and even has a suggestion box."
good,"Translated business needs and priorities into actionable logistics strategies."
good,Most positions you don't need any previous skills.  There are opportunities to earn more responsibilities and advance within the company.
good,"cleaning restroom, conducting safety sweeps, listening for any radio calls for any spills, helping customer locate items when necessary and greeting customers."
good,It was so little work to be done with a lot of time so you had so you had to stretch it out to last you through the night.  I was just to help out with some money for school.
good,"As a cashier, I would have to greet and bag the customers purchases. I would ask to see if they had found everything they needed and make sure their experience at Wal-Mart was a good one. I would also assist them in a price correction and even get the manager if they had a problem that I could not solve."
good,It was a fine job to work at i would get to work about 20 minutes early and  wait then clock in it would start off slow then pick up in the evening. the only thing i really did not like was when i told the manger i could not work after 10:45 because the bus stop running and it was the only one close to me. one day  i had to walk home i did not make it there till 2 in the morning. he told me Ok thats fine i wont put you  on that shift again and the next week he schedule me to close that whole week. My co-workers was very nice n helpful when i first started.
good,"This is not a place for everyone to decide to turn into a career. If you need extra cash for a while, this is the place to be. I like my current location. The people are fun. There is lots of work to do, but the job would be boring if there was nothing to do. "
good,Maintained parking lot and helped customers find what they needed in the store. It was a decent job. I would not like to do this again.
good,"This workplace has a decent environment.  The coworkers are very friendly.  Most of the managers work hard.  However, there appears to be a problem of favoritism within the workplace.  Also, several managers engage in putting down the cashiers in front of customers."
good,"They assign you to one location as your job. But they are not shy to take you away from it. I did photo lab but was taken greeter, cashier, and where ever else they could shove me that day."
good,"i will never work at Wal-Mart again. Although I have met some great peers during my time their, the management does not care for you."
good,Wal-Mart is an okay place to work. The hardest part of the job is keeping balance. I worked in each and every department. I enjoyed it for the most part. I would say it is a great job for college students or retired people.
good,Being hired at Walmart has taught me how to work with others and how to deal with customers. My co-workers were for the most part nice and easy to get along with. The hardest part was probably was dealing with customers. Being paid weekly was probably the most enjoyable part.
good,loved  the customers and the  job  pretty  flexible  management  wasnt  to helpful  and  good  advancement opportunities need  to  work  on  there  management and co-worker  relationships
good,Walmart gave me an opportunity to interact with different people. I also learned how to handle a lot of money. I even got a chance to train cashiers and stock shelves.
good,empresa com beneficios bons mais com relacionamento ruim com seus empregados
good,"Working at Walmart was definitely an experience. Most of my coworkers were great people and we were like a family. Being in a management position at Walmart involves being overworked and over extended on a daily basis. There was never enough help and most managers are required to do the work of 5 people in a regular 40 hour week. Although I found this to be difficult, I rose to the challenge and succeeded. The trouble was the harder one worked, the more work would get thrown at you and nothing was ever appreciated."
good,I learn how to use clean bathroom and clean up floors .Management was really never there. My coworkers didn't even really show me nothing. i learn most of it on my own.
good,"co workers work as a team to get task done quickly"
good,nice company to work with and start your career.co workers were very co-operative.its a good place to work at.best in retail sector
good,"Typical day at work included stocking shelves, making displays look neat and providing friendly customer service. Best part about the job is the friendly people and working in the many different departments."
good,"O walmart e uma empresa que da oportunidades aprendi varias funcoes atendimento ao cliente ao publico ,fazer conferencia empacotar producao ajudar na produçao fazer contagem de sagrias no caixa geral aatendimento aos operadores .Meus colegas muitos dedicados a parte mas dificial longo no inicio e aprendar o sistema depois com dias vc aprende normalmente a parte mas agradevel e vc se interagir com todos ."
good,Working at Wal-Mart was a good experience for me. I would arrive on time for my shift and get the work done that needed to be done and more. I went above what my job required and did the best quality work to my ability.
good,"less customers to deal with i stock merchandise in shampoo vitiams"
good,the overall pay is great but they started to take certain benefits away that would give you something to strive for which is a huge let down for those who work hard.
good,"I enjoyed working the phones at walmart, I was able to  move around the store to help customers. i would halp people on the phone as well. i didnt enjoy the customers who thought it was ok to talk down to me and you will get that alot."
good,"I worked with a diverse groups which developed my cooperation. "
good,everyday I unloaded the trailer and help train other unloaders I loved doing it because i notice that people really listened to me
good,"	Overnight Stocker, consisting of stocking the freight on to the shelves, lifting over 50lbs of merchandise. Worked all phases of building maintenance."
good,"Aprendí muchas cosas nuevas, la relación con la gente, el trato era muy bueno al igual que con los gerentes un buen ambiente. La parte más difícil del trabajo es la responsabilidad y lo atento que tiene que ser uno con el tema del manejo del dinero. y lo que más me gusto fue que aprendí de todos y fue una linda experiencia."
good,"Typical day started at 8am with opening up and preparing the shop for service. The rest of the workday was filled with oil, tire, and battery work orders, with the shop closing up at 8pm. The training was very hands-on, any questions were answered without issue. The manager of the shop worked in the shop with us, and we had strong team spirit. Co-workers were friendly, or at least amicable. The only downside was the upper management not doing much by way of greater shop maintenance (fixing or replacing equipment, dealing with workplace hazards such as crumbling inspection pits.) The hardest part of the job was the heat in the summer. The most enjoyable part of the job was everything else. I loved working in that shop."
good,"Most mangers are nice, your co workers are friendly. "
good,"It was a job, That's all I can say. It consisted of typical cashier duties and helped me to develop outstanding customer service skills. As long as you have no problem talking to strangers this job is great."
good,Productive and fun workplace with great management. The hardest part of the job is dealing with changing of the seasons.
good,"Learned to properly organize and enhanced my skills on money management."
good,Made sure customer got there carts so they can shop. I made sure merchandise was stock. And when we close. We have to make the parking lot is cleared before leaving.
good,"I worked for Walmart for two years, and it has its pros and cons. Coworkers were awesome; however, customers (in general) were super rude and most managers (not all of them) did not treat workers with respect. There is a lot of room for improvement."
good,A typical day consisted of checking receipts the hardest part of the job was the customers who got upset about what was being done.
good,good management and people always busy and your day can go by pretty quickly and they will work with you if you need a certain schedule for school
good,"A very labor intensive job. Unloaders work harder than any other employees, but they rarely have to interact with customers."
good,"i would open sometimes alone and cars would be lined up befor i even open the shop i would let costumers know i mite take a minut  for i was alone then i would proceeder to work on them in order of there arivel. then i would stock , clerane or olrganize as needed wern there were no cars to work on. iwould work inside wen not on a car , stocking, or helping at the cashregester."
good,I enjoyed working for wal-mart it's always go to learn tranferable skills to take to the next job and to grow learn more skill.
good,"1) footfall conversion is high "
good,"Como mi primer empleo apredi mucho:"
good,"Manage 20 to 30 people and accomplish goals for the company.  Input schedules and time sheets for payroll "
good,"At work i would basically stalk carts, down stake pallets, organize our cooler, first in first out... we could clean our produce sales floors. wash the carpets. also i would cull, zone, stalk, and clean. i would usually work with two other co workers and maybe on a good day two managers or department managers. The hardest part about my daily job i would have to say would be doing the heavy lifting of the bananas or apples.. the most enjoyable part of my day was working with others, i am a very sociable person so just having others around me makes my days go by faster an makes things funner an more enjoyable."
good,The environment is not that healthy. The goals they have for their employees are not very technically reachable. Management is alright. They hardest part about this job is meeting the required goals without hurting yourself and getting wrote up.
good,"Overall I have enjoyed working at Walmart. I have been fortunate enough to have great mangers and employees.  There is always room for improvement, but the good out way the bad."
good,"Llegaba solicitaba que me abrieran caja chica , hacia arqueo , sacaba reportes , posteriormente , realizaba cargos para personal , despues hacia mi detalle para comenzar con mi poliza , terminaba la poliza y comenzaba a ingresarla a sistemas para posteriormente enviarla a mexico , checaba mi correo respondia correos y realizaba los ajustes correspondientes al tef bancario , entregaba panamericano segun llegaran y posteriormente me dedicaba a retirar a los cajeros , dotarlos , montar joyeria , atender joyeria y entregar reportes , armaba fondos para entregar mi turno . "
good,Is a decent place to work but could be more nicer to their employee. They wouldn't let their employees talk much with other employees and like to yell and complain for just something really simple.
good,"I was responsible for training new associates, shipped damaged material, claimed merchandise, processed paper, maintained communication and rapport with vendors for return authorizations, securely destroyed merchandise, processed claims, kept claims room at low inventory level."
good,"Work at Walmart produce section was secure, stable, albeit quite repetitive.  I learned how to better work with people by identifying my own flaws and other people's strength and temperaments.  It was difficult at times to juggle between duties and fulfilling customers' demands, especially during holidays.  "
good,"Day shift:"
good,Good place but management could use a class in compassion. They are flexible but sometimes penalized for having to go home for a family issue.
good,"A typical day would be breaking down pallets, stocking floors, and mopping floors. I learned that you can be successful at doing your job but the job may not be right for you. Hardest part of the job was I guess fitting in. Was very uncomfortable working somedays. Most enjoyable part was completing all work assigned."
good,Lots of customers and is good if you enjoy big box retail type of stores. management can vary and your success depends on who you get and what you do to advance
good,"A typical day at work was unloading trucks , using pallet jacks. I learned how to pick and pack in a warehouse. Also sold televisions and other electronics. The hardest part of the job was on busy days with low staff scheduled. the most enjoyable part of the day was working with coworkers with great attitudes."
good,walmart is a very competitive place to work. its a good place to work and fast paced. the customers service is a first and cannot be compared.
good,A typical day at Walmart for me was unloading a supply truck and tacking inventory to the sales floor in a specific amount of time.
good,I would like to have more time to spend with my family. The hours I put in working is taking a toll with my family and they are feeling very neglected because I spend more time at work than with them.
good,"Ok. Satisfecho. Buen ambiente laboral, es satisfactorio laborar para esta  compañia"
good,they were ok to work for. not my favorite place at the time. the associates weren't always nice to the customers and they would even treat the co-workers like they weren't worth being there
good,"zone"
good,"Easy work environment, daily workload easily accomplished. The morale in the stores seem to be directly influenced by the store managers and move down the chain. Overall, happy store manager, happy workplace."
good,Learn about meats and different ways to cook them very fast. Must be organized and willing to life pounds of meat at a time while still assisting customers. Co-Workers are very helpful but sometimes may get swapped with all the duties you have to do but a very stand up job at the end of the day.
good,The pace is typically very fast and it isn't uncommon for one to be asked to balance multiple tasks at once by management. My co-workers were often times very enjoyable to work with. The management wasn't all too caring about the employees at times and it took a toll on the workers' individual performance at times.
good,the mananagerment was not fair to me at all. I would work hard and no praise or thank you. each day was ok some days and other days it would be like do I have to work today.
good,Most of this position was spent working alone stocking shelves.  The training was surprisingly extensive and was challenging at times and I was diligent in completing the training as soon as possible
good,I liked working at Walmart because I got to learn all aspects of the store. I got to work in every department and learn everything about that department.
good,Trabajo para el formato lider.cl el cual tiene un buen ambiente de trabajo donde he aprendido mucho de mis compañeros
good,"I worked as a floor associate. While I worked for Wal-Mart, it was a very family friendly place to work. They were accommodating to family needs"
good,"Working for Wal-Mart is okay, the pay is not all that great for what you are doing. Sure its good right out of high school and its a good start but the pay isn't. Management likes to over work you. You work hard and you start getting overtime, well management will have you cut all of that hard working overtime. Even when they ask you to stay to help out they still want you to keep cutting those hours. For me I work hard and I like to see that in my pay checks."
good,co-workers are great to work with.  customers can sometimes be difficult to satisfy. Management can be unclear with directions.
good,"I did all things for walmart. "
good,I enjoyed working at walmart the employees were very nice and the management was competent and I enjoyed working with them.
good,Being a cusotmer a manager for walmart had its ups and downs. Ups where you incountered with some people tha dont think that your helping them sum rude and some s sweet that you will never forget them. The thing with this type of job you have to rememeber that your dealing with all type of personalities each and everyday. What Ive learned from working here is not everyone is goin to agree you must stay humble and always pleasant because the customer is always right.
good,"In the produce department it is an active job, and always has something to do. Some days it can be stressful or back breaking, but overall it is a good job for a college student. "
good,I will never recommend this company to anyone unless if you are desperately in need of money. They will force you to make as much mastercards for them as possible. That's the main reason I hated working there.
good,Walmart is a big fast past company. If you have no patience this will not be the job for you. If this company you have to stay to yourself and just do your job and go home.
good,"I learned a lot from working at Walmart, and appreciate the experience that has helped me grow in my overall career. "
good,the co-workers are fun and easy to work with. management sucks and the costumers are hardly ever friendly. wouldn't recommend working there if you cant handle a stressful environment.
good,"The job at Walmart, was quite easy and the employees there made the rather repetitive task (i.e., scanning) bearable. This job overall built my patience and improved my problem solving and customer relation skills."
good,existe  en ocasiones un mal trato de parte de la gerencia hacia los trabajadores .
good,I worked there for about 6 months and I didn't hate it but I didn't love it. Meeting the people was fun but I didn't know who I was reporting to and who was my manager and who wasn't. It wasn't the happiest place to work.
good,"I usually check in the work from the lab, sell glasses and contacts help with the customers. Fellow workers were great. The store is very neat and organized. I did travel to other Wal-Mart to fill in."
good,"Received delivered packages and ensuring proper amount is inside"
good,"Customer service, clean, stock. A very social workplace. Manage other teammates. Learned how to operate multiple departments at a time."
good,Walmart was an opportunity to earn a low wage with little chance for advancement.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers but the cost of transportation to and from work meant that I couldn't afford to work there.
good,"Task that needed to be completed throuhghout the day included stocking the fresh, seafood, and packaged meat wall. It also included inventory, freezer and warehouse-like related experience. Customer service interaction is daily and frequent. The hardest part of the job was keeping and maintain full stock on fresh wall without enough inventory. The most enjoyable part of the job is the feeling of breaking down and completing many challenging task."
good,walmart gave me alot of oppertineties to learn many different skills and opportunity.while i was thier i form freindships that still last.
good,"Most enjoyable is meeting new people. Typical work day busy, fast moving. Friendly coworkers. Hardest part of job is scheduling."
good,I have found that Wal-Mart is a great way to start in the job field because it has many opportunity's to exceed in the retail environment.
good,People you work with are great. You always have each others back. Management is always poor and aggressive. I would suggest to find another company first.
good,"Working with produce, making subs and salads, keeping work area clean, customer service skills and how to work with others"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was creating something new and working on projects. There were great avenues of learning and most of the bosses are understanding and helpful.
good,"Process and handle customer transactions. Assist co-workers with order and neatness of front of store. Handle lotto, tobacco, and money order sales behind the customer service counter."
good,A typical work day is usually really busy with little time to breathe in between. i learned communication skills and how to help people when the need it along with using a cash register and bagging groceries and etc. management Is alright depending on who is working that day. Co workers are nice to have just depends on the type of day they are having if they are moody or not The hardest part of the job is dealing with the rude customers. the enjoyable part is being able to cash people out and meeting new people
good,"at typical day at work would be greeting customers answering questions, receive payments via cash , check or credit cards. also having small talk and wishing them a very good day"
good,"fast paced environment, totally customer based.  I worked overnight full count inventory. I also created weekly work scheduels."
good,"I always enjoyed merchandising with this company. Hard work and face pace kept me busy. I enjoyed that I didn't have a set routine, and was able to take care of my customers without getting approval. My managers trusted me to keep them as well as my employees happy and it helped me be successful and grow as a supervisor. Being in a supervisor role, I saw my co-workers more than my family and grew close to some of them. I was dedicated to my job and enjoyed making features that impressed my market team and got my bosses kudos. I always enjoyed making my customers happy and strived to impress my management team. The only downside to the job was time away from family events/holidays and the struggle to get promoted from hourly to salary management."
good,"High pace, high volume work.  How you feel about the job depends  a lot on your fellow techs and pharmacists."
good,Le service a la clientèle la première chose la plus importante..
good,Working here was sometimes a challenge with the less amount of staff we had sometimes and the push for master cards from managers. Co-workers are very friendly and help pass time along with most of our customers. The most enjoyable part of the job to be honest is when people let you do your tasks without any complaints or trouble. But overall its a nice place to work part time.
good,A typical day at work would be walking the sales floor safely and to ensure that safety was being taken daily. You learn a lot about safety everyday and the amount of procedures you have to take to keep the work place safe. Management is on average and are there if you need them.The Co-workers like to get their job done. The hardest part of my job is working alone while I am keeping the store safe. The most enjoyable part of my job is making sure all merchandise is being protected and not stolen.
good,"Management liked to play blame game for things that went wrong, and did not want to accept responsibility for their own mistakes."
good,started by getting pallets to aisles then started stocking the shelves overnight shift. Easy work. hardest some things heavier than others
good,"Kept very busy entire shift, co-workers made it fun to be at work. The associates were often supplied with some sort of treat during break and lunch times. Most management was very nice to me and worked with me with my schedule. At this point I do not think there was anything that hard about my job there except during the holidays it was very busy and customers all over needing assistance. In that atmosphere I learned how to multitask and get things done while at the same time assisting customers with their needs."
good,"good job to work for and not too hard of a day. good manager's and worker's clean environment,nice customer's good benefit's."
good,this is a good compay to get start with for the young  but not for th old... long  nights and the management are never there when you need them...time there was fill with alot of run aound by staf and  mangaement  i seen this at all the stores in my area
good,"diffrent each day was never the same each day had its own challenges ot face you are never treated the same tranning low "
good,"I only worked at Walmart for a short time, but while I was there I had no issues about the job. I worked overnights as a stocker and didn't mind the work. It was fast paced and with the amount of work that needed to be done, it made the time go by quick. Plus it gave you a great workout while lifting boxes stocking shelves and quickly traversing the store."
good,"Stocking shelves "
good,"Stocking shelves, putting away returns, helping customers, variety of tasks, friendly environment, helpful management, flexible scheduling, could do without the constant testing."
good,"A rotina no dia de trabalho é tranquila, só é mais corrido na ultima semana do mês,eu aprendi muito nesses quase 6 anos de empresa, da tesouraria passei para Adm, e a ultima gerente que tivemos é muito boa e mudou o mercado. O convívio com os colegas é tranquila."
good,it was ok. employees were friendly. managers were very nice also. the pay sucks but that is suppose to change. schedule has to be flexible
good,"Worked as a cashier and customer service rep for 3 years. I enjoyed my time there because of the employees i was surrounded by, however management is unethical in every situation."
good,I enjoyed every person in my department as well as the other department managers and upper management. Most of the team members worked together great!
good,"Working for Wal-mart was extremely horrible. Employees and managers at the facility were very rude to me and others. When you tell them about a problem your having they overlook it and tell you they will take care of it. Its was never any compliments of how good you were doing it was always ""you need to do this, you need to do that"". The pay was good but working with those kind of people made me find another job. If there were better people working I would definitely work for Wal-mart again."
good,"Stocked shelves then helped stock in other areas of the store "
good,It was a learning experience about customer service and the retail industry. I learn how to solve big and small problems.
good,Very stressful at first but with time management I controlled it. I enjoyed the other coworkers they were the best part of the job.
good,Good hours alright pay the most fun part was being able to talk to customers and helping them when they needed it. Managers had high expectations.
good,"Walmart provides excellent job opportunities and has a diverse culture of employees; however, I am seeking a different aspect in my future career as a legal/paralegal assistant."
good,Going to work everyday with dedication stocking neatly and doing everything that is needed of me management was ok and so was everyone else i had no hardest parts about working here the most enjoyable part about working here was i got the chance to really show my skills and make customers happy.
good,i like the people i work with i work and what i was told to and did it  and my boss is really cool the hardest was getting started
good,typical day is filled with notes and customer service. the co works help get things done and are a good group. have learned how to help run a large store.
good,"This is where I learned all my customer service skills and was able to grow from a cashier into a supervisor."
good,"Its ok, for me it wasn't all that, unorganized, good hours, hard to get days off. a place where customers service is everything"
good,"I stocked groceries overnight. The job was pretty straight-forward and simple. I worked overnights stocking, zoning, and helping co-workers with various tasks, as well as providing assistance to customers."
good,"Bake Bread and donuts, pastries. Bag and price/label all foods made each mornng. Stock, Customer service, cake orders."
good,"always great starter job, meet new people always changing, many different places to working stores always opening. really labor intensive depending where your working"
good,"There is  no typical day at Walmart,there is always different things that is always 1st on the list."
good,this is a multi dollar company they where acting cheap and well under paid they could of did better the people was good at times but don't make them mad
good,"I was a front end cashier. stocked shelves, cleaning duties. I enjoyed my coworkers and the front end management. I really enjoy retail an would like to find another job doing the same work."
good,"Not a friendly environment, immediate co-workers were very nice, bush department, went to work and packed boxes by weight for post office standards, hardest part was lifting boxes weighing 70lbs, enjoyed working with people from different countries."
good,Loved it until they came up with all the new things. I really loved stocking overnight. but the rush to get something done when the supervisor asks you to do something was ridiculous
good,walmart is a good company to work for. they treat their employees well and management doe everything they can to accomodate the associates.
good,Hours and wages were reasonable. Store was often understaffed. Day and Night management were very rarely on the same page as one another. Not the worst workplace but not a job for someone with a family.
good,"Typical day started with clearing the unloading zones and setting up to receive new freight before unloading crew arrived. Verified receipt of correct truck. Unloaded truck and ensured unloading crew finished in a timely manner. Printed warehouse receiving invoices for high value items, and ensured receipt of high value items. Staged new freight for overnight associates. Processed apparel freight. Directed unloading crew for pulling priority picks. Hardest part of the job was ensuring there were enough people unloading the truck to get it done on time. Management did what they could to make sure we had enough people and would sometimes help out themselves.  Most enjoyable part of the job was the paperwork and sorting freight."
good,"I started my junior year of high school as a cashier and just worked my way up to the sales floor a year and a half later and then moved up to an auto technician a couple years later."
good,"I come in every day I check instock of frozen and dairy. Create picks for each department and work them to the floor. Claims, shop features to home, price changes, manage 2-4 associates from 6am - 10pm either working beside me or leave clear direction in notes as I leave."
good,"The typical day begins before 7am with a backroom inspection. Within two hours you will have assisted with the receiving of general merchandise. Picks must be completed hourly. Inspections of equipment will be conducted and completed before use. Fifteen minute break commences after 9am. Complete audits and picks and assist with stocking of shelves via communication with sales staff. Assist third parties as per demand. Ensure third parties in the stockroom are not left unattended. Ensure visitors have checked into the building and that they are wearing proper attire, i.e. no open toe shoes. One hour lunch at 11am or later. Commence improvement of stockroom when opportunities arise. 2pm begin preparing stockroom for receiving by 2nd shift associates. Day ends at 3:30pm or later as per demand."
good,"Coworkers come and go frequently, management willing to help out, but don't work with your schedule as much as you might hope. Job isn't difficult, but the temperature can effect you."
good,Easy to understand your daily task and easy place to work for the most part. Some management could have used better training. Benefits were decent and they gave adequate break and lunch times.
good,A typical day at Walmart consisted of being busy the whole work day. Which was great because work went by so quick. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers who always came to my line because I was their favorite cashier.
good,"Fast paced retail environment. A great learning experience if you have the drive to learn on your own. Lots of opportunity to advance or get lost in the system, all on you."
good,"I love working at Wal-mart. It was a very fun experience, my co workers. I love being around different types of people. I was very busy at Wal-mart . I was being train for different types of position . because i was a fast learner."
good,"I loved working with people at this particular store. The only real problem I had was the management taking advantage of my desire to make sure things are done. When they scheduled me for 5 months of Saturdays (after repeated requests to have at least 1 off a month and reassurances I would get the next few Saturdays) while others in the section did not get scheduled at all, I was frustrated. Overall, I found the daily challenges interesting for the most part. If the scheduling thing could be worked out, I would not mind working for these people again."
good,Get to learn a lot in each Sales department  with co-workers and services returns. Fun with listening to people complaints.
good,"The employees at Walmart are for the most part nice people.  They help new employees when ever they can.  The part of the job I like the most is being able to help customers.  The hardest part of the job, for me, is restocking of products at the checkout lanes."
good,Walmart as given me the best ideas and knowledge of customer service experience. Good team members and I love helping customers at all times.
good,It is a good place to make money and pay the bills while in school. i am given the hours I need every week and they are pretty good about giving days off when I need them.
good,"le management chez Walmart est assez biaisé, certains gérants sont impartiaux mais la grande majorité font du favoritisme et ce même lorsqu'il est question d'avancement de carrière et ceci peut être brimant."
good,"Personal growth, work-life balance, very friendly and talented people, lots of diversity."
good,Walmart is a great company for someone looking for a position to build their work history. The job would have been more enthusiastic if there work more team work with other employees. Overall I did enjoy my time there and I would return if needed for employment.
good,Some days at Walmart was better than others. During holidays and weekends were extremely busy. if you don't mind working with very grouchy people then you should be fine.
good,"Working at Walmart sucks about as much as life. It's not too bad, you can climb the corporate chain if you put forth the time and effort but you'll always be nothing more than a cog. I have no real complaints and no real compliments. The people you work with will determine how much you enjoy the job, but in the end it's all about perspective. Walmart is successful for a reason and that reason is caring about their employees and customers just enough to maintain their insane profit margin."
good,"Walmart is not such a bad place to work, my co workers were fun and upbeat, and the hardest part was lifting the boxes. A typical night was going in at 11pm having a meeting, then going to get your boxes put up the items in the hba area"
good,I showed jewelry that was in the showcase.  I priced merchandise when it came in and the invoice had been checked.  I scanned purchases and took payment.  I put batteries in watches and changed watch bands.  The hardest part was trying to help all the customers when I was there by myself.  Some of my co-workers were not easy to work with.
good,I actually enjoyed working there for most of the time I had. The only problem was sometimes the other employees would leave the department and take longer lunches than allowed.
good,"Es una de las empresas que mejor me fue, comenzamos bien y solo teníamos tres días de trabajo, y se cobraba bien, aprendí a reponer y a acomodar en bloque los productos, mis colegas siempre fueron como una familia mas, la parte mas difícil cuando no terminas tu trabajo a tiempo y te quedan cosas por hacer, me gusto formar parte de ellos porque fueron como una familia mas para mi."
good,Stressful to be sometimes. I learned most of my skills like customer services and merchandising. management here was helpful. coworkers were fun to be around. the hardest part of the job was handling areas when we were shorthanded. the most enjoyable part of my day there was lunch.
good,it was just a regular day everyday for me i would wake up get ready for work and head out i can say it would be packed some days but i managed to do it cause i work really hard
good,"Good first job, relaxed environment and great employees. I did mainly stocking at this job but customers that needed assistance were always greeted with a smile."
good,"Assisted customers and provided prompt courteous customer service, refunded money and credited customer’s credit cards and gave store credit for damage merchandise.  Operated cash register and performed all sales related tasks."
good,"Most of my days here were spent with a Telxon Gun in hand, picking orders for the shelf stockers on the floor, and organizing the back room (mainly putting overstock away in the racking, and properly utilizing the Telxon Gun for the location, and the quantity of the overstock)."
good,The environment is not professional and it shows that anyone can work for this company. It is to full of cliches and does not cater to anyone outside of those.
good,gostei muito de trabalhar nesta empresa pois fazia o que eu gostava commmuito apreço .
good,"Nesta empresa tive um grande aprendizado e pude crescer profissionalmente, onde trabalhei por cinco anos e aprendi desempenhar varias funções."
good,"i Learned lots of new and important skills at wal-mart, like being patient, organized, fast, and efficient. i enjoyed every day at work whether it was a hard one or a challenging one. i always delivered the best customer service i could. i helped other coworkers in all they needed and offered to stay extra time if needed. i also had a great management team there for us associates  in what ever we needed."
good,"As a Walmart employee you'll be getting good hours even if you are part-time. Yes, you'll get tired and probably frustrated, but there are not many jobs which can offer you as many hours as Walmart."
good,I don't really have anything negative or positive to say about Wal-Mart. It was a job and a job is a job. nothing else to say.
good,"Walmart is a very good place to work if you enjoy constantly being around people. The management at the location I worked is great, they will help you out as soon as you need them. The coworkers I had at this location were amazing. The hardest part of the job would be handling so many guests throughout the day but that wasn't so hard for me; that was actually my most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"It was a stressful environment."
good,"enjoyed working for his company stock from 10 pm to 6 am clean and face off items 6 am to 7 am. \"
good,"Hard work, very busy on most days.  Always something to do....LOL.  Just wish that they would have much better compensation for their employee's."
good,Very productive day but co workers could be more respectful. Love speaking with the customers. It makes my day when they tell me I am doing a good Job.
good,If you can get past all the drama Wal-Mart is an ok place to work for while your going to school. They offer may hours for everyone and will reward those whos stick around with them. Beside that thats about it
good,Interaction with patients and customers. I had  a great boss who taught me some thing about pharmacy and school . Customers would get upset because their medication is not done when they get there.
good,when I first started with the company it was an amazing company to work for but at the I dont know what happend that they change in all
good,"always busy, smiles every where, great management, not the best co works but they do a good job, everyone does there part"
good,I had a fun time working here and wold do it again. not enough people apply for this job and get it. i was greatful for the oppurtunity
good,A typical day at Walmart started off slow. I learn how to use the price tag gun. The co-worker help and talk to one other the hardest job is working in the freezer the most enjoyable is the morning meeting
good,I have learned to help people meet their goals. I am very happy to assist my customers and to make them feel welcomed. Custom satisfaction along with professional performance are the most important of my professional goals.
good,"Currently I am a department manager of the shoe, bra, sock, and underwear departments at Wal-Mart.   A typical day starts out with zoning all areas, next off to the backroom to reverse pick all bins for the departments.  Then work all picks.  Scan outs in departments, work on negative reports and price changes.  Finally, do the exceptions for each area.   Always having customer needs first."
good,"Despite the somewhat illogical management on night shifts, working here was tolerable, despite excessive cross-training and often working outside of your job title. The co-workers were always friendly and willing to help, and management was very patient. I was often left on the front end alone to check customers out and provide Customer Service (returns, cash checking, etc.). Though on 3rd it is usually slow-paced enough to do these things, I found myself stretched too thin on some nights and it seemed that management's priorities were often within other places of the store. Overall Walmart was a decent place to work."
good,"Worked midnights as cashier, although actually working the cash register is only a small part of the cashiers job.  There were some strange policies."
good,Ok place to work. The store is open 24 hours this helps with getting hours. A typical day is very busy very hard if you cannot keep up with the paste.
good,all I can say is I would not go back for a job. it was very unorganized. they taught cashier's within a couple of days which was not a lot of time for some of the staff
good,"A typical day would for me would be"
good,"A typical day includes unloading trucks, stocking freight and zoning the store. I've learned how to stock, receive deliveries, use a pallet jack, and proper fresh food safety regulations. Management, for the most part, is fine. Sometimes lacking in relating to associates and demand too much of some and less of others. The hardest part of the job is making sure all of your work is completed within the time allotted. While the most enjoyable parts include the fast-paced nature of the job and helping out customers with their concerns."
good,This was a fast pace environment.  Balancing duties of the company with the wants of the customer was exciting.  Getting promotions for a female was very difficult and talking with the store manager was almost impossible.
good,"Cashier, Opening Credit Cards, Cleaning work station and Zoning."
good,The co-workers and management were friendly and willing to teach me new roles. I learned a great deal about office politics under this employment.
good,The most important thing at walmart was working a as team. Most co workers there were very nice people. I have learned many skills working at walmart which i will carry on to other jobs.
good,Great place to work. There are a lot of opportunities to advance your career with Walmart. Friendly co-workers and safe work environment.
good,"I liked working here, I loved the hour long lunch, but hated being the grunt that does every single thing in the store without any recognition"
good,"When I arrived at work, I clocked in and headed for the parking lot to collect shopping carts. I helped customers with their groceries. My most enjoyable part of the job was working with these customers. The hardest part of my job was working in the rain and snow, and when co-workers called in sick, because it made my job a little more difficult. I learned time management, work related responsibilities, and improved my social skills."
good,This was one of the best jobs I had the experience and my team members were amazing. If I could do it all again I would have transferred in order to move up.
good,"This corporation assisted me in organizing my time management skills and tested me in many areas at the company, as I have been working in all of the departments in the store."
good,Wal- mart is a okay place to work and pays good . Mangers are cool and co-workers also. Loved working outside at wal mart. They give good discounts and everything.
good,Work with many individuals that mastered the retail industry. Learn company P&L and how metrics effect the business. Great experience to learn.
good,7 years working walmart stressful mental not physical learned to use cash register money orders cash check money grams
good,There are fun people to work with and a lot to learn about business.  Management is always there to help the associate move up in the company.
good,Depending on who you have as management they can be accommodating on your schedule. A diverse work environment. A typical retail job.
good,WalMart was a good place to work. They had very good steady hours and management was easy to work with. The hardest part of being a cashier was having to stand in one spot for 8-9 hour shifts. I enjoyed interacting with so many different customers throughout the work days. Working at Walmart has allowed myself to improve very much on my social skills. I am grateful for the experience I learned but am seeking to learn more experience in a field which will help with my future career.
good,"Enjoyed those I worked with, enjoyed the interaction I was able to have with the customers. Received pay increase after 90 days."
good,"I clock in, report to my department manager. They give me directions and I follow from there. I get returns, organize all merchandise"
good,"depends on where I start .. but on a typical day I go to meat , frozen or dairy and get them started and when caught up I would go to another department to help or run by myself in that department too.. then .. I have learned a lot in each department and had at one time ran the meat department . i usually work alone but when i get help i usually go to another department to get that department caught up.  hardest part of my day is when management bothers me which usually slows me down some but i deal with them and then go about my work after I finish up there task.  the best part i guess is working alone .. i get more done but sometimes depends on the help its good to have an extra hand sometimes which sometimes helps improve my day too."
good,"As a cashier, I greeted and assisted customers with their purchases. Teamwork was  a daily part of the job. Being able to assist in other departments made the job not-so repetitious."
good,"Learned many different skills from invoicing, inventory both cost and invoiced. Learned hiring and termination practices. Got practice with managing people and planning for events and daily life. Had the opportunity move and experience different departments from overnight crew management, deli, and GM departments. "
good,lot of labor poor manger choices work every where only close christmas stand on ur feet all day most co workers easy to work with
good,"My typical day would consist of setting up shop at one of the many registers and helping the customers by ringing up their purchases, and answering any questions they may have had to the best of my knowledge. Each day seemed just a bit different in the regard that you rarely had the same customer more than once through out a weeks time frame so each interaction with your customer in that time frame was in essence different. I'd say the most enjoyable part of the job was the quirky co-workers that I was able to chat with in between aiding the customers. not to mention a full hour for your lunch break each day, that you could take at your leisure; all you need do is inform the CSM (Customer Service Manager) in your area that you were going on your lunch and then to flip your Number light off for the time being. A cool thing that you would get to learn from your customers is what ""Price Matches"" were big at the moment (In case you're new to Wal-mart's price match policy if you find a product that they have somewhere else for cheaper wal-mart will match the advertised price) and if you happened to find  one ya liked you were at liberty to take advantage of that once you were off the clock."
good,It all depends on the person. If you like working overnight and then this is great for you. You have to know how to also hand customers well. Overall its a good starting job.
good,Cashiers usually start off by cleaning around your register. You learn the duties of being a cashier. The management is not all that great though. The best part about being a cashier is interacting with the customers.
good,A typical day starts at 6 am and will end at 6pm.  Work is and very hard physically. But compensation is completive and benefits are great.  Must be in great physical condition
good,nice place to work but the pay sucks and it is extremely hard to advance.  I fyou are looking for a place that will pay you your worth then this is the wrong company.
good,"unload/ load trucks"
good,They do require a lot of hours and aren't very flexible with hours. I did learn a lot of customer service skills and learned how to deal with a variety of different people.
good,pay sucks hours vary no set schedule love my co-workers but do not talk to those outside my department parking is far and senority is bad
good,work Is slowest at night cause your already tired. 10pm-7am aint easy but you don't have to deal with to much people so work is simple. i learned how to communicate with my team members and even show the veterans new things. as well as so much about the company and the practices. co-workers differ but over night your like family. everyone takes the same lunch and breaks. hardest part of the job was having EVERYTHING fully stocked and zoned up by the time 7am. Lunch was always the most enjoyable part of the day.
good,"On a typical day I enjoy my customers, they bring happiness and life to my job. The management teams however have changed over the years going from great to ok. My co-workers were good to me and vice versa some have changed but that's life. The hardest part if my job was not being able to assist a customer if something didn't go thru where they were unable to receive money or pay a bill. The most enjoyable part was to see a smile on my customers face and for them to come back requesting me to take care of them."
good,pagava no dia correto. mas como entrei bem no início no e-commerce vivi muitos problemas de estrutura e falta de conhecimentos dos gestores...
good,Typically I would read notes and e-mail regarding changes. I grew a lot in supervising a team. Working directly with management to make changes for employees as well as customers. The hardest part was leaving this job. I thoroughly enjoyed working with customers.
good,A typical day before I was moved to day shift was a hard shift unloaded 1 to 3 trucks a day I would sort the merchandise and deliver it to its right departments then if there was time left I would restock shaves and pick merchandise to go to the sales floor I was my shifts highest picker so my managers decided to move me up to first shift in there I learned how to audit the store bins and do merchandise counts bin in merchandise using the S.M.A.R.T system.my co workers where great I enjoyed working with a diverse group of people. The hardest part of ever working at Walmart  was unloading the freight trucks the most enjoyable thing was learning how to used the inventory systems .
good,"I think this place is good if you're good with working under pressure and dealing with difficult customers. I only worked there for about 9 months, and I found out that a large store with a huge employee population isn't for me. But, it was a good working environment while I was there."
good,"was able to move around from area to area,locating people to area's of need,worked with a good group who shared my view's on doing your job in a timely and efficient manor"
good,On an average day you will work at least 10-11 hours the workload can be light or heavy depending on what kind of day it is. On this job I learned that you will work hard for every penny that they pay you. The management team is a very shabby one they don't do what they say they will do. The co-workers are cool you'll meet some interesting people from different areas. The hardest part about working at Walmart is they put a lot of work on jus one person and you have to be quick with your hands. The most enjoyable part is that you get to meet some very cool people.
good,"a typical night would start of with me doing the night meeting, explaining to all the employees on where they would be going and what they would be doing. Afterwards I would do a productivity walk ensuring that everyone is where they're supposed to be and everything is set. I would then help top up any featured merchandise on the floor just until first break would start. By the our inventory truck would come in and i would help out with that for about an hour depending on the load. I would try and finish any of the merchandising that needed to be done so I could help out the stocker's if needed to be. when the last hour and a half appears i would start to clean up and make sure all stock, carts and miscellaneous items are off the floor for opening."
good,"It was an ok work environment. Nothing overly special or horrible. Pretty much in the middle. The other employees were friendly and helpful, which made the shifts go by faster."
good,Lots of hours if you are willing to work them. Always looking for someone to promote unless you are only there for a few months.
good,"A typical day at work is a busy, challenging but taskly job. I learned how to be a good team member and how to multi-task helping other workers while still finished what was assigned to me. The hardest part of the job is unloading the truck on holidays."
good,Good place to start out in the retail world. Would have to be here a long time in order to move up as most people stay long time. Constantly dealing with public and this sometimes can be interesting.
good,"typical day at work was helping customers with making paint and getting returns and putting them back;fixing and cleaning my department. I learned how to mix paint and copy keys. management wasn't the best at walmart, the never helped with anything and it was hard to talk to them.my coworkers were awesome and nice helped me when i needed help. hardest part about work was when there wasnt enough people on the floor to help and i would have to cover 3 departments myself. What enjoyed most was meeting new people and helping customers."
good,"Typical day at work , I basically was responsible for anything that needed to be done in the store, learned a lot of different positions, and skills during this job. The hardest part of the job was I never knew what they were going to have me do ( even though my official job title was electronics associate)."
good,"Working at Walmart is a routine job, a typical day you experience ups and downs with the customers, and a high energy work environment where you are constantly involved in your job. This type of employment teaches life skills with people because Walmart has such a focus on great customer service, you learn to endure handling unsatisfied customers and sometimes unpleasant comments and actions taken against you. The co-workers at this job are exceptional, they are a huge part of making the Walmart environment a light, friendly and fun workplace.  The hardest part of this job, being a cashier, would have to be standing in one steady place for hours, at times it would be much appreciated just to have a little more movement in the job.  The most enjoyable part of this job is between the friends you make working and when there is a special customer that is different from the rest and makes your day brighter."
good,"general over all work place is great, good benefits, on the job training provided.  advancement for those who are willing to travel."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was to have the opportunity to meet with internal and external customers and learn from them.
good,"The work at Walmart was fine, my coworkers were great to work with, we had an amazing overnight team. However, the supervisor would rotate and you would end up with one supervisor for 2-3 nights, then someone different, etc. Every supervisor had a different way they wanted things done, so every 3 nights or so you would have to completely revise the way you were trying to do your job. It would do no good to try to explain that there might be a better way of performing your duties. It was frustrating at best, down right maddening at times. There is way too much management and supervisory staff and not enough actually working employees.  Overall the job experience was fine, I would work there again."
good,"Working there was ok, I have fun talking with costumers and meeting other people everyday. When I was working at redlobster I had a second job at Wal-Mart which is full time."
good,"Typical day at Walmart was any other typical day. I learned that you even if you're not having a good day, you can brighten someone else's day. Also, I learned that not all management is just an authority figure; but can also be a life mentor inside and outside of the workplace. The workers was always uplifting and very genuine about being a co-worker. The hardest part of the job was staying calm and collective during anytime of adversity. The most enjoyable time was meeting new people."
good,"Everyone has a good attitude, friendly, communicate, well focused."
good,Working here was a good choice in many ways and a bad choice in others. Many supervisors did not appreciate the work that other employees did and how many worked around doing certain things because of helping customers.
good,not a bad place to work the pay was acceptable the everyday duties were basically the same day to day would work there again
good,"Co-workers are great"
good,"Respeto, cortesía, coordinación y apoyo mutuo entre compañeros.  Con respecto a los supervisores, crearon un ambiente de trabajo de discordias: presión y críticas innecesarias que afectaban el excelente equipo, creando competencias y divisiones en el área de trabajo."
good,"Operated a Crown forklift in a 1000,350,000 sq. ft. warehouse, moving freight from receiving to order fillers. Cross trained in a variety of jobs from the merge line to order fill."
good,"The management, how they handle things, schedule people, hire people. To me it seems like they do not even know what they are doing."
good,"when i first started this job i wanted it for a very long time but when i started i couldn't wait to leave it they treat there employees like there not important at all and tried to get you fired as fast as they could, they use you up then when there done its like you dont matter to the company anymore. ITS ALL ABOUT THERE MONEY NOT YOUR HEALTH OR ANYTHING ELSE FOR THAT MATTER."
good,"The typical night at walmart starts out by tasking in to the area your assigned. Once you do that, its taking freight off of the pallets in the area and putting the merchandise in the correct areas, seeing if it will go out or not. Occasionally helping the customers that are out and about in the area. Once that is finished cleaning up the trash and boxes that were left behind and dumping them in their proper places. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with the people that are ill-considerate to the workers around them and throw merchandise anywhere they choose to. Management does their own thing most of the time unless they are checking up on you to see how your doing. The most enjoyable part is helping the people that want the help weather it is your co workers or customers."
good,this was a great place for my first job. the workers and customers were fun to be around. we always had a great time working together.
good,"A typical day at work as a cashier would consist of clocking in, being assigned to a register, assisting customers by checking out their orders and maintaining a positive attitude throughout the day. Occasionally you'll be assigned odd jobs to do around the store, which may include outside duties such as pushing carts or picking up the trash."
good,"Working for Walmart was very fun, I got to meet a lot of people and became friends with a lot of employees. The best part of the day was being able to stock shelves or run the cash register. The worst part about working there was the management team. I believe as a management maybe they could have been more knowledgeable."
good,Walmart is a job that you can start at the bottom and work your way up. If you are at the bottom you will be working very haard for a little pay but if you show that you are a good worker and is dedicated then you will be advanced
good,"its cool, the managers are ok, a safe place to work and get the retail experience. short breaks and free lunches sometime."
good,Hard woring employees. Very organized store. Management was nice. Safety was very important. Flexible hours. Both full time and part time
good,"Price changes, stocking, modular changes, inventory control"
good,Some managers are a little inept but if you find a good group of coworkers it is a blast. The pay was suprisingly high $9.50 starting
good,"In my position, I am learning better customer service. "
good,Wal-Mart was forever looking to find ways to improve and expand the customer service experience and went to great lengths to promote that sort of environment.
good,The company started cutting out benefits shortly after I got hired on. This is not an ideal place to work if your looking for a career or full time job. They have no full time work but I did love my managers and co workers. They were the best associates I could ask for.
good,"Walmart was fun the people were fun, the work was challenging, they had there minor hickups but what place doesnt. they were a lil strict on attendance but none the less not many complaints i had fun working there."
good,working at Walmart is fun. Its always busy so theres never a dull moment. Management is good they never bother you. On a typical day you ring up customers with a smile and adjust prices on a regular basis.
good,I enjoyed my time with the company. Great opportunity for advancement within the company. Fast paced and high customer demand.
good,"My typical day at work is making sure the shelves are fully stocked nice and neat. I am to ensure all major projects are completed and customers leave satisfied. I've learned and am still learning different things about retail everyday. Every area of the store is different. Not only that, the customers are great.  They are friendly and its nice to be able to help them when they need it. That's also the hardest part of my job, not being able to help the customer find what they're looking for."
good,"For the most part like shopping at Walmart, this one is so so however, my biggest complaints is they dont seem to have enough checkstands open, and sometimes line is rather long- plus the produce at this Walmart Im not impressed with, I will get other things here, like frozen food and whatever but not produce."
good,"I enjoyed Walmart do to their fast pace environment. Meet new people on a daily basis, help others find something that fit their needs. Communication, there was a great amount of communication between the employees and the management."
good,"Staying busy with taking care of customers, cleaning work area and interacting with other employees. Co-workers and management were great to work with made the day fun"
good,"Co-workers are great. Working nights is hard and not for everyone. Need more people on this shift. Constant work, not much time to be bored."
good,"walmart is a good company if you can get over how they do business. a part from have too big of customer traffic and never having enough associates, plus a balanced schedule its a good brand to be apart of. its one of the biggest US brands in the world which we should be proud of."
good,I worked for this company for 8 years. I have had many job titles. I enjoyed Human Resources because I love clerical work. I also enjoyed Department Manager jobs because I enjoyed communicating with people.
good,There were always tasks to be done once you arrived to work. I learned how to work in the stock room and pull picks and pick merchandise to place on the floor.
good,"good over all work was fun enjoyed the exerience. work with my hands and with people and was over all fun"
good,A productive and fun place to work. Every day brought a new challenge. Got to meet lots of different people. There was lots of room for advancement. It was the kind of job that you just did not mind getting up to go to.
good,"Hour distribution among associates was not fair. Too much ordering was being done by a computer and we had an overstock of things that were not selling. I left, I couldn't survive with the hours being given."
good,Walmart asks a lot of their employees but has good opportunity for advancement.  Culture is generally productive and loyal.
good,The managers were great to me. They were very flexible with my schedule as i was attending school at the same time as working. The environment was a great place to come to because of the interactions with the kids and families.
good,A Job not a career...on your feet long periods of time... Customers very Friendly. Great co-workers. Lots of areas choice from to transfers to.
good,"I like walmart, they have several different benefits and a good culture to be an employee in. The management is engaged and communicative to meet the employees needs."
good,Great place to work if you can get the hours40. Sometimes they will have you work 40 then the next week you will get 15. Management is always forever changing.
good,"I  was a cashier there, I enjoyed working there, I  was also expecting my first Baby,  they treated me very nice too, hopefully that I get to go back to work for Walmart."
good,"Work was constant and fast but enjoyable. I worked in several departments as well as a cashier. When i happened othave an injury or illness, i was not always allowed to call in or go home and had to work in those conditions."
good,"everyone knows what a cashier does all day everyday."
good,"productive and fun work place, i wAS SO LUCKY TO BE APART OF THE walmart  FAMILY the staff was amazing i loved being apart of the walmart family"
good,"I am  pleased to have learned a new skill, that is decorating cakes. I have managers that pushed me to be better and co-workers that helped me grow. The hardest part about it is learning a skill that was previously foreign to me but the best part was the faces of the happy cutomers."
good,"I enjoyed a lot about WALMART the customers, the managers, everyone felt like family. I worked in the Photo Center but I first started with LAYAWAY which is the perfect place to learn if u want to get all the rush jammed in as fast a possible. WALMART helped me a lot with customer service the customers need a lot of attention and you can easily be pulled back and forth, which I did a lot of. The skills needed to work in an area like that are recommended for people who enjoy helping others"
good,Walmart is not that much  of a bad place to work it just the people they have managing the company if they paid more attention to employer then trying to make them work for less I belive treat  people how you would like to be treated
good,Interesting time spent at this store. Located at the gateway to the cape. Solid minded associates. Most managers had a moderately level head on their shoulders. Would work for this store again if put in a situation that called for it.
good,"Working here can be include a lot of labor depending on the position. In receiving, unloaded trucks and maintained an organized work place. I gained increased communication skilled by interacting with customers and co-workers. Some managers are better than others, some are not very good. Co-workers are nice and hard working. Hardest part of the job is unloading a job given an impossible time limit. Most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers."
good,Day to day it is a rather grinding job with a low pay and enough boredom to go around to kill. Though the people do enjoy what it is they do from cashiers to the management creating a rather upbeat atmosphere though I can not say that for all of them.
good,My experience at Walmart was neutral. I enjoyed the co workers but the management always played with my schedule. I felt there was not any kind of job security because the corporation is a fire and hire.
good,benefits are great but moving up in the company is hard. Can be a fun environment if you know how to get your work done first then no one will say anything to you.
good,"Worked there for 5 years, when I first started they were all about the associate and their needs and family oriented. Then their culture changed to be all about corporate and making money, they seemed to no longer care what the associates needed but what Walmart needed.... So I guess they became like every other big business in that aspect."
good,not a bad experience should be paid more for the work that you do. Organized sometimes. Great lunch hour. Second job in customer service
good,"-Good teamwork"
good,Walmart is place that not only concentrates on customer needs but the needs of its employees as to where they best fit within the company. This allows the employee great amount of mobility in the company.  Cross training is a big part of their culture that teaches you how to be a good at many different skill sets.
good,Based on my experience at this location. The hours fluctuate too often and the employee turnover rate is extremely high. I would go back because hard work never hurt anyone and the the people there are awe as well as some of the management. Most of the old management is gone and have been replaced with people who work hard. I worked in ICS and I loved it. I worked overnight and the off shifts on overnight should always be back to back to allow peoples bodies time to adjust.
good,"You get a good schedule."
good,"This job was great for learning customer service skills, because at walmart you see EVERYTHING and get it all thrown at you quickly. You learn really quickly about how to handle tough customer situations and I loved it."
good,"A typical day at work was after clocking in, I counted my register drawer to make sure the correct amount of money was in there to start the day, cleaned my area and zoned, stocked, and waited on customers.  I worked with some really great people which made my day go by faster.  I also had some terrific customers with whom I was able to know them by face and name because they were regular customers and I could always have converstaions with them that were enjoyable. The hardest part of my job was having to wait on people that had poor hygiene. But I learned to deal with it in a way that was considerate without being rude."
good,"a typical day at wal mart requires a large amount of patience, and a vast knowledge of what you are working with. you should familiar with the store layout which changes often and be prepared to assist people who are unhappy because they can't find what they are looking for, and may even take that anger out on you. Every manager has a different policy on handling the same situation and it can be frustrating."
good,"u get to know people,help customers out and learn things about how a retail store works,hardest part of job is days when they have extra merchandise to out on the shelves,but i get through it"
good,"walmart was fast paced, i learned patience, management sucked. we lost thousands of dollars in that place, my co workers where amazing,, the hardest part was not quitting the best was getting away from the house"
good,I was satisfied overall when I worked at Wal- Mart. I typically worked eight to nine hours a day five days a week. I learned about people from all walks of life. It was  pretty structured around there. My co workers were nice. The hardest part of the job was the monotony. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the customers.
good,I enjoyed my position here. I chose to move back to Utah from Nevada so that is why I left this position. A higher wage would've been nicer too.
good,"It was a new experience working at Walmart I learned that this job is all about customer service which every jobs is but Walmart was a fun, management was kinda polite at times. My Co-Workers were very nice, the hardest part of this job was being in the freezer all day"
good,"Nice laid back friendly environment, efficient and affective training for job role expected. Manager was very nice and was able to help me with questions i had."
good,"Make sure all carts were put back in its place"
good,"A typical day at work will be completing the task that's given. I learned to communicate more. The management was not at it's best,but it was something that you could work around. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting and the most enjoyable part was when everyone pull together as one."
good,"Long hours on cement floors"
good,"Lidar diretamente com o cliente era a principal função da minha rotina diária, salientando que atuava como operador de caixa. Lá foi onde tive minhas primeiras aprendizagens; e lá que despertei o interesse de trabalhar em público. Desenvolvi agilidade pra desempenhar minhas tarefas diárias. Lidar com a liderança era complicado, pois ela trocava seguido; apesar de a empresa trabalhar com padrões. A parte mais difícil era nos dias de grande fluxo, como finais de semana e vésperas de feriados que se tornavam exaustivas."
good,"Customers were always difficult, it took forever to get help when it was needed, they don't train too much before throwing you on a job."
good,My main goal is to provide the best customer service to our clients regardless of the work atmosphere. The hardest part has been to adapt and learn the work system due to the minimal time there is for training.
good,"Nice Store to work for .                                                   "
good,"While I enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart, and they were extremely flexible with me because of my outstanding work ethic, I had to leave because I acquired a permanent disability to my leg due to cancer and could not stand for long periods of time any longer. My managers did everything in their power to keep me, and that is why I stayed for so long, but inevitably it was a job that required you to stand for 4-8 hours a day and though I was a high functioning individual, my leg could not keep up that pace any longer. Also, Wal-Mart corporation as a whole did not do much to take care of their employees. With low pay and sparse benefits, it was difficult to maintain a decent living while employed there even though I had it better than most. I was respected because I came in and did whatever was asked of me without objections, provided input when asked, and could find jobs that needed to be done without being asked first. That led to me being asked to be the training coordinator and ultimately to being entrusted with the position of fundraising lead because I could still accomplish my daily work while maintaining the fundraising schedule. The hardest part of the job was careless management and rude customers. Many times the job of making things right with an unruly customer fell to the employee because the manager would refuse. We had a great track record of fixing things that were within our power to fix. The best part of the job were the people you meet. I made life long friends there and had customers that sent me cards while I was out with cancer and visit me constantly when I returned"
good,"Some days WalMArt can shine, some days they can be mediocre,  I tried my best but mediocrity was often the flavor of the day"
good,Typical very busy.What you learn is to know deal with different people way. Management was not great at all.Co-work was lazy.The hardest part was lifting heavy items .I enjoy became the team leader.
good,some days was manageable but always good to interact with the customers and team workers.Management was not the best in a crowded environment.
good,A typical work day at Walmart entails great customer service and performing the daily tasks by following the proper procedures.
good,was an okay place to work. learned a lot and made many friends. work stress varied but always high due to overnight shift and its expectations
good,"When employed there the management was always very helpful, hours changed weekly, payday was every other Friday , but got laid off ."
good,This is a good entry level job. There are other places that I am sure are better and other places that are worse. There is a lot of turnover unfortunately.
good,Working at walmart was good. I stayed busy. I worked around a lot of people and we had fun and got work done! Management was okay! We all got a long!
good,"rotation of fresh produce, cleaning the fans , barely interacted with customers , down stacked produce trucks, co-workers were okay and friendly"
good,ok job  just minimum wage job nothing great.  You have to deal with a lot of cranky customers.  Managers ok.  It's a far drive for a minimum wage job.  have to wait 6 months to transfer
good,there are some days where your extremely busy and most days when you are stuck day dreaming and forced to recheck shelf's that have been checked already for the past 5 hours
good,"I managed cashiers, the service desk, money center and cart pushers. I worked with some great people and we all got along together on a daily basis. I can honestly admit that working at WalMart was a great experience and there was something different everyday."
good,"Average retail type of work, associates work harder than management, never respected for any work done. Not worth sticking around for the benefits."
good,"Great Company overall, Just very little focus on the work/Life balance leading to less than favorable Morales through out the company."
good,Not my favorite place to work but it was a job. They do not treat their employees with the proper respect and pay that they deserve.
good,"Very Productive, expedite parts to hangers, stock shelves, put production in computers move parts from one hanger to another. Get other parts that needed serviced to the mechanic shop for work orders."
good,"walmart is a great starter job, nice people to work with and great atmosphere. decent pay and they are looking for people with flexible shifts that can be worked."
good,Work would start off by all overnight employees would gather around and do a meeting first. Then go to the assign departments and put up  merchandise that came in off the truck. Customer service. Handle cash register. Answer phone calls
good,It was fun working here.  I got alone with almost all of the managers and other employees.  Just needed a break from petty things that was always overlooked.
good,"I have worked as a cashier, customer service rep and a customer service manager. my favorite position was as the CSM. kept me on my toes and taught me to be very patient"
good,typical day form is a smooth shift and i stay busy the couple hours im there.I've lesrne taht there will be rude customers and also very nice customers just have to know how to deal with them all.Night shift managemnet is great the morning are very rude and unproffesional. teh job isnt hard at all very face past how i like and keep busy and teh most enjoyable part and runnung aross great customer and hearing little storied while checking out.
good,working in the HR field has taught me alot about myself.  I love helping and training other associates. It has been a positive experience for me but I have worked for the company for almost 15 years and am wanting to venture out.
good,Great work-experience and benefits packages once accepted into their union. I also enjoyed the fact that I had the option to work at more than one location as well.
good,"•	Excellent Communication skills and ability to work well with diverse groups or independently."
good,"Well this Job just made my ends meet, made a couple of new friends. hours were part time, pay just took care of my bills.did not quite like the overnight shift"
good,Wal Mart is fast paced and every changing. Its a great challenging job. You are constantly meeting new people everyday.
good,A vocação por custo baixo nos faz ser bons negociantes e ter certeza das escolhas.
good,"Management needs improvements"
good,I have worked for Walmart for 5 years and I've learned a lot. I would suggest Walmart for any future potential employees if you're willing to work hard and accomplish your goals.
good,"I would have to move back and forth between my register and areas I had to front and face in the store.  Most customers were friendly while a few could be difficult to deal with.  The management was dependent on the district management and the general management of the store.  Sometimes the management was great, and others it was alright.  Co-workers were usually friendly, but because of the low rate of pay and benefits the turnover was high.  When the customers were friendly it was fun to talk to them."
good,"management was great and willing to help by any means, if the hours were better would have stayed, co workers were very friendly  and great to work with"
good,"Enjoyed the opportunity to meet and talk to new people and from all walks of life.I learned a lot working there, customer service,cashiering, working safe."
good,One day it was hot on the parking lot and it had tis young lady out there trying to put her bags in the car and i saw her stuggling  so i went over there and helped her the best way i could . The job wasn't hard at all i loved seeing people and it was kinda a workout for me I enjoyed the customers  and the workers  and helping everyone
good,"aside from never getting rid of the smell of flowers stuck in my nose till a month after I quit, I did like the job, besides for some of the management and the pay."
good,"It all depends on what location you work, but all in all it was so so. Some good days and others.. well others you wish the customer would just leave already."
good,"Turn on all machines. Go back to floor and pull all the bad dates.By then the fryer should be going off that it is ready to heat up oil for day. Then you waste out an put in 960 all old product.. Put out all sandwiches and salads made day before and put in sandwich log what empty, Then put salads in salad case. Then check produce for truck and dairy and frozen. If any truck items found bring them to deli by this time should have customers. So for rest day in between customers put on shelves both on floor and in back cooler and freezer items away and do sandwiches and salads to put on floor. While helping customers also start frying and keeping food fresh and up to temp."
good,"Once I enter my room I gather all of the register bags and lay them down on my desk. Then proceed to create a final pick up. I have learned to deal with money, have patience, and do research to look for register shortages, longs, and sales. Management team was ok when the store first opened then it went down hill from there. My co-workers I have had a wonderful relationship with some. They made me excited about coming to work just to have fun. The hardest part of my job consist of doing research on registers and even in the cash office when we came short and could not find were the shortage came from. That upsets me because I do not want anybody to get the assumptions of THEF."
good,"I really liked working for the company, but it was only temporary and for seasonal. I loved the discounts. Friendly environment and my co-workers were friendly as well. The hours were flexible."
good,The Wal-Mart company needs to take a look at the relationship between profits and customer service and realize the value of each.  The decisions have not been in the public's interest and someone needs to take responsibility and fixed the problem.
good,"During my time at Wal-mart I worked as a garden center employee, so on a typical day I would; transport pallets with a fork lift, tend to the plants, load bags of soil, mulch, and bricks, and made numerous money transactions.  Management worked hard, and so did my co-workers.  The hardest part of the job was withstanding the summer heat, and the most enjoyable part was learning about gardening and the different types of plants."
good,"It was an okay place to work, i worked their over 20 years ago, not sure how it is now, they have been plenty of change in the past 20 yrs, with layoff and then rehiring."
good,A typical day at work includes having to receive the merchandise that are being shipped to the store. We then had to take the merchandise and put them in the specific storage areas that they are designated to. My co-workers and managers/supervisors were very friendly and this caused us to have a friendly working environment. The hardest part of the job was having to lift heavy boxes and other big merchandise. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with amazing people and being able to enjoy going to work.
good,"I unloaded freight nightly, stocked shelves and 'zoned' in a timely manner. Great place to get your feet under you, but sometimes management isn't of the highest quality."
good,"A typical day consist of clocking in, filling customers orders, maintaining a clean safe work environment while interacting with co-workers as well as helping customers find merchandise on the sales floor in between breaks."
good,"I am an in-stock associate and my workplace is in back room. As I work on the weekends my main job is to pick and audit merchandise. So, a ""telxon gun"" is my best friend because I have use it throughout my whole shift. "
good,If I could have Monday to Friday 7-3 pm it would be perfect I just don't like the scattered hours.  I went from being a busy cashier to a bored associate on the floor.  They are pretty good at giving us 3 weeks notice for schedule.
good,Good enjoyable a typical day was good the learning was helpful the hardest job was moveing big box my co-workers help me alot
good,"Wal-Mart is a good company to work for. They work around your schedule as much as possible. The point system is a bit strict but other than that, it is a great place to improve on your customer service skills."
good,"I am responsible for the flow of the merchandise from the stock room thew out the sales floor."
good,Management was good. Co-worker not so great but it was fine. The hardest part of the job is knowing that someone is not doing their job.
good,I've worked at Walmart twice in two different stores. The first time was my first job I had ever had. I enjoyed it. It taught me howto manage my time. Like I said I've worked in two different stores but the experience at each one varied. One store had a lot of drama due to the type of people they hired. The management in one was great they would work with you if you had school or another job while the other one the management was rude and mean. The hardest part of working at Wal-Mart was dealing with the various attitudes throughout the day and the way they schedule your work week. The most enjoyable part of the job is it teaches you patience and builds your understanding and personality through your daily interactions.
good,Were I got my start. I learned how to be on time and always keep a smile on my face no matter what the circumstances. Managers are on point and willing to help.
good,"Worked overnight. People were great, social life did take a fall. There is job security here, but not a lot of chance to move up unless you know the right people."
good,"Empresa onde pude aprender a trabalhar com gestão à distância, onde tínhamos ""liberdade"" para trabalhar, claro que cumprindo prazos e demandas solicitadas. Horário de trabalho flexível, desde que se cumprisse a carga horária estabelecida. Processo seletivo para todo Nordeste, níveis de Liderança de Loja até Distritais."
good,"liked working with people (customer and co workers  there was some nice children that came through toys looking to talk about some of toys we had that was the most enjoyable part of my job"
good,"I liked working at Wal-Mart because they are very clean/neat, energetic, friendly, postive and truly enjoy doing things for and satisfying their customers. I would not mind working for this company again if they would hire me back."
good,"A typical day at work kept me very busy with customer service, working in clothing, the bakery, and the deli.  I enjoyed all the jobs I had  and made lots of friends.  The hardest part of the job was watching potential shoplifters, handling disgruntled customers, and not making enough money.  The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers."
good,"start my job at 5 am would push truck, greet customers. I learned a lot about management. I know how to run numbers, place orders I worked in logistics as well."
good,I enjoyed working for this company.  High volume store. Fun work environment. Well trained technicians.  Great customer service. Great merchandizing.
good,Wal-Mart teaches you indirectly to rely on yourself and your immediate coworkers more than anyone and to rely less and less on the higher ups. Not the greatest work environment.
good,I had a lot of fun working at Wal-Mart. I enjoy being busy. It was a team effort and the hours were very flexible. The benefits were wonderful. It was an all around great job before I had my daughter.
good,on a typical work day i stocked shelves with meat and stocked the shelves with product the hardest was throwing away good meat
good,"I worked at Sam's Club (Wal-Mart Associates, Inc.) during the summer of 2006 in between college semesters. I enjoyed this job because I got to be on my feet most of the work day and my co-workers were pleasant to work with. My typical day involved stocking produce and performing other various tasks as assigned."
good,"loved working third shift, very busy always something to do which makes the day go by faster. management is not great. lots of opportunity to grow and advance."
good,"Typical day of work: Cashing out customers, stocking shelves, customer service, I was sent to different areas in the store to work.  I liked my co-workers and enjoyed meeting all different types of people.  I was pleased with Management, I learned how to set a store up, change prices, labels, returns, money gram, set modulars up, order supplies for the store, answer phones, tasco customers prescriptions out, check medications in, handle problems and much more."
good,Provide customer service by helping take out there groceries stocking shelves checking expiration dates on all products. Unloading truck getting store ready for open
good,"Empresa boa, com boas chances de crescimento para quem gosta da área."
good,most enjoyable is making friends the co workers are nice management is okay I have learned to work hard is the best way to move up.
good,"Assigns duties to workers and schedules break periods, work hours, and vacation. Supervises and coordinates activities of workers in department of retail store: Interviews job applicants and evaluates worker performance to recommend personnel actions such as hiring, retention, promotion, transfer or dismissal of workers."
good,"The friendliest group of peers that I have ever worked with.  This has been the job that exemplified the best customer service.  Coming in daily, running the registers, stocking merchandise, and just building great rapport with the regular shoppers."
good,Enjoyed working there but my location was biased towards women moving up over men. My travel distance to and from work was a little far but able to do it adequately. It was hard to build a relationship with management because they changed various times while I was there.
good,"My job daily was to do returns, make money transfers and communicate with the customers and clean up. My over all experience there was interesting and fun to work with all types of different people of different races. Most important thing was toe get the  job done and that's what we strived to do."
good,Staff always short handed and always letting go of people and expecting everyone to do everything since there is lack of staffing
good,"	Provide Excellent customer service “Greet customer, find out their needs, provide best device and rate plan for their necessities.”"
good,"some managers aren't the best managers, plotting and secretly scheming, but it is an ok place to work. I appreciate the discount we get, and the bonus' we get as well. They should have more incentives for the employees ."
good,"A typical day at work was fine. Plenty to do so time flew by and people are easy enough to get along with. I learned a lot about taking initiative here. My other jobs were more tied down but at Wal-Mart there wasn't often a manager around for direction. Management was OK for the most part. I liked a lot of my supervisors and stayed strictly professional with not so enjoyable managers. Co-workers were basically all good people. I get along with everyone so it isn't hard to find friendly people. I'd say the hardest part of my job was a particularly arrogant manager who decided to make me his work horse. The most enjoyable part of my job was the freedom to do my job the way I saw fit, within reason. As long as I got it done correctly and timely they were happy."
good,"Walmart needs to treat their employees with honor, commitment, and respect. Just because someone works minimum wage; doesn't mean they need to be treated like pond scum. The hours are either minimal or outrageously high. The uniform standards grow increasingly uncomfortable and stifling every year. Employees are all but threatened into NOT fighting for a union."
good,"Great place to meet people! not enough employees to carry the demand of customer flow. customer service desk, phones, western unions, returns, exchanges, looking up warranties, and great customer service!"
good,"While working here, The Work wasn't an Issue, it was the management, because they couldn't appreciate anyone for the work, and were constantly bugging you while trying to unload a truck."
good,A typical checking out customers putting thing on layaway answering calls / customer needs and satisfying the customers needs I learned how to multi task work with other my coworkers were helpful and fun to be around hardest part really wasn't nothing I handle things in a fast paced way enjoyable part meeting the store needs as well as the customers
good,"Save Money-Live Better"
good,They let you give hours when you need them and a lot of good people work there. I have learned that not everyone cares about there job as much as I do. The hardest part is working in the diary where it is always cold. Most enjoyable is the people.
good,"Standing in one spot all day, I learned many communication skills and what I needed to improve my already existing ones. I liked most of the coworkers I had even though I didn't get time to get to know them all. The hardest part of my job was the standing in the same spot all day and if it was almost break-time and there was a long line, your break would be held off until there was no line at your register. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people who came to the store, granted there were a few bad-tempered people here and there, but the people made the job."
good,"This position is challenging. It has good days and bad as any other job. The work is easy, the only issue is the staffing and the structure of the schedules."
good,I can say that Walmart is a great  career starter. With a lot of work and connecting with the right people can move up the ladder fairly quickly. I went from sales associate to customer service manager to department manager within the span of 1 year.
good,"It was a fun fast paced work place. There will be some down time but you're always on your feet when it gets busy. When working at Wal-Mart, you're pretty much going to not have time for your social life. It's work. The hardest part is coming to put up with the customer. If you're not prepared to put up with people then this job isn't for you. I should say that this applies to every customer service jobs. Management are there whenever you need them to be. (Ex. long lines, short staffed in certain areas.)"
good,"the job is enjoyable, and most of the people there are too. no one is going to get along with everyone. "
good,"Work at Wal-Mart part time for some extra cash to help pay bills. So far can't complain to much. They work with my other job's schedule. Co-workers range from nice to jaded from dealing with unhappy customers some times. Hardest part of the job is dealing with people when they are upset about something such as carding groups for alcohol, following WIC rules, price matching rules, or who knows sometimes. Most enjoyable is meeting and interacting with the nice and polite people."
good,This job provides you with the chance to enhance your customer service skills along with your problem solving abilities.
good,"I learned incredible customer service skills with my time at Walmart. I found a very close group of friends in my coworkers, even now we are all still friends and try to spend time together."
good,"On a typical day at work I come in and speak to my co-workers, I clock in and get my day started. I learned that if you are completely focused you will get your work done. The management is very professional. My co-workers are very friendly and very good to work around. The hardest part of the job is being rushed to get the job done in a timely manner. The most enjoyable part of the job is working at my paste and getting the job done in an orderly timely fashion."
good,"Everyday I would go into work, I'd have an assignment to the product I was going to sample for the next 6 hours, usually food, but every now and then you might get things like sun block or toilet paper. The hardest part about the job is standing in one spot for hours at a time. Also, it's only a part-time job."
good,a typical day at work consist of fast pace move constant helping other customers. The other co-workers are awesome people to get along with and interact with as well. Management could be somewhat better. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people.
good,They are not very family oriented as they claim. If possible they will have you work every holiday (along with the day before and day after)
good,I learned how to manage many different task and meet certain goals all why leading a crew of associates to accomplish these goals
good,"	Provided a clean, stocked, well zoned store"
good,"Walmart is walmart, make it how you make out of it, good for starters tho. Walmart can help you get a good start on what you trying to do within the departments they have, or you can just make it a career working at walmart."
good,A day can be challenging and/or productive.  You have to know retail and customer service to deal with the highs and lows of the business and people aspect.  I love knowing that I have a business and personal relationship with the employees and that we can maintain it on a professional level.
good,My typical day was full of surprises. Every day is something different. I enjoyed making and decorating cakes for the bakery dept. I had great co=workers and I would not have traded them for the world.
good,"I made sure that cashiers were assigned to registers based on customer needs, counted tills, and addressed customer and associate concerns. It was an okay place to work."
good,"Must have and keep patience. A typical day includes encountering different kind of people and attitudes, which taught me how to be an 'all-round' employee"
good,"for greeting customers, locating products, price-checking items, and organizing store shelves and displays.  also answer customer questions about policies, services, and products. Returning carts to store frontends also serves as a typical, daily responsibility."
good,"Wal-mart is one the largest retailer in the country which mean they employ thousands of workers.  A typical day at Wal-mart for me as a floor associate would be making sure the department where I worked is clean, the merchandise is organized correctly on the shelves and to make sure customers are able to find what they are looking for. Wal-mart has a store manager, 2 co-managers, 4 assistant managers who each have their own area.  These areas are then broken down by the zone managers , the department managers and then the areas are assigned to the floor associates.  Because we have so many managers things can be a little chaotic when communication is not done properly between hourly associates and management.  For the most part my co-workers are good associates. I think the hardest part of my job is poor communication from management and their slow response time with customers who need their assistance.  The best part of my job is being able to help customers."
good,"I believe Walmart would be the ideal place to work if the ""Managers"" received professional training, instead of promotions."
good,"There is a routine set in place that is supposed to give structure to your day.  Managemet constanly changes this, so it is very important to be able to adapt.  No two days are the same, as with almost all retail jobs.  Was agreat job to start but, i feel i have outgrown my current position."
good,"If I was asked to come back to the wal mart store on mississauaga road and williams parkway I would not go back. They were not sympathetic to my loss of a family member, and they were not understanding of my availbility."
good,Bon travail pour étudiant. Les gens étaient agréable et ce conformaient aux horaires fournis par l'employé.
good,"I learned that you will not just be in one area, but management can pull you where ever they please. It was hard on me, but I was able to learn how to roll with the punches and grow within myself."
good,"Lo que aprendí en esta empresa fue a poder trabajar en equipo de una forma que pudiera obtener los resultados deseados, a desenvolverme mas como un buen líder. Es una gran empresa con una gran cultura, lamentablemente el ambiente de trabajo es muy tenso."
good,"I enjoyed working for the pharmacy manager at the time. The customers were brutal to wait on. Loved shopping at work, didn't ever need to stop on my way home."
good,eh apredido mucho en farmacias walmart..desde como manejar recetas hasta como manejar dinero en efectivo...el trabajo es muy presionable por todos ya que tenemos que ser muy cuidadosos ante el cliente y sobre la salud de l pacientes tenemos que ofrecer lo mejor para ellos...la parte mas dificil es hacer muchas cosas en tan poco tiempo como revisar nuestra mercancia y al momento prestarle atencion al cliente...por eso eh decidio te buscar otro empleo alo mejor tener las mismas reponsabilidades pero como un buen salario y oportunidad de crecimiento dentro de la empresa y crecimiento profesional....
good,"Managed the food fresh area of the super center store to provide fresh, quality food to customers, trained sales associates, & organized managed their schedules & daily tasks."
good,"Revisar ventas, detectar los departamentos mas afectados y ver cual fue el motivo del decremento, verificar que se hayan hecho cambios de precio de los artículos de todos los departamentos , una vez terminados, dar seguimiento a los planogramas pendientes y supervisar que se cuente con el inventario correcto en bodegas o en los anaqueles, para evitar caer en agotado, hacer pedidos de mercancía , monitorear la mercancía que ya se haya pedido a compras y con los transportistas para estimar el tiempo de llegada, durante la mañana, se debe revisar las ordenes de compra de proveedores directos o locales, los cuales nos traen la mercancía a diario y negociar precios mas bajos en mercancía, para poder vender mas barato y comprar mas mercancía pero siempre sin sobre inventariarse, revisar los gastos de tienda, al medio día, ya que se haya detenido un poco el movimiento, se deben revisar los gastos de tienda para ver cuales son las áreas de oportunidad y así irlos bajando, por ejemplo, compras de materiales de mantenimiento, o gastos de luz, agua, teléfono, consumos internos no necesarios y controlar, también al medio día se debe enviar mercancía a tiendas mas pequeñas como las bodega Aurrera exprés, ya que son tiendas que no cuentan con departamentos de carnes ni panadería, los cuales nosotros le surtimos de esa mercancía, mi labor es supervisar que lo que nos hayan pedido sea lo que se esta llevando el transportista ."
good,"Loved the people and nice place to save a bargain, had alot of sales on different merchandise all the time. Most of the time they have what you are looking for if not they will try to find the next best product."
good,"I love the job I'm  just not always happy with the management or some of the policies! Such as when I show up to work everyday early or on time and went above and beyond my job duties, then when my kids got sick and I followed policy on calling in and bringing a doctors note ,I still got terminated!"
good,"Typically a day at work was fun and demanding. Co-workers did not bother you they kept to themselves. What i enjoyed was meeting new people and management was okay they didn""t bother the workers."
good,"Typical day for me would be starting at 5 a.m and working till around 1:30. During that shift I would bake buns and what not so it was all ready when the store opened and I would prepare stuff for the following day and put away skids of frozen product. The management isn't the greatest they just do not seem to always know what they are talking about. I got along with all my co-workers never had any issues or arguments with them. Hardest part of the job was really just getting out of bed and being to work for 5 in the morning, Best part I have to say is baking cheese breads.. they always smell amazing."
good,"it was a good place to start off, I did like the co workers I did work with. well most of the coworkers I did like. the hardest part of working at walmart was probably when co workers didn't want to do there job and me having to go behind them to do there job, also probably when people was trying to act like a supervisor or a manager when they really was just the same level as me. the most enjoyable part was most likely working the power lifting machinery. Also breaks and lunches was pretty enjoyable."
good,"A typical day at work would be consist of zoning the shelves, stocking bags, ringing up customers, and cleaning around my area. I learned how to operate the register such as loading money to make bill payments and other work duties. The co- workers are team oriented and friendly. Management is responsible and organized. There is no hard part to the job because I like a challenge to enhance my work ethics. The enjoyable part of my job is pleasing the customers."
good,ok place to work.  Didn't pay enough really and couldn't get a full time position.  I didn't get enough hours and I lived 30 minutes away and they would only schedule me like 3 hours sometimes.
good,"i wasn't as much of a fan with this job because it became quite monotonous after you got an understanding of the job. My training wasn't very in depth and you were expected to know things that weren't taught in training. it was an overnight position, which i had no problem with. there was minimal problem solving, so after a while it made me feel like i was becoming a robot. The management was very good and treated people with respect."
good,Pay was bad for what I had to do. The People there were terrible because they didn't know how to do anything. My Mangers were Great.
good,For the amount of work that is done and the amount of money that is made I feel the pay should be better here. Takes a long long time of being to actually make some decent money
good,A typical day at Walmart requires you to come in to work and first look at your numbers and identify areas of opportunities. Follow up is very important. Making sure that you are well stocked is a challenge because of the labor restrictions that is why following up and setting expectations is so important. I have learned a lot working here mainly thinking outside the box to get goals accomplished. Management here are hard working and most are customer focused. The associates here are also good people and they have good attitudes and are happy to do what is asked of them. The hardest part of this job is finding a balance between your work and life. The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart is working with the community and charitable organizations such as the Children's Miracle Network.
good,"lack of staff. managers doesn't care want more work done with less people, pay is not enough, like being able to interact with customers"
good,"My manager tried to accommodate me so I could continue to work, after a couple of weeks it became apparent that I was unable to lift heavy freight. He moved me to apparel to see if it was easier , and it would of been except for the fact one of my coworkers was a elderly women and unable to lift herself and I was not able to handle all of my lifting plus hers."
good,"I would recommend others to work for wal mart it is a great company, with lots of benefits for there employee's. I learned a lot about people skills and marketing."
good,Lack of hours given each week to the employees. It's a job where you just don't feel appreciated for the good work you did ever from management.
good,"Ok, jobs are hard to find and stay with but walmart is stable and not bad for a career. What location you work and the management are also something to consider"
good,"It is a place that is very dependent on having good customer service skills. Management does provide some assistance, but I wouldn't say they are very good at their jobs. The most rewarding experience is meeting very polite people, which most customers are. The most negative aspect is that Wal-Mart doesn't provide much stability as far as a set schedule and set days."
good,I really enjoyed working at wal-mart. As a Cashier you are always busy and moving fast pace all day long so the work day goes by really fast. Loved talking to the customers building friendships.
good,"This company made it hard to stay in touch with your managers. Also the work hours did not fit my schedule at all. The work itself was  nice, I learned a lot about customer service, and computer navigation."
good,It is a fast pace and ever changing environment. I help customers with their purchases. I made doughnuts and decorated cakes.
good,I don't like the work scheduling nor do I like how I can't get a second job because one is not enough to cater to my needs. I enjoyed to talking to the customers as they came through my line.
good,"Cashier was fun working with my customers learned how to maintain level of stock,, handling irate of customers and working in other departments."
good,Shifts vary from 5-8 or more hours a day. You are required to deal with the public. The management is easy to get along with for the most part.
good,Retail is ever evolving. Opportunity to work with many people throughout the day. It was a family environment and a great experience to work with 25 year associates.
good,A typical day at Walmart is a smooth but very busy. Walmart is usually under staff on Sunday. The hardest part of working there is when management doesn't care.
good,"Walmart is fast pace, never ending, challenging expectations and standards with change daily. There is always something new the company is rolling out with for stores to test and find results. Walmart is job for endless opportunities and job experiences. As a manager I over see over 200 employees every day and that is not including the customers that come into the store. We consistently are planning for the next season before we are even in the one before it. I have to deal with all the HR services for my associates I'm over whether that is accountability for actions and behaviors or its constructive feed back with teaching and training, developing, and the evaluations I have to give to each associate. There is never a boring or calm moment in my job and you have to be observant and on your toes at all times. Leading by example means having integrity which means doing the right thing even when no one is watching. Walmart provides well if you work hard and exceed the expectations that are required. the benefits are out standing and all the extras that come with your hard work and hours that you put in make the sacrifices worth all of it."
good,"Much as I enjoy working with others, it's always touch and go with new Walmarts, as I've worked at two. I've learned that there will be the people you can enjoy being friends with and talk to and like, and there's the people who just seem grumpy at the world. This is mainly why I call the experience decent, there's okay and good times, and decent pay, but there's almost an equal amount of people that negatively affect you, which burns you out over time."
good,Meeting all the different kinds of people at the register was either the most enjoyable or the hardest part of the job. Most days were relatively smooth.
good,i am a zone manager over apparel a typical day at work would be to tour my areas when i come in and write notes. i attedn a 8:00 meeting every morning. we go over notes and sales from the previous day.i to get with my asscoiates and give out the notes for the day. i have to check with them though out the day and make sure the notes are being completed
good,"Learning to serve customers, seating customers, taking orders, cashing out customers, and making money on an everyday base."
good,working at walmart is a very fast paced job. everyday something is changing. you are always dealing with customers. walmart is a great place to start you retail career you will learn alot and it can prepare you for the management field
good,"I am now retired form Wal-Mart, seeking a part time job. I retired after working there for almost 10 years. It is a busy fast-paced working environment. Being a cashier, means standing on your feet for 8 hours."
good,"constantly talking to customers,assisting them with their needs and wants,later moved to cashier doing basic check outs for each customer"
good,It was very busy all day never any down time. My co workers were very great to work with. It worked around my family and they were very flexible.
good,"A typical day is to see the customers and to have a full conversation as if we knew each other for years."
good,"During a typical day I would serve many customers and help them with anything I knew how to or I would find someone that could assist them. Everything is run fairly smooth throughout the cooperation. They only problem I had, had while working at Wal-Mart was that I was employed while I was attending school so the managers knew that my schedule would change twice a year, once when school ended and once when it had began again. Even after my availability had changed in the system I was still scheduled during class and after my availability and was written up for missing work while I was in class. In turns I had put in my two weeks and searched for a new job."
good,"Fast paced, organized.  Learned how to break down a shift and organize how to stock shelves the fastest. Not a lot of down time which makes the shift go faster."
good,Typical work day involved filling an average of 250 prescriptions a day while answering phone calls and providing recommendations/advise to patients.
good,"Working as a sales associate at WalMart is probably the most monotonous job you can have. You constantly have to zone (make sure all items are facing forwards) and you don't really get to do much else. If a customer needs help, you can help them. If monotony is your thing, this is the place to work."
good,"Very busy, but professional work environment. The managers are well trained and professional as well. I would highly recommend any job there."
good,"great benefits, fast paced, its about who you know to move up in management. Lots of oppourtunities to learn different aspects of the retail business."
good,This was an interesting place to work. I enjoyed my co-workers and engaging with the customers. I left here to move to Peru to pursue a career as a medical assistant
good,Walmart is one of the busiest company in the world. Your guaranteed your hours and raises based on performance of course. They also have bonuses with is nice.
good,"I decorated cakes and helped customers with orders and questions. I filled the cake cake and sometimes helped stock shelves. Custom cakes were my specialty."
good,"It was okay.There was plenty of work to do but not very good communication between managers/managers and managers/workers, especially between different departments."
good,"I enjoy working with people and helping them problem solve."
good,"Hours are unpredictable; often schedule for 5.5 hour shifts to avoid having to give a lunch break, which means only 1 15 minute break for the entire shift; long hours standing in one spot with little or no relief."
good,"A typical day at work reminds me about my night routine; report to work on time and accepted my assigned duty. As Cashier, I will used my assigned cash register to accurately receive sale revenue from customers and ensure that all cash and other monetary instrument are accounted for at the end of each shift. Also, part of our job relates to customer service; since as cashier we assists customers in many areas they needed help.   During this time, I have gained lots of experience regarding working together as a  team, co-operation among co-workers, and team effectiveness."
good,"I was a pharmacy clerk for 8yrs. I waited on customers, checked in orders, helped stock merchandise. I would assist my co-workers with secondary duties, such as filling bins, rounding up trash, etc. Overall, I enjoyed most of my work and all of my co-worker relationships. I miss all of them tremendously."
good,I have worked here for about 2 years now since my senior year of college. It is a nice company if you just want a part time job.
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart, everyone I worked was very friendly"

good,People oriented environment. I enjoyed the different job experiences and interacting with an array of people. I learned how to multitask and act quickly on my feet.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with slow days and down time.
good,I enjoyed being a part of this company and was sad when ended. It was amazing to learn Walmart operation when it come to managing such a big store and to learn how the store is organized. The group of people that I engaged with was really helpful and generous to us and treated us as one of the permanent employees. The hardest part of the job was lifting the material. I also learned to use a hand jack to life heavy boxes. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming in to start a new project.
good,"Aprendi muchas cosas dentro del trabajo como polifuncional. En el Super Bodega acuenta terminal los colegas muy esforzados, atentos."
good,"co-worker were fun to work"
good,"All in all it was a learning experience."
good,I love the people I work with. I don't like the constant changing of the rules to how they want things. I also don't like how they never work around your availability but expect you to bend over backwards for them.
good,"Walmart was a very fast paced job, especially in customer service. The management were friendly, and my fellow coworkers were extremely helpful when I had questions, or needed help getting my line down. The hardest part about working in the customer service desk was when customers would get upset if they could not get what they wanted, or was told about the options they had for returning items and receiving  refunds. This frustration led to customers throwing items and yelling. During this job, I learned how to appropriately handle customers when they are upset. I learned how to give the customers a positive experience in customer service."
good,it was ok the staff was friendly but you had to deal with diffrent attitudes. the managers were cool
good,"A typical day at work started with me clocking in and saying hello to all the other employees. My job duties consisted of operating cash registers and practicing customer service. My co-workers at the time were very nice and respectful, and we got along just great."
good,"I am not hard to please. I am also 21 and don't need to make a living yet. This was a safe workplace, with steady predictable hours, yet it would be hard to work here long-term. The people who do usually were not very happy people--generally."
good,"Perform cash register audits on registers that were used the night before for the cash office for cash accountability purposes as well as doing cash audits through out the day."
good,"The company have no values any more, they do not care about their people, they only care about another dollar. I learned a lot of skills working for his company but overall they have no morals and values"
good,I liked unloading truck and taking stuff freight out to sales floor just needed a change.
good,I was hired as an assistant store manager trainee.  It was a classroom learning environment that provided hands on training for the big-box management style.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the people.  My co-workers were very supportive throughout my time there.
good,"The days were fast paced, productive with lots of learning. People enjoyed helping one anther."
good,not much movment would love better managment it has it's pro's and cons the one in phx was terrible.
good,"A typical day at work was checking the fruits and vegetables for display of sale."
good,It was a good company at first but then we became a super-center and a lot of priorities in the business changed.
good,Great commuity service by contributing help to different organizations
good,"Great pay. Strong work ethic a must. Hard work pays off. I am currently still employed, therefore, am not allowed to provide information due to confidentiality."
good,"I started to enjoy my job as a grocery stocker once i got used to it and learned where things went and got to know some daily customers, but some of the other associates were not very nice so i ended up leaving because I didn't get any respect, other than that my job experience from Walmart was alright."
good,Co-workers were great hard working people. Most management was lazy and would sit in their office talking. Started the night with a meeting saying goals for the night. Some people would get 1 area of work while other had 3-4. If you worked hard and fast they gave you more areas. If you were slow they would just give you 1.
good,Start out meeting with developement team for debriefing for what work is to be done. I learned about interior design in department stores.
good,Wouldn't work here forever but just to get your foot in the door basically your at the cash register helping customers get threw there process of buy there products and checking them out quickly and accurately. Keep work area clean and make sure you front the candy and products around your register
good,"I would clock in at 10am, take a break from 2 until 3 and resume working until 7:30. Most days I was alone all day. During this time I took passport photos and family photos. I would also advertise for photo shoots. When I was not busy at the store I would go around Walmart and ask costumers if they would like to come in for a photo shoot."
good,"I worked very hard at walmart. I consider that job my first real job. It taught me alot of responsibility and it taught me how to stay focused and determined. I started off most of my days stocking and making sure all the isles were up to par. I made sure they were clean. Then at 6 am I opened up my registered and started my day. My co workers were very helping, nice and informative. The hardest part of my job was learning how not hold my line up. Being fast but efficient. I enjoyed helping customers and I enjoyed working hard and working for my paychecks. I loved being a important asset to the walmart company. I loved all my regular customers and I enjoyed seeing their smiles when I could help them find what they needed and getting them in and out in the time they needed to be."
good,"Very busy work environment, so I was very well taught how to multiple task.  Customer service is always number one.  Being a department manager there was multiple jobs that were done through out the day as well as being in charge of multiple departments.  Some management was very helpful, but others not so much.  I enjoyed most of the management team, and all of my co-workers.  We worked very well as a team.  The hardest part of the job though was the miscommunication between management and employees when it came to tasks.  By the middle of the day there would be so many tasks that were given out, plus you still had your routine that you are to do everyday and you would not have enough time or help to get them done.  They still expected you to get it all done and still held you accountable even though you do not have the help.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me is the customers, and the team work between coworkers."
good,overall it is a great company to work for due to the fact that you tend to learn things about the company and the work you apply for as well as learn a lot about yourself along the way. there are times when management could be a little un-organize and that tends to through everyone out of place.
good,"As an Assistant Manager I provide supervision and development for hourly associates in assigned area by hiring, training, mentoring, assigning duties, evaluating performance, providing recognition and ensuring diversity awareness; analyze and interpret reports; implement and monitor asset protection and safety controls; provide direction and guidance on executing company programs and strategic initiatives; drive the financial performance of assigned area by ensuring that sales and profit goals are achieved and implement plans to correct any deficiencies; model; enforce and provide direction and guidance to hourly associates on proper customer service approaches and techniques to ensure customer needs, complaints and issues are successfully resolved within company guidelines and standards; participate in community outreach programs"
good,Wal-Mart has competitive pay and most holidays are off and paid off.  Very good computer system that makes workflow easier. It is an equal opportunity employer.  Management team is fare and hard working. The associates are very helpful and caring.  Personel is very help full also
good,"Working in the Deli department is sometimes fun. We make orders for customers such as sandwiches, fried products and cold salads. Co-workers are fun with nice personalities. Most enjoyable part of the job is having a happy customer and knowing that they will come back."
good,this was an okay place to work. not many things I could complain about.
good,The job was okay. The pay was low. It is a family owned business.
good,"Spend most of the work day in my department by my self."
good,The company expects a 45 hour work week from salaried associates.
good,"The most enjoyable part about the job is that I get to meet and talk with people, maybe even make their day.  I also get to see people I know that I don't usually run into often.  Management is very quick to let you know when you've done a good job and when you've made a mistake, they talk you in a respectable tone and show you what should have been done instead."
good,"I had several responsibilities. Stocking shelves, working w/department heads on there needs of the products that need to be put out for stock.  Also, I would help with customer service. Example:  Cashiering, Getting products off the shelves if the customer could not reach it.  When a truck with merchandise comes in, I would unload the pallets with the forklift."
good,"Walmart was a good place to work for, I started school to become a CNA while i was working at walmart and they were very helpful with scheduling. Management ad co workers are normally cheerful and make you feel at home."
good,A TYPICAL DAY STARTED AT 10 TO 730 and we were taught how to stock in different departments. The long night were the hardest and getting off was the best
good,"A única critica da empresa, é que a oportunidade de crescimento lá dentro é muito pequena. Fora o horário de serviço e o reconhecimento la dentro que não era visto."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with at times it was a little confusing what was expected of you.
good,overall work was pretty good I never had a problem wit anybody
good,i was trained for one month before going to do a setup at the new store.
good,"it was a great job with excellent customer satisfaction, the management team was great along with other associates. would definitely recommend to others."
good,"Cooking, cleaning , cutting meat ,and helping customers find things"
good,Walmart was awesome. I loved beig able to please and satisfy my customers that came through my line. It was moy job to make them feel wanted and comfortable coming back to our establishment and thats just what I did. I used to love waking up and getting to work to see my regular morning and afternoon customers come through my line.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was working with different people every day.
good,"Very very hard work, not really in the job description. I didn't mind the work but when I am getting paid minimum wage but doing assistant manager duties that is a different story. But other than that, the job is labor."
good,it was a fun and easy going company to work with.  the people at work can make a work day go by fast.
good,I enjoyed most of my co-workers. We were short staffed most of the time so it was mainly stressful and a lot of moving of end caps.
good,I enjoyed working with people and working as a team. I did the same thing everyday which was probably the worst part but I love going to work everyday.
good,Very busy holiday cashiering position. Friendly work environment.
good,A typical day starts of with coming in to work and unloading the general merchendice truck which car run anywhere from 1000-3000 pieces of live freight and separating the on to pallets where they are then run out to the floor to be worked after lunch at around 8:00. Then is off to help the overnight workers to put freight on to the selves. I learned how to separate the freight and how to stock the freight. I have also learned how to use a baler a compacter and a power lift and a walker-stacker. The job is psychical labor and the hardest part is it is non-stop. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting all of the wonderful people that work at wal-mart.
good,"Stock items"
good,"The job itself was easy. Pushing carts keeping the bay full, so the customers always a cart for use. The management was ok. Some management knew what they were doing some didn't. The hardest part were most of my co-workers were lazy and i usually i had to pick up their slack."
good,"I prefer to stay busy.  So everyday was a busy day for me.  There is always something to be done. You  learn something as often as you can.  I was constantly learning, policies, procedures, and most of all people and customers.  Of course every manager varies in how they choose to run the store when under their command.  Being best of friends with your manager is not necessary to work efficiently.   Having a level of respect on both ends employer/employee always helps for a more successful outcome.  Working as a team is just as important as being able to work individually. Knowing your own personal strengths can help you plan for success. Having this information available about your other team members can  be very helpful as well.  The most enjoyable part of my job was any allowance to be creative.  This could include coming with retail ideas to helping a customer pick out wedding items to fit a very modest budget."
good,i worked night stoke for f few years then went to days in the cooler.
good,Walmart is a great place to work and i love seeing all the people and i also  enjoyed being a cashier and making people smile and keeping my line down and work at a steady pace .. happy customers and good service means your doing your job the best way you can.
good,"A typical day on the job, would be inputting prescription on the computer to be checked by the pharmacist in order to filled. I have learned lots of names and uses for medical purposes and have gained a quick way to calculate days supply dispensed in order the for the patient to know how much and how often doses are taken. My co-workers are great, we all work together to achieve same goals. which are counting and dispensing medications, double counts on controlled substances to ensure quality and quantity accuracy. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the health insurance companies that may or may not cover curtain medication. We must then resolve the claim by calling or have patient provider to call and authorized the medication in order to be dispensed, so it can be covered. The best part of the job, is the fast paced work and the happy patients that come in. At first they are sick, it is nice to see that we do not see them as often because, we know that they are getting better in health."
good,Fun workplace with friendly managers. Ive done everything from working on the registers to stocking and checking in inventories.
good,"Walmart gave me a great foundation and training. I enjoyed working with customers daily, and business was almost always consistent, leaving little room for distraction."
good,Didn't mind working here but the timing is bad. The space that you work in is a little to cramped for comfort. I loved the drive through because it gave you something to do every hour so that you didn't watch to time on the clock. Management was awesome and the benefits are good if you work full time.
good,"I loved most of the people that I worked alongside, but the pay is just too low. If you work hard, you can get a decent raise, but you could earn lots more doing the exact same job (for some positions, at least) somewhere else."
good,"long hours, under paid, horrible management. I would not advise anyone to work here."
good,this job is very demanding and does not pay enough money in order to pay bills and does not work with you when it comes to being off and has to get things done outside of work. management was fine and does not bother you while on job unless everything is out of place.
good,this was only temp jobs not much job securty diffirent jobs never having stable ful time

good,"Great work atmosphere, Very fast paced and sometimes chaotic. Some company policies should be reviewed but still I met some of the most amazing people working there."
good,"Since I am able to do almost anything in the store I never know where the managers are going to put me. I currently am a cashier. I also work the money center and customer service where i do returns. I have been working at walmart for 6 years. I have learned to just go with the flow. "
good,This company want you to rush all the time. It is not safe to rush with heavy equipment.
good,Co-workers were very rude and not very friendly. The work environment sometimes became awkward with the friction between co-workers and managers.
good,use of cash register and dealing with public is sometimes challenging
good,"I learned a lot from my many years at Walmart. I started out at a young age and have worked very hard to work my way up. I loved the people that I have worked with, and I loved the fact that I got to see different people daily."

good,pull pallets of merchandise out onto the floor and stock shelves. seperate other departments items and taking them to to the correct freezers. scanning items and placing the correct stickers on the boxes and bin them into the correct storage unit.
good,"Overall, if you need a place to work and can tolerate a lot of ridicule, work here. decent raises, not sure how much they have improved but when I worked for them, I wasn't paid overtime in full for months at a time. Actually got a check for unpaid wages 2 years after I left. Other than that its ok."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in work on go-backs, clean and organize work station, and start up all the registers. The hardest part about this job is to deal with rude customers face to face. It stressed me out when I encounter rude and obnoxious customers. This job had made me toughen up and can better my customer service skills. Wal-Mart is a giant retail company and each day we helped over 1000 customers of different race, personalities, etc. The most enjoyable part of the job is to be able to help my customers walk away happy and satisfied. There's nothing self fulfilling as knowing that today you actually help someone out with their problems and they're happy walking away from you."
good,"co-workers very helpful, learned more about inventory, management for the most part listens to you. hardest part about this job is making sure all the picks are done and audits by 3-4p.m."
good,"Always busy, some nice customers, some rude customers. Always up to dated on polices. Employees are okay. Has decent health benefits, 401k plan, stock options, donations to Children s Miracle Network. Maintenance tries to keep up with all the cleaning but is impossible to do due to the fact that its always busy."
good,Working here was a good learning ground in how to deal with customers.
good,I would go in clock in and go up to to my register. When I wasn't busy checking out the guests  would be cleaning and restocking all the shelf's so I was always busy

good,uma empresa bem concentuada muntialmente conhecida e respeitada no mercado
good,"Working as a supervisor with largest retailer in the U.S. gave me a great opportunity to test and apply previous store and retail management experience in valued and educational ways; I helped area associates and leadership with successful location openings as well as contribute to recovery or improvement with regional store locations as needed while challenging myself to maintain an accelerated pace and continuous improvement mentality required for such large volume and turnover.  I proved and advanced my versatility as a leader in store merchandising, sales, talent management, shipping/ receiving, customer service, and asset protection."
good,"No Walmart aprendí muito,trouxe muitas coisas boas tanto profissionais quanto pessoais."

good,"co-workers are great to work with, at times management lack at doing their job but mostly they were fine at managing the work load."
good,"I worked as a cashier and it was stressful, everybody always seemed grumpy and it just killed my vibe all together but it did pay good money. The co-workers were always nice but the bosses were always, always stressed out like always."
good,typical day at work was no associates to work the floor leaving morning supervisors with a situation with no help. No positive feed back from store manager.
good,Typical sales job. Not an exciting job however it kept money in my pocket throughout college. Relaxed schedule and hours for college students.
good,"My days at Wal-Mart were usually straight forward. I learned how to move a little faster and still be able to do everything right. Management was well and my co-workers were great team members. The hardest part was lifting super heavy boxes , and the easiest part was placing the merchandise."
good,"A typical day at Walmart teaches an individual how to communicate  with the public."
good,"A typical day at Wal-MArt would be me rigning customers items up,and wiring money through moneygram. I learned the MoneyGram system. Management was pretty good. The hardest part was dealing with upset customers about price matching."
good,Working as a cashier and Tire Lube Greeter was very exciting. I helped people everyday and they were disappointed when I left. I always went beyond my job expectations to make sure the customers left satisfied.
good,I did enjoy this job quite a bit. It was over night and my co-workers were pretty handy as far as teaching me how to do my job. I was not micro-managed and loved to work in the fast pace environment. The managers actually worked as well so it made me feel as if they enjoyed their jobs as well.
good,"Consisted of stocking shelves with merchandise and ensuring the presentation of the merchandise was presentable.  Helping customers when needed and ensuring that they were finding everything they needed."
good,"My typical day at work would be taking customers at my register, fifteen minute breaks every two hours, one hour lunch break, clean my area and then clock out."
good,"Receive payment by cash, check, credit cards, vouchers, or automatic debits. "
good,"A typical day at work is very fast-pased."
good,A typical day at work would be sorting clothes and folding them bringing the clothes to the department that they belong in also helping customers find merchandise. Managing a five line telephone system also unlocking dressing rooms. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers find what they wanted that was a great feeling.
good,"Processing claims, filing paperwork and providing customer service to our customers. This job has helped me on handling difficult situations, controlling inventory, managing and prioritizing my daily tasks. The management staff helps with situations that are beyond my control. I work well with others and enjoy helping others."
good,"Each day at Wal-Mart you are faced with customer satisfaction.  This can range from assisting a customer in locating merchandise, allowing a customer to vent while a situation is explained so that u may help resolve it, to simply checking out a customer, bagging their items and the handling of payments.  The hardest part of the job is learning to keep calm no matter what the situation may be.  The easiest part of the job would be knowing that u have satisfied every customer within your ability."
good,"It was a summer job, the people were ok. Nothing extraordinary. Got paid very little. But worked a lot of hours. As a part time job its alright you get the experience of working cash and handling customer satisfaction."
good,i was a greeter there and loved working with the oublic/customer service!
good,"This job proved to be fruitful and training was informative and I conducted my day to day task with ease.

good,Working for Wal-Mart for 9 years has helped shape the man I am today.
good,"assemble bikes, grills, baby beds all day. restock and help other departments when my work is done."
good,Wal-Mart Pharmacy has become very busy the last passed year.  I learned to balance everyday duties between patients.  Mondays and Fridays are the busiest days of the week. I think the hardest part of the job is dealing with insurance companies. Some insurances pay for certain medication and patients want to know why. Then have to explain to an angry patient the process of insurance.
good,Working here required understanding of the product arrangement and goo customer service.
good,Belle opportunité d'emploi pour les étudiants étant donné l'horaire à temps partiel et flexible
good,"Overall Wal-mart is okay. Could be better if higher management would take more control of situations that happen at work. Such as life threatening situations with my associates. Once I do my part, I expect for them to follow up and do theirs. The best part about my job is making my workers happy because if they aren't happy, you can't expect for your department to show improvement if your workers aren't happy first. They learn from me so I have to set the example for them to be great."
good,"Fast paced, and not for the easily agitated. Working for Walmart was albeit, fun because of the co workers, and thus it was made easier to stay working there. Not ideal if you are a temp worker, but well worth its salt should you be hired as a permanent employee."
good,"Its a great place to work at if your just saving money for the holidays. If you are looking for something full time look elsewhere... The people that work there are fantastic, and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job is the rules in your first 90 days of work."
good,Wal-Mart taught me how to work as team. As team we work harder and we accomplished so many tasks in a typical day. It was all about helping and pleasing the customers.
good,"Walmart has a fairly good management, but they can do better with a bit more focus. Time availability is not a problem and they are very considerate in that area. As long as you do your job, they are okay with it. Employees are underpaid and it takes a long time for them to get a salary increase."
good,"Answering phones"
good,Consistent work flow; several managerial instructors; lack of employee respect; good co-workers; hardest part is taking different instructions from so many managers; enjoyed the working hours assigned.
good,Walmart is a big or one of the biggest retail chains. Working there takes a lot of hard work and effort. Here is a place you can find your no limit goals and reach them like I have. Plans are open and they introduce others to key interests and job opportunity that have like I said no limit.
good,I have learned a lot of valuable skills while employed at Wal-Mart.
good,"A typical at at Walmart in the electronics department would consist of helping customers out, selling phone contracts and setting phones up for customers. I learned in that time how simple it is to sign up a customer to a contract for a certain phone company. The management was rather decent, but understanding on certain issues either personal or work related. The pay was rather low for the amount of effort and hard work I put into the job and also of my past work experiences. The hardest part was to tackle the whole sales floor as only person during the Christmas season. The most enjoyably was engaging in conversation with costumers."
good,"Although this Company has a great growth opportunity, the hours are NOT flexible no matter what.  They do not work well with employees impairments."
good,"Nearly all of the associates I work with are agreeable.  This helps circumvent the difficulties with night shift work.  The IMS job is very, physically intensive, however, I've never been turned down by my immediate supervisor for assistance when sought."
good,"Its only 2 months at Walmart but I like the work environment and courteous supervisors."
good,"Easy work, learned team work, accountability and management skills.  Learned that marketing gets the desired results."
good,"A typical day at work would be checking in at the time clocck then going out to the floor. Once i  get to the floor i'd usually greet all my coworkers with a smile, handshake, and find out how there day was going. Once i finished that i'd go to my manager to find out from her hows things going at work and ask what she has for me to do today. The hardest part of work was always dealing with the restocking of shelves after customers had misplaced items in the wrong places. I loved being able to help customers find the answers to their questions. My managers was always nice and while they put me through alot of training i enjoyed every bit of it. I learned how to unload the trucks of all merchandise, I learned how to take inventory and how to request for merchandise to be put on the shelf through the scanners. After i completed my work for the day i'd usually go around and make sure all the aisles was in order and make sure to help any customers that still needed help through out the day."
good,"Dealing with customers can be stressful at times but also fun! I have many co-workers and ii like all the people I work with, they make the time go by quick. Knowing that I have put a smile on customers face makes me happy inside. It makes me strive to be a better person, not only in the workforce, but, in general."
good,Dealing with unruly customers and not having the backing of upper management.
good,This was the hardest job ever being a cashier because you had to be a very good people person...the customers were not always nice and the labor was hard at times. I learned a lot in my 3 years of working there. Overall i did not like working as a cashier I wish I more opportunities to work in other departments.
good,"If you like people  Wal Mart is a good place to work  you will run into all kinds of different people, some you will like some you wont,but that is every job..Hardest part of job is working 6 days and only 1 day off then work 4 days than 2 days off.  Enjoyable part of the job can take a break anytime i want most, after i make sure all most all my work is done for the night..."
good,Was a ok job for my first job starting out. Make great friends working here.
good,"Easy work, competitive pay. Was lied to at interview about amount of hours I'd get."
good,"great company, I am part time, when every one is getting a lone"

good,"Buen ambiente de trbajo, muy enfocados al tema de precios en los productos"
good,"Good Management"
good,"I would start out every shift by going to work early to allow myself time to prep the workload and properly assign the staff.  "
good,"Go in at 10p.m. start to pick items from the system until lunch and after lunch would bin in the overstock into the system. what I learned was how to the equipment.The management is not very functional there is not a lot of help that is provided. Most of my co-workers I get along with, they're nice people. The hardest part of the job for me is it being overnight. The most enjoyable part of the job is that leaving the work area knowing i did my best to accomplish my job."
good,I would say it was an experience  working there. Very busy store i learned there how too  deal with different personality. Management wise it could be more organized.Nothing i could not handle.My co-workers i got  along with everybody there.You learn something new everyday never boring it was challenging.
good,My personal experience working for this company was nice. The associates were very friendly and nice. This company was customer service driven.
good,"i would start with putting up any returns that we had by the time my shift started. As well as straighten up the apparel by folding them neatly on the display tables and hanging them in they're places. I learned the techniques used at wal-mart. most of my co-workers who have worked there much longer than i have, told me all the procedures so they were very helpful. I just loved operating the phones when the opportunity came."
good,"enjoyed chatting with coworkers, didn't like being on my feet all day. learned to operate a cash register. A good company to start out working for"
good,"Morning email review and responses.  Requisition review/succession planning , engagement/recruitment, conference calls, store visits, interviewing, workforce analyses.  A day of engaging managers, associates and Market Level Peers.  Intelligent, hardworking individuals who enjoy what they do day to day."
good,My typical day at work is going to the daily meeting and starting my usually work.What i learn from the company that benifit myself to stay focus and work hard.Managment is a good asset to the company learning new things from managment.Co-workers we are good team together and work hard as a team.THE hardest part of my job is trying to do cbl's and multitask with my job duties.THE most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers and working with my team members.
good,Walmart is a positive place to work.  Advancement in responsibilities can be challenging.  I would have like to have seen more opportunities to advance.
good,"Liked the associates that i worked with.  Had to cover their positions when they were on break, had the day off, vacation, or when they called in.  The management that i worked for liked me very much and depended on me for allot of different tasks."
good,"Start the day by approaching a manager and and seeing what needs to be done. most days seem the same, working the freight. coworkers are lazy and managers seem too eager to leave. Even the store manager would leave on sudden notice. "
good,While working at this facility I was able to decide I wanted to go on in school to do something meaningful and get my Bachelor of Science degree.
good,"Its walmart place just sucks, management is bad, pay is beat"
good,Working with all kinds of people was very interesting. You were always moving all shift and you had to stay busy for the entirety of your shift.
good,"Remplir les étalages des produits, descendre et sortir les palettes de produits pour chaque département. Rentrer les palettes d'over pour entreposer dans le back-store."
good,"On a typical day, working in Electronics, I would generally have to handle everything from helping customers, attempting sales loosely (no commission but expected), handling merchandise such as stocking (or cleaning up overstock other associates created), binning overstocked or excessive merchandise, handling dot.com in store orders (both pick ups and processing), setting and resetting expired modular (merchandise sections), wireless sales (both prepaid and contract), wireless set up and technical support, basic photo center coverage, and anything extra asked of me throughout the store (helping in other departments, cashiering up front, carrying or moving heavy items (in some cases alone when needing a team lift)."

good,This was my first job and it helped me grow people skills and how to act in people service.
good,"I gave everyday my best and passed the management test, but was told I was too much of an asset to the department I was working for. Needless to say I was denied every attempt to advance within the store."
good,"Working for Asda is a fast paced work environment with no 2 days being the same."
good,"Good work environment , great co-workers, great learning experience , learned good customer service"
good,Wal-Mart was an ok job it paid decently at the time and it was a good experience.
good,"People complain a lot, but it is not a bad job. Minimum pay, but not too demanding and the work isn't difficult"
good,"The turnover rate is horrible, the management gets moved around constantly (Garden center manager can become Deli manager with no training at any time, assistant managers change the area they work in every 6 months), and we are constantly under-staffed."
good,Good place to work while going to college. Great people to work with and managers are easy to work with.
good,"Walmart is Walmart but Its not for me. Fun workplace if you don't mind retail, part-time is what they do and I want more. All together a decent company for people looking to make a few extra bucks on the side."
good,"Walmart can be interesting place to be at.  I'm sure you it can be a fun job when nothing bad happen, but when something bad happy or someone come into the store funny, people talk and get around fast."
good,"our work was never the same, different job sources everyday, co workers were great, I learned how to manage a large group of people, customer service skills, inventory control,  hardest part of our job was dealing with unsatisfied customers, the most enjoyable part was to meet new people everyday and help them with any problems they had"
good,Awesome company. I believe that it was time to move on after spending several years.
good,this job taught me how to be more patient. my day was spent at the register. i would help customer with their purchases. i would speak to everyone. some of the customers would hold a conversion with me.
good,"Every working day added to my experience some thing special"
good,Coworkers got along for the most part. Management was pretty good could have  been a little nicer though. Loved running register.
good,My time in Walmart was great at first until I gotten to know more about management better and how they ran things along with the associates who didn't seem to take pride in their work and are there for just a paycheck. The hardest part about the job was trying to finish projects or tasks before the end of your shift and usually the store I worked at had rushes every day between 11 am to 3 pm. The most enjoyable part about the job is when things go smoothly and all there is left to do is clock out.
good,Walmart is a good work place if the managers knew what was going on they wouldn't have tht problems
good,Each day I would go in and start cooking to fill the hot bar. Then I would start on freight for either the deli or bakery. The days I was in the bakery I would make sure the cake wall was filled and after I filled it I would start on the orders for the day. Each night we would have to weigh up all the leftover food and throw it away then proceed cleaning up the deli and bakery area.
good,"I started working overnight as part of the maintenance crew, but after a couple of months I was allowed to move to the cash office. Here I was in charge of balancing the teller drawers and resetting them for the next day. Also created cash shipments to be deposited and made sure that orders for cash were made to replenish the teller bags. This is the first place I furthered my knowledge of cleaning by striping and waxing floors. I learned how a full retail store needs to operate and the many cogs that keep it going which are vital. Managers here always welcomed new talent and would normally give you a chance if you asked to be moved to another department. Working overnights takes a special kind of person and they were plenty of them on that shift. The hardest part was first learning to work overnight and still being able to have a social life. It took some time but eventually a routine developed and I found myself being able to go to school and still work full-time. I enjoyed working at different departments."
good,Walmart was my first job while I was in college. It is a great place to build work experience and I've learned allot. I started out in lawn and garden and eventually was promoted to Department Manager towards the end of my employment there.
good,I would put merchandise in the right location. I would get pallets and then open them and put the item in the correct place
good,Everyday was the same. We had the same job and same tasks everyday. I learned how to use some of the equipment for that job but it wasnt something that most places use. The people i work with were very helpful in most situations. The hardest part of the job was getting to know where everything was. The most enjoyable part was being able to work around customers and interacting with people everyday
good,was a great place to work and advance in for being so young. Taught me alot of people and skill and how handle pressure filled situations. Pay was not great but the experience was invaluable
good,"Long hours, and not the best pay. As well as having to closely watch what you say and do. The Only good thing are the benefits, and having a sense of having a bond with the others"
good,"Quadro de funcionários com reduções, o que nos leva a outros setores e outras funções aprendendo um pouco de cada atividade, com o consentimento e solicitação da direção, sem maiores atritos com colegas, mesmo sendo mais difícil conscientiza-los da necessidade do trabalho em equipe, mas, me recompensava ao fim do dia todas as atividades a mim atribuídas concluídas, e todas as oportunidades solucionadas."
good,Walmart was a really good first job right out of high school. I learned fast that it would not be a long term work place for me. It gives you he opportunity to speak to customers and develop communication skills as well as problem solving skills.
good,always working and had something to do. site to store layaway general cleaning customer service piercing ears jelwery sales fitting room shoes appaeral grocery stocking etc build displays worked carts frozen dairy moved around alot always called upon to do tasks.
good,"A pretty outgoing job, fun workers and easy to get along with. We make sure the job gets done no matter what. Responsibility is a big goal for us. Respect is a must and Customer Service is not even a question to discuss."
good,"enjoy the people and the public,i put toys too their locations,and swept floors and took cardboard too the compactor"
good,"I enjoyed working for my Managers but was not happy with the drama behind the scenes in the Deli Department. I do not believe that employees should bring their personal lives with them to work nor back stab their fellow employees, we should work as a team. I do not like the way the company deals with employees absences and the having to worry about losing your job when you have a legitimate reason to have to miss work. I loved the customers that I met and looked forward to their weekly visits."
good,My day starts out with a meeting with management reviewing the details of the day. Following this meeting I begin to fill the orders that are given to me. Throughout my career with this company I have learned time management and organization skills.
good,buenas personas tanto los jefes como el personal que laboraba con migo ademas era muy ameno el trabajo
good,"You meet a lot of new people, very energetic, fun and friendly workplace."
good,answered questions  and learned different things. met new people.
good,"Work hard and play hard.  It was a great environment to work, they don't really care about individuals at Walmart though. Pay is great after you know what you have to do.  Four days off a week made time for me to get my Bachelors degree."
good,I learned that retail work is not for me and that most of the management are good people.
good,The hardest thing was dealing with the people who just want to argue and the ones that are already having a bad day take out on you. So your just not going to please them.
good,Is a good company to work for. They worked with me well when I had a family matter come up
good,"its a pretty fun job, its not as bad as people portray it to be. hardest part of the job is dealing with customers"
good,"Each day you'll clock in, go to the daily meeting, and do the walmart cheer. Then you'll do you daily duties, for a night-time stocker, your freight is normally already pulled out for you. You stock for two hours, go to paid break, stock for two more hours, take an hour long lunch, come back, stock for two more hours, take your last break, and finish your freight. Your required to put away returned merchandise, and picks(overstock from prior days). you must also zone your area(line everything neatly on the shelves so your area looks fully stocked). while doing your duties, it is, in my opinion, extremely important to make sure the customers are finding what they need, some don't feel the same way and the 10 foot rule is not enforced. Management has a lot on their plates and they work very hard, you must do your best to work safely and solve problems on your own as much as you can, however no one will blame you if you need help. so if you don't know something don't hesitate to ask. it is not a hard job there is just a lot of multitasking involved, so don't get stressed and you'll be fine. my favorite thing about stocking is that there is always work so time goes by extremely fast."
good,"Enjoyed coming in to learn something new each day, pharmacy staff was amazing."
good,"Toys sales associate - a typical day includes running freight and returns, cleaning and organizing the shelves in the toys department and anywhere else the management team needs you. Also helping customers find whatever it is they are looking for, whether its toys or grocery."

good,"As a loss prevention associate, this job is challenging and rewarding at the same time. This position can either make or break you in he security field."
good,I did over night stocking. The employees there were very nice. The most enjoyable part working here was meeting new people. My section was mainly in the liquids section. I stocked all the liquids onto shelves.
good,workers are great and very knowledgeable on what need to get done. corporate is not supplementing there stores properly with the amount of work that needs to be done. walmart is a good environment but needs more body's in there store to provide a good shopping experience for the customer.
good,"I had a great experience working with the customers here, some employees were not the nicest but I just learned to go about my day and not worry about them. I would not recommend anyone working here because they are not a very understanding company to work for"

A typical day at work includes prepping the merchandise and displaying it in a appealing manner. I have learned on how to manage people to help better themselves and for the company.
good,its a layed back atmosphere nothing is rushed and you don't have to deal with rude customers. management is great and very understanding coworkers are very dependable hardest part of the job is the hours if you're not used to it. I learned how hard it is to keep up with a huge store
good,working with technology. great coworkers. management very handsoff
good,"I down-stocked and delivered pallets to their corresponding locations, stocked the shelves and then cleaned my working areas."
good,its basically being a stocker and watching the front for customers while you stock. It demands more attention than a regular stocking job. I am constantly running back and forth from the front register and back to stocking. the hardest part of this job is trying to be in two places at once when there is usually no other cashiers all night. there are only two over night cashiers so we really enjoy the days we are both on the job cause it makes working the front so much easier.
good,"A very nice and conducive place of work. My customers and co-workers always make my day with their camaraderie. The hardest part of the day is when one encounters usually difficult customers; but since one has a very good disposition to others, one would always give them a benefit of doubt and interprete that as someone only having a bad day. Coupled with one's training, one would turn the negatives into positives."
good,"High performance retail entity. Fantastic growth, profitability, and opportunity for advancement. I struggle with the fact that the Walton Family has billions of dollars yet is at the low end of the scale in giving back to the community. Still a great company with great associates and a very secure future"

I learned how to deal with all types of people here, very interesting experience. Great co-workers to work with, the most enjoyable part of my job was dealing with my customers, they made everyday a little easier."
good,"Alot of the managers wouldn't speak to you if they did it was to yell at you. The training was done on the computer, and one day of trainging was done on a actual cash register. If you didn't learn that one day than you had to teach yourself.When asking questions the CSM's would roll their eyes and were vary impatient. The costomers would get frustrated as well which looks badly on your part."
good,"Stocking, rotating the stock so the older stock is sold first, keeping track of what was selling and knowing when shipments arrive, helping the customers, getting to know my customers, completing transactions and enjoying my job. Overall management was fair for not much interaction. Dealing with customers that were upset from anything like out of their smokes to them just having a bad day. Helping my regular customers and working the smokeshop."
good,I enjoyed gaining customer service experience. The most enjoyable part of the job was the wonderful people I worked with and being able to solve problems for the customers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with difficult customers.

good,"Constant learning experience with diverse coworkers and strong management. Most enjoyable part of the job was constant interaction with different customers, which gave me the ability to help differently each time."
good,i started working for wal-mart since last year 2013 and i thought it was going to be a good job but as the time progress with this company it got worst by not getting certain days off when needed and the pay.
good,"Being a department supervisor gave me an excellent opportunity to interact with the customer a great deal.

good,It’s a very busy working environment you get a lot of customers daily and you had to maintain the store at the same time the co-workers were helpful and nice the managers understood you. The hardest part of my job had to pick up items every minute and the most enjoyable part was see the costumers leave happy.
good,"Depending on who you work with, you may have a pleasant day.  Some management actually seem to care about their employees and will make an effort.  Some are more grumpy and only care about numbers.  There is a lot of standing and a lot of down time most days."
good,"Busy days, Customer service is a must. Co-workers were awesome, most bosses were great. Most enjoyable part was breaks."
good,I would go to work and have to get carts in side the store so that people have carts to shop with
good,"i really love Walmart where i am working right now. Most of my co_workers are so friendly and enthusiastic. We are ready to help each other when one of us got any trouble during working time without any hesitation. i also like the managers there because they deeply understand us.

I would feature to home first, after that I make a pick list for the items that are in the backroom so i can stock them on the floor. Next I would work on price changes. Depending on the season I would usually be setting and stocking holiday candy to make sure that it is full so the customers and find what they are looking for.

I will also go up and cashier when the lines are long that way the customers have a fast check out and are not standing in line."

good,"Great palce to work, and get experience. A good learning enviroment."
good,"Well its not Walmart it was C3"
good,I do not like working with people that don't try to better the store/company. I learned its better to work with people that care about more than a paycheck.
good,"It is an alright place to work. Management is okay, but could be greatly improved. I'm really good friends with many of my fellow co-workers, and enjoy working with them. The hardest part of my job is dealing with the lack of communication from my fellow associates as well as management, as well as having to complete 3+ skids on your own, which I don't complain, and successfully complete. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with some my co-workers, as well as the fact that I can help customers and make them happy."
good,"I enjoyed  working with people I worked with.  Management good, always felt good when customers were excited  and happy about their cakes. love to see the kids happy when they are picking cake designs.  Most of the past year I was the only cake decorator working, it was hard to make sure that cake orders were ready on time for pickup. But I enjoyed my job and worked hard to meet my work load, worked a lot of hours over knowing I had to cut overtime because I wanted to make sure that customers would have their  orders, I gave customers the same kind of service I would want."
good,"There is always plenty of work to be done at Wal-Mart. I am constantly moving and I like it so far--it never gets old. I am now able to work in multiple departments and have learned how to run a cash register, cut fabric and such. Management helps us find goals each day and is always willing to give suggestions if you have any questions. This isn't a hard job--if you can multitask you should be fine. As long as you are willing to help customers and fulfill your duties for the day, you should be fine."
good,"I've only been there for a couple of weeks so far. I was hired as a temporary associate, but management has told multiple times now they will keep me on because I'm a very high performer."

good,Was ok for work and certain people are ok to work with that know their job.
good,"One of the best things I liked about working at Walmart was the consistent work hours every week. My hours never decreased significantly and when ever hours needed to be reduced, there was at least a two week notice of it."
good,Electronics is a difficult place to work. There is a constant supply of people that assume you work tech support and telling the wrong one that you are unable to help them will set them off.

good,"Overall I enjoyed working here, I was able to meet so many nice individuals."

good,Job was enjoyable great coworkers who worked together and got along

good,"When I arrive I go to my designated area and meet with managment for task of the day. Once I have my task which usally includes zoneing and organizing,stocking and sometimes recieving. Most of my co-workers are friendly and dont mind helping others. I would have to say the hardest part about my job is the customers because you never know what type of person your talking too or whats on there mind. The most enjoyable part is when my area is talked about being the most cleanest and most organized area in the store which motivates me to keep up the good work."

good,"The people that you work with are usually great, but of course, there's always a few bad apples somewhere. Management is nice to work with. They always seem understanding when you have a problem and need off or have to leave work early. The most enjoyable part of the job? Is when we have our MyShare days. It's the little parties that the company throws for us. They usually cook us food or have the deli make us trays, and they issue us a big check (it's called the MyShare Bonus). And there's usually always a chance to advance your career at Wal-Mart"

good,A typical day for me at work be coming in early and greeting my associates. The hardest day for me will be not able to help every customers
good,"Ok place to work for short -term."
good,"Hard work for little pay and expected to overachieve in every are of work. Schedules are arranged according to the company needs and complete disregard for time specific requests. This is important because if you're a student going to college or any other school, chances are that there most likely will be a schedule conflict. Managers constantly threatening discipline and lack skills themselves to appreciate their workers."
good,"Assisted customers "
good,"It was a fun place to work lots of activities, charities, parties, and events. Once you got to a certain level of management or department it became very hard to advance. Benefits could be much better. Not pay a high hourly rate so the least they could do is give better benefits. They cost quite a bit each pay check and a lot of out of pocket costs."
good,"Usually i would work in the afternoons. when i went to work the people were nice. the tires were already set where thay needed to be. everything was cool. on te days it wasnt busy enought or even if it was busy i would get pulled away by store management to do the jobs of other workers. wheather it was prepping for unloading trucks or stocking the groceries, it was not what i was getting paid to do. most of the time. the peoples jobs i was working were way below my pay grade. "
good,"it was a nice experience, everyone was very nice, the only thing i didnt like was there was busy days where there was only like 3 cashiers"
good,Too much micro management from H.R.  Not enough freedom for dept management to shine.
good,I liked the job I had there. With hard work there are opportunities for advancement.
good,"A typical day at work was helping the customers, waiting for customer to purchase there merchandise, assisting the supervisor when needed. I learned how to have patience and what cashiers really go through. management was real helpful and patient with the workers, co-workers was real helpful to when you didn't know something and asked for help they would help you. It was working with customers and meeting a lot of new people. the hardest part was trying to explain company policies to customers without them getting frustrated with you."
good,When you work for wal-mart you are required to work many different areas you are neither informed about before hiring.
good,Stayed busy. Intimidating lines but happy smiles smoothed most things out.
good,"Not enough pay or hours bu good overall. Flexible ours, nice managers. I made lifelong friends and I work work for them again."
good,work 8 hrs a day with 1 hr lunch and 2- 15 min breaks count the money  at podium and distribute to cashiers as needed. Try to keep the customers moving through registers as quickly and smoothly as possible. I have learned how to do many different jobs at Walmart from selling hunting and fishing license to zoning the shelves which is a never ending job. We have a pretty good management team and you can talk about any problems to them and they will try to resolve any issues. I get along with and trust my coworkers.The hardest part of my job is standing on my feet for 8 hours. The most enjoyable part is interacting with customers and helping them find items they are looking for. Also interacting with my fellow coworkers.
good,The was a temporary job for the holiday seasons. Would have like to been made a permanent place of employment.
good,"Count and keep control of the cash box of change for cash regesters. Do money grams, money orders, cash checks, handle all money problems.  Did the control count on each regester, check in new clerks, handle any purchase problems. Answer phones and direct the calls to people. Made sure of brakes and have coverage on the regesters.  Direct the clerks to other position when needed. Fill in at regesters when needed. Help with self-help regesters when needed."
good,Wal-Mart Was an productive workplace with room for advancements.
good,"Asset Protection is the only free and autonomous departments in Walmart that are allowed to work independently without worry about excessive oversight. Oversight is expected in every profession but the other departments are often micromanaged. "
good,"Typical retail management schedule."
good,"I enjoyed working for Walmart,loved my daily duties and being able to help out where I was needed.Know more than one job in the company made it is for me to help in various areas."
good,I would pull all the out of date stock of breads.  Then I would break out the proper amount that would need baked to restock the shelves. The hardest part was lifting the heavy boxes of frozen bread.  The most enjoyable part was finishing for the day.
good,"Faced past work, focusing on instock, inventory integrity and customer service."
good,The hardest part of my job was staying warm. Other than that I enjoyed my time there.
good,"The management there was not so great. Communication there was pretty low, many of the managers there fail to communicate with me and let me know what needed to be done on a daily basis. Other than that pretty simple place to work, mostly collected shopping carts and loading customers vehicles."
good,"All the rumors you have heard about walmart being the worst place to work for, they're true!! "
good,"um trabalho de muita produção com responsabilidade e cautela movimentando produtos e volumes com utilização de peleteiras elétricas e manual, com uma dinâmica legal entre os colegas de trabalho e uma boa produtividade."
good,"If you have open availability, you get all kinds of crazy shift hours. The hours aren't consistent and it's rare to be a full time employee."
good,I was first a cashier I would go clock in go to what number they assigned me had some great customers to interact with. Also had some con-artists come in and try to scam things. Then I worked in the warehouse where I was given a hard time for not knowing how to use a pallet jack first but got alot better over time. I unloaded a truck in under hour and no positive comment were made. I liked the environment but not the negative vibe.
good,"I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart there was a since of diversity. I learned how to do more than what I was trained to do. My manager was awesome and worked with me on my schedule when it was needed and she also understood when I had problems. My co-workers loved and adored me that would always be able to ask me to work a shift for them if I was off. The hardest part of the job was really nothing, I can honestly say that if there ever was a challenge for me I was able to work through it and fix the problem."
good,"very busy ,worked with a great crew never had no complaints kept me on my toes ,something I enjoy at work to stay busy"
good,"The company of walmart is going down in sales and are cutting down in work force,,,   less working associates to do the job.  The customers are noticing the difference in the sales floor performance and stocking ,,,   thus providing less and less customer service.  Walmart is also taking out a lot of the good and better benefits associates used to have."
good,Wal-Mart was a good place to work.co-workers were easy to get along with as well as mgt.
good,"My typical day of work was working on schedules, maintaining coverage, breaks, and lunches of the employees on the front end."
good,I learn something new everyday in the store. I love to help customers. Me and my co-worker work together to complete our project throughout the day. The most enjoyable part of my job is to help and keep customers happy.
good,"Process and return damaged products"
good,great good nice and have fun there the customers are always nice and friendly
good,"We usually have a meeting at the beginning of the shift about where we are assigned to go work for the night and where to go if we finish early.  I learned how to read locations of items and how to make cardboard and paper bales.  Management is ususally one of two assistant managers along with a support manager for the night.  They assign us where to go and check on us periodically as the night-shift proceeds.  Some of my co-workers aren't exactly team players when it comes to helping each other out.  Some of them would rather walk around or purposely move slow instead of helping other co-workers in need.  That's what makes the hardest part of working here, along with a enormous amount of freight to work.  There isn't anything i can think of that makes it a positive experience working in Wal-Mart."
good,"A typical day at work is just go in, do my job, and go home. I have learned out to build bikes, because doing assembling was my job. My co-workers helped to pass the time, and to assist me when i needed the extra help. The hardest part of the job was meeting the numbers they wanted because they wanted a bike every 20 minutes, which would be no problem, but they didn't hand me the tools necessary to achieve it. The most enjoyable part is that i got to work a pretty decent job and pretty decent people"
good,Walmart was a place I learned some skills I dint know before.
good,"the job itself was ok but management liked to treat its employees like robots . like work, work, faster no regard if they were ill"
good,"Work days at Walmart consist mostly of ""zoning"" which is organizing and cleaning. Customer service is slightly lacking as they focus more on cleanliness, which still leaves a little to be desired. Management seems to be too busy to do much more than help themselves. Training is lacking and usually poor."
good,i was an overnight stocker and it isnt as easy as people would like to think. i stocked anywhere from 5-12 pallets a day. customers can be rude sometimes but that is common when dealing with the public. my experience with management was great but it depends on what kind of worker you are. i would recommend wal-mart for entry level straight out of high school students or college students looking to make some extra money.
good,We are currently getting ready for grand opening. The process is interesting to say the least. The hardest part is getting the management to work with your school schedule.
good,"At the start of each shift a production meeting is held outlining that shifts goals and projects.  A safety review is conducted, equipment is checked out and the shift begins."
good,Simply ring up items and take payments. Light cleaning. Stock sometimes. Morning were the worst time to work because it was a lot slower. A lot of standing around. Nights were more fast paced.
good,It was good experience and it helped build my accounting and customer service skills.
good,A typical day at work is stocking shelves and assisting customers in finiding merchandise. I have learned how to merchandise items in the shelves so that the items will sale. The management team could be better but I get along with them. I get along with all my co workers they say I am very engergetic and and I fun to be around. The hardest part of my job is trying to find merchadise to put on the shelves. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking with co workers and providing customer service.
good,"Meu primeiro emprego fixo e me ensinou muito."
good,It was a job and it helped me for what i needed for the time being
good,"Every day a different crowd of customers, seasonal overhauls"
good,"Making sure that customers get their photos in a timely order is great and for the most part management will not bother you with your work."
good,Managers are very unprofessional but overall you must be very productive fast paced environment
good,You are making sure that the customers are enjoying a great experience while grocery shopping.
good,People were great. Cleaned restrooms cleaned inside and out of buildings
good,"Walmart was a good job, it consisted of eight hour shifts with doing multiple activities throughout the day. I learned so many different things so as empathizing with customers and providing exceptional customer service. My co-workers were great and i really built something with most of them. The hardest part of working at Walmart was sometimes not enough help but other than that i enjoyed my time and building friendships with a lot of people who care about you."
good,I really enjoy working with the customers.  That is what we are really there for.
good,"This was a easy job, but they pay was not so good. They say you get holiday pay for working holidays, but when you get your pay stub, it just shows that you worked those holiday hours and there was no extra pay!  This job included just answer incoming calls with customer complaints.  For walmart to be one of the largest companies in the world, the pay suck. How do they expect people to live off 400 every two weeks."
good,"My coworkers were friendly and fun to work with. I stocked shelves, made mods, use the cash register, answered phone calls, sold hunting/fishing licenses."
good,"Very fast paced Warehouse Distribution Center, multiple forklift licenses obtained.  Computer applications used on pc.  Multiple scan gun devices used. High production goals met every day. Operating and using computer systems and conveyer systems."
good,"Enjoyed working for this company, wish the pay had been more. Wish company offered greater full time transfers."
good,"I was moved from store to store with just a days or hours notice. There was no upper management, just micro. I would not go back. It was an experience and it got me through college; but thats about it. No comment really."
good,"Energy both positive and negative moves quickly through the store so if your someone who can handle the waves of emotions without it effecting you this is a good place to go. the job is fast paced but if you set a reasonable pace(meaning not too fast or too slow) for yourself to start with when your hired if something happens to cause you to slow down later on it won’t be as noticeable as if you start working at your fastest pace. Co-workers become like family but don’t be caught talking too much because work always needs to be done. The hardest part of the job to me is being thrown more instructions then are humanly possible to complete in a short shift and having to prioritize them based on what is the most important or which manager has the highest ranking without making any  managers think you are deliberately going against them but once you have the timing down on most aspects of your position it gets better and the prioritizing comes easier. To me the most enjoyable part of the job is helping put smiles on the customer’s faces when you know they aren’t having the best of days but there are plenty of back room jobs available if you are one that doesn’t like angry customer interactions. As to management your experience can go one of two ways. either they love you because of how fast paced you can work and how willing you are to do what they ask or they will dislike you because you have to tell them no on something. There really isn’t much in-between but it can work to your advantage. getting on managements good side by doing what is asked to the best of your ability, it"
good,"I learned inventory control, ordering and maintaining stock for our customers."
good,I have had a few different job tittles at Walmart. I really enjoyed finding different ways to raise funds for different charities to make them fun and unique.
good,"Entry level positions available. Not much benefits."
good,"Wouldn't work there again, and management didn't really help as much as they should have"
good,"Usually they would be short staffed so I would be covering photo lab, electronics, and connection centre while still maintaining a balance within the workplace. Through out my time at wal-mart I learned to adapt to the environment and I became very informed on how to multitask and get my work done in a professional manner. The managers were helpful when they could, but I was learning many things on my own with my co-workers each day. The hardest part of the job was having a bunch of tasks that had to be finished in a short period of time. I dealt with this by always asking for help when my coworkers could lend a hand. The most enjoyable part of wal-mart was working with my team and there was never a sense of working with individuals and then going home, but more of working along side with your second family and then going home."
good,"Work hard and in heat for 12 hours"
good,"I usually work evening shifts that start at 3:30 and the first thing I do is look through my department to see what shape its in. I keep the department clean and help customers, do price checks, and take calls. I tend to engage in conversation with customers and learn a lot of new things. All my co-workers are very friendly and help me out when needed.The hardest thing about my job is having to clean up all the mess customers make from the floor and/or shelves but I enjoy it sometimes because my friends are usually working with me. my"
good,"My duties included:"
good,"A typical day at work , for a cashier like myself, is mainly long sessions of standing at the registers checking customers out. It is the long time periods of standing in one place that are the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part is meeting the people who check out and building a relationship with them. It is that aspect, as well as being friendly to everyone you meet, that helps pass the time on a register enjoyably. I have been blessed in my Wal-Mart career to have many great managers, and my coworkers are very personable and friendly. I have become good friends with some of them. Wal-Mart is also willing to be flexible in scheduling their associates. This job has taught me the most basic lessons about being in the workforce, such as integrity, discipline, and how to treat customers. Unfortunately, Wal-Mart simply doesn't offer good enough pay or benefits for people other than students just trying to get through school or upper management."
good,In a regular day I am responsible for maintaining the flow of money to the registers.  Taking care of customers complaints and the resolution of those complaints.  I make sure cashiers get short breaks and lunch breaks at a reasonable time.  The hardest part of the job can be taking care of the customer.  Sometimes their need cannot be met.  For example when they want something we don't carry on our shelves. But you know it's a good day when a customer says thank you for going that extra mile for them.
good,"On a typical day I start by cleaning all the registers getting them ready for the day ahead. I make sure trash is out, and belts are cleaned.  Then through out the day I run change, give breaks, run a register when needed, help at service desk. I have learned how to work better as a team no matter what our differences may be. without a team leading the front it all falls apart."
good,"During my time at Wal-Mart, I learned to cooperate with many people and help out customers. I learned to change the oil and tires on many different types of vehicles. Since the first day, all of the employees were very helpful in getting me started on doing my job. The most difficult part of the job was working outside, especially on hot days. The best part of the job was receiving the thanks of the customers at the end of the day for doing a great job."
good,I liked working at Chick-fil-a it was my first job. I made so meany friends and had so much fun. I would go to work and get on register as soon as i clocked in. Helping the customers was one of the best feelings of my day.
good,"Running a cash res. helping the public, keeping the work area clean."
good,I learned how to operate a cash register and stock groceries
good,great company to work for this was my first job in college. I unloaded freight trucks and stocked shelves and provided customer service.
good,"At my particular store, most of the workers were lazy and some of the managers didn't seem qualified."
good,"A typical day at work is like we clock in for work and we get assigned to our department and we worked the freight in that department. After we finish the freight, we clean up after ourselves."
good,Working with the children in the community was a lot of fun. Having different activities and trips for the kids. Management wasnt the best but ok.
good,"There are many functions of this job that can vary by hour and by day or week. A summarized typical day for me may go like this; attend the morning meeting with store manager and co-manager. Distribute the notes given to available associates throughout the day. Check food temperatures, verify cash deposits for the armored car, answer outside phone calls, provide customer service, shrink reviews, associate schedules, associate reviews, track , have discussions on performance, change features, make plans for modular changes, unload deliveries, training of associates. The hardest part of my job is keeping distractions from accomplishing tasks for the day. The most enjoyable part of my job is training others to learn their job."
good,"Coming to work and everyone is on the same page and doing their job.  Production and products are being put out and everything is looking fresh, clean, neat, and in order.  Management come make their rounds with affirmation. That's when I'm most proud at the end of my day. A hard day is when I come to work and I have to do my job and the other person job to make the whole deli run smooth as possible. Get the products out and try to get out production in the time allotted."
good,Went out of business. But overall ok to work there.Not very good benefits or pay.
good,A typical work day used to consist of helping customers with different concerns. Working there helped me out a lot with learning how to communicate properly. The management were very knowledgeable and helpful. The co-workers made it worth while. We was like family. Working with co-workers who cared about helping customers is what I enjoyed most.
good,". I think Walmart is the busiest store to work."
good,great hours and schedules. They paid better then their competitor stores.
good,"Bad management, if this could be fixed, there is possibility for success in the future"
good,"Fast paced, must have good communication skills and be able to handle conflict. Work as a team to solve issues"
good,Walmart is ok to work for. The hours vary and I really hate that there isn't a set schedule. Not having a set schedule make it nearly impossible to organize your private life. The pay is ok due to the driving distance is just 2 miles from my home. No healthcare offered. Hours are at best 32 per week.
good,"Busca la excelencia en todo"
good,I was relocated throughout the store many times ending up with being a cashier. I thoroughly enjoyed working in the garden department but was frustrated when I was forced to cashier.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was very tough but managable. You were greeted with different types of attitudes and it's up to you to make sure that customer leaves the store appreciated and satified. Customer Service was wonderful, customers were happy."
good,I learned you cant make everyone happy great company I recomend this job
good,There was lots to do to keep busy when you have a long shift. I also enjoyed the department that they put me in.
good,"As a claims associate I loved my job. I processed all the returns out of the system and got credit back from vendors. "
good,"I've worked at several of their stores and most are well rounded in all departments, but this one is anything but. Their management is great and very knowledgeable in their area.Everything down from that is a freeforall. You are given training modules to lean from and anything that is not included after that you have to learn from actually doing the job. this particular store has nothing really that customers actually need."
good,"Very busy and friendly location, learned to be responsible, multitask, and organization skills, enjoyed working with both mangers and coworkers. Reading the Dr writing was the hardest part of my job.  Having the ability to help the customers was the best part of my job."
good,The work environment was stressful and overwhelming. many times you are given impossible tasks and no help to complete them. I learned what is important to excel in customer service. I enjoyed the people I worked with and some times the environment. Assistant managers seemed not to do much and they got bigger bonuses than the associates. Associates are treated like they are expendible.
good,"unpredictable "
good,"I'm a cashier so everyday when I am scheduled I work with the public, supervisors who are on the floor that day and many coworkers. I get along great with all my coworkers and are friends with some outside of work. I have worked at Walmart for a little over 5yrs now. The hardest part of the job is the scheduling a lot of the time I work until 10 or 12am and the next day by at 9am. What I enjoy most about my job is the many different people I meet. Most are very nice and knowing that I made that shopping experience a little better for them is worth it."
good,enjoyed my two years there before I relocated to Kentucky...enjoyed interacting with customers and co-workers
good,A typical night at is all in all ok. I've learn how to do inventory management work which consists of knw the different departments in the knowing where the departments are located. I aslo learned what items go to each aisle in the grocery department which consists of at least 6-8 different aisles. Management is so so because it depends on the manager who is covering the shift that night.But all in all they don't knw how to take advice at tilmes because they think there way is right or better. My co-workers are pretty cool. So may have their nights but they are pretty nice people to work around/with. The hardest part of my job is when space is limited and there is nowhere to bin the overstock. The most enjoyable part of my job is when we have cookouts to celebrate safety and accident free.
good,"I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart because I rarely had a co-worker or management I did not know from the community.  Also, the customers were regulars so I had an opportunity to actually learn others, what the needed, and what they wanted."
good,I love what I do and the people I work with. I take pride in advancing my associates to the best of their ability. I do everything I can to make sure the customers are taken care of as well as help in other areas when needed.
good,i was a stepping stone for me to grow the experience was great but im looking for more
good,"Cleaning front of store, greeting people had team work going on nothing really was hard enjoyed what I did."
good,"working at Wal-Mart was fun, I liked being around the people I worked with."
good,"A typical day would start with me helping out with making the patients' prescriptions were done in a timely manner, keeping our inventory levels for patients' prescriptions and any special orders that needed to be ordered.  Always saw a problem through to the end and if I had to do something else, I would make sure and tell another co-worker about the problem so they could continue getting the patients' prescription/insurance problem resolved."
good,"there was never a set schedule, at the time I worked here it didn't bother me. As a single mother I wouldn't consider ever going back."
good,"Work at wal-mart pharmacy isnt too bad. You get paid decently, especially if you've already worked in other departments for a couple years. "
good,Time for me to explore more. My time is up here. Nice people. Cool family & steady work pace.
good,"Typical day would start at 8 am to 5 pm.  Check the computer to see who is working in the depts.  See who needs to be assigned to do what.  Made sure mdse. from the previous nite had been stocked, if not would help finish and then the dept. managers would bin the overstock in the stockroom.  "
good,"Working there motivated me to further my education."
good,"Every morning I was responsible for checking the system for orders that had been submitted overnight, and fulfilling them. Then get the department up and running, in addition to customer service. And this continued throughout the rest of my shift as well working on notes brought to our attention by management."
good,I Liked the people I worked with made for a pleasant work environment
good,"It can be stressful at times, but great coworkers, management, and awesome customers make it worth it. The hardest part of my jobs is dealing with the really mean and rude customers. They can't all be nice of course but it gets hard sometimes especially after a long day of fast pace working. Though the rude customers are hard to deal with it is of course balanced out by my favorite part of my job being connecting with the other percentage of my customers. I have met some of the sweetest people you could imagine, and they make my job worth all of the negativity that others may bring."
good,Move shelving units. Boring. My co-workers were the only good part about working for this company.
good,this job offered me a lot of knowledge in inspecting very appreciative.
good,"a typical day ... "
good,Working at the winter haven store with the remodel. Making the store look better then before.
good,I have learned alot of valuable skills regarding the retail business.
good,Got carts and put them in the store. Greeted people and tagged their items for returns at customer service.
good,"I would help customers and stock shelfs. Co-workers were fun to work with, Stocking movies where hard. Meeting people was the most enjoyale"
good,Fast paced environment with  team spirit. Enjoyable co-workers.
good,management was confusing due to lack of communication between managers. A typical work day involved alertness. a lot was expected when it came to task managing. co-workers sometimes wouldn't contribute to the task given. The breaks were the most enjoyable part because we were allowed a fifteen minute break after every two hours.
good,Very busy environment for very little pay. Everyone gets alone. Nothing hard about the job.
good,llegada saludar al que baya pasando verlos pendientes que se tienen que efectuar verlos cosas que tenemos que elaborar darle seguimiento  procesos
good,You learn a lot in a small amount of time and you get to know good people once in a while. You have to be a multitasker and a leader
good,"Busy workflow."
good,This company does not compensate you enough for your hard work and does not offer a high premium to work 3rd shift
good,"finding first job was great,once the job ened company has not returned any calls regarding new placement"
good,working here was a little bit crazy. Many customers were rude.
good,Working at Walmart was a well experience. I got sick and they terminated me. I went to work faithful and dedicated to my job. Working at Walmart was great I just did not like how they let me go because I had to miss day per doctors orders.
good,"good benefits in the long run but the hours and pay is their only down fall, not enough hours and the pay is to low"
good,"I had fun working here at Walmart, My trainer was great in communication."
good,This was a great opportunity for seasonal employment. I was really glad that this distribution followed safety precautions
good,"Wal-Mart is a good place to work at i loved working night there. i left because me and my boyfriend where walking into work one night and  a car handicap parking spot and hit my boyfriend in the side and that pushed me to where i fell over. The man drove off as if nothing happened did not even ask if he was okay or if we were at that. "
good,It's an okay place to work. I liked my co-workers. the hardest part of my job was some of the customers i dealt with. but overall is was a good job.
good,Wal-Mart is an alright place to work.  You just have to go in do your work and leave.  Some people are a bit difficult to work with but I don't work with the same people everyday which helps
good,Opened the doors to a wonderful industry and created opportunities I might not have had elsewhere.
good,"Working at Walmart was an extremely busy job. There were customer service to deal with as well as inventory control. I learned the retail side of things like how diary products are maintaned. Expiration date, stock rotation and unloading merchandise. Everyone there were hard workers and worked as a team. The most enjoyable part of this job was the fact we were all team players and could count on each other."
good,"This company did not provide decent training. They would show someone what to do over the course of a couple of days and throw a person into the worst situations possible. Additionally, I was expected to take on Assistant manager Job duties and was not compensated fo rthe extra work."
good,Lots of hard work with very little recognition. I got more experience with customer service here but that is about it.
good,Not all TLEs are good to go to. People for this job are hard to find.
good,"The only thing that kept it from being a ""punch the clock"" job was the people I got to work with. The management however ...you started countdown to get off the clock after lunch. Customer service always has it's ups and downs but I find it good work."
good,"I have learned a lot more about retail while working with this company. I also have seen the ups and downs of a business. I get along with my managers and coworkers. I like the work, but am looking to move into another field and spread my wings."
good,"Everything was by the books, everyone in charge was professional and mature"
good,"-fun place"
good,I would replenish new goods delivered overnight. And set up display sections throughout the store.
good,they expect you to work your butt off for minimum wage. overall good place to work and make it through school.
good,This is a great job. It has reasonable pay and work/life balance.
good,"Running the computers, to order and run the film to go to the plate to go print the pages of the books."
good,"Love the fast placed Environment, loved my coworkers and the customers that came through, no matter how angry they were. Only reason I didn't stay was because the pay couldnt pay my bills."
good,"While stocking, packing, and sorting foods daily. The management were okay but the policies in place are not beneficial for employees."
good,"Learn different areas of the store, friendly environment, flexible schedules"
good,very nice management that work with you. co workers work together as a team.
good,"A typical day at work at walmart would be stocking the shelves, unloading trucks, and binning merchandise. I actually learned alot from Walmart including customer service skills, how to drive a forklift/walkie stacker/pallet jack/electric pallet jack, how to unload trucks and stock merchandise. The management as a whole was the worst part of the job as they were unorganized and always had us do things that didn't make any sense. My main reason for leaving was i felt it was a dead end with no opportunity for advancement."
good,A typical day at work once im there need to clean my area. After that I have to make sure I check in all the freight. Put merchandise up. About managers they tell me what they want but most of the time I got my plans for the day. I always have fun with my co-workers.

good,"Wal-mart is not a bad place to work while you are trying to finish school; however, I don't think it's the best place to start a career. A typical day there would be setting up any new features that are going on at the time, answering phones, engaging customers, register processing, and completing daily tasks for your department. The most enjoyable thing about wal-mart is that you can meet different kinds of people from different walks of life. The most difficult part about the job is career advancement."
good,"Wal-Mart was a basic job although it is a very big company and the managers don't remember or recognize employees. "
good,Walmart wants their associates to strive to move up in the company and reach their goals
good,Most of the time it is very busy at Wal-Mart. There I always customers to help. I've learned how to build relationship with people and communicate with people. I have also built relationships with co-workers. The hardest part about my job is not pleasing everyone or dealing with an upset customer. The part I enjoy the most is staying active and meeting a diverse of people everyday.

good,I actually thought this job wasn't too bad the pay was low but their was always room to move up in this company.
good,"Stayed productive each day, management needs to work better with employee's.  They have no respect for us and never communicate any information necessary for everyone to know. I enjoy working with customer's and being able to work at the deli, bakery."

I usually go and pull out picks of merchandise  that needs to be taken out and sent on the sales floor and help out any consumers. Then when I am done and I have overstock from what I have taken out, I bin it back into inventory in the back room with their hand held device. Then I start helping out with either picking out merchandise or binning it back in. I also help out with cleaning the back room and preparing for the unloading of the truck that comes in and help out unloading and place each items on pallets in a certain order. "
good,if management was better it would be a good place to work. i liked most of my co workers.
good,"I learned alot at Walmart that will definitely help me in the future. When I first started, they didnt train me in anything. I had to figure it out on my own. And then management would get mad at me when I didn't know the best way to do something. How am I supposed to know the best way to do it if you never taught me? They threw me on the cash register a week after hiring me with no training other than watching a video. After almost a year of working there, I still didnt learn everything my job title was supposed to know. But I did learn stuff that would help me. I eventually got the hang of the cash register, and that will definitely help. I learned how to unload the truck (which didnt seem like something you had to learn, but its actually quite a process). I learned how to manage inventory, pull picks, bin, etc. With my recent job hunt, it seems like nobody wants to train you on how to do anything. So what I learned at walmart will help me in the future. "
good,"Supervise and maintain multi departments. Control inventory . Keep product stocked. Keep shrinkage of perishable product to a minimum. Place orders, maintain freshness and keep all department eye appealing to the customers. fill out all reports pertaining to all department on a timely manor."

Management is acceptable."

J'organise moi-même mes journées sauf s'il y a urgence de mes patrons pour autre chose. Il est très intéressant de pouvoir être présente pour les employés pour des questions ou tout simplement pour une oreille attentive"
good,Long hours are rewarded with sales and customer compliments.  Must multi task and be able to handle on the fly changes
good,We worked actively so we were not bored. There was often too much work to get done because we were consistently under staffed.

good,"Fairly enjoyable days at work, sometimes working as a team and sometimes alone."
good,"typical day get there start gathering merchandise, and getting it ready to be put out. Learned how to work with forklifts, because my manager thought I could handle it. My co workers were great, most I knew from high school. The hardest part was the hours, and the best part was learning skills that would help with a better job."
good,"I really enjoyed the people I worked with, however I believe the managers are not as compassionate with their employers as they may lead you to believe.  I don't think they pay enough either, for what they expect from you.  I did have a lot of fun working there.  I had a lot of fun with my customers."

good,Sale Associate in the dairy department and manage the department
good,"Great place to consider when looking for a first job with interest in building a career. Great performance is recognized and they don't mind offering or recommending  you to new opportunities if you have worked hard for and deserve it. Every job you will ever have will have its good days and its bad days as far as customers and co-workers, including management, but you just have to remember everyone is human and were all there to get a job done. The best part of my job is when people acknowledge how great my customer service is. my customers feel as though I have a true compassion for people. There absolutely right!"
good,"Good balance of different people to work with, always something new to see"
good,Great Place to work. Learned lots of things there.  Great place to work.
good,"Typical day includes ringing up customer items, greeting customers, handling money, and bagging groceries. Management has a few good and a few bad. My coworkers aren't very friendly, they mostly keep to themselves. The hardest part of this job is when the customers get angry because you can't scan their alcohol and management takes forever to come and scan it for you. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customer happy when everything goes smoothly and correctly."
good,being it was my first real job iu had fun building my resume and learning newq things
good,"Ordering, Inventory, Stocking, Meetings, Budgets, Schedules, Hiring Employees,"
good,I worked with customers who came in to purchase jewelry. I finished many computer hours learning about jewelry. I ran a cash register and provided change back. I stocked jewelry shelves.

good,A typical day at work was always fast pace work. What i learned was to be more faster in serving my customers. My manager was a very nice lady she always made me feel comfortable.
good,A typical day at work was overall good. Management was almost always helpful with most things as well as co-workers. The hardest part of working there was watching newer associates move up while they kept me in the same spot they wanted me in because no one did the job the way I did and others refused to learn. The most enjoyable part was the hours. They were very negotiable and schedules were posted weeks in advance.
good,I learned how to be come more of a leader by observing how my supervisor motivates us. My co- workers are very friendly. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting together to celebrate individual accomplishments. The hardest part of the job though is saying goodbye to those you have become close to.
good,A typical day would be going right to my cash register and starting to check out customers. I did like the interaction with people but I much rather prefer a job where I get to move around a lot and do more than one task. Only being at the register was very repetitive and I would have liked a job that had a place to advance to.
good,"After clocking in, I would check to see all I needed to do. Restocking shelves and helping customers. I could always ask/get help from management, if there was something I didn't know. I liked that I had a chance to work with and get to know so many different walks of life. My Wal-Mart family rocked! Parting was hard. I enjoyed the experience."
good,I would work here again. The employees are seeming to now become a importance to the company. There is unlimited opportunities for advancement.
good,"zoneing meting new customers every day , and seeing same customers agine"
good,A good job that has helped pay myself through university though offered little in terms of career options.
good,"Ring up and bag purchases. Some management make you feel as if you are appreciated. Some customers are snobby, but I met a few awesome co workers."

good,"•	Provided general administrative support to the head nurses, social workers, and Dietician by performing various secretarial and clerical duties "
good,"mainly working the freight, work safety , and making sure that the store is ready for the customer by 7 a.m. By working at walmart i learned about respect to fellow associate, respect for me is number one, if you earned the respect of a person, they look up to you and they follow your lead. my co-workers, i considered them as my second family. like family we help each other. the challenges that i face, is how could you manage a day at work that you short of staff.how u could u be able to finish the job, when your shorthanded with associate , that when i learn to prioritized what is needed to be done. enjoyable part, when at the end of the day, i walk all through the store, and when i see that it is customer ready, and when management  appreciate my job."
good,Walmart is a good company to work for with a lot of opportunities and benefits but the people who work there can really ruin your experience. Management can be very lousy at times and be very helpful as well.
good,"When I was first hired, no one explained to me what to do."
good,Wal-mart did not have good pay and minimal benefits. The growth within the company was their but very slow pace. The benefits that were promised did not come into existence.
good,"A typical day at Walmart was setting up register, cashing out customers, stocking shelves, and cleaning my area. I would also help in the customer service department and cash customers pay checks."
good,I Report To Work On Time Daily & I Never Move Slow On The Job. I Am A Person That Doesn't Mind Helping Other & Making Sure That My Job Is Completely Done Within A Timely Manner
good,Dollar General was my first job. At first I didn't like it but got use to it. I was shy and greet the customers but I had to get use to it. My co-workers like me and I enjoyed working with them. I enjoy working at the cash register and greeting the customers.
good,it was a good place to work just some of the managers didnt really care about the employees they were more concerned with the facility and everything else. but you need employees to make the facility run.
good,i loved working at walmart we were like we were all sister until the last girl that hired was the pharmacy pet .I was able to keep busy order strips and lancets and over achieve .some girls the whole concept is if were not working as a team were just going to be backed up. I tried enforcing that but they just didn't want to listen anymore.
good,I learned a new skill and enjoyed my day to day tasks and providing customer service.
good,"Too much drama.  I loved getting to interact with the customers, but the drama on the sales floor was ridiculous."
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with but there were issues with registers and equipment that management knew about and obviously didn't take care of. Location was notorious for customers leaving items behind because some cashiers didn't check bag carousel.
good,"*Ambiente agradavel"
good,a typical day at walmart consisted of unloading freight trucks onto pallets and then taking what we stacked on the pallets out to the sales floor.
good,I was a cashier.  Didn't have any trouble with management and co-workers were pleasant.  The hardest part of the job was standing for long periods of time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was most of the customers.
good,"Steady pace job , until rush hour (12-2) than it gets busy very calm , smooth place to work simple work"
good,lack of employees and management not enough hrs. short breaks
good,Hard job but benfits u learn from the job can help you down the road
good,I guess its a good place to work if you need the job. They state flexible schedule but they do not work with you. They had this computer system where it makes the schedule and cannot be adjusted.
good,stock shelf with merchandise unload trucks and move pallets to floor.
good,"working at Walmart was alright, i gained communication skills and fast pace skills. the co-workers are helpful and fun to be around, and same goes for the management."
good,"I Just did this. Not sure why I have to  do it again.... It was a good job . I enjoyed the people I worked with, and learned alot of helpful skills"
good,"A typical day at Walmart consisted of having probably 20-25 cashiers scheduled. Out of the possible 20, 5 or 6-have been terminated or call in which really affect the routine of scheduled breaks/lunches including for the Customer Service Mgr who also work that and any other day/shift."
good,"Had a  lot of fun their and loved the job,  just no room to move up in security."
good,"Not bad if you dont need to get paid much to get by. Managers are for the most part kind but can be a pain in the butt as well. Lazy, un-inspired co-workers are common. You do get discounts but that only offsets some of your salary that you should be getting but dont. Work is not difficult or backbreaking but it can become overwhelming if management is not doing its job properly.  Nice to interact with customers and help people find what they need though."
good,Walmart provides you with job security and flexibility. There is something for everyone.
good,I sold cell phones and helped out customer. I enjoyed doing the customer service and helping out the customers.
good,"I worked different shifts but enjoyed the evening shift the most because that is when most of the trucks would need to be unloaded and the shift went by quickly.  It being my first job I learned many things valuable, such as the importance of being on time, responsibility, completing tasks assigned, and dealing with the public."
good,I worked from 10 am to 7am and it fit perfectly with my life and schedule.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart will include helping customers, answering phones, cleaning my area, working freight, and run register. On occasion check in new freight, and prep jewelry to be sent out for repair. I've learned how to use new equipment. Most of management is effective in making sure that we are doing our jobs effectively and efficiently. Most of my co-worker are wonderful to work with and pull their weight, some however do not pull their own weight. The hardest part of my job is being expected to be in 2 places at once. But at the end of my day the most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying the customers and making sure that each one got my best work."
good,Cubrí personal permanente. Creo haber alcanzado las expectativas.
good,Interacting with the children also providing them wit breakfast and lunch.
good,It's only part time so not alot of hours but it pays pretty good.
good,"Depending on what position at Walmart, your typical day can range from cashiering to loading trucks. One thing you can count on is dealing with customer's."
good,"Not a career choice, just a first job. I enjoyed my time there, and gained valuable customer relations skills."
good,Boa de trabalhar atenciosa com os funcionarios boas condições de trabalho e competencia cons o colaboradores da empresa sem duvida do que falar.
good,already reviewed walmart. the hours were awful and unstable
good,Walmart was a fairly good company. I have learned a lot from working with the many stores I have. I have made some life long friends. I have had the opportunity to work at super center walmarts and a neighborhood walmart. The neighborhood walmart was probably the best. I had a chance to meet everyone one on one. Got really close with my managers who were able to help me schedule work time around school time. They understood that school came before work. I am the type of person who will do everything I can for the company but  I will also do what I can to achieve my life long goals. I would love to be apart of another company and put myself to work.
good,Slice meats and cheeses for customer.. wash rinse and sanitize all food contact surfaces. i learned stronger customer service skills. the management are really friendly and understanding. the co-workers are up beat and friendly . the hardest part of the job was cleaning the rotisserie and washing rinsing and sanitizing all necessary equipment on the hot side. the most enjoyable part of the job was watching customers walking away with a smile on their faces
good,I was grateful to find this job. It was a high paced environment. Times were always being watched. A typical day for me was completing 15+ hours of work in my department within my shift. I had made many friends from the group of coworkers I had. The hardest part of the job was getting all that work done and still being able to walk afterwards due to my injury.
good,"My main job was to assemble bicycles and furniture for store display, but I found that most of my time was spent helping other departments with their projects. It wasn't my ideal line of work, but my coworkers were friendly and it was honest work."
good,stocking shelves throughout the store and then watering the plants.Management was too top heavy. Too many people giving out instructions.
good,way too much politics and main focus is not put on the things they should be. A lot of unhappy people working there. Can become a very negative work environment.
good,I learned a lot about customers and the proper steps to handling a lot of situations.
good,"I realize not all Wal-Mart store are the same, b/c I started at one and transferred to another, with that said the 2nd was not so great. I enjoyed my job, but after a while I wanted to challenge myself and felt it was time to do something different w/in the company; my plan was not to stay a cashier forever. There was no room for growth. It was almost impossible to move up the corporate ladder, if you desired to learn more and had interest in learning other departments or become management. It felt as if they did not care to invest in your future for their company. Of course w/ any job you must start from the bottom and eventually work your way up, but for me it felt as though they would rather you stay stagnate. I felt that they were very unfair, unjust and discriminate in a lot of ways. Tonier and seniority meant nothing to them; for example,  After being there for 3 years, I asked to moved to a different department and got denied then later applied for a CSM position and was denied as well, but someone who was unqualified, younger and new to Wal-Mart got the position instead. FRUSTRATING... Had they allowed me to advance I probably would still be working there to this day."
good,I was trained on the spot by co-workers. I usually would stock the produce and help customers find what they needed. Warehouse product if needed.
good,"i like working here it has put me through school and now i am done and there seem to be very few jobs in my field hoping to maybe move up."
good,Open boxes and determine if there is room on the shelf for the entire box if not it goes to the backroom as overstock until another day. Once this complete I am to pull products forward making them more accessible to customers. Once done I am sent to other areas to assist others as needed. Most of the others seem to keep to themselves but i am on third shift maybe that's why they work this shift. The physical demand was new to me but I seem to have worked thru it.
good,hardest part of this job is to deal with costumer. If your looking for a part time walmart is the place. I learned to be more patient all the time.
good,Great place to start for your first job. Many advancements are offered. Many key departments to learn to advance your skills.
good,I loved my job. The hardest part was pulling items from the backroom and places them on the shelves and the modulars that had to be completed.
good,"Solid 40 hours and this was my first job so, I was able to take what I learned from here and apply them to other jobs."
good,"greeting customers"
good,I enchanced my customer service skills its a goood company to work for
good,If you have the right attitude and work hard you move up fairly quick.
good,Working for Wal-Mart for the past 7 years have been very hard. I am over worked on a nightly bases and pushed to the limits. A typical day at work is down stacking freight and placing merchandise onto the shelves and also anything else that is asked. I have learned that there is no advancement with the store I work for and believe that we are underpaid for the work that we do. The co-workers would be the most enjoyable part of the job because they are all very nice to be around are considered to be more like family to me. The hardest part of the job is having to do everyone else's job without being compensated for that job.
good,enjoyed working with my co-workers and helping the customers
good,"In the Tire and Lube section, it is fun and fast paced work that strives for excellence. My employers though, don't have as much ambition for hard work ethics as myself. The employees tend to half do the work and are very slow."
good,Walmart is good as it is .it just depends on you .you must follow direction but cant say its a bad place .
good,"Work hours were never the same. Worked anywhere from 4 to 8 hrs. a day. Starting time varied. Worked as cashier, met customer's needs and wants. When the lines were not busy, we cleaned our area, put items back on shelves, or kept display shelves neat and presentable."
good,no much to tell if your have ever stood in line for any lenght of time you would understsnd
good,Advancement  is possible with alot of work and determination . Hardest part is getting different orders from different managers and not knowing what to do first. Love working with the customers one on one to make them happy.
good,fun job if you like to meet new people and to be around people I was a cashier it could be stressful at times but it takes time to get used to
good,"I enjoyed my years with this cpompany.  They were my first experience in retail.  I gained plentiful knowledge and know how when it comes to working with money, customers, and other employees.  The hardest part of the job i would say are the difficult customers, even then you still have to have patience.  My most enjoyable parts were the holidays and those very busy days around the 1st of the month. I loved to scan and bag as fast as i could to get my customers in and out in a very professional manner.  They as well enjoyed my services during their experience."
good,"learned how to slice meat and cheese, decorate cakes, slice bread, assist customers with their orders or any questions they had, paid bills, sent and received money, cashed checks, loaded and unloaded cards, returned merchandise, claimsed out defective merchandise, assisted the front end with any questions or problems, watched the front end to insure customers were being helped in a timely manner, learned how to do loss prevention"
good,"Review reports, determine what fires need to be addressed first."
good,It was a good place to work.  The employees were/ are willing to help you understand what needs to be done and how it needs to be done in order to satisfy the customer
good,I always had fun while I was working there. The coworkers are extraordinary and I got along with everyone. Managers are easygoing and they are very good at training employees.
good,"Multitask "
good,"Day at work-"
good,"When my shift started I would either do the lunch, break, or register schedule or I would work the money drawer. I also listened to complaints and resolved as many as possible what I couldn't resolve Management took care of it. I learned to be very patient, also learned how to defuse a lot of situation's with kindness. Our job was a team effort, we learned to work together, for the benifit of employees as well as customers. The hardest part of my job was stepping down due to my back surgery. the best part was being around different people."
good,"As a Customer service Rep, there is never a dull moment at Walmart. I have learned to become more of a team player and how to be more understandable.."
good,"Well organized, well managed organization.  Rigid work environment."
good,It is a very physical fast paced job with a high priority put on safety.
good,I learned to have patience dealing with people. Built my customer service skills.
good,I decided I wanted a career in the medical field and didn't want to work retail.
good,Fun place to work and co workers are always happy. I learned how to multitask in a fast paced deli. Hardest part of the job was cleaning the chicken cooker.
good,"A typical day at work would be grabbing the necessary items from a pallet to your aisle to stock that aisle."
good,"Very poor communication skills (too many managers on shift)"
good,A normal day was just ring up customers as they came to check out. The people were nice and so was the other employees
good,"la responsabilidad es es grande en cada puesto uno aprende atrabajar bajo precion, se tiene gran compañerismo, nos festejaban nuestro cumpleaños era muy grato el trabajo,nuestos jefes respetan y apoyan."
good,Work place is very unique and fast pace. Working with associates can be a challenge. However the job is very rewarding at the end of the project to see all completed.
good,"I was an IMS Associate, when I was hired on I was told I was an unloader, and I would be just unloading trucks, and then it turned out to be quite everything but. I would do all kinds of stuff from binning items to the steel to helping customers do carry outs which they have people to do that for. Management doesn't really help anything they just kind of laze around and tell you to do stuff that you're already doing. or they tell you to hurry up on stuff that should probably take a lot longer than anticipated. The co-workers were great, a bunch of people around my age with some of the same interests pretty great groups of people to work with. The pay sucks, barely above minimum wage, not enough to keep food on the table, especially for the work and task at hand. all in all it's a great place for a first job but would not recommend it for anyone with an education."
good,Everyday is busy in retail. Especially when you are a sales floor associate and managed the department by yourself when the manager was not present.
good,"I worked in different departments at Wal-Mart. I stocked shelves, cleaned, use cash register, filled prescriptions, unloaded trucks."
good,"Enxerga bem tudo que se passa perante a visão."
good,"i liked working for Wal-Mart. They work with the hours you are able to work. the company is going down hill tho. shelves are empty. they are over working their staff, making work more then their job plus doing other departments jobs."
good,Helping people find what they need and make them smile. And help solving their problems.
good,"Picking up boxes all day, everyday isn't hard to do. The difficult and often frustrating part is not being able to get the hours that you want. Also the  management isn't where I would like it and what I mean by that is most of the managers don't care for the their employees like they should and it seems that many are just there to go through the motions. What I have learned working there though is the ability to work much quicker and more efficiently compared to how I worked before. The biggest thing that I thoroughly enjoy with my job is the schedule that I have. The work environment and the people that I work with are good too."
good,"I was hired during the Christmas season to assist in the high demand of merchandise stocking and sales.  My duties included stocking, organizing, taking care plants in lawn and garden, and cashier. The most enjoyable part of this job was greeting and assisting customers."
good,Job security is high but management and crew and overall store organization is terrible.
good,"Everyday make sure all the price are right. Order merchandise that  is not manually ordered by the system. Create features, Train new employees and make on hand changes. Completing  5 week bin report . Work merchandise on the sale floor."
good,"clean, fix things that have either broken or about to break."
good,"long working  hours specially for management, could be better"
good,It was your typical customer service day. Nothing to strenuous.
good,"Staff Pharmacist September 2010 - November 2012"
good,"uma empresa com grandes desafios, respeito ao individuo eoportunid"
good,"You prepare for your day as soon as you get to the store. Make up a schedule of work for your associates. Complete mandatory tasks, straighten merchandise, check in freight, bring to sales floor, guide associates and all the while give GREAT customer service to all. My co-workers are wonderful people, hard-workers that I would work with again. The hardest part of the job is flexible scheduling and loss of holidays. The most enjoyable part for me is organizing and new freight."
good,"Pay is good, but the hours were to early for those who are single parents."
good,Take the bad/expired product off the floor.Work the old freight and later work the pallets of new freight.Management helps with working the freight.The hardest part of the job has to be trying to get everything done by the end of my shift.the most enjoyable part of my job is when I'm pulling a out of dates.
good,I learned customer service skills on how to help out a customer or how to deal with a customer when their mad.
good,"I love working on car and at Walmart I get my fill of cars. I enjoyed working with other people. I hated the short schedules and the separate off days, but loved the management."
good,"I enjoyed Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart was fast paced, busy, and sold a lot of merchandise. Though Wal-Mart also needed more organization as far as keeping the store organized and also needed more employees. Also, the stock room needed more safety and organization as well. The store was just too small. Though it was a good place to work for and get good deals on products if you were a customer shopping there."
good,"Em um dia típico de trabalho, antes de nossa equipe iniciar sua jornada de trabalho, fazíamos reuniões para delegar metas e corrigir possíveis pontos críticos em nosso modo de atuação. O aprendizado é intenso no que se refere ao atendimento ao público e ao relacionamento interpessoal, visto que o setor de prevenção precisa trabalhar em equipe e com eficiência para resolver situações inesperadas com dinamismo e bom senso, buscando sempre a melhor solução para todas as partes envolvidas nas ocorrências. Só tenho a agradecer aos colegas de trabalho, pois cada um deles a sua maneira contribui para a evolução de minhas habilidades, tanto pessoais quanto profissionais. A parte difícil é sem dúvida o risco envolvido nas abordagens feitas a infratores no interior e exterior da empresa, mas com o treinamento devido essa prática tem seus riscos significativamente diminuídos. A parte agradável é estar constantemente se relacionando com pessoas com suas mais variadas formas de pensamento, o que contribui muito para o crescimento de nossa cultura pessoal e de nossa cultura profissional."
good,"I did everything there , did manger job"
good,"my days at work are long I'm always on time always precent, after the route in the morning job putting dealsel to busus, then clean offices, manaller not have much experience and does not take the best deciciones in the work area ."
good,"Working from opening shifts to closing shifts it is a constantly moving  "
good,"The photo lab had a fun, fast paced work environment. Convenient for a student requiring a part-time job while in school. Created lasting relationships."
good,"At the time i was a cashier and I loved everything about the job. Management and co-workers were great. At the time the only thing that was awful was the pay, but it was my first job."
good,"Fill orders on to pallets"
good,it was a fun idea but my co workers were rude as well as my store manager.  No one cared about pets well being just selling product
good,love working with others. i get to fix phones and do inventory.
good,"fun place"
good,Working for Wal-mart is okay if you like working in retail. Personally I   only took a position there because I had just moved to Maryland and wasn't able to find a better paying job fast enough (I could no longer be without an income).
good,"A typical day was opening up shop for the customer to bring there vehicles in for tire replacement, tire repair, lube and oil change, or battery replacement. I learned how to use the tire machine to remove the tire from the rim. Management was professional in the department and made sure customers were satisfied with the work orders. The hardest part of the job was working in the shop during super cold days and very hot days in the summer. The most enjoyable part of the job was that of working with my hands and being a productive tire and lube technician."
good,"A typical day at walmart for me is, To come in at 3 p.m. to set up the backroom so my crew can unload the truck. When they arrive at 4 p.m. we start unloading the truck. By 6p.m. the truck should be finish, & I send the crew to break. When coming back from break all the freight must be separated, & down stacked correctly. At 8p.m. everyone goes to lunch, 7 returns at 9p.m.. When returning all freight must be pulled to the floor to its right destination by 10. After that I assigned the crew there tasks for the night, & check in with manger before leaving."
good,"Good people, very productive, hard work, customer service."
good,"This Job gave me a lot of knowledge about warehouse work and inventory. It also gave me knowledge on how to work promptly, but very detailed as well"
good,A typical day was getting there and right to work. No time to waste. What I learned that getting a job there and being pregnant they don't treat you fairly. The management had its decent people and then the people who only cared about themselves. The fellow cashiers were amazing and helpful. The hardest part of my job was constant work that helped me get to a fast pace. The most enjoyable part was the actually cash register I had fun using it.
good,"When I started my day I put merchandise on the shelf, the people there was nice to work with, the best part of my day was helping customer"
good,"Too much up and down hours "
good,Greeting Customer with a smile ringing their items up & having a small conversation while doing so.
good,I cleaned all day and this was fine. All was well with everyone and the job was a job.
good,Help people with their purchases & getting their products & getting through the day by helping getting the task done.  It was a place in which you had to be always alert because of anything that could happen.
good,Enjoyed my time as Assistant manager in Nebraska Walmarts unfortunately Family health problems promoted a move to Colo.
good,They hire anyone but they pay sucks and they will try to work you to death. I would not recommend this company to anyone/
good,"Learning the different departments, and meeting all kinds of people"
good,This is a great job with plenty of advancement opportunity. It is very fast paced but most are very friendly.
good,"The Supervisors push the people who can't defend themselves"
good,"Llego reviso pendientes a resolver en mi jornada, tomo el receso para el almuerso el regreso es retomar actividades y resolver problemas o escuchar a empleados con inquietudes."
good,"This job would be wonderful given a few issues that over-ride the good; most of their centers won't hire more cashiers, and have a rough estimate of 3 to 5 people working at a time. as a cashier there, I earned my ability to stay and even a few raises and extra positions. However, when I put in for a transfer I was sent to a location two cities away from where I'm currently living/attending school, without hopes of transferring again. I had to quit voluntarily before school started again to avoid going completely bankrupt on gas expenditures. Also management at my last location changed so often it has been hard for me to remember who my supervisors would be at any given time. Also their healthcare plan is almost as expensive as paying out of pocket."
good,The work itself wasn't bad. You just unloaded and stocked your freight. Management would only half listen to the issues though and only cared about corporate askings during the team meetings while the employees needs were disregarded. We got regular breaks throughout the work day and the break areas were clean. Lots of in fighting between employees which made things more difficult than it needed to be.
good,it was alright . very easy job and real relaxed also very boring
good,The hours are horrible there is no benefits for part time employees and the management is rude
good,The hardest part of the job was. Trying to manage time with inventory. To get every thing put away on time.
good,"On a typical day we gather for a short meeting and then go to our assigned areas for the night. We start stocking the pallets of freight that are sitting in the general area for that department. Re-stocking a high-end super center can be a challenge. "
good,Overall my experience at Walmart was pleasant. I was only seasonal but I enjoyed my time there while it lasted
good,typical day at work trying to get work directions for the day.  I learned how to pick merchandise from receiving to replenish the floor.  A very select few of management cared about the employees and did their best to help resolve issues.  the coworkers were great very helpful.  The hardest part of the job was not being allowed to clock out at the end of my shift. Most enjoyable part was coworkers and customers.
good,I liked my job working on cars. Most co-workers were pleasant and easy to get along with. Though management and the over all experience there was often disappointing.
good,"My typical day at work consists of checking out prescriptions for customers and handling payment of them at the pickup window. I previously had no experience in Pharmacy operations, but I learned a lot about the process required to expedite pickup, drop off, process insurance, and filling prescriptions. Some of those things I was not allowed to do as a cashier, but I still was eager to learn by watching. My job was to maintain stock and process pickups. Management was supportive and open to suggestions to promote a team effort so that efficiency would improve daily. My co-workers were very good at what they do and as a result, I was able to learn new methods to apply to my own work to improve. The hardest part of the job is expecting that some changes in the pharmacy procedures of certain duties could change daily, requiring adaptability on a daily basis if necessary. I enjoyed every minute of it. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting and getting to know your customers on a personal level to the point where you meet members of their family, despite the circumstances."
good,"-apprendre des nouvelles affaires"
good,"a typical day at work for me is, I clock in. Go to our nightly meeting. When that's done I scan my badge to see what depts. I will have for the night. Sometimes it can be one department. Sometimes two or three. Then follows a fifth teen minute break at twelve and my lunch at one thirty. The best part of work for my is talking with the other employees and the customers. You can learn a lot about somebody who comes in the store a three in the morning. At five its another fifth teen minute break and at seven its time to punch the clock to go home."
good,i did not enjoy working for this company. noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
good,Walmart is a great company to work for. A lot of benefits room for advancement
good,Watched for shop lifters and kept up on employee safety. Worked with local police officers.
good,"Greet customers, keep area clean and organized, stock, inventory, displays, change prices, help customers find what they are looking for. "
good,Its was good to work there but the pay suck but the 401 k plans was good
good,Had a good experience with this being the first job I acquired.
good,"Electronics Dept Lead."
good,Job advancement was there. Had problems getting hours at times.
good,"A great job for a single person wanting to get into retail and grow. Your development and training is really up to you to go get, learn on your own. Hardest part of the job is dealing with people, but often times that is the most enjoyable. "
good,"I wouldn't work there again unless absolutely necessary. They want you to give your all even though they may only give you 20 hours per week at times. That's demoralizing, its hard to get excited about that"
good,"Unloader / Stocker"
good,A typical day at work would consist of dealing with freight.  Making sure the customer has products on the sales floor to choose from as much as possible.  I have learned that this is a daily struggle to make sure customers have products on the sales floor that they are looking for.  Management I feel is very lacking in this workplace.  What I mean by that is there is a major lack of communication in direction of employees by which an employee with have multiple members of management branches giving them different tasks to complete while they are trying to already complete a task.  Co-workers seem to be grouped  in which they stay to their group rather then working as a whole.  The hardest part of the job is having the patience to deal with the demands of not living up to what people in higher positions expect of the employee.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers in their search for something they are looking for.
good,"fair, work enviroment. for best results. please check previously submitted review of work enviroment"
good,Walmart is a good place to work and they pay a reasonable wage
good,"While Walmart is high pressure, there's always something to do and you're always busy.  However, even though you have a lot on your plate, you still are required to take scheduled breaks and follow you schedule to the minute unless asked otherwise."
good,Overall inefficient with a lack of communication. However most employees are very friendly and willing to help each other out.
good,A day at work was fun. I learned that you have to have patients. Sometimes management seem to be stressed.
good,"My Job was to keep my area clean i worked with the Shoes, and sometimes i had to work in the dressing room.."
good,Each day starts with reviewing each areas and Managers daily workload. I ensure everything is going to get done in a timely manner. I review many reports to monitor performance. I have 7 leaders that report to me so i have learned allot about dealing with people and what make them tick. The hardest part of my job is letting people go sometimes.The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing people succeed.
good,I like the type of job I did while working at Steak'N'Shake I was able to pick up good valuable skills while working there
good,"could have been better as far as management,co-worker were great to be around and work with"
good,"Assigning responsibilities to cashiers, making sure they went to lunches, breaks, that they are following walmart policies and regulations. Making sure customer service desk associates are providing excellent customer service and meeting customers' needs. Performing audits and reporting them to cash office."
good,I really enjoyed working at Walmart. Kept me on my toes and busy at all times. Enjoyed assisting customers and building customer service relationships with them. Safe work environment also.
good,"pharmacy was a nice place to work at, never a dull moment, always busy"
good,My co-works aren't team players in any kind of sense of the word. If everyone did their part a minimum waged job would be so stressful.
good,"A typical day of work for me is stocking freight in the morning before automotive center opens. Greet and assist customers. I have learned to have a lot of patience and treat others the way you want to be treated respectfully. Management agrees with the policy but then again they don't considering that the employees follow the policy given to them and management sometimes turns around and gives it to the customers. No support for employees sometimes. The hardest part of the job is working and not getting appreciated for all the hard work you put into the job. The most enjoyable is the environment with the associates I work with, it's friendly and fun."
good,"Staying busy all day helping customer, cleaning and stocking shelves. Decent pay for being a store."
good,it was good work. i enjoyed interacting with customers. and i liked the people that i worked with.
good,It is alright. Get to meet many different kinds of people.  You learn to work with many types of people and learn that sometimes you can not please everyone.
good,"Justdial is a great and fun workplace. Great management, great co-workers. Dealing with different customers at time, free lunch sometimes."
good,"My typical day at work was taking care of customers and ringing up items to be purchased, keep my area clean, and help where needed.  I learned how to be nice to people even when they are mean to you; not to say anything mean to the customer but show them respect; and main lesson I learned was that if you are pleasant and smiling at the customers, they will return your smile.  Sometimes your smile will make their day that much better.  I found that I had to be a good listener also.  My co-workers were great to work with.  We all tried to help each other whenever we were without a customer.  We worked as a team.  My management for the most part were good.  As I have worked in several stores, I found that management has different methods in how they run a store and/or department.  I realize that they have lots to do even if it seems they don't.  I would not want to deal with what they have to deal with day in and day out.  The hardest part of the job I found was that I had to keep my mouth shut and not say something back to those who were disrespectful.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers.  I loved each and everyone of my favorite customers."
good,This job involves being able to make decisions quickly and accurately and providing the best customer service possible.  Multitasking and being able to work efficiently are very important.
good,"Working for Walmart is both a good and bad experience. I enjoy learning about the environment and opportunities to benefit the community and myself. The hardest part of my job is putting up with crazy customers and a management team that just can't seem to get it together. I am an apparel sales associate who usually works in shoes, jewelry, and accessories. These are not easy departments but I get the job done. The most enjoyable part of my day is knowing that someway somehow I was able to satisfy a customers needs. And who knows, my smile may have been the only one they got that day."
good,"Período maravilhoso onde aprende  muito, e fiz muitos amigos. Uma empresa quer você sai preparado pra enfrentar qualquer  desafio."
good,"Wal-Mart is an ok place to work, your co-workers are great but managment not so much. You'll find some managers to be great but others seem like they think low of you."
good,"Customer service,lbaking, packaging, stocking and pricing. I I learned from the Optical dept. how to screen the eyes prior to exams and assisting customers with putting in and removal of contact lenses. In the Bakery dept. I  learned how to make some of the decorations that are on cakes and glazing donuts. My co-workers and supervisor was friendly and encouraging. The most difficult task was writing on cakes. I enjoyed the looks on the customer when we were able to meet their request."
good,"Working for one of the biggest corporations in the world was quite interesting at first. However the respect that I was received was not I thought I would get there. The job itself wasn't horrible, it was just the people who were in management that weren't so great. The moment I got an opportunity to go further in to my career at WalMart is when I was taken advantage of by fellows associates who keep me from exceeding in my position."
good,Lack of training and direction and everyone had poor attitudes.
good,Okay business to work for if your going to school because of the adjustable schedule
good,I was able to do a lot of different things over the years and am grateful for the opportunity I had gotten.
good,It was fun the employees were fun. i had to make sure the shelves were stocked and then work all merchandise in the warehouse made it to the floor.
good,"•	Supervised all cashiers and their work schedules"
good,Managers try to put heavy workloads on employees. They sometimes expect you to work 4-6 full pallets of products and get done in a certain time. A few of the managers showed favoritism. By that I meant that some rules didn't apply to other coworkers because they were friends with the managers. A few were even rude. A few of my coworkers were very inappropriate.
good,High demand job. Managers really push productivity out of you.
good,Pulled in several different directions all the time. Direction is never the same. More More More and they give no help to get it all done but still hold you 100% accountable for results. They care very little about the personal side of the business.
good,was a good place to work up until the end. I enjoyed working with most of the people there.
good,Wal-Mart can be an exciting place to work if all parties involved does their part. A typical day at work goes fast for me because I am always busy. Sometimes it is difficult to establish relationships with co-workers because a lot of them only work for Wal-Mart temporaily.
good,This was my very 1st job. I feel like you do so much work and it goes unnoticed by management.
good,mostly busy work days. dealt with many diverse customers. learned to work with members of management and my co-workers were nice to work with. Hardest part was having to deal with many rude customers. Most enjoyable part was dealing with diverse people.
good,"I would make sure that the store was cleaned and made the my "
good,Learning how to use a cash register and sometimes carry out orders of mulch and different items in the Garden area.
good,"it was just a co-op job that was it, didn't work there after! i would like to work there, but it was too much work for me when i was in high school to take on, the people who worked there before with me weren't so good"
good,"The job is not a difficult one, but some of the customers you have to deal with are amazingly frustrating. As well the Managers sometimes expect for you to do more than is physically possible, such as look after the entire back corner of the store by your self, helping customers, and run a cash register. but the people I work with there make it a fun experience."
good,"Ok Job!  The customers and managers make it difficult...."
good,When I went in for the day I would get with my Assistant Manager and find out what tasks I had to complete for the day. I enjoyed working with my coworkers. The took direction well and we all worked well together. I would say the hardest part of my job was rude customers but you have to be professional. The most enjoyable part was the friendships I made with the people I worked with.
good,Work was standard in a retail warehouse environment. I learned a lot about inventory control. What to do and not to do. Management was good albeit one or to problem managers. My co-workers were nice and very helpful. The hardest part for me was split days off on overnights. It kills your day off cause you end up sleeping the day away. The best part was the co-workers. It was always a good night when we would work together and joke around.
good,customer service very busy. learned alot from various departments.people are very nice
good,one of my first jobs it was ok I didn't really like it much but it was ok.
good,I learned many things I like to have feedback od customers so I can be a better person every day I love my coworker had so much fun working with all of them.
good,"Set responsibilities, set schedule, set pay, and wrong career path for me."
good,"I enjoyed my employment at Walmart, i had a great team and management. The hours were fluctuating from week to week not giving as many hours but overall it was a good learning experience."
good,"I work in the clothing department. When I am at the fitting room I answer a lot of calls and transfer them to the necessary department. This often takes three to four tries before the call is answered. Many times I deal with irritated customers because of the wait. The thing I love about the job is getting to interact with the customers, ask what they need and being able to help them."
good,A ok place to work its like most workplaces you get along with some and others you don't. Management have their picks and chooses but you're not there to make friends do your work and go home. Take advantage of the 401 k and the stock as soon as you can . You're there to make the customer happy and once you get a hang of what you can and cannot not do to please the customer your day will run smoothly.
good,"Provided excellent customer relations. Duties included completing sales transactions, organizing merchandise, and providing a professional platform for both customers and employees. By assisting with the stock area, I was responsible for keeping track of the sales floor, stocking shelves, checking inventory, and assisting customers with finding a particular product. Received training on promotional deals and learned marketing strategies to help increase store profitability."
good,"Always on the go, makes day go by fast"
good,Great job for someone going through school and has good benefits.
good,Always lots of work to be done but never enough staff. Been working there for 2 years now and its the same old story. The pharmacy can not keep enough staff to complete the work in a timely manner. Staff do not work together as a team. Management doesn't support the employees. It can be a very stressful job with not much compensation for the work that is done.
good,nice company and advancement but barley get hours.pay not that good but at lease your in side and get breaks and there paid
good,"always had a good day at work overall "
good,All the people that work in this company are friendly and outstanding
good,Clock in an start my job greeting customers an ringing up items an sacking items
good,"I had worked for Wal-Mart for a lot of years. I had learned to work well with others and learned to cope with new management that has different attitudes everyday. I learned how to work with pallet jacks, telxons, computers, as well learn to become a department manager. My typical day when I come to work is getting told where I am going to work in which department or if I actually going to do my job as changing the modular for that department. Wal-mart has changed so many management and they get down on their associates a lot. They sometimes have grudges to certain people if they do not like them and find reasons to fire people. The hardest part of working for them is that they do not communicate with each other and it gets hard for the associates because they have to go to each manager to get the correct answer. The enjoyable part is getting the job done and going home."
good,"Todos los días, en el turno matutino, había que sacar a piso de venta las tarimas de mercancía para seleccionar los artículos que se acomodarían en los estantes; también tenía que capturar la información de la mercancía que estuviera en promoción para generar la señalización y posteriormente colocarla en su lugar. "
good,Walmart is a hardworking place but the pay was nice. some of management was nice and supportive.
good,You start out by getting your stock put in place. You double check the stock that was located overnight because it was put up hurriedly and might be in the wrong place. Then the best part of the day happens. You get to deal closer with the customers.
good,management doesn't work well with all people... I enjoyed the people the day to day to work with different people.
good,"For associates working  8 hours get 2 paid 15min. breaks and 1 hour unpaid lunch. You get holiday pay, but it depends on how many hours you work a week. For example you work 40 hours a week you get 8 hours holiday but if you work less then 8 hours you get less holiday pay. Most enjoyable is helping customers. Hardest part is getting the right people in your department. (as a supervisor) Management, well you have some really good managers and then you have some that aren't as knowledgeable. Walmart isn't a bad company to work for but you don't get paid as much as you should for supervisor positions."
good,Work is not as bad as you would believe. Its an ok place to work but not a career making type of place unless you are moving up in the company.
good,Walmart I feel that they are to big for the shoes that they fill.
good,"My day at work I'd deal with all types of customers. From the Angry ones to the cheerful ones. I learned how to have patience and self control even if someone is screaming at me. My managers were pretty fair and taught me how to handle different situations. All my co-workers were friendly. Never had an issue with anyone, we kept things professional. The hardest part of my job would have to be keeping a neat work station on those really busy days. The most enjoyable part would be resolving problems customers have and just helping out in general."
good,work was always there stayed busy days went by fast the bosses wernt very nice tho but why should they be there walmart bosses
good,"Nice coworkers, but crazy customers."
good,I love the people i work with directly on a daily basis on my team
good,Busy place fast pace in filling prescriptions and providing good customer service. Communicating with pharmacist as well as coworkers.
good,"My typical day: Clock in, head to my register and ring up costumers until they gave me a lunch or break."
good,"The jobs all had some benefits, and if you did not learn at least something that has helped your life in someway.  Then you should not have much to learn you should retire."
good,Job was not difficult enjoyed co-workers and eviornment. It was a nice place to work
good,"empresa boa de trabalhar,duas horas de intervalo,dão assistência médica  e cartão colaborador."
good,getting to talk to new people from all over everyday. helping all customers with all their needs
good,"Working for Walmart you will always be pushed to the max far  as working. I learned to be very patient and understanding. Management  at Walmart has its ups and downs, but i learn to look on the bright side of every situation. I enjoyed my co-workers, they where all very ambitious as am I. The hardest part of  the job would be getting use to working over night. I enjoyed the hours and looked forward to the advancement of my position."
good,This was a fun job at first but became very monotonous towards the end of my stay.
good,"The most enjoyable time at work was definitely the customers, personally I am not a social butterfly but speaking with different types of people everyday absolutely opened my eyes and made me a better more social person. I honestly enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart; Management was in all honesty could've been a bit more professional."
good,"Co manager responsible for total store operations 7pm - 8am.  Manage all new freight and stockers to complete all tasks scheduled for each shift.  Responsible for hr and management staff. Manage 6 assistant managers, 2 overnight supervisors, and up to 350 employee associates.  Responsible for p&l for facility. Hardest part of the job is my commute of 170 miles round trip from home.  Also working 3rd affects time spent with my family. Most enjoyable is dealing with customers and associates."
good,The company was fine and my co-workers okay. I just moved on to a new job that had better all around benefits.
good,"I spent 7 years at Wal-Mart, starting as a Cashier and climbing to Department Manager.  I learned a great many things during my time there; I even had to opportunity to attend their Management Training School.  It is a fast paced environment with a lively associate culture.  However, I felt that after 7 years my hard work was no longer appreciated when I was shuffled to the night shift after having cut the “shrink” due to theft in their Jewelry department by half in my one year of its management, with no thank-you.  This employer is wonderful if you are a student looking for part-time work or are looking to join upper Management, but is not ideal as a long term associate level career."
good,"This job isn't one with a challenge...really. The associates that I work with are fun and out going. Management isn't that great.  2 of them are fun but they all seem to be after each other it's kind of funny actually. "
good,i did not like working there at all the managrs were not nice they did not really train me i trained my self
good,"Great way to learn hands on about time management skills, inventory, and learning new concepts under pressure."
good,"Not as good as i thought..the new changed management is not as good as the previous one."
good,Already submitted a review of this company. Walmart stock room was oppressive with heat during the summer due to a lack of ventilation.
good,"most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers, the knowledge I learned from the job and experience as well, and pushing myself to the limit of making it through sometimes up to 10hrs within a night to get work done."
good,They like to overload you with work and management treats you very poorly but it can be a fun job.
good,"Organize food items"
good,it was helpful that all the staff helped.i learned alot working there
good,No breaks until truck was unloaded.  Could take anywhere from 3-6 hours. When we were short handed they would pull other employees from other dept. that just moved so slow and managers would come back there and yell and tell us they gave us extra help and that we should be done by now.
good,great place to work and really enjoy all the wonderful customers to communicate with!
good,Everynight i showed up on time went to my cashier and did my job.
good,This job was very interesting because of my interaction with people in person of all cultures and backgrounds because of the wide array of customers that Walmart serves. I learned a lot about interacting with all kinds of people and became more comfortable dealing with the public. The company was fairly well structured and I enjoyed my management and coworkers
good,I didn't like working there. It's really taxing on your body and the staff wasn't very nice.
good,Walmart fallen way from Sam Watons  plans and business practices.
good,I learned good communication skills with customers. I also learned how to handle intense situations when dealing with angry customers.
good,I helped with inventory control. I watch video when needed.
good,"During a typical night at work I mostly unloaded skids and distributed products to their proper shelves. I feel like I gained exceptional organization skills as well as I became very familiar with a scanner called 'Gemini'. Though it was difficult to unload my quota of skids during the allotted time, it also made the night fly by which I absolutely loved. Being entirely engrossed in my work while being surrounded by helpful and friendly co-workers and management that left you alone unless help was needed was great. Unfortunately, due to a previous injury to my left hand I wasn't able to keep the job as the continuous lifting caused me a lot of pain."
good,"A typical day at work would be always being on your toes interacting with guest and helping out each other as much as possible. What I have learned from working at walmart is that you always try your best and be happy and to learn more about working a cash register. Management was great when ever you had a question they were always there to help out, and they backed your decisions when it came to reasonable transactions and deny of sales to people underage or buying for minors. Hardest part of the job would be customers who are always in a bad mood and nothing you could do would help make them better. Most enjoying part of the job is when you get told you are doing a great job by management and customers."
good,"As I said before, I had no problems with working at Walmart. They should have more hands on training though."
good,"Wal-Mart is very diverse. They welcome people from all backgrounds and lifestyles who want an opportunity to work with a willingness to learn. I work third shift and my crew and I have grown together like family.  We all get along, tease, and laugh with each other. We help each other and operate as a team. We get our job done! The hardest part is being in a small town where no one wants to leave but that's also the most enjoyable part."
good,in general upper management sucks but can be a fun place to work
good,Loved meeting all different types of people. Even though our interaction with each other were short they were always enjoyable.
good,Wal-mart would be a great place to work if they would actually do what they say they would do.
good,"Mainly worked by myself stocking and reorganizing. There was not a lot on time for leisure, just did my job and completed the task given to me."
good,"•	Retrieves carts from storage docks in the parking lot and returns them to the store for patrons to use."
good,"Some clerical, very safe, a little boring but compensated well."
good,"So starting positions in Walmart suck. They just do, and management can be a bit selfish and sketchy. However its a reliable job with great hours as well as lots of opportunities to move up in the company. The awards program is great plus a 401k plan. Its just hard work, and sometimes you may not mesh well with the employees. It works though"
good,Good hours. Flexible schedules if needed. pay not always the best for rank and file employees.
good,"A typical Walmart day begins with a morning meeting where reviews of stocks, MyShare information, and other issues are discussed such as daily expectations.  I have worked at this company for several years and one of the main lessons that I have learned is that hard work and team work go hand in hand.  "
good,"held job through college, helped me pay bills and  rent. Good place to work while in school or just getting started as a young adult"
good,"come in 15 minutes before scheduled shift "
good,It was an okay environment. The wages could have been a lot better.
good,"a typical job"
good,"worked there as I was going to school for Business"
good,my day begains by taking out the trash cleaning floors applied for management and the co-workers are great
good,"muita correria e cobrança,trabalho de logistica,muito boa bons amigos de trabalho.organização devido mau planejamento das agendas de fornecedores.o trabalho em equipe um ajudando o outro."
good,"You can learn a lot, customer interactions can be great, overall just to laid back."
good,Maybe I just lucked out but this particular Wal-Mart was so welcoming to me when I first started.  The associates I worked with as well as all the lovely customers.  They allowed me to branch out a bit and learn various positions and jobs which was great!  The only reason for my three stars was because the communication between the management and the front end was poor so no one was ever aware of policy changes until where were warned about it by management.  It became very difficult at times but all the warm smiles and laughs made up for it. Overall I absolutely loved it there.
good,great place to work at it was some times not so nice the management is so out of it thay should  show you what t do its the othe way around
good,Hardest part of the day at times was dealing with angry customers.
good,Walmart was my first job as a student. It was a good place to start with as a college student to make some money to cover my life expenses. Christmas party was one of the most enjoyable day of the job.
good,another great place that i enjoy working the people working king the management were the best the environment was clean just a pleasant to go to work
good,"Working for little money and treated with little respect. "
good,"In my 10 years as a Wal-mart associate I have learned to cover your self. If you change to price on an item or deviate from policy you had better be able to explain why. Was it for the good of keeping a regular customer? How will it benefit the company in the long run. Also, be honest with your customers and your coworkers. People hate being lied to especially if they find out later. Be honest from the start. You will avoid challenges later as long as you are honest from the get-go."
good,Extremely large location with over 500 employees. Management didn't hold employees accountable for their actions which resulted in chaos in the workplace.
good,"Rolar turnos, 1hr de comida, descanso entre semana, buscar clientes en toda la tienda que cubrieran el perfil para poder vender los productos"
good,"Worked there 10 1/2 years ... things were fine until I got hurt on the job ... nobody seemed to care about what the doctor reccommended and as a result, I now have permanent nerve damage and limitations, which keep me from aquiring another ""open"" position at Walmart. "
good,"Working at Walmart was always busy, fun to meet new people, but can be difficult at times. I learned cash and credit card transactions to fulfill transactions with quality customer service to all my customers. My co-workers were always there to help me in the beginning to help if needed. The hardest part of my job would be the black Friday shopping time. I enjoyed meeting new people throughout the co-workers and customers. I also liked knowing that I was always learning something to benefit my working experiences."
good,Is a very productive place to work for. Can be stressful at times dealing with customers on an everyday basis. Also trying to get your work done at the same time. I was able to get it done by the end of the day. Some days I had to wait for the next morning. All in all still got the work done. The people I worked with were great. Was a fun bunch and still keep in touch with a lot of them.
good,"Learnt multitasking, working under pressure and within specific time frames."
good,No compliments. Keep pushing more work on you. Communication isn't good.
good,not bad long shifts. several employee appreciation events and training
good,destreza en la retentiva de productos y responsabilidad con el personal.
good,"Great place to meet new people and a good place t"
good,A typical day of work would be coming in directly after school Monday-Friday at 4pm-9pm. 36+ hours a week part time and attending high school. As soon as I arrived there would already be a load of customers ready to check out and not enough cashiers. Managers would be working registers along with associates from other departments. I had great co-workers that helped me learn my job correctly because by the 2nd day I had been put on a register alone working 12-8. The hardest part of my job was when customers came in with several price comps/overrides. The most enjoyable part was getting to make my own money and making new friends.
good,Helped customers all day. Stocked and faced merchandise so department looked neat and tidy. I learned a lot about different items that I didn't even know existed. I enjoyed my coworkers. Management was sometimes unfair and a regular employee usually starts only a few cents more than minimum wage.  The hardest part of the job was getting all of the merchandise out at Christmas time. The part I enjoyed most was satisfying customers.
good,"Constant flow of our customers, time goes by fast. Not a bad to work"
good,Overall a good company to work for! Can be a challenging job at times!
good,this is a fine place for someone who is just getting their first job
good,"A typical day at work included customer service, stocking merchandise on sales floor, receiving. What I learned working at Walmart is having a great attitude will take me along way. Don't take it personal when customers are rude, & go with the flow. The hardest part of the job was not satisfying a customers request. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting and exceeding customer expectations."
good,"El equilibrio entre la vida privada y la laboral es regular, ya que absorbe el mayor tiempo de tu día, puesto que al poco sueldo que te ofrece, debes quedarte tiempo extra, dejando a un lado a la familia, inclusive algunas veces el personal se queda durante la madrugada para poder ganar un poco más para ofrecerle a sus seres queridos, además de que el turno es rotativo, evitando poder entrar a un curso, para poder superarte personalmente por ejemplo. "
good,"The work day was exciting and you was always learning something everyday, The managers were ok, some you didn't mine going that extra mile for and some you just wanted to get it over with, but over all it was fun and the work was done."
good,"Other than some issues with the supervisors, this particular Wal-Mart runs pretty smoothly."
good,"Working for Walmart was a true test of my life. I tested my sanity, my patience, and at times even tested me on whether or not I even wanted to come back to work or not."
good,"Wal-Mart has provided me a great career advancement."
good,it was a good first job the store was well managed and i only left because i moved.
good,"Stocking shelves overnight, ok place to work if you have small children they are not very understanding if you need to change to a day shift from a night shift."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was an experience, there's not much to tell, when your heart is not somewhere."
good,although i enjoyed working there and enjoyed my coworkers i could not support myself with the pay i was given and there was little room for advancement in my department
good,"The work was satisfying and fast paced, which I enjoyed. Things were organized well for the most part, although sometimes it was difficult to get a manager to review certain situations in a timely manner. This often resulted in customers being upset for having to wait. Compensation was good for the job and I was able to have a flexible schedule. Overall, I enjoyed the job."
good,"Insure the needs of the customers were met through using proper critical thinking skills, managerial skills, and by being logical and ethical. Exchanging or refunding goods for unsatisfied customers to make them as satisfied as possible. Asked the unsatisfied customers questions about their experience with the product so I could better understand their situation and fix the problem to the best of my ability."
good,"Overnight unloader was easy to do, time passes by quickly. friendly work environment."
good,My work started with same tasks. I learned that I was totally on my own. Co-workers were good when available to me. The hardest part of the job was working big projects alone. I enjoyed belonging to a work-family.
good,There was always work to do and if there was a down time I always seek other responsibilities.
good,"Pay is mediocre,benefits are good, depending on location, also depends on department"
good,"Was laid Back easy, coworkers was cool and helpful, manger was there when needed"
good,"It's a cashier job, what more do you want to know.  The company can be great and advancement is possible with patience and drive.  Nothing is handed to you."
good,You will be moving from the time you start until the end of your shift is over. But overall it is a good job
good,"Watch your back ."
good,Walmart is a great company. I was part time and I liked the flexibility of my schedule.
good,"Overall, not a bad place to work. Typical warehouse environment. Most co-workers work together. Production quota is at times unachievable. I enjoyed having a 3 day weekend."
good,fun to work at but very bad pay. The co-workers are fun. the hardest part was the pay.
good,"Over see overnight crew, check reports, price changes, work freight, associate meeting, make sure stockers are keeping busy getting freight out onto the sales floor, zoning, inventory, binning product, scheduals, unloading truck. looking over managers notes and fixing issues on sales floor"
good,"winter season was very busy and the winter was harsh"
good,"The Walmart I worked at was mismanaged, from what associates from other stores said. However, there is a large room for advancement in the company."
good,There were a few things that could have been better. I enjoyed the job like helping customers find the product they were looking for.
good,"learned to work in different departments such as customer service, money center, fitting room, jewelry center, and cashier "
good,"Whatever items a customer purchased, I would scan these items and place all of the customers items into their bags as well as their buggy."
good,"Customer service, A/R, A/P, ordering, teamwork building. The most rewarding part of the job was the camaraderie between the employees."
good,fun place to work and shop. people were friendly there and work was easy
good,It can be a better place to work at. A typical day at work. like the people I worked with.
good,"This job consisted of oil changes, tire rotations, fixing tires, and light wheal maintenance.  Not much to learn because I worked in this field before.  Management made it hard, but I overcame."
good,in my time there its a great place to met new people while you work
good,Very little upward movement it is just a job. Management does not care about employees you are just a number
good,It was a job.  I didn't like it but I didn't hate it either.  Customers were rude and nasty most of the time and supervisors were almost always never available.
good,"Stocking incoming merchandise to its proper destination, I've learned that all retail stores are run differently when it comes to receiving and stocking merchandise. Management will not lend a hand or guide you properly. Co-workers complained about management to much instead of doing their jobs. The hardest part of the job was having your ideas shot down every time you bring them to management. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers."
good,"llegar puntual checa con el gafete y iniciar con un pasillo limpieza y para abrir y que todo este listo para atender al cliente,. el compañerismo era muy bueno el mejor de las 4 tiendas que abrieron y super  a gusto todos no hablábamos y nos llevamos muy bien pues dificil no por que ya sabia lo que tenia que hacer y tenia que estar bajo presión y lo principal terminar los pasillos y atención al cliente,. lo que mas me gusto fue que tiene uno facilidad de promoción aun que desgraciadamente no a todos lo que de verdad trabajamos no se nos da la promoción merecida,."
good,"Walmart was a very fast paced company, I enjoyed being a part of the enviroment."
good,simple place to work. not bad if you can get into a department that you actually want to work in.
good,"Acolhe os seus associados como família,mais o salário é baixo para a quantidade de atividade diária de seus associados"
good,"I did CBL's (Computer Based Learning) the first week, then actual training the next week."
good,"A typical day at the job is to make sure the department is zoned when I get in. Make sure the shelfs are full and if there are empty items, I scan them and pick them out of the bin. "
good,"Good and honest work, was very productive and challenging."
good,The hardest id part of this job was standing for 6 to 7 hours on your feet.
good,"Its ok to work there. I have a very high tolerance to deal with angry customers. There wasn't enough management at very busy times, I went without any change in my drawer more than a few times. I lived my co-workers. I had a problem with the schedule though when I was 9 months pregnant and I got off at 11pm and the store manager wanted me to come back at 5am ( which was also out of my availably) after talking to her she said I had enough time to get sleep and be there the next day if not I was to be fired. I showed up and left around 7am because of contractions, I just wished she would have taken my condition into consideration. I quit after I had my baby and they told me I didn't qualify for a leave of absence anymore."
good,"Too much work not enough hours for such little pay, but you do find whatever your shopping for."
good,"Really enjoyed working every day with a team that everyone put in a great deal of teamwork.  Co-workers were smart, flexible, and enjoyed doing what they were doing.  Typical day was 8 to 10 hours filling 400-500 prescriptions a day.  Staff placed care of the patient as a high priority and assisted in making that happen."
good,"Duties includes that candidates have the physical stamina to move product of up to 50 lbs. on a regular basis, unloading freight, filling stock & fresh cuts."
good,"Making sure when customers leave my register that they are happy and are willing to come back. My co-workers were the best part of my job, i worked with some wonderful people that will be life long friends. The hardest part of the job is always keeping a smile on my face even as customers can be very rude. But the best part is making even the worst of customers happy, content and  willing to shop here again."
good,"When I worked at Wal-Mart it was hard because manly of the weather. The weather was our enemy. It was hard because it would snow and would be very hot. Getting carts on the weather would suck, but I didn't complain because even though it was my first job, I liked doing the hard work. Hard work is fun for me and I enjoy it."
good,"This job was fine for a young, single person with very few financial obligations.  "
good,it was a ok job could have better wages. Management and fellow employees were very friendly and helpful.  enjoyed assisting customers.
good,Wal-mart is determined to not have anymore full time employees. They will give you full time hours up to the point you are going to be full time and then cut  you back just long enough that you start all over again. That keeps them from giving you benefits. You can average 45 hours a week but never come out on top. They hire a lot of people who could care less about showing up for work or even working once they get there. I loved decorating the cakes as well as the customers.
good,I've learned how to work with money. the management team is the best my co-workers are fun some of the time. the hours would have to be the hardest part of the job. the best part is when its time to go home at 7am.
good,"A night at Wal-Mart for me was pretty interesting, each night something different happened. My favorite part of my job was assisting the customers."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was busy, faced paced but fun. I learned many useful skills."
good,"Unload trucks, pull pallets to sales floor, do picks."
good,"A typical work day during my last year at Wal Mart was actually really good. I got up in the morning, helped get the department ready for customers in the morning so when they came in I could help them with finding the right merchandise and then ring them up. By really diving in and researching the products that I was selling, I was able to help the customers make the most informed decision about buying the right product at the right time. "
good,"Walmart has a very heavy work environment, management and supervisors do not treat their workers very good"
good,"A typical day at work, I learned hard work pays off, management was fair, my co-workers wore helpful, and the hardest part of my job was sorting the little cosmetics, the good part of the job was seeing a customer smile."
good,"Worst part - some of the rude and disrespectful customers who looked down on employees for being in the service industry"
good,I would clock in and go see a member of management and find out what register I was assigned. I would then ring people up and bag their groceries.  I feel like I was only a number. I loved waiting on people and talking to customers. I only knew a few coworkers since people were always coming and going. I think they were really nice and still talk to them when I go to Wal Mart. The hardest part of the job was no advancement and being pregnant and having to carry heavy stuff around with no help. The customers would offer and try to help but ultimately that isn't their job.
good,A typical night was very busy stocking merchandise to store shelves and assisting customers with questions.
good,its an okay job to work the pay is okay and they really work with you and your schedule
good,Nice first job to have. Nice environment to work in and get pretty good training.
good,"ingreso als 15 horas repositor de gondolas sector bebidas y galletitas."
good,"stock groceries and sales floors, inventory, direct and answer customers questions, light maintenance."
good,"Nothing special."
good,love helping customer but some of them just had bad days enjoyed seeing what was new that we had to bring to the floor..
good,"As a Customer Service Manager work can become very busy, hectic but can also be fun. I've learned to have a lot of patience and my communication skills has increased tremendously. I've learned when a customer comes with a problem, even if you know you can't help them for reasons like against store policy, don't have the authorization to do so, or need to be referred to a particular department, its always good to listen to them and try your best to help the understand in a respectful way. Sometimes it may not work and they still get a little hostile but the majority of the times, it makes the situation a lot easier to handle. As a Customer Service Manager I was supervisor over every cashier, responsible for every register in the store, responsible for register audits, supervision the customer service desk and money center, handle money gram transactions, vendor payments and loans up to 10,000 dollars plus. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people and being able to help people. The hardest part of my job was trying to do everything by myself because of other co-workers not wanting to do their part. It's hard trying to do your work and other people's work along with providing good customer service."
good,A lot of overtime required. It's very busy especially on Sunday's after church. They will let you know if they need you for overtime as you are getting off work. Getting breaks are not easy. They pay is not much and you will have to transfer departments.
good,"Typically task orientated always finishing and starting new task through out the days. The hardest part of the job was managing the work loads between the few people that worked there for the task at hand. I learned a lot while there including how to control inventory , and keep the sales floor stocked and zoned for ease of access for he customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to help customer;s find the products they needed to finish a specific job they had for any type of home improvement job. I was the department manager in hardware , and i would get a lot of questions on how do i do this and what do i need. It was enjoyable to be able to accurately be able to help them with those needs."
good,"In a normal day, I clock in and get a register assignment, and either open the register or relieve another associate. Then check out customers for the rest of the day. When there are no customers we pick up items that are not supposed to be at the register. As well as cleaning our register. I learned better customer service skills. Management is usually productive, but at the same time they seem to pick favorites and don't treat everyone equally. The hardest part of my job is standing on my feet, in  one spot for 8 hours a day. The most enjoyable part of my job is all of the interaction with customers!"
good,"what I really enjoy on my job is everything about computer an report "
good,"my work would involve different management instructing me and they weren't always on the same page. Learned a lot about retail and demographics. The hardest part of the job was being pulled in several different directions and trying to focus, The most enjoyable part was assisting truly greatful customers."
good,This job was alright. It was no different than a couple of other big box retailers I've worked for.
good,A typical day at WalMart goes smoothly. I enjoyed working with my coworker. We would always work together to get the job done each night.
good,"Cant be full time or permanent in my position. The position entails me to come to work at an early time of 6:00 am, starting the job by opening of boxes from a minimum of 4 pallets a day. Though I like my co workers and I enjoyed working with them and its the most enjoyable part of the day but I still feel like Im overworked with a small pay."
good,"could have been better "
good,I learn how to use a computerized handheld gun and also learn were all the merchandise go too
good,Would deal with customers effectively and efficiently.  Electronic money transfers.
good,A decent to place work and learn operations of events for Walmart.
good,"It was a job to work with great co-workers, i would have to say management  they were nice and always with a smile on there face's. Everyday i would make sure i would have money in my drawer, handle money and scan customer items,have smile on my face,clean around work area and i would work in a fast paste.There wasn't anything hard about this job. I the most i enjoyed about this job was i got to help people and put a smile on there faces.But now i need a career because i have a family to look after."
good,Its Walmart. If you are willing to work its not a bad place. But you have to be willing to put in the work to be rewarded.
good,"A very good work environment, love my co-workers and company i was contracted with"
good,I was able to move from one department to another and get a feel for all the areas.
good,Helping and assisting customers. I liked working in the customer service department more because I like to stay busy but I was everywhere from a cashier to a customer service mgr.
good,"A typical day you check in and go straight to your work area."
good,"At work, I feel like I am a chicken without a head. I am always running around trying to get the merchandise on the shelves while trying to provide the best costumer service for the costumers. I learned how to use a telxzon, organize merchandise, and more about team work. Management is ok. They can have their moments."
good,breakdown in communication between management and associates causes confusion and ineffective work
good,"*good for a first job"
good,"I have worked for Wal-Mart for three and a half years and I have gotten better at my job.  It is a job where if you get used to it you can master it and each day is always different.  I have learned to make good choices when it comes to getting my job done correctly.  Management respects hard workers and co-workers appreciate it when they know you are friendly and helpful. "
good,"I'm a upbeat and professional person, so my typical day is always good. I'm a aggressor, so I believe in being the first to start a conversation with my customers. I've learned that the company caters to it's consumers and their workers have not a chance. It's not a bad thing, but workers need acknowledgement too. Management is good, In all my experiences management has good days and bad ones. My co- workers were awesome. We all had a job to do and decided to make the best of it. The hardest part of the job was leaving the relationship I had built with my customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to make my customers smile."
good,"-Meta batida"
good,Walmart had a work friendly environment with great customer inteactions.
good,"Walmart was a very exciting place to work, there was never two days alike. Most of the people I encountered were good people and be it that im the same type of person, it was always a refreshing feeling to encounter such great people."
good,I definitely learned a lot while working at the portrait studio. I loved learning how to properly shoot basic photos as well as let my creativity shine through. It's definitely not a job for shy people since we were always out in Walmart getting people in the studio for photos and drumming up business as much as we could.
good,"They were not willing to let just anyone expand in their retail career. They often did play favorites. If they didn't like you, then you would be stuck where you were at."
good,There is both a positive and negative side with working at wal-mart. The positive is spending time helping customers and making them feel good about their shopping experience. The negative side is the lack of opportunity to create an improving career in the company. Never had any negative experience with management but just to see the stress they have to endure is never a good process.
good,"During my time at Walmart, I learned much regarding inventory control and worked closely with the management on suggestions on how to provide a quicker, easier and more efficient program for the stockroom."
good,"A typical work day is busy and there is never not something to do.  "
good,"Dia tipico,entraba demasiada gente,se vendia muy bien,los encargados muy buenos empleados,todos los dias venia el dueño a la mañana."
good,"There is really no typical set plan.  Each you come in with a fresh mentality, due to the fact that the demand constantly changes; you need to remain flexible.  I've learned how to deal with multiple personalities on a daily basis, in which I became a great people person, understanding the needs of my subordinates and all associates in general.  My co-workers were the true reason that I came to work each day; we supported each other no matter the situation.  We had a team within the big team.  The hardest part of the job was to deal with the micro-management in general.  The most enjoyable part of my job was the interaction amongst the associates and myself."
good,"Typical Day"
good,"Desarollo y capacitacion del personal"
good,Very busy place to work.  Only interested in bare requirements for technicians.
good,"On a typical day of work, I check through my department and order items, and update any pricing, while replacing and changing labels on anything needed. Over my nearly four years working for Wal-Mart, I have learned a lot about what makes a business work. I've learned how to re-merchandise product to make it more attractive to the customers. I've been lucky enough to work with an incredible management team, who are not afraid to take risks for a higher payoff later. My associates have always been very hard-working, and I'm very grateful for them, and all the teamwork. The hardest part of my job is managing so many different departments. My title may be Infants Department manager, but I actually run the Girls department as well. Some days I am actually in charge of all of apparel (Ladies, Jewelry, Intimates, Mens, Boys, Girls, Shoes, and Infants). This can be a lot to handle, but it also always puts me up to a challenge, and I do enjoy that. The most enjoyable part of the job for me is definitely working with the different customers. I am very much a people person and I love to interact with everyone."
good,Good Starter Job. Fast Paced. Good Carree job if that is what you are into.
good,You will learn new skills. Interact with different kinds of individuals.
good,"° Responsible for managing the entire ladies department at Wal- Mart. "
good,A typical day is hectic i learned to deal with a variety of personalities and multitask efficiently.
good,"A typical day at work includes, checking customers out at register, assisting customer service departments with returns, refunds, and or exchanges. Interaction with management and co workers was essential for one common cause to assist and aid all customers in a timely matter. The hardest part of the job was going to lunch on time, the most enjoyable was faster paces which made for shorter days."
good,If you love working with the public then this job is for you. If you don't then you may want to look elsewhere. customers are 100% of the job.
good,"Good place to start work, you get to meet alot of wonderful customers, you have a great option to choose from in whether you want to work days or overnights. Good place to plan out your life within the company or go through schooling with the company."
good,"I deal with customers all day, I am a deli sales associate. So it is my duty to slice there meat, take orders, make sandwiches etc... my co-workers are my co-workers. Some of them are reliable some of them aren't. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who have had a bad day but i'm a determined to turn that around. I enjoy meeting new people everyday or seeing my same customers that makes my day."
good,a typical day at work was being asked to complete task that were nearly impossible to do in a 8 hour shift .while working here i did learn how to stock products and zone them.as far as the management goes we had some that were pretty cool and then we had some that were not as cool as the others. most of my co workers were OK but then the other half were slackers so it made everyone else job much harder.the hardest part of my job was trying to stock all the freight and zoning it before the end of the shift.the most enjoyable part about the job was some of the co workers and management.
good,"An easy job, but you have your usual issues of lazy and inconsiderate co-workers and managers which is the hardest part of the job. They give you the training if needed for you to do additional tasks. Stocking shelves with new product is not a hard job, and that is all your job is."
good,Walmart has great benefits.  There are several different positions that is offered.
good,"I felt the management was great.... I do however think that the meal and call in policy needs to be looked at.... I called in because I the doctor told me, didn't think after 13 years I would need proof. Well don't call in 3 times in three months.... Got fired. I really did love my job, Hate the policies...."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart wasn't too bad. You go in, clock in, meet with your CSM (Customer Service Manager) to get your register assignment for the day, and then get right to work. Occasionally you are asked to fill a break for another department or a door greeter. You are also told when to go on break or lunch by your CSM or you may be asked to run clean up of items out of place. As a cashier, I filled a few roles, and not all of them on the front-line cash registers. It wasn't a bad place to work, but it was horribly confusing as to who was in charge of you above the CSMs. We had a few switches of managers on the front-line so it was hard to tell who you went to to go above the CSMs for any reason. It normally came down to finding a manager, any manager, that was on duty when you needed one regardless of the department."
good,"A typical day as a CSM started by scheduling lunches and breaks (this was before we upgraded to a computer program that did this for us, we still had to make adjustments) in which the difficulty varied depending on the number of associates scheduled that day and how many breaks or lunches overlapped. Between completing requests put in by associates and customers part of my job was to complete a set amount of audits along with other tasks assigned by management which I had some opportunity to delegate to other employees."
good,"I worked here it was alright, promotions rarely happen and having integrity can get you in trouble at times."
good,"before being promoted, it seems like the sky is the limit with the company."
good,The management team does not treat people equally and I have learned how not to treat the people who work for you.
good,"A typical day at work will be busy with verifying prescriptions while answering Doctor, patient phone calls and counseling patients."
good,This was a good place for me to start in the dealership business.  I learned a lot of new things and enjoyed my time there.
good,"a lot of customer service, and management is very flexible with your school schedule."
good,unloading trailers and stocking shelves and customer service
good,"The day would go by fast, I had to stock the meat cooler because I was a meat associate. The co workers were nice and willing to help those in need of help"
good,"friendly co workers ,everyone working together, one common goal everyday."
good,Working at Wal-Mart it gave you a feel of what the business world is like. You go in and clock in like any regular job and you began to learn the do's and don'ts of the job or either the particular position given. Manager's are nice but strict when it comes to their jobs. They know how to make you feel comfortable but still keep it professional.
good,Enjoy working and being productive great benefits and 401k
good,Over night shifts are very quiet and they go by fast. There are sometimes a lot of work and sometimes there is moderate amounts of work. I work with a lot of different people all different personalities and most of the time we get along.
good,There was a lack of training for the position that I was hired for.
good,"Meeting and greeting the customers, Providing assistance."
good,"The Walmart I worked at was a fantastic store. The management was caring, however, some people there felt underpaid. The work load is heavy and hectic. I don't have anything really negative to say about the store I worked for. I have heard from other people that they've had bad experiences at Walmart. I guess every location varies."
good,I would recommend to anyone who wants to work with the public and is great with customer service.
good,good workplace exceptional benefits good teaching environment
good,i would help patient get ready for the day. i would also make sure their needs were meet by helping them eat.
good,"It was a nice place to work for, except for when they tried to go against safety and have me do a job that would harm my well being without help. They gave the job to a co-work and they were off work due to injury for 6 months.I swept, safety sweep,clean restrooms,clean windows."
good,Worked in customer service and electronics area. I enjoyed learning about new products and helping people who had questions on the latest products.
good,"Wendy's was like any other fast food place. Although the one I worked at, I made interesting! I had a blast! I closed drive thru mostly, and the closing managers were awesome! They were lax most of the time, and we worked as a team."
good,The job was a very productive but social environment. The work load was a bit unfair; meaning the same expectations weren't the same for every employee.
good,"I counted my money drawer and made sure my area was clean. I waved customers over to my line and quickly and efficiently cashiered them. When we had a lull I would do merchandise recovery, clean  and take out the trash until the next wave of customers came in. I would also occasionally train new cashiers in proper procedures."
good,"Fellow employees are very friendly but,you will not get payed for overtime so if you get off at a certain time and customers still come to your check out line you cant leave but they make you cut your hours. Also they train you for different jobs in the store but your pay rate will not change."
good,Watered plants and helped out customers when they were either lost or needed help.
good,Its what you make out of it. could be good or bad depends on your manager
good,"Was good company to get a first job experience with. I learned all types of things in the six years of working there. Everything from the sales floor to running the front end of cashiers, customer service, and money center."
good,This is a good job. I just couldn't deal with work and the death of my son.
good,"Constantly working with customers, you must perform great customer service in order to work there i think.  I learned alot from coworkers as well as customers.  The hardest part is making sure the line comes down quick due to impatient stressed customers.  It's 50 50."
good,Decent company to work for.  Hard to move up to better your career.
good,"Mantener estándares al 100%."
good,This job consisted of stocking shelves and assisting customers with their needs.  Management was very organized and consistent in work practices.  The diversity within co-workers allowed their to be no discriminatory connotations to be construed.
good,"It's a very good company to work for, but there are some changes need to be done. I have learned a lot while working with the company. I have some of the best co-workers. The hardest part of the job working with people that do not respect you.The most enjoyable about the job is the customer."
good,"A fast paced work environment.  Duties include merchandising, price changes, customer service, planograms and training associates. I also made schedules, conducted interviews, hired and trained new associates."
good,The most enjoyable part of working for Walmart was meeting different people and having relationships with co workers.
good,I enjoy working with my co workers and other floor staff to better assist our customer. I learned the value of a smile can go along with people. i learned how to effectively read upc codes and stocking procedures to ensure productive service of our customers. Because this is a fairly new location the management changes quickly not leaving enough time to learn from one person to another and this is physically demanding position which offers no bonus nor benefits beyond your signing on benefits which causes a quick turn over of employees.
good,I work in a fast paced atmosphere with people from different background.
good,a typical day consists of work then break then more work then break again.
good,"great for seasonal job."
good,"A typical work day was dealing with an over crowded shipping dock and co-workers that were self-centered, fork-lift operators who would only help close friends pull full-pallets from under racks."
good,"Wal-Mart was a fun and great place to work.  They have great employees, great management and it is a clean environment."
good,There is always something to do when you work in produce at Wal-Mart because you can remove rotten food and restock it with fresh food and help customers.
good,"Perform many different tasks. Some of those task was ordering, stocking, assisting customers, maintaining a clean environment, and inventory control."
good,I enjoy my job and working with the crew we have. we get a lot done together
good,"A typical shift begins with organizing and making a presentable cash area. Most evenings are quite busy and you barely get a moment to breath. You receive breaks based on the amount of hours, I must say that WalMart is one of the most generous companies with their break times. Overall, I loved the people and the job while I worked for this company."
good,A typical day was stocking and ordering merchandise. I learned how to be a good leader. Management was constantly changing every 3-4 years.
good,"I would start by collecting the money from the outlying registers and then coming back to the front to finish the registers up front. At midnight we would change over the last two registers. Next I would have the cashiers start to clean the registers and stock freight as it came in. I would print the schedule for the next day to have it ready and countdown the podium and get a change order ready for accounting to fill so the podium would be stocked. I would cover the breaks and lunch of the cashier. I would have to do extras for management such as zoning the hot spot seasonal area, and clearance isle. I had to make sure that all return were put away before 6:30 a.m. when the day CSM came in for their shift. I would put the change in the podium and balance it before I would clock out for the day."
good,"What I learned working at Walmart Supercenter is that everyone is like a huge family, theyre all there for eachother. The employees were always really busy and had an handful, but most employees would stop what they were doing to help. The hardest part of the job was having to balance the shifts, they changed my work hours last minute a few times, and it interferred with my high school education at some times. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers, and the employees."
good,Spent 10 years with the DC enjoying my career. Over the last couple of years of my employment a lot of management positions were given to new candidates and it caused some headaches from lack of experience.
good,"Walmart allows you to learn several different things in your time with them. These is always and opportunity for a job change, however movement within the company is very linear."
good,"Al llegar todas las mañanas me gustaba sacar ventas para entregarles a los gerentes o subgerentes de apertura y siempre tuvieran esta informacion por si sus jefes inmediatos les llamaban."
good,Love working with my co-workers and customers. Enjoy seeing them from time to time. Home town new a lot of customers that visited the store on a daily basis.
good,Wal mart was good place to work for at the time that i was there. I got alot of hours and had a consistent schedule. The pay was good and i enjoyed being around my coworkers. The one concern i had was that there were so many people working there that i felt like it took a while for our concerns to be addressed.
good,ok company to start with if you are in school or just need extra money and want a discount on their merchandise.
good,"Learned a lot of things working for this company, for example how inventory works. Monday's - Thursday's are not as hectic as much, when the weekends come that is when everything really busy. My co workers are excellent they are hard workers as well."
good,"I had great co-workers, everybody was really friendly. I learned how to run a cash register. You also learn patents when it comes to dealing with all kinds of people."
good,I was promised around 16/hours a week and didn't get even close to it.
good,Everyday is a consistent pattern. I have pallets of product that has to be broke down by a 10:30am and put out on the sales floor by 11am. I've learned how to manage my time more and also how to stay consistent with keeping the sales floor stocked. Our management team is good. My co-workers are cool people. The hardest part about the job is getting the sales floor full and clean when we are under staffed. The best part about the job is being able to give our customers fresh and great quality product.
good,"Walmart wasnt bad, ok hours and ok pay it was an ok job. best parts were the coworkers and cracking jokes. all the coworkers hated walmart. when i worked there it was like limbo, i worked there for 6 moths and it felt like 3 years. "
good,I would pass out food sample to customers and try to convenience customers to purchase the products.
good,After working long hard hours there is a possiblity to learn more skills.
good,"we had too many hrs, bad management, more help needed by magement, fraud"
good,It's what you make of it. Working with many customers was always fun and brought many joys and excitement to the job. Just hated that they wouldn't let me take more time off for my studies.
good,This job gave me the opportunity to learn to work as a team toward a common goal. I was also able to become familiar with equipment such as fork lifts and scissor lifts.
good,laboren en esta empresa mientras estudiaba lo malo es que los sueldos son muy bajos
good,would be a great place if the multi billion dollar company would pay more to employees
good,Very positive work place.  The Managers were understanding.  It was a positive place to work independently.
good,Overnight can go by fast as long as you keep busy. There is a lot to do because the store is big and a lot of product to be put away
good,I got to unload the truck for the Wal-Mart associates to replenish shelf's
good,I enjoyed working there and learning different techniques. Cooking in a cafeteria is a whole new world. Being able to work in front of employees and conversing with them was a good way to interact with the people you are cooking for. My organization skills and speed increased as time passed by for service. Having to deal with different diets was also a challenge but manageable.
good,"Greeting customers, helping with grocerys if needed and cashing them out."
good,"I had liked working as a cashier at Wal-Mart, I had liked my managers in the beginning and at the end of my temporary position."
good,"A typical shift started at 10 p.m. and ended around 7:30 a.m. I worked nights and went to school during the day. I learned that hard work will pay off in the end, and that will power can accomplish many great things. My co-workers were great people, but not the best employees. The hardest part of the job was working the graveyard shift. I would often be tired from going to school during the day and working at night, but it's something that had to be done. The most enjoyable part of the job was probably my relationships with my managers. I really enjoyed their work ethic, and they enjoyed mine as well. We were able to get a lot accomplished when I worked there, and it felt great to be able to contribute as much as I did during my time there."
good,did learn different types of people and their wants learned that not all company have great team leaders.
good,"A typical day at Walmart for me was pretty much the same everyday. Go in and start doing your computer work, ex: price changes, inventory counts, stocking shelves, resetting departments, scheduling, meetings and planning. I learned a lot of leadership skills at Walmart and about inventory and numbers and how they all work together to make money. The best part of the job was your customers who made you feel valued! The worst part of the job was coaching someone for something they had done or was in the wrong for. When I worked at Walmart we had a great store manager who you could trust, talk to and count on to give you what you needed to perform your job duties so I was well pleased there and for my coworkers I always had such a great time with them. I made life long friends there. I liked working for Walmart but I left to have more hands on with helping people."
good,"I worked a variety of shifts and departments.  My main assignment was in the produce department mostly working the closing shift.  Different shifts had different tasks such as stock rotation and binning during opening.  The closing shift involved managing the sales floor and cleaning the stock room.  I learned specifics about our stock and how to use our inventory system.  We would assist Wal-Mart staff that were not from our retail division.  Maintenance crews, inspectors and auditors would sometimes require access to parts of the store and members of management and we were to facilitate them in their assignments.  The position required more physical work than I was used to but the upside of that was the exercise."
good,Your a number you are just a number. The enemy of my enemy is not my friend.
good,Office supply company with great potential. Long hours and hardworking individuals.
good,The Management Staff does not care about you You are expected to get all of your tasks done and help customers at same time and if all work is not done you get wrote up.
good,My day starts with signing out the keys that open up the backdoor and loading dock doors.  After that I prepare my desk and paperwork for the day.  That's about when the vendors start showing up.  I open the door for them and match up their invoice with the total on the Telzon after I scan in the product.  Many vendors come through the door so I do a lot of multitasking throughout the day.  At the end of the day I match up all of our printed invoices with the invoices I get from the vendors and hand them to the accounting office.  This is how all the companies will get paid.  Management typically gives minimal supervision because me and the other receiver have a good handle on keeping the vendors in compliance with all store policies.  I enjoy the relationship I have with all the vendors and they respect me enough to listen to what I tell them.
good,I had stable hours it was a great work place and great associates and work really well with mangers.
good,"I went in at 10pm, got the pallet of merchandise from outback with a pallet jack, and started opening packages and putting them on the shelves if needed, or putting them on a ""overstock"" cart, and bringing them outback when the nights over, and the last hour was zoning. "
good,I would work 9 hour shifts and was only getting paid minimum wage. Not somewhere I would work unless there are no other options.
good,"nice co-workers , nice management. Flexible schedules for college students"
good,worked inside a plant in a freezer -20 temps everyday lots of movement never in one spot for to long always moveing
good,"This job was good ,because it offers good pay and benefits. For me this job gave me some insight of what to expect from a job, how to cope with employers and co-workers and showed me how to better prepare myself for my next job."
good,I help out customers with electronic related questions. I have learned a lot more in depth details about technology. My co-workers I worked with were productive and completed tasks accordingly. The hardest part of the job was dealing with enraged customers but I can usually bring them to a calm state and satisfy them. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work in departments like seasonal.
good,working as a pharmacy technician allowed me to help others and I enjoyed the job and team members.
good,"A typical day as an Overnight Stocker included unloading delivery trucks, stocking end caps and creating new displays, stocking aisles quickly and as efficiently as possible, and greeting and assisting customers. "
good,I liked working there but there was always 2 people telling you to do something different which caused a lot of miss communication.
good,I enjoyed my coworkers while i was at Walmart but the management wasnt the greatest
good,"Good pay, long hours, promotions are fast if you show some pride in your work and work hard. The hardest part of the job is not having enough associates to get the work needed done. Management and co-workers work great together, make a good team. The most enjoyable part is getting the hourly associates a quarterly bonus."
good,Loved working and doing my job with everything I had but no place for advancement and higher pay
good,"I would check inventory, help customers, process trucks, and anything else I could do to help keep it a great shopping environment for the customers."
good,"A typical day at work was moving counters, clothes, food, ect. around to make the place more neat. We also help build a lot of shelves and place different store material on them. I learned how to build a lot of different things and how to organize a Super Center. And my co workers were real fun to work with and it was a pleasure to work with them. The most enjoyable part was putting objects in it's designated place because it was really easy. And the most hardest part was moving the counters during the day."
good,I have been a Customer Service Manager for 3 1/2 years and love taking care of the customers and the associates I am in charge of.
good,Good for a decent paycheck in college. Loved the customers.
good,learning different jobs with in the company helping customers co workers are friendly hardest part of the job is lifting 50 lb. boxes
good,"customers  were  sometimes  rude  but  that  can  be  expected, employees  were nice until they got mad at management then they took it out on you"
good,"aprendi hacer arqueos con mucha plata..."
good,"Working for Walmart on a typical day is unloading 18 wheelers by hand off groceries furniture toys etc... Co-workers were good to work with was a real team effort, what i enjoyed the most was when we finished back to back trucks for the day."
good,"I enjoyed working for Walamrt. When it came to fulfilling my military obligations however, my managers were not understanding in the requirements that needed to be met for soldiers. Although I had provided them with a training schedule with ample time for them to find replacement, they failed to do so, thus making the job less than pleasant on my return from training. The skills I learned while working there can be useful in other fields of employment so I am pleased with that aspect of the job."
good,not great but not a horrible place to work. management I had was not so good but that is people not the company. day by day was ok routine routine routine.
good,enjoyed my job.. management was the worst... got to meet new people.. lots of responsibility .. pay is aweful..
good,Working at walmart was one of my first job and a great way to build my customer service skills at. I would assist the customers at the end of their shopping experience checking the items they wanted to buy out. The hardest part of this job was when customers would have WIC products.
good,"start your morning off with some exercise, to get the blood flowing. interact with other staff. open doors and let customers in. hardest part would be going out in the freezing cold to collect shopping carts, best part was helping customers with their purchases"
good,"meeting"
good,It had its ups and downs working for walmart. The bad part about it was the mangers all had different answer to what you should do. One person would tell u one thing and you would go to the next manager and they would say that was incorrect so they dont communicate very well at all! The most enjoyable part was the customers and the co-workers I worked with
good,"getting people what they needed "
good,"Typical day consisted of the following: Cashier, Maintenance"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job at Wal-Mart was the customers.
good,"I ultimately enjoyed the job but, was never able to get full time hours.  I did enjoy working with the public."
good,Developed and monitored inventory control and ordering processes.  Devised strategic business development plans  Led a dedicated workforce that filled an average of 200 prescriptions per day ..
good,"i handeled  alot of responsibilities being a customer service rep. I cashed checks, took care of customers, balanced cash registers, and even scheduled my co-workers breaks."
good,"if you like assisting customers, and learning new thing than this is the job for you."
good,"A typical day at work is zoning the isle, helping the customers find items and stocking the shelves. I've learned that Wal-Mart don't really sell everything. Management need a little more work. My co-workers; some can be trusted with information while others can stab you in the back. The hardest part of the job is picking up the heavy boxes, having to leave late to come back in early the next morning. The most enjoyable part is when they have something for the co-workers every now an again, interacting with some of the customers makes the day go by faster."
good,Full time empoyees were only guaranteed 30 hours per week..Reason for leaving was the insurance plan..
good,The co-workers are probably my favorite part of the job. Everyone I work with is awesome. Everyone is on the same page for the most part. Management is okay.... some are good and some are terrible. The hardest part of the job is having so much to do with so little help.
good,"You really learn how to take care of customers at walmart. However, they are usually so short handed that it takes the fun out of work !"
good,Basic day to day mundane redundant retail job. The most enjoyable thing about this job was being able to work with a diverse group of people.
good,"Lately our routines have changed and I find it hard to finish them daily. I am currently trying to manage my time better,  to complete my routines. I do learn something new everyday in my job. We have had great turnover in management since I relocated to Idaho in 2012. My coworkers are very helpful and we get along really well. The hardest part of my job as of late, is completing my routines, but it has been a great challenge for me,"
good,"You can come from any walk of life and work at Walmart, very diverse place and a very accepting place. Unfortunately education is very much undervalued here, thus if you have a high education level, don't expect a high pay at retail or DC level."
good,Very busy atmosphere. I learned that people only expect professionalism and courtesy. Respect for the individual is important.
good,"was once the best place to work, now is drudgery personified"
good,I Learned that you got to  try your best and listen I went in I had to learn things on my own work the cash register
good,"Boas pessoas na área de trabalhos."
good,"-Signaler ma présence à ma superviseure."
good,"Print Photos"
good,"overseeing 25 cashiers . deal with lunch breaks ect. dealing with customer returns,cashier,and any other front end problems .made decisions and money handling"
good,"there was never enough associates on the floor, customers use to complain a lot about it, some times even take it out on us. ive been given a job by one manager then get in trouble from another for not being in my department. cash calls were crazy, you get called to cash but leave a mess on the floor and you get in trouble for that. co-workers were always nice i got along with everyone.the hardest part of my job was i knew too much, the more one knows the less they hire. theyll multi-task a person as much as they can but then you get pulled every where by differrnt managers and get in trouble from others the next day for getting the original job done. they need more people or give the part timers more than 12 hours a week"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of stocking, operating the cash register, and typical customer service."
good,A typical day at Walmart is busy. You have to multitask between different positions. I learned to have a lot of patience. The upper  management team could be more hands on and act with a better sense of urgency. The co-workers could be more communicative. The hardest part of the job is being alone to take up on every aspect of the front end. The most enjoyable part of the job is being efficient and pleasing all customers if possible.
good,"Very physically demanding job.  Heavy lifting 7-8 hours, 50+ lbs.  Must maintain 95% weekly productivity."
good,"Okay place to work at. Nice Co-Workers. Good staff. Nice managers, very understanding people. Night shift hours got a bit tedious. Overall good experience."
good,I was able to work the hours and days that I needed to work and worked with many good people.
good,"Wal-Mart preaches ethics that are not followed. They outsource a lot of career advancement requirements. RE: Assessment. That make it very difficult to advance in the company."
good,I started here as a cashier and then went to Customer Service Manager.  I then took over the Fabrics and Crafts department. I worked with customers every day.  I did the ordering for this department as well.
good,"Always willing to work, I am a hard worker. Have great exprience!"
good,not a bad place to work if you need a little money but no career here. They will treat you like dirt and sweep you out the door just the same.
good,Ideal for Part-time Job and for employee taking up Retail Business Courses.
good,its not a bad company to work for i think you can get paid more for your work and should have a better chance of promotions and advancements
good,"In my department, the Tire and Lube Express, we were a family. Everyone would help everyone else out with any issues."
good,Working there was an great experience and I could not as for more or less. I learned that I can resolve a lot a problems with just a smile and an upbeat attitude. Working in the pharmacy was very challenging. Dealing with people medication was no joke. Either the medication would not go threw the insurance or it was just to high I always gave to customer a better solution or solve the problem as quick as i can so they could walk away with a smile.
good,"A company with great profits, but not enough help to service their customer base.  Training was on going and mostly useful, but not enough time to teach others."
good,good people culture i always looked forward to going into work
good,Just come in get ready because it was going to be a long day this was the job I had back in high school management was good very concern team of people. Hardest part of the job was the rush but I never crack under pressure it taught me how to stand strong and be ready for anything
good,"As a department manager my typical day was always filled with much to do (scanning outs, working and binning left over freight, cleaning up leftover cardboard, etc.). I learned a lot about retail in the time I worked there. As far as backroom and sales floor processes, and how to properly stock and maintain a store so customers can find what they need, and safely do so. The management seems to have communication issues from time to time, as well as not always treat all associates and customers they way a manager should. I did however make some good friends out of working there with fellow associates and managers alike. As with any workplace of course the proper treatment varied. Overall I enjoyed working there overall, but the quality of the store I worked for seems to be dipping year by year. Within 3 years more than a handful of managers had either quit, or transfered to another store due to lack of communication and respect from there supervisors. Its a great place to work if you find your particular area in the store you enjoy, and you have a good sense of patience and understanding of the effect stress and a large workload can have on a manager of such a large retail store. Great job security, and great benefits if you stick with the company."
good,Challenging place to work.  Inventory turns so fast that it is hard to keep the store in stock.
good,Not enough workers schedule in a shift. One person is not enough to push all carts for 7 hours
good,I learned to work at a faster pace in a busy work place and how to keep up with higher work demands. I have great co-workers who are helpful and understanding. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet all the different types of customers. People from almost all over the world.
good,I get along with all employees the management like my work ethics
good,The honest only thing i like about my job is all the friends I have made there and I really like working with people. The hardest part of the job is the fact that it is overnights and management doesnt treat you the best.
good,I love the work with the people I worked with and customers. they had a issues with employees coming to work and not giving hours to the employees who did.
good,"Walmart is not the greatest place to work.  They don't treat their employees very well, and there is no room for advancement in the company."
good,"You have the opportunity for advancement. Within two years I advanced to Customer Service Supervisor. Never had the chance to be board. I would come in and immediately check to see where I can effectively place cashiers to minimize customer complaints. I handled any issues that arose whether from customers or team members which included cash handling, pricing, and returns. The hardest part of the job was trying to be in two places at once when you are short handed. In other words; when you are being called at the front to deal with an issue and at the same time you are being called to handle another issue at the back of the store. The best thing I loved about Walmart was seeing satisfied customers and happy cashiers."
good,Busy work environment working in the deli. Alot of additional dutities not initially described in the job description.
good,"Walmart is really ordinary to me because i did it or worked there when i was in my twenties, i mean Thank God for the job but im ready to do something else."
good,"O trabalho exigia um compromisso sério, pois tudo tinha horário certo para ser cumprido, não podia ter atraso. Tive um bom aprendizado com liderança, desempenho profissional, trabalho em equipe. Os colegas de trabalho eram todos profissionais, ajudavam um ao outro. Os gerentes eram parceiro dos seus funcionários, buscava sempre melhorar o setor. A Parte difícil era fazer com que todos os caminhos saíssem no horário certo sem ocorrer atraso. O momentos agradável era a união que todos tinham em motivar um ao outro todos os dias com o grito de guerra que a empresa tem."
good,"Its a fun environment to work in, and all the employees and customers are nice and fun to be around. I learned how to treat every kind of customer and handle every situation I was put in to."
good,Typical day at work I'd come in to the store and put a hairnet on my head and began to work. I would take out boxes out of the freezer and lay out bread on the baking trays the way they were suppose to be done. After that I would put the trays on a tall rack and then put those racks in the refrigerator. After that I would clean up the bread that was outdated and throw it away then I would put almost outdated bread on discount and put it on the discount shelf. I also took cake orders when they cake person wasn't there and then I would write on cakes after the cake person was gone for the day. The hardest part of the job was no interaction with customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was working at Wal-Mart.
good,"It was an okay place to work.  But they wouldn't let me change my position, so I kind of stopped liking the job itself. I liked the customers and my co-workers."
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers."
good,Each day working at walmart can be a challenge depending on the everyone attitude. I learned that a positive attitude can lead to a positive outcome. The most important message of my job is remembering that the customer is always right and the customer must win. The front in cashiers and me as a supervisor are the first people that the customer see when they enter the building and the last people they see when they leave.
good,"Finding expirations dates on all products and when to pull from shelf and destroy.  Learning where all items in store were located.  Management and co-workers were great,  Hardest part or job was destroying food.  Enjoyable part of job was meeting new people daily and helping the customers."
good,"Cashier tendering,cash balance,customer service, processing and or  exchanging merchandise returned from customers, price merchandise,keep inventory control, and more"
good,"Manager made the whole day everyday bad. He never works and was a butt to everybody, Besides that I liked it."
good,Not the best job in the world by a long shot. Very demanding. Also very strict management team
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the fact that we stayed busy, there was always something to do so time went fast."
good,"Good job to gain customer service experience, flexible work hours, quarterly bonuses"
good,"fun, fast, clean and safe, career starters for most. Ask not what walmart can do for you, but what you can do for Walmart."
good,I enjoyed working there. Got to be outside see the customers and greet them before they came in the store
good,It was good for the few first years but they won't give you full time unless you are a manager or higher.
good,making sure floors and the package stock.  i learned how to communicate and be around great professional skill people
good,management could be a little more caring and the co workers were fun and made the day go by faster
good,"Good Company to work for, good health benefits and log term careers"
good,"Stock 2 hr zoon in "
good,"Close to home and good environment to work in. Fair treatment by management, friendly coworkers. I learned a lot about automobile parts and customer service. The hardest part of the job was the physical work; the most enjoyable part was educating customers on the right parts for their automobile."
good,Let me carry 20 air-con without anybody's help. Its more than heavy than my weight.
good,"i did not enjoy working for this company, they do not value their employees"
good,a typical work day for me would be me going in and checking out the customers. I enjoyed checking out the customers.
good,a typical day at work was usually stressful and management was not very helpful and the co-workers I didn't get along with them  didn't have an enjoyable part of the job.
good,They could value their employees more.Busy from start to finish at this place.
good,"Every day at work is a new day, there's always something interesting. I love everyone who I work with."
good,"different work enviroment everyday, run a lean employee ratio compared to number of departments"
good,was taught customer service and able to work in different areas
good,The company has an amazing culture that still holds the values Sam Walton created the company with. There are endless opportunities and areas of interest that a career could hold a future with.
good,Everyday is a busy day also because its a retail store also. Working as part of a team member and doing the right as what the company needs for improvement.
good,A typical day is never dull. Always busy and ready to service its customers.
good,"I got hired to work at a Wal-Mart that was still under construction and I got placed in the shipping/recieviing department. which was fine. But with only two weeks of mediocre training at my job, the person who trained me had left me alone for unknown reasons and I became the one who pretty much ran the department.  Why?"
good,"Pretty busy at times. Learned how to bin items. Good management, they make sure you're doing your job at all times. Co-workers are great, always working. Never have to worry about someone not doing their job. hardest part is during black Friday. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be when you get drive the scissor lift."
good,good places to work but not enough hours work ragne is like 6.30 pm to 10.00pm and what not but it wasn't bad
good,A typical day at Walmart was very busy. While employed at WalMart I learned that it is important to do your job to the best of your abilities because you never know who is watching you daily. The hardest part of this job included customers with very nasty attitudes. The most enjoyable part of my job was fun day with my co-workers and managers. I enjoyed working with majority of my managers but we also had some that would treat us unfair.
good,I actually learned how to take control of your actions working in a fast paced stressful environment. As far as the organization of the entire store it can be managed better on my opinion.
good,"A typical day would be an about average work speed, Not much performance pressure a bit relaxing. Didn't really learn much while working there, job was pretty simple. Very Accepting Co-Workers. no drama. The Hardest Part Of The Job Was During Rush Hours When We Had To Find Ways To Keep Each Member Satisfied. The Most Enjoyable Part Of The Job Was When The Day Was Relaxing And Not So Much Running Around."
good,nice to work and a well maintained environment the manahgers and coworkers are always by your side.
good,"As a Grocery Stocker, I was assigned anywhere between 4-7 pallets to be stocked each night. I, as well as my other team members were often sent into the parking lot to collect carts as well; this task emphasized communication skills since multiple people were needed to return a line of carts. When my assigned tasks were completed it was up to me to ensure that I had other work, this helped me learn how to keep busy."
good,"zoning and setting modules for new apparel."
good,Great learning job ! really helps you with customer service
good,"Easy work, long nights because of hour lunch, laidback people, works with schedule"
good,I felt the store I was at was poorly managed.  I worked at two different stores and neither one was very good.  There is no clear way to move up to assistant manager.  Other companies I have worked for has a test to take and a clear way to apply to new openings.
good,"getting change dealing with customer complaints "
good,"Co-workers were friendly or otherwise didn't really interact. I was a grocery associate and spent most of my time stocking items and organizing. Management wasn't terrible, but they were not very understanding to a college class schedule which in the end is why I had to quit, even as part-time as they would schedule me to work during class times."
good,"Friendly people and supportive Managers, Overall good atmosphere. enjoy interacting with customers."
good,It was a good to job to have to earn extra cash. I enjoyed meeting alot of new people everyday.
good,great people stressful at times yet very good costumer service experience
good,"It was enjoyable, my section wasn't organized and my manager avoided discussing subjects with me"
good,Each day was different and challenging but fun at the same time. I liked my regular customers and the other associates. I made many friends during my time there.
good,"Wipro offer testing services to different client locations, Wal-mart is one of them."
good,"The co-workers at walmart are very friendly and very helpful. You can always count on someone to give you a helping hand."
good,"Correria;"
good,Coworker and managers were rude and not willing to teach new employees
good,"Typical day at work: Constant inbound calls."
good,"a typical day at work involves many different people and requires a lot of multi-tasking and critical thinking, lots of moving parts many daily duties which must be completed by days end. The hardest part of the job would be finding time to complete everything, the most rewarding is the people and partnerships you build."
good,dependable job unloading trucks manual labor requirements overnight stocking good atmosphere
good,Hmp... not much to say honestly. hours were okay... people sucked.
good,"Nice Enviroment, Nice people to work for. Fast and easy to get in & out. Sometimes some workers made me laugh, & some made me mad, But everyone has those kinda days. Alway's stayed busy and productive."
good,All i did was get cart. the people were rude and thought they could push us around since we had the lowest job.
good,"Mostly working on front registers ringing customers up, then later transferred into loss prevention."
good,"Flexible scheduling, easy advancement, good working environment for teenagers. Not really the greatest for supporting a family."
good,"I would start 7pm to 9am. Non stop moving was great. I was the only manager on duty so i was in charge of prioritizing the night. We would receive 2 somtimes 3 trucks a night and i would task out all associates accordingly. I also unloaded trucks used the highlow for the pallets, stocked shelfs, both grocery and gm. Twice a week you worked on a schedule, reviews, coaching for improvments."
good,I can honestly say that I didnt have many problems with this employer
good,"Empresa de grande porte ,mas sem estrutura  fisica e estrutural para os associados"
good,"Typical retail work, basically mainly dealing with customers but for a short amount of time."
good,"Working here wasn't the best experience. It wasn't the worst either. It taught me a lot about myself, and the working conditions I could deal with. The best part of the job were my co-workers, the hardest was constantly being left alone to do everything myself. Overall, it was okay."
good,"ok money but is not somewhere i go back too! management bad, work place ok got to do something new"
good,It was difficult getting use to nights and the work days weren't consistent enough to get into a good routine
good,Me gusto trabajar ahi porque aprendi cosas nuevas como saber utilizar una caja regitradora tener el control de efectivo y el ambiente de trabajo fue bueno
good,I liked my job there and the poeple I worked with.  Just didnt like the shifts
good,"I normally cash out 100 to 200 people in a 4 to 5 hr day. There are disceptancies with management and what to follow or what to wear, or what is allowed at your cashregsiter.  The hardst part of my job is remembering all the codes for differnt produce products and certain I gift cards I sometimes forget how to enter into casg register correctly.I have learned how to run a cash egsiter to 90% of which you should now in one and a half months of part-time work. The most enjoyable part of my job is talking to the customer as I cash them out, assuring their visit was satisfactory and enjoyable"
good,"Working in the Deli, I quickly learned how to come together as a team to get daily jobs taken care of while tending to customers. The management over my area was poor. They never took the time to teach me what I was doing, they completely relied on the staff to do so and if I had a question, I could never find a manager, so I always resorted to asking an associate. My co-workers were friendly and very enjoyable to work with. There wasn't really any part of the job that I could determine to be harder than the rest. It was all fairly even between all the shifts, especially since my co-workers made sure that everyone worked together to get tasks done. I definitely enjoyed the customers more than anything else. They were almost always friendly and excited for their food."
good,"This company was exceptional well to work for in the beginning. However, I soon found out that they were not employee friendly."
good,"The company did have perks. Although it is nearly impossible to get hired on full time, you can't clock out one minute late or you might end up having to talk to the boss about it."
good,"-Fast paced environment"
good,"they are ok, lost someone close to me when I was working there so I could really tell you a lot about them."
good,"Walmart is a good job to start out at, but not to pursue as a career in my opinion."
good,huge customer flow. learned how to manage cash and back room processing. Management was fair for the most part.
good,A typical day at work would be good as long as all the workers did there job with no problems. Ive learned no matter what personal issues you have outside of work you do not take it to work you always have a smile and be palite. Management was okay we had some good managers n we had some bad managers. My coworkers I worked with were good we all were nice joked around with eachother but also made sure our work was done we all(cashiers) helped eachother out with any and everything. The hardest part of being a cashier is dealing with people attitudes coworkers and customers. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning more and new things each day I came in for work. Helping my coworkers(cashiers) and them helping me either with work or personal issues.
good,Walmart and Sam's Club are very team oriented and value visions for growth.
good,Walmart is a place that you think you want to work for but when you get hire you just want to get unhire. The co-worker is good and lunch is the most enjoyable part of job. The hardest part of walmart is trying to get help when your job called for 16 hour and you try to get help but no help.
good,"Wal-Mart makes it difficult to get noticed so you can advance your career. When working there, they reluctantly gave me full time hours under the condition I still not have a set schedule."
good,"chegava no serviço trocava a roupa e batia o cartao."
good,associates work too hard for the money. insurance is too expensive for what they pay. some store managers who don't care about the people who work for them.
good,A typical day at work was to make and pleased the customers. Help them with any questions they had
good,"they really need to learn how to manage people and not play favorites, didnt like to work here at all"
good,I stared in the pet deportment. Then i went to work as a casher.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is pretty smooth. I clock in, attend the daily team meeting if there aren't any special promotions I usually pull out freight and began to stock my department. Once I'm finished in my department I float around and help any other department that looks like they need a hand until the last hour of the shift when everyone is ordered to ""Zone"" or face products and clean up . The Management team on my shift were easy to get along with but always seemed out of the loop when it came to utilizing employees and assets. My co-workers seemed very acceptable to me and easy to get along with. The hardest part of the job was the lack of organization some times on the part of management . The most enjoyable part of the job was the chance to interact with customers I always got a smile out of them or they always got one out of me."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart taught me how to be great time manager. While working as a overnight associate, all stock must be off the floor by 6 a.m., forcing all employees to work efficiently."
good,"Wal-Mart is not a bad place to work, many find the job enjoyable and rewarding. In truth I myself used to find the job quite enjoyable. However in the past three years it has gone from being a great place to work, to being somewhere dreadful to work. Management used to work with you to find out your availability and respect the fact that many of their employees attended school. That is now a thing of the past. Should you submit your limited availability now, the store manager can deny it, which means you will be scheduled anyway. This creates stress and a horrible atmosphere because of the stress, where once an open door policy provided an opportunity to connect with your supervisors to solve problems it has now become a revolving door of complaints and stressful conversations. "
good,Enjoy the atmosphere of diversity...probably more diverse than most stores with a cultural variety...some managers need interpersonal skills training but overall good team
good,"the store is very hectic during the holidays but it teaches you how to deal with different customers and different aspects in the work place i.e jewelry, fitting room, stock and cashier"
good,Enjoyed meeting people daily. Assisted the customers with customer service and ringing up their purchases.
good,It was an okay company to work for. There is chances for advancement.  They can be too many politics and it can feel like you are in high school.  But for the most part I enjoyed my job and learning all the things that I have learned while I was there.
good,"typical day was to go in set up task management, have a meeting with all associates to focus on daily tasks."
good,I worked Mid-night shift stocking shelves and ran register when needed.
good,I loved having the same schedule every week. The most important skill i took from this job was providing the best customer service.
good,The company is a busy company with hard workers all around.  The management and the associates work hard.
good,Working at Walmart there is never a dull moment because they are always busy. There was always something to do and a lot of people to meet and greet. Working n the cash register was easy and I always kept my line down because I moved quickly.
good,Fun place to work at with co-works that make the day better and faster.
good,Cashier wal-mart was a good place to work for love meeting now people the management there was okay at the time wal-mart is a good place to move up in quick
good,Working for wal mart was stressful. the co workers were very respectful and fun to work with. The hardest part about the job was working in fast and unsafe environment. The enjoyable part about the job was getting paid.
good,"I am a customer service representative that provides customer service, assists with stocking and zoning, which consists of maintaining the appearance of the aisles.  I also help with the unloading of trucks, separating freight to the respective departments and an inventory associate, which consists of inventory counting, inventory labeling and prepping, and stocking."
good,I worked here for almost two years all together and I loved going to work. Knowing I would be able to spend my day helping someone else always meant a lot to me.
good,Very buisy from the get go.  I learned how to manage several different people.  Good management.  The people
good,Walmart is not going anywhere any time soon.  You will have a good chance with promotion.  If your willing to work long hours and long work weeks you can get promoted with this company.
good,"My typical day at work consists of stocking, maintenance,  carry-outs, unloading truck, re-setting mods using the necessary equipment, and keeping the parking lot clear of carts. I have learned how to manage my time effectively and how to communicate with my fellow associates and superiors in order to complete a task efficiently. Management at Wal-Mart seems to have a high turnover rate, but the managers that stick around are consistent with their expectations of me. My co-workers are in similar positions as me, but rely on me to help them get their jobs done. The hardest part of my job is working in extreme weather conditions outdoors. The easiest part of my job is dealing with customers."
good,"Loved having my own department to care for and helping customers find everything they needed. Enjoyed the variety of taking care of a department, customer service and running a cash register. It was a very fast paced and enjoyable environment."
good,As you know working at ANY Walmart can be a tough job. Especially as a cashier. Co-workers weren't very social or helpful and mostly only cared about themselves.
good,I would go into the office and balance the room and then start counting the cashiers bags.  I learned to be accurate at what I did.  I got along with management and my co-workers.  The hardest part was holiday seasons.  I enjoyed being able to handle such an important job with expertise.
good,"a typical day included stocking shelves, talking with other employees and dealing with customers. there really isn't anything too complicated with this job, as long as you don't mind working with customers who will literally ask anything"
good,"A typical day for me is opening the shop at 7 a.m. (provided that I can find a manager available to come unlock the doors on time, which in most cases very difficult) sometimes there are customers waiting and the day can begin at a fast pace right away. Through out the day I change oil, tires, and batteries. Along with performing flat repairs, tire rotations, fuel injections and also writing up vehicles for customers or helping them order the right tires. In between servicing vehicles the shop is cleaned and tools are put in their proper places along with removing used tires and batteries and putting them outside in the correct cages (as long as we can get in contact with a manager to come unlock the cages which rarely happens as it should, a lot of the time we are left waiting all day for them not to show up.) Management, in all honesty could use a lot of work. There isn't a lot of structure or planning with them and most of the time they ask for 5 different tasks to be done at once, including working in completely different departments instead of the assigned area. Also it seems that they forget that there is a Tire and Lube department at my store, which has led to a lot of stress and issues. The hardest part of the job would have to be, dealing with management because as I have said more structure is needed. The most enjoyable part is working with my co-workers, everyone seems to get along well and works hard together."
good,"If you're in a pinch and need a job, your local Walmart may have a job for you, but you won't want to stay long."
good,great place to be a job that you can always prosper in surrounded by great people
good,Walmart is a good company to work for and gives you many opportunities for advancement. Most co-workers are great to work with. The hardest part of the job and also the most frustrating is trying to keep fresh product on the shelve while payroll hours keep getting cut but management expects the same production and quality levels.
good,"We were always short handed so I was willing to learn as many departments as possible to fill in. Even though I my position was Cashier for both regular and tobacco registers, I was secondary Customer Service Desk, Store zoner, cart pusher, threw freight, covered Electronics and sporting goods. I assisted in closing down registers in the whole store at night. This IS a typical day. I love being versatile. It makes me feel good knowing they can put me just about anywhere and I know how to do it. The only reason I was not allowed to advance is because I had relatives working the same area as I. Some Management took to me very well."
good,"The job itself isn't the greatest, however the people are amazing. My co-workers made the day enjoyable. We all were able to joke around and laugh about our work situations. Even managment would chime in on occasion."
good,"I definitely learned how to handle unpleasant customers at walmart. However, I did gain plenty of customer service experience while working there."
good,"helped customers, checked items in, helped customers when needed, great coworkers,"
good,"In my opinion, there is nothing majorly wrong with working at Wal-Mart. I don't dread going to work everyday. Basically my work day consists of cashing people out, and helping customers out when they need it. I've learned to be more patient with people, the hardest part of the job is when it is very busy and lines are just never-ending. But even that I really don't mind. I like working with people the most."
good,"Can be a little overwhelming and stressful at times."
good,"put food in a container "
good,"Wlamart is a good company that provides good benefits for its associates. Walmart maintains high standards in customer service and associate appreciation. As a member of management, I enjoy the great work schedule."
good,"Provided customer service in a deli while maintaining, operating, and cleaning equipment in a fast-paced, highly regulated environment. Working here taught me a lot about food safety and further strengthened team work with a diverse field of co-workers."
good,"Very fast pass, several things need to be done in the day. This help me to manage my time better to get everything done. Co-workers help each other out to get the task down. Did ordering, maintained inventory levels, set mods. I enjoyed setting mods the most."
good,"Working cash and stock."
good,it was a fun fast and not that hard of a job it just was not for me
good,aprendi mucho sobre hacer caja cuadrar y eso a socializar con la gente.
good,"I believe there is a lot changes to be made, like the fact they take the lower paid employees and put them on jobs that the higher paid people get paid to day and our pay stays the same. It just stays the same untill we get out of our job titles."
good,"You learn leadership and the importance of being on time. It's a great step before college or just after college while looking for the job of your chosen field. It's quite relaxed throughout the slow periods of work. You do have deadlines that must be met and when it starts to pick up it's non stop your whole shift. You must take care of a large section of the store mostly alone as well as cover other departments when asked to. There is a lot of drama but that happens in retail for the most part. The money is quite poor for the amount of work you actually do and the amount of money you create for that particular business. The hours are steady and the benefits are quite well."
good,Working at Walmart gave me a great oppertunity to learn a lot of new things I did not work on the sales floor of walmart but the shop was part of the store. The best part of my job was the customer service and being involved with working in the shop it's self .
good,"stocking easy, learned alot, great co workers,  stocking.  unloading trucks, inventory. learned inventory and about  walmart"
good,"i had some issues with the paying system, angry customers, squaking coworkers, and crazy people."
good,"Retailer- Worked service desk and as a cashier. Handled disgruntled customers, returns and managed cashiers."
good,"I like the work that I do. I just don't like the management staff. They don't treat you like they want you there. They don't give recognition and they don't show you that you matter or help you get better in your career."
good,"Very fast paced"
good,This is a good part time job... great management and co workers
good,"Ganhei experiência com vendas."
good,I liked working here but once summer came to a end. they cut your hours an pay back.
good,"I was hired to work in apparel, which involved hanging up, putting away and folding clothes. As well as helping any customers with finding an item or resolving an issue they had; if a customer was looking for an item I would walk them to where the item was located to ensure they were given the best customer service possible. When the front registers would get busy I asked to be register trained so I could help out; I was trained on registers and would go up whenever needed as well as maintain my area. After I got register trained when electronics would get busy and only had one person working there, they would come and pull me from my area so I could help them, than I would still finish all my own work before I was off."
good,Stocked merchandise and helped customers. co-workers are all good people and work hard. Management is good and works with you with any issues that might come up.
good,"A typical day involves planning, goal execution, customer care and employee relations. I have learned to disassociate feelings from the varied circumstances within the day and not take action or comments personally. There is always that one co-worker or member of management that excel at bringing out the best in you and spending time with them can make a world of difference in the work environment. The hardest part of the job is that It is very stressful, labor intensive and mentally exhausting. The ability to interact with a lot of people a day, and have the opportunity of making their day a little better is always rewarding."
good,A typical day entailed of just standing at a register with lines of people checking out. The hardest part of the job was not being able to move. The most enjoyable was being able to help people when they needed it!
good,"Work involves getting product onto shelves and spotting merchandising opportunities. Always adhering to Walmart safety policies,keeping a clean work area, modular integrity and zoning."
good,Wal-Mart was a decent place to work at overall. There is chance for advancement and extra hours are given if needed.
good,Pretty much take care of customer through check-out. Provide customer service while following company guidelines.
good,"I start my shift by cleaning and providing all supplies neede in all washroom , then I clean all trashcans of all content and provide new plastic on it and then I clean the associate lunch room and clean whatever areas in the store that needs my services . I've learned that cleanliness is one of the factors that customers like when they shop. we also have a healty relationship with management , we can talk to them easily.the hardest part of the job is during winter were everybody who comes in is wet . and the rewarding part iswhen after youshift you go home laeving the store clean"
good,"Personally, I loved working at walmart. It was my first job in high school and is still a job that I hold every summer when I go back home. I loved the interaction with the people of various backgrounds. I just hated how inefficient management was."
good,A typical day is putting out items. Management is indecisive I was told to do multiple things by different managers. I loved working with my co workers they were fun to work with.
good,"I start the day by having a meeting with store manager. He gives us notes to complete for the day. Then I walk my pad as well as my partner's pad with the ZMS and dept. managers and give them my notes to complete during the day."
good,It is a great place to work if you are looking for a career in retail.
good,There are plenty of room for advancement. The pay wasn't all that great for the kind of work you had to do.
good,"-Maintaining registers, cleaning areas of store, zoning ,etc."
good,"Management needs improvement, scheduling needs improvement co workers easy to work with."
good,High volume retail pharmacy focused on providing quality service at a low price
good,Loved the schedule that I worked I enjoyed working with the people that I worked with
good,"What I learned from my job is that I excel in  the office field."
good,"-very busy"
good,"cashier, helping customers with daily needs. cleaning and restocking. good team work"
good,hard work co- works great management ok. it a job for a yong man
good,"Cashier, Wal-Mart, Boca Raton. FL"
good,"very unorganized, I often was working in many different departments."
good,this job was very busy and always something to do. the management team was not very involved and often had attitudes
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing the products that I'am shipping will be used in  many stores
good,"A typical day would be busy. There are always plenty of costumers to service and help. There are many duties to perform such as working the register, helping customers return merchandise, and keeping the store neat and tidy."
good,Management need to communicant better. Co-workers are ok.
good,"It was a temporary job for the end of the year, we work hard and we had opportunity to meet people or even see the positives of the company. Only work at that time."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"Great physical stimulation, customer interaction accessability"
good,"Management was hard on employees, company was always willing to help employees once someone would actively listen."
good,got to meet new people get to know each matter had a great work enviroment
good,"Fast pace environment, you meet new people everyday, nice managers and coworkers"
good,"I worked with great people on the graveyard shift. the job was boring and tedious, but the coworkers knew how to have fun while getting the job done. only problem it is a minimum wage job, something to hold until a real job became available"
good,"nao tenho o q falar de mal gostei do tempo q passei lá"
good,"On a typical night we are each assigned separate aisles of the grocery.  We try to finish stocking before 2am (lunch time).  To help speed up the process, we assist other workers.  I have learned, when trying to beat the clock, team work is the key to success. Our managers are good people.  They don't over push us and they understand how hard we all work.  My co-workers are all very positive and willing to help.  We work overnight so we feel each others pain if we didn't get enough rest that day.  The hardest part of this job is the overnight hours and the little pay.  Trying to finish in time with a small crew is also difficult. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to purchase anything during breaks or lunch from the store after hours."
good,"good place to work, but could be better with the customer service, the managers are not all that great and rather play on there phone then do there job. i would rather shop at coventry 24 hour walmart or work there."
good,Company was helpful for the community.  The pay was not good and team spirit wasn't there.
good,wal mart is okay. management could use training.a typical day of work was long and harsh.
good,it is a large company with large company values. They really try to go by the book for employees
good,Getting the experience you will love just by work in an environment that is lovable.
good,"I loved working in Human Resources and helping our Associates with their benefits, payroll, orientations and just being there when they needed support. The hardest part of the job was being a liasion between Management and Associates when I could see the Associates side clearly. The most enjoyable part of the job was to work out on the floor at Christmas time helping customers."
good,More to do than is possible with the staff on hand. Always fighting a losing battle.
good,"Sorting out items and making sure they go to the right places."
good,"We worked hard and non stop for the assignment, without the perks."
good,loved seeing the same faces all the time and being able to meet/greet.
good,"A typical day would be starting a shift by walking on the sales floor engaging sales associates, making sure the anti theft devices are in place in high shrink departments. Then again you may investigate suspicious behavior involving employees and / or customers. You may spend some considerable amount of time reviewing video about         s involving customers or employees or those requested by Law Enforcement viz a viz , money laundering, check fraud.  Co-workers are supportive. Hardest part is getting suspects to cooperate and the most enjoyable part is the satisfaction of making a difference and being recognized by supervisors."
good,"I would clock in and report to my assigned checkout lane. I learned more job duties, such as stocking and customer service. I also learned to perform parking lot maintenance. The hardest part was dealing with unhappy customers that were convinced an error was performed on your calculation end. The most enjoyable part was interacting with numerous cultures and people."
good,"we would have to do counts inventory and set up for the truck at the end of our shift. management was fair. some of the co-workers there were very rude and would say rude things to others about you in front of you. the hardest part was setting up for the truck moving the heavy pallets. most enjoyable part was doing the counts and inventory,"
good,"Good work environment"
good,I always started off with a great group of people to work with including customers.
good,"It has flexible hours."
good,The work was repetitive and when there was not a car to work on I had not problems finding other work to do around the shop to keep myself busy.
good,This was a great job but the hours did not benefit myself or my family
good,Retail. NO Training was given to me whatsoever before my first night on the job. Stockers are expected to already be able to just haul heavy pallets of store product in a limited amount of time.
good,Working in a supercenter gives you many different areas to learn and advance in. Typically a day would consist of putting out new merchandise and assisting customers with purchasing decisions. I would have a mixed bag of co-workers and by that I mean some that had strong work ethics and others that was more poor. Management in Walmart will change after a certain amount of time so the caliber of management would change frequently so I would have to deal with many styles of leaderships and attitudes. When I first started working for the company the constant change in leadership and in changes in expectations was a little difficult at first but it helped me handle change to now I see that as a strength that I can adapt to new and changing areas in my work. The most enjoyable part of the job I would have to say is working with customers and having them leaving satisfied and even helping the customers who may have had a bad experience or are upset and helping to fix and resolve the issue.
good,Working at Walmart is a ok job if you are still in college orr still staying at home with parents
good,"arrumação de matérias para aula, digitação de aulas, impressão de provas, boletins, atendimento direto ao publico.."
good,"Show up to work we wouldn't have a pacific job to do. Managers run around trying to give people task. The store was not open at the time so they send us to different Wal-Mart's to work and learn things, but we were taught nothing."
good,"I would start my day with checking with my boss or the computer to see if I had and task for the day. If I had task I would have to do those jobs before I could start anything else, because they had a deadline. My task could be help unloading trucks, answering the phone or doing returns. Most of my days was helping customers and zoning my area."
good,"it is a good job. loved my coworkers. busy at times, but enjoyable."
good,"I learned a lot at Wal-Mart as far as how to be productive. Learned how to operated a cash register, stock shelves with food and non-food items, and to use a telezon and printer for printing labels in backroom. Ability to work as a team and independently when working on tasks."
good,"This job gives a great starting place and puts in place the stepping stones to working towards greater things but not too much else. Management was mediocre at best most of them avoided doing work as much as possible and hid away in their office and avoided conflict. There was little to no advancement opportunities, very little of the time the positions would be awarded to the person that sucked up to management the most and not to the person that deserves the position the most. In the end it's a job that I would not recommend to anyone that is looking for a stable job, but it is a decent starting place."
good,I was thrown into a whirlwind of work I didn't know how to do and no one to teach me.
good,"worked most departments of the store at one point or another, helping out. Co workers and Job Culture were really good. Everyone is a family. Manangers were ok, they tried hard. Job was simple, when you could avoid the corporate stuff."
good,"Great company, but looking to expand my experience in the outside world beyond Walmart."
good,"go to work"
good,Regular worplace great benefits good hard working people good hours
good,"Part time opportunies available.  I worked there. What can I say, I worked there."
good,Hard to advance but overall not a bad retail job. I work in customer service.
good,"Collecting carts, great but tough first job.  I got along with coworkers, hardest part was working in the sun."
good,Walmart was my first experience with being a people greeter at first I didn't get it right but after making some mistakes I got alot better at my  job. It was always fun catching people with unpaid merchandise and of course I always made sure they went back and paid if they were gonna take it with them. I loved my job but they let me go since work was only for the holidays.
good,"Being a cashier was very straight forward, however, customers and management could be the source of a lot of stress."
good,"	Executed daily operations of inventory control."
good,"on a typical day i would work in produce, making sure products were kept fully stocked and and culled before there expiry date. "
good,set up store from an empty building to stock shelves for opening day
good,Walmart changed over the years.  Use to be a great place to work but they have changed the way they do things and stopped caring about their associates.
good,you could have a great experience or a terrible one all really depends on the management
good,"A typical day at work is usually 7.5 to 8hrs. completing task that are assigned to you from upper management. these things include zoning the department (straightening everything out on the shelves, making items visible for the costumer neatly). Reshop the department (picking up all items in the department that don't belong along with going to the costumer service desk to retrieve items that costumers didn't purchase from the department you are in). The hardest part of the job would be to maintain the entire department by yourself along with completing the assigned task. The enjoyable part is there are always opportunities to move up in managing."
good,"Busy environment"
good,"-learned how to deal with customers"
good,needed to pay workers more liked co workers. Came in  and started helping customers with what they wanted
good,Realmente es fácil trabajar en el Sam´s siempre y cuando te guste el trabajo bajo presión aquí nadie se mete contigo si te dedicas a realizar bien tu  trabajo.
good,Just your basic run of the mill retail store. A typical day involves doing your position specific duties along with assisting customers. It's an easy place to go in do your job and go home. Good work for first time job seekers.
good,Required excellent customer service and a high paced energy. I learned about the art of versatility. The hardest part of that job was never knowing when you were going to be scheduled.
good,"basically you're standing in a 2 foot square area dragging items from one end of a table to the inside of a bag. too many rednecks for my tastes, but that's just the area i live in. Towards the end of my stay at Walmart, I got a little mad as there was a flyer up over the clock in station telling the cashiers not to talk to one another when there was down time, but no one really followed that rule"
good,I held the position as an Assistant Manager for Walmart.  I left because I was working over sixty plus hours.
good,"learned how to use power lifting equipment"
good,Nice place to work happy I'm not there anymore enjoyed being a cashier
good,lots of work with little compensation and management is horrible at scheduling
good,"Worked with wonderful people who helped you when you needed it, the hardest part was dealing with rush hours and stocking before your shift ended"
good,"At my Wal-mart, some of my managers were indecisive on certain matters. They also seemed to disagree with one another on certain policies."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was everyday interactions with customers.
good,"I've been working at Walmart for a year now, and I've been able to put up with all that I have to deal with there. The customers are very angry all the time, but that isn't the only thing that makes the job negative. The management is horrible, and they always have attitudes. Everything bothers them, it's almost as if they do not want to work. Between the rudeness of the customers and the rudeness of the managers, it is a very unlikeable job. I am a very positive person so I want my next job to be in a positive environment. I want to be able to look forward to going to work, so at this point I just want to experience something different."
good,It was means to an end. It allowed me to prepare for the next step in my life.
good,"I worked there for a year and a half or so.."
good,"Fun environment, employees and management are cool to be around"
good,"Geralmente como trabalhava numa Transportadora que faz parte do Grupo Wal Mart. Os dias eram dedicados a descarga de veículos, entregas das mercadorias no Padrão Wal Mart... tínhamos que garantir o nosso nível de serviço na Entregas das Mercadorias no seu dia Previsto. Aprendi que Empresa vive de Resultados e bons...qualidade no serviço operacional e faltar qualidade no atendimento ao cliente/fornecedor. A direção/Gerência, elaboravam reuniões semanais e discutíamos os prós e contras do nosso dia a dia com total liberdade e respeito. Aos Colegas de trabalho, engajados, disciplinados e determinados no objetivo comum. A parte mais difícil....Queda nas vendas, baixa movimentação de mercadorias.  A parte mais agradável... épocas sazonais, onde podemos ver e sentir as vendas em alta."
good,"I really enjoyed my job, Hours were never a problem to get. Coworkers were great."
good,To service customers with their items and help them find product in the stores.
good,Worked with parents and children in the toy department. I also assisted managers on an everyday basis.
good,"A typical day at work usually consists of checking in with a manager, cleaning off my register and the area around and taking customers. It's usually a calm, stress free environment. I learned customer service and how to handle customers issues with a calm and friendly attitude. I also learned how to handle money and work in a fast pace environment. I have always gotten along with all of my co-workers, if there is an issue it is usually very easily and quickly resolved. The hardest part of the job was probably having to deal with situations where a manager hadn't fulfilled their job (or even a managers attitude) and having to pick up any slack. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with the customers, especially the repeat customers. I also enjoy the people I work with and most of my immediate supervisors are great to work with."
good,"Working here was harder than i thought it was going to be. "
good,Honestly the job was not bad at all the only negative thing i have to say is that the managers and supervisors were unprofessional
good,The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to train new employees  to move up in the company and see them grow
good,My day was spent mostly on the register or in Customer Service doing returns and exchanges. Walmarts scheduling was not employee focused.  Alot of standing during the shift.  Prior knowledge of store sales.
good,como dice el titulo fue un trabajo corto ya que fui a hacer unas suplencias. me gusto ya que aprendí como repositor
good,"Great for anyone looking to gain a lot of different kinds of experience, if you have an open mind, ask a lot of questions and become close with management you will learn a lot. My downfall was that I need growth opportunity, and not in the 5-10 year 1 promotion kind of growth, but rapid growth. Walmart does not offer that."
good,long days  management was worried about production   a lot of heavy lifting
good,"keeping a clean and safe work environment, help customers find what they need, managing and selling guns and ammunition, register, and working stock."
good,"I enjoyed greeting customers and answering their questions but most of the time it was just standing around and making sure nobody stole anything. Some people may enjoy that job better than I do, but I like moving around a lot and doing something more productive."
good,I loved this job and made it a career in a way.  I basically enjoyed my co-workers and some of the managers.  Most enjoyable was helping with photo lab needs. The hardest part of the job was having a member of management tell you to do something and another member of management would get mad and tell you not to what the first member of management told you to do -  the left hand did not know what the right hand was doing in management.
good,"Can be very chaotic, gets very very busy most of the time.  I have learned to keep calm, especially dealing with an irate person.  Most of my coworkers are great.  Management can be very difficult to deal with at this store, cut our hours and the customers are not satisfied as we have 27 registers and want to know why there are only 3 open.  Hours are cut, and it is the customer who is paying for it.  No hours is the hardest part of the job.  Working with the great crew at the service desk is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,it is a good starter job but hard to make a living there unless you are management
good,Walmart is a descent company to work for. They will hire based on demand but will not promote or change an employee's position in the company unless there is a demand for it.
good,"Loved it for 20 years, hated it the last 7.  I enjoyed the challenges but once the company started hiring so many people from the outside who never understood Sam's vision it went down hill fast.  It was very unfortunate to say the least.  He was an amazing leader.  He would be said to see his company was run by lawyers and those at store level are not listened to any longer.  He actually wrote in his book that when this happened he would no longer want to work there himself.  A great leader and prophet."
good,"I enjoyed working there, I like working with people as a team."
good,A typical day at work would be moving from location to location to get the job done.
good,Had several fun jobs at wal mart but the pay is lacking and the constant management and procedure changes makes for a stressful and sometimes difficult job.
good,"It was my first job, and I was there a while, but I would never go back. It wasn't that bad when I was there, but it's went to hell in a handbasket in the past few years. Management is horrible. They cut hours on full time employees. There are never any registers open, even on very busy days, lines are always backed up. I hate shopping there now."
good,Not hard work at all. Great people to work with. Some days could get tough but its manageable.
good,"I was able to get a lot of experience working with different kinds of people, from the nicest, to the rudest. Everyday you would have to deal with a situation that was unpleasant, but overall working at Walmart was something I enjoyed. The hardest part of working there was dealing the rude customers. I would close fitting rooms at 10 and customers felt that cause it was a 24 hour store, they had the right to use them, people would be sneaky and try slipping in the dressing rooms. All you can do is be polite and tell them your sorry but not to undress in public and to come back within the dressing room hours of operation."
good,"My coworkers and I got along relatively well, the problem lied within management who expected us to act as robots despite me having been reported by many customers as one of the fastest and friendliest cashiers they had ever come in contact with. The most enjoyable part of my day was the interaction with most of my customers."
good,"I Enjoy Interacting with the customers. I like helping them with whatever they need. Happy when they are liking their shopping experience and the prices they get. Keeping the store clean and stocked for the customers so they can find what they are looking for."
good,"I love working retail jobs, Being able to satisfy customers and making sure they get what they need. Im a very fast efficient hard worker with a great work ethic I do everything I can do to make a huge impact on the company."
good,A typical day is having management request tasks before any previous tasks are complete. I learned to do all that I can do as soon as possible.  Learned that no one is super man or woman.  Wal-Mart Management always expecting but not participating in keeping up with all the tasks needed.  The co-workers are all so tired and wishing they could have qualified for a better or different job.  The hardest part of the job is knowing who the problems are and yet not being able to show the solutions.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help customers when needed.  Being able to complete a task with out interruption from management.
good,great place to work while in school. Co- workers and the customers kept me here due to the fact its located near many neighborhoods and schools.
good,"My day begins at 7am. Usually there are two other assistant managers, and the store manager who tours the entire store with myself. We look for roughly several things. Overall cleanliness, whether we have enough products on the counters, if pricing is correct, if sale items are properly displayed so that customers can compare pricing, are a few of the basic areas of focus during the tours. We make notes of things that need addressing both on the sales floor and the back room. Each assistant has an hourly assistant. I usually meet with that assistant so that we can plan ways to complete daily task in addition to any extra task that the store manager needs. We assign these task to various associates, and follow up with them throughout the day. I spend several hours handling administrative items, and customer complaints. Also I plan, with the help of the rest of our team, how to merchandise items to gain maximum sales. This is a quick overview of my typical day as an assistant manager at Wal-Mart."
good,I learned how to manage my time to achieve goals. Management was always willing to let me learn new areas to expand my experience. Enjoyed working with everyone at the job.
good,"I worked overnight from 10pm to 7am, i swept, scrubbed, buffed & waxed floors. The best part of the job, i did have fun with my co-workers. The hardest part of the job, i didn't like the hours. I learned how to be a team player."
good,"For the most part, the job was pretty easy.  The hardest part of the day was unloading the truck in a good time.  After that task was finished the rest of the work was very easy.  I enjoyed my co-workers the most.  They made the day easier to get thru."
good,I unloaded trucks and keep the backroom clean and organize.Did back hauls with the fork lift and lead my team. controlled my dept and order what i needed for the dept and controlled my sells
good,Working on an assembly line was very fun and eventful. my co workers were always great.
good,putting a smile on peoples face everyday was the goal and it was an enjoyable environment to be around for the most part
good,"bueno un dia tipico en el departamento era trabajar bajo precion, siempre revisando la seguridad alimentaria ya que el departamento donde me encontraba era de perecederos, aprendi mucho sobre la administracion de alimentos, asi como las temperaturas, contaminaciones, riesgos, productividad del area misma, la gerencia era buena solo por el subgerente de perecederos que no sabia ni donde estaba parado, mis colegas muy buenos siempre ayudando en todo momento asi como siempre les ayudaba cuando necesitaban saber algo, la parte mas dificil del trabajo eran las revisiones de seguridad alimentaria y en parte un poco los inventarios ya que eran demaciados codigos para introducir, lo que mas me gusto del trabajo fue que subi rapido de puesto, me gustaba hacer los inventarios y las revisiones de seguridad."
good,"Interesting workplace; opportunity for advancement"
good,"Good environment and good place to work. Not always the best days tho. Depends on location of store and experience of leadership, from market level down!"
good,"A typical day at work involves consistent customer service, shipping/receiving, inventory control, and general maintenance. "
good,I enjoy working for walmart the people are helpful. its a fasted pace and time flies when working
good,"I personally love the store that I work at, I have never seen the ""team"" play like I do here. Although I am in the pharmacy, we also have duties on the floor to help the work load of other workers. "
good,"Great company room to move up in the company, Good discount, Pay could be better"
good,"Overall a pretty decent job, I learned a lot about working with all different kinds of people. The hardest part would be getting used to the job but once you do its smooth sailing"
good,"Not much to say, but had a semi good experience until the managers put a lot of pressure into their employees and not giving too many hours."
good,The ultimate retail experience. Each day was guaranteed to be different. Learned a lot about the retail world. Enjoyed the many different people I got to know as co-workers through the years of my employment.
good,"I found this to be a great place to work while I was in school. Management was easy to get along with, but quite hard to deal with at times."
good,good company to work for because of the benefits and the great team effort .
good,"I personally was in the management program and was learning a lot about how everything worked as well as how to implement new ideas, for me this was fun.  I enjoy being challenged everyday when I go into work.  However, on the other hand I know that there are parts of the job that are tedious and repetitive.  "
good,Very nice workplace. If your not looking for a life time career.
good,Overall walmart is a wonderful place to work especially if your looking forward to meeting new people and learning new things
good,very busy all the time. made the time go by fast and I got to work with people witch I love.
good,Maintained store inventory by unloading merchandise from trucks.
good,My job consisted of plant care and customer service. Unfortunately I had to move to Spokane and was only there for a very short period of time.  The hardest part of the job was being required to take breaks.  I am not used to having to take a 15 minute break after working only 3 hours and unfortunately was not there long enough to adjust.
good,A typical day at work consist of a hard working fast paced environment with a focus on serving my customers whether it be baking bread and donuts or making a cake for them. the co workers are great and fun to work with and always work as a team to meet our objective. I think our management needs some work they dont treat associates with respect and dont care about associate needs. Also there is to much managers telling you different things and there is no consistency in what they are telling you. the most enjoyable part of my job is seeing the smile on my customers and knowing that i satisfied them.
good,This job gave me the essential tools you need to interact with customers daily and how to provide excellent customer service to a high volume of customers.
good,A typical day at Walmart is very fast paced no matter which job title you have.
good,its a job nothing to exciting about it. black friday got crazy
good,"Open department in mornings, do assigned task, on time."
good,"This is a very easy job. I'm comfortable working here, however, I have no health benefits and the salary is too low."
good,"Prioritizing and managing deadlines."
good,"Nice place, Nice people, opportunity to advance... How much more do I need to write before I can move on to the next screen?"
good,"They seem to promise the world, but only half deliver. I learned many things, but was led on for long periods of time with promotions, and unfulfilled promises."
good,"A typical day would be to grab the pulls from the back and push the product to the floor, clean and zone the departments throughout the shift and help guests. The hardest part of the job was having to solve conflicts and problems with customers, there was sometimes even actual fights right before your eyes. The most enjoyable part of the job was that we had long breaks. My coworkers were friendly and all had an open mind and would befriend anyone."
good,"A typical day at work will be clocking in greeting the associates as well the customers make sure everything is in place in order to have a good work environment. Speak with management to see if they have any task for me to do. Making sure my co-workers are getting their breaks and lunches on time. Training new associates if we have any at the time. Sometimes the hardest part of the job is when the rush comes in and we get busy and not have enough cashiers then we must figure out what we can do to eliminate long lines and unsatisfied customers. Best part of the job is when we all come together and work as a team, team work always makes it a good place to work !"
good,loved helping the customers my co-workers were friendly management was ok
good,"Wal-Mart is a huge company. However, it seemed liked no matter which one I worked at there were never enough people to take care of everything. We would lose people and they would not get replaced, you just had more to do. I did enjoy that I always had something to do and my managers trusted me to help out with more supervisor jobs so that spiced things up for me. I did not like that some nights I would spend more time in other departments and on the register as compared to my own. I would have to scramble to get it cleaned and looking well before I left."
good,A typical day at work would usually involve me organizing the left over freight/merchandise from the overnight stocking. All while maintaining a crew of 4-5 people to maintain item stock accuracy. The position I held was one of the toughest in the store and I was one of the few that did a great job and held the position. I worked with several managers and other supervisors and was  well liked by all my co-workers and management. The hardest part of my job was figuring out how to organize the backroom to help maintain merchandise and ensure it was ready for the unloading process. Honestly the most enjoyable part of my job was helping other employees with work related problems and helping customers on the sales floor.
good,The managers were great they had an open door policy that actually worked. The rate of pay wasn't the greatest.
good,put up stock work all part of the store. cashier everywhere help anyone that need it.
good,"What I've learned from being at Walmart for the past six years is how to be a better person.  I have grown in my work ethics, customer service and how to work well with others and management."
good,"-Receiving shipments, stocking items on shelves, cleaning store, and building displays was a typical work day"
good,I met some wonderful people working there. I got along with my co-workers and the people that I had met when I went to orientation. I didn't mind having to stand because it was no big deal. When I worked there it was during December so it would get pretty cold on whichever end you were at.
good,"Great quarterly bonus,flexible hours/shifts.Wonderful benefits,personal /vac time."
good,Duties included: Manage 20-50 Associates on a daily basis. reports; brinks bank deposit; customer service; checking in warehouse; inventory control; training of new associates; hiring and terminating of associates; scheduling for my specific departments; ordering of product for store. Over see the entire store on a daily basis when working. Main Department to oversee was the Electronics/ AT&T Connection center
good,"Fun but not my type of work, Overnight is to wild, so to speak."
good,was pretty good place to work overall. co-workers were always friendly and general atmosphere was good
good,"Working with co-workers made working as a team awesome. Group assignments were done faster and more efficient. Hardest part of the job was dealing with upset customers, trying hard to please the customers. Manangers were decent not too respectful to other employees."
good,"Fun environment to work in. Managers choose favorites, which is a downfall. The company seems unorganized."
good,"Nice to work meed a lot people and learn a few things,I have good coworkers."
good,I loved being a cashier. It was a great experience and I'd love to more of it.
good,"Personel constantly gave me shifts while i was at school. It became a problem and when I spok to the lady about it, she called me liar."
good,"I liked the routine and the fact that your shift passes quickly. You don't have time for any clock staring. My co-workers were weird but entertaining. Management will occasionally stick their necks out to try to help you but generally they shove too much work on their best employees and leave the lazy ones alone to be lazy which brings down morale and production while raising stress levels. The hardest part of the job is learning to deal with overbearing managers who are concerned about their jobs not yours, and being stuck on an aisle you absolutely hate."
good,"you work from the time you clock in until time to go home and sometimes you work late just to complete your task. the managers are always rushing you to hurry, co-workers are great hard working, the hardest part of the job is going up and down the ladder and working the cold sections, the best part of the job is when no one brings a lot of backstock to be binned in"
good,Poor management and didn't seem to care much about their employees.
good,Wal-Mart gave me the opportunity to learn how to manage work production. Also to gain skills in areas I lacked. It was an experience to keep up with the demand of a retail company such as Wal-Mart. At the same time it was rewarding personally.
good,I worked on the line and basically just did general labour work
good,"Very demanding, high prescription volume, retail pharmacy."
good,I learned that I can have a lot of patience during the toughest moments.
good,"A typical day at Walmart is never boring. There are always many shoppers in the store, and as a cashier, attending to customers was a constant. I learned to be patient with the general public as well as being patient while I learned company procedures and protocols. Once I became a professional ""Walmart cashier,"" I was able to give customers the level of customer service that they expected when they shopped at Walmart. And of course making friends among your coworkers is always a plus, and it makes the day go faster when you have someone to work with, laugh with, and help you out when you need it. The hardest part of being a cashier is dealing with complaints  and angry customers (and any cashier at any employer will tell you this). However, knowing that my customers had a good experience before leaving the store always made my day much better."
good,"I loved working with the people I worked with, however, the job itself didn't pay what it should have. The upper management team had their favorites, and showed it."
good,"There was a time where I, along with many coworkers, loved my job. Over the past few years the company has become all about the bottom line. There is too much emphasis on ""scorecards"" which can have an adverse effect on productivity and customer service."
good,Bad pay and hours. Non flexible for anyone with kids. Unwilling to help other employees. Treated well by management.
good,"A typical day consisted of unloading anywhere from 1 to 3 trucks a day as well as pulling freight unloaded from the trailers to the floor to be stocked."
good,pay wasn't good.. but it was a good place to work. Enjoyed working with Customer's on a daily basic.
good,Learned a lot from working here from high school to after college. You can obtain alot of skills and knowledge here and would recommend working here to anyone.
good,I didn't work there very long but it was a positive work place
good,todo excelente solo que es un poko mas dificil la promocion de puestos
good,"My typical work day would entail organizing the customer service desk, making sure that the cashiers were well managed in their day to day work, and helping customers in anyway that I can. I would say that I have been learning how to effectively communicate to not only customers but other employees about my opinion, how I think the work environment is, and the policies of Wal-Mart."
good,"Unload trucks and stalk shelves"
good,If you like making calls to people that have been looking at vehicles to purchase.
good,"The Typical Work Day would start with a meeting involving all of the assistant supervisor's and associates. Most of the meeting would just involve sales figures of today compared to last year followed by evaluation of the previous day's performance , we would then just check our tasks for the day and attempt to complete them."
good,"Its a good day, some stores are faster than others"
good,I can say this job helped me work on my people skills and communication skills. At times it could be very stressful because you deal with such a high volume of people with various personalities. A typical day would include me clocking in going to the sales floor answering phones and connecting customers to different departments or answering the direct questions myself. Everyday customer service would need to be provided to customers looking for merchandise and the floor had to constantly be kept tidy and in order.
good,My typical day was ringing up customers orders. I learned a lot about different foods. Management was helpful. The hardest was not being able to speak spanish. My most enjoyable was speaking some sign language to death cutomers.
good,A typical day at work consisted of making sure my customers and cashiers were being taken care of.
good,People tend to slack and put a heavy load on good workers. I learned the best way to finish a task is to follow instructions and finished quickly so you can help others that are behind. Management was decent but rarely was helpful in work related task. Co-workers where not very qualified and sometimes where hard to get to give 100 percent on their task. The best part of the job was it was at night and was very laid back. The worst part was the pay was not very great for the amount of work put in.
good,I enjoyed my work and the co-workers.  I liked working for WalMart just did not like working the midnight shift.
good,"Scanning inventory , stocking shelves , helping customers , and unloading freight trucks. I learned that you must approach every person positively , even if you are having a bad day. My management team were a decent group of men and women, just doing their jobs. My coworkers were between the ages of 16- 65 , so there was a great diversity of people , in different stages of their lives. There was nothing really difficult about my job, the most enjoyable part of my job was helping the customer."
good,it was fun and a friendly involvement i learned how to zone how to run a register management was very far co workers were very helpful with things i needed to know in the work place such as zoneing and where items would go.
good,"Walmart was an alright place to work for.  They always make sure that you have a good amount of work to keep you busy, but won't ask you to do anything that you aren't capable of.  Management was pretty fair, they always try to make sure that not too much work falls on one person.  The hardest part of the job is being able to keep up with everything the management wants you to do, since they aren't always the clearest with their expectations.  The best part about working there is getting to meet and interact with new people."
good,"The day usually consisted of opening the shop.  Having to do more then my job as a technician.  I was not only a technician I was a service advisor, shop manager, inside floor specialist not only in the automotive department but all departments, I built bicycles and grills,  I put stock away and I even pushed carts.  My coworkers were my family outside of my family however, management made it difficult to work diligently in the shop."
good,"Very productive and stressful at times but overall had a good sense"
good,The Managers were really rude but I still appreciate them for the opportunity.
good,Very productive atmosphere and stressful at times but overall I had a sense of accomplishment at the end of the day. My co-workers were like family to me since we worked so closely together day after day and year after year.
good,"Learned how scan items"
good,Arrive to work at 3:45 pm clock in at 4:00 pm. Proceed to the receiving dock for the truck. Their were certain stations that boxes and freight had to be divded while things were coming off the truck down the zip line. Each truck needed to be finished within 2 hrs
good,"At Walmart, I learned how to develop film, print pictures either through 110, 35 mm film, or through digital media. I also worked as a cashier and did light shipping. I really enjoyed editing pictures, and customer experience. The most difficult part of my job was dealing with unsatisfied customers."
good,"- A typical day at work is always very calm , and talkative."
good,"es una empresa donde puedes desarrollar"
good,"a typical day at walmart is very busy your constantly on your toes"
good,"Managed 20-30 employees to include scheduling, coaching’s and evaluations.  Managing the shop, all shop inventory, monthly inventory and budget, keeping an accurate account of all inventory, cash payouts for customers and vendors and preparing all mark up and mark down reports."
good,The supervisors had their favorites. They didn't work with you on appropriate hours when you were trying to go to school. They made you do other people's jobs that you didn't apply for and wasn't getting paid for. Mostly I think it was the manager that caused all the problems and he is not the manager any more.
good,"I learned a lot from Wal-Mart. A typical day for me would start by me punching in and walking to the fitting room desk, see my tasks for the day, and then walking to the front to get jewelry keys. I learned different jobs throughout the store besides my normal apparel/jewelry functions. There were good managers and there were not so good managers. Most of the good managers didn't stay at Wal-Mart to long. The hardest part of the job was the repetition. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing some of my co-workers."
good,"Walmart wasn't a very organized place to work at! The CSMs are very rude and wouldn't help me out when i needed it!  Some of the things that i didn't know how to do,when i asked i'd be frowned upon or yelled at!"
good,Walmart stores is not a bad place to work.  I would like to point out that if you do decide to move up or accept a management job you consider your family.  If you do not have one the great place to move up and you can do so quickly.
good,handling money and merchandise helping customers and keeping the area around your register clean
good,"It was a job had worked during college, I strengthened interpersonal skills and teamwork attributes."
good,a typical day at work was getting to work putting my meat coat on stacking meat helping people.
good,Enjoyed running my department and the people I worked with.
good,"A typical day at work would involve me maintaining my department, stocking shelves and occasional helping of other departments. I learned how to merchandise clothing, so that it appeals to the customer and they want to buy it. Management was good for the most part, easy to get along with some individuals. Others weren't as laid back as others but overall good. My co-workers were very friendly and helpful, easy to get along with and socialize. Hardest part about my job was keeping it maintained as I was the only person in my department for a couple of months. Most enjoyable part of my job was the quiet nights were I could get my work done without having to worry about other matters during a busy day. Overall a good place to work."
good,Temporary job. Good job experience. Diverse client and staff populations.
good,"i go to work with a great attitude and love seeing and helping customers. Never had no problem with co workers or management. The hardest part of my job is getting a customer who has had a bad experience shopping at walmart, however i try and have them to leave with a positive feeling and feeling appreciated."
good,I exceed associate and customer expectations by using          policies and the right resources to resolve their requests.
good,"stocking freezer, stocking food dept. management was ok, co-workers friendly,staying in the freezer for long periods of time, finishing what I started"
good,I would help customer's check out and find every thing they need.
good,". walking in to a mess, Cuz the job didn't get done"
good,Got the opportunity to satisfy needs and wants when it came to automative work that needed to be done. At time toughest part of the job would be not having the available resources to complete a task.
good,Have tried to keep in touch with former co-workers. Didn't like the fact that rules tended to change depending on who was running the store. Also seemed to be different rules that applied to different people.
good,A typical day is making sure customer service is friendly and with a smile. Always be helpful. I learn daily from co-workers and on other ways too. Be positive. Be a team player. The hardest part of the job is having a lot of customers in one or more areas that needs to be cover. I enjoy being a helpful and helping others.
good,A typical day at work is folding clothes and putting them away. When they needed more help up front to cashier I would go up and help.
good,"Having to learn other peoples job including yours.. "
good,it is not easy to get work some part time worker who come for one or two time in a week and
good,This job is a steady supply of work that does not end. There is no end to the work that goes into worcompany king for this company. The  company does not care for your personal life. This company only cares for it's bottom line. The people are great to work with and make the job fun.
good,a job for some but not for me. I enjoy dealing with the public and solving problems.
good,"full time job, customer services, specializing in phone sales, gaining vast knowledge in the working world, traveling to other locations to work, supervising other workers on remodeling teams,making connections to customers that are more than just a sale."
good,i enjoyed my time at Walmart. management was fair and treated me with respect.
good,Awesome staff and great pay!!!!!  you will love it! apply now
good,I worked overnight and a lot of duties fell on the overnight shift. The hardest part was if day shift didnt do what they were supposed to do then all of their work fell on us plus our own.
good,"Applying to work for Wal-Mart was a good choice."
good,Come to work have a brief meeting to discuss the project for the night. Co-workers stayed to there self and focused on getting the work finished before the shift ended. By it being an overnight job there were alot of different attitudes and mood swings between co-workers and managers. The hardest part of the job was finishing a 12hr job in a 8hr time frame and doing it correctly. It was a nice environment to work in.
good,"I've been with the company for 10 months. I have no problem doing what my managers tell me to do. But I feel that some do not listen, or pay attention to the needs of others. Some carry a power trip."
good,Overall it was an alright experience. Got to experience the retail life and see what kind of work was given and how well employees worked together.
good,Overall I Just Loved Interacting With The Customers And My Co-Workers.
good,Stocking shelves and learned to do several different jobs throughout the store
good,Management was greatly lacking on leadership abilities. Not much communication made work difficult.
good,WalMart was a descent place to work.  Always able to keep busy and help customers or other employees.  The greatest part of the job was helping customers find products they wanted.
good,"Sitting and talking to angry customers can not be avoided in this job. Great incentives back then, not sure how company is now"
good,"I only worked here for a couple months because I got hired on 6 1/2 months pregnant and had to quit when I had my daughter. The managers want you to work to you bone for little pay and want you 100% devoted to them regardless of your home life, they don't care, they are just out for money and that's it. If you want a paycheck go for it, it pays the bills but i will say nine times out of ten you will not like it."
good,"Merchandising"
good,"Great workplace, it is a good working and learning experience.Not a career based job."
good,I loved working with my fellow employees and working in different departments. I enjoyed learning new things and helping our customers with anything they may needed.
good,Enjoyed talking to customers face to face and checking out customers in satisfying their needs and wants
good,"If you work hard, you'll advance.  Pay is not the greatest but its retail what do you expect.  Great job for high school and college students."
good,Served orders to customers and did so in a timely fission.  Made sure the food areas were clean and sanitary.
good,"You get bonuses which is a plus, but it is based on the stores success. 4 hour shifts, only part time, and some are temps."
good,A typical day at work is helping customers. As an associate its our responsibility as a team to make the customers shopping experience  a pleasant one.
good,This job was nice because it was a different work schedule for me.  I worked overnights as a stocker.  People were nice and the job was nice too.
good,it was a seasonal job and was oh kay very different then what i thought it would be
good,I learned the values of customer service and how to multi-task. The managers were very well trained and showed great equality. The only hard thing about this corporation was trying to get enough hours to cover certain expenses but I enjoyed the friendliness of the whole entire workplace. Sometimes co-workers might not see eye to eye but the idea of teamwork flooded throughout the store.
good,scanned inventory learned how to drive forklift made friends out of my co workers my manager was cool and understandin hardest part of the day ws unloading the trucks i enjoyed my break time with my co workers

good,"enhanced my ability to communicate and identify a customer's needs, issues or concerns. learned that feedback is important to improve the operation of a work place. My co-workers are willing to stretch their hands to help. its always hard to deal with customers who would fight for their rights that is not tolerable due to the company's policies, but the enjoyable moment I am able to solve a customers issue, or complains.."
good,I like working third shift and they always gave me full time third shift hours and full time. I had okay benifits and okay pay but always short staffed and relied on what they had to much and cut hours all the time.

good,"easy place to work, has friendly people to work with more of a chilled out attitude great management, easy job"
good,"The Arnold location is a large, new, clean, and busy store. The staff including management was not motivated but the number of people that work there make it possible to complete tasks."
good,"Obviously working retail can be difficult, you cannot always please every customer that walks threw the door but I sure did try."
good,"Working at Wal-mart, every day is an adventure. We'd even have a television personality come in and harrass a customer or two. Occasionally you'd get a demanding customer like the one that was referred to as Buffalo Bob, who'd come in with his ten gallon hat and his cowboy boots thinking he was an oil tycoon looking for a discount and if he put on his jeans that day, I would have taken him seriously. But all in all it was a typical day at the office. "
good,"The majority of the time is take care of customer service.  I'd sliced meet and cheese.  Take care of the hot case and salads.  I'd learned how to sanitize and cook in the fryer.  The hardest part of the job was at the end of the day when we had to close the store, we have to have everything clean for the next day again. The most enjoyable part of the job was taking care of customers."
good,I love the way the company structured their business.  I learned how to treat individuals and to give them value.
good,I wanted a job with a future that would challenge me and give me a chance to learn new things.
good,"Cleaned a messy back room every morning. Counted freight all day, in both grocery and GM back room. Covered for Department Managers that were absent. Counted their outs, did price changes, and placed orders."
good,A typical day started in a managers meeting. During the meeting we were given tasks to complete by certain times. Some days you just has so many tasks and usually there was not enough people to do complete the tasks. If you didn't complete the tasks then you would get into trouble for not being productive enough.
good,A typical day at work is stocking shelves with merchandise.
good,"Helping customers, coordinating drivers on daily deliveries without"
good,"Everyday you come into work and get ready to unload the truck for the day. Sometimes there were more than one. The day crew is supposed to help set up for the truck so you can jump right on in. At the Wal-Mart I was in they don't. So, we spent the first hour of our shift collecting pallets for the general merchandise, and carts to put the grocery merchandise in. It wouldn't take so long if management would respond when needed."
good,"good place to work, great work/life balance, and also good employee communications"
good,Walmart is a fairly easy company to work for that pays decent for retail. However it is not enough to live on.
good,I was a cashier and stock I greeted customers and made sure there needs where taker care of.
good,"I liked the work as I was stocking water, pop, and juice. I did not mind that it was heavy. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and got along with them,  the hardest part of the job was the bending and getting to bottom shelf.  but all in all in enjoyed the work itself."
good,"The day would go by fast since I would be consistely on the job."
good,"I love shopping/working at walmart "
good,"I never planned to stay at Walmart on a long permanent basis. At the most about two years. But I'm hoping to make that a little less now."
good,"Typical job, best part is the people I work with every night."
good,No two days are the same due to the orders varying daily. Only get your hours near the bigger holidays. Never know what time you will get off of work
good,"Although often stressful. I enjoy the challenge , co-workers are for the most part happy and upbeat,"
good,"Nice place to work should have stayed , good benefits. But no overtime ."
good,I worked with really nice people. The only really hard part of the job was the furniture-putting it on the shelf.  I learned how to use a baler. I learned a lot about chemicals and what to do with spills of that nature. I learned how to match the numbers so the product matches the number on the shelf. I learned how to deal with the customers and how to deal with different types of situations. I was only there for four months but I did learn a lot of useful information that I can carry to other jobs.
good,this Job is not as fun as some. you work hard and can never get full time.. but hey its a job
good,"I worked here in high school. It's not the best, but it could be worse."
good,"Sept.1998- Feb.2011 (12 ½ years) "
good,"Very confusing job position, promoted but no training, lack of teamwork."
good,"Customer Service"
good,"Overview night stocking made time go by fast "
good,they want you to show up for work and do all the jobs they ask of you
good,"Working here was most definitely eye opening and I truly enjoyed it very much. Everyday was a little different, but relatively consistent. I didn't admire how if your department was done zoning, they made you keep zoning as if you weren't. I mean, you could be working freight and getting that out of the way instead of pretending to zone for two hours. I've learned so much from WalMart, I truly would not change my experience for the world. The fast paced retail business along with having so many people was just an outstanding experience. Management was wonderful, for the most part. But quite a few were completely unprofessional. They honestly made it feel like I was in high school again, what with: cliques, rumors, drama, bullies, etc. From new workers I would completely understand, but from the management. Oh no, I just could not do it anymore. My co-workers were absolutely wonderful, when there wasn't gossip flying around. When you're new, gossip hits you like a speeding bullet and makes you feel like you're the center of it all. Apparently confronting the issue wasn't all fine and dandy, because I was caught between horrid crossfire for confronting the matter. Also, many people would call in at the most unreasonable times. When they would show up for work, they would complain about how they weren't feeling all too well because of their ""insane partying"". The hardest part of the job was working alone during busy times because people would call in or not show up. I found myself on numerous occasions working alone because people didn't show up. The most enjoyable part of the"
good,The work was easy and everyone got along but the corporate office doesn't work with employees when matters of medical come up.
good,"Cut and stocked fabric, customer service, and cleaning with organization for ordering new supplies."
good,This job was very enjoyable place to work and with this employer is very family oriented and was always wiling to assist with things to help their employees with anything.
good,"You never know what to expect from Walmart, each day is different from the other. Your co-workers in general are friendly, and they're easy to work with, your managers, it's a hit and miss situation. They expected great work, but didn't always appreciate it when it was given."
good,walmart is a great place to work. they take care of their employees
good,"A typical day at wal mart is to clean my department up. restock the shelves and sales pet fish to customers. I have learned how to mix paint, cut fabric in the arts in craft department, make keys and a little maintenance. Management was a  young crew and was very irresponsible when it can to giving authority. The hardest part if my job was the pay I was receiving when I have had two years if retail experience. The most enjoyable part was the customer service."
good,I learned everything there was to know about customer service and being a cashier. The job itself was great and Walmart was a great company but the other people working there could careless. I didn't see why half my co-workers hadn't been fired for not doing their job. I ultimately had to clean up after a lot of people and it got old. If I am doing my job they should too.
good,"Flexible with my schedule, fast paced made the day seem to go by faster. The managers were always willing to help when needed."
good,"Stocking shelves help costumers."
good,"I loved the people i worked with. I learned that no matter what always have a smile on your face because you can always brighten someone elses day. The hardest part about this job was the fact you didnt get to move around alot, you mainly had to stay in one spot and im the kinda person that likes to move around. The best thing about my day was the interaction with each customer you had a few minutes to strike up a conversation with each customer and get on a more personal level with them and alot of times they came back looking for my line just because they liked the fact that i interacted with them."
good,"some of the management staff does not talk to each other to correctly handle customer related problems. I learned how to properly take care of a customer, run a register, and stock merchandise."
good,A typical day at Wal-Mart was making sure that all the carts were off the lot.
good,"maintaining a safe work place for the employees also, for the shoppers. On the the day to day catch shopper lifters, counter fitters,  return fraude and etc..."
good,Regular day at work just go in have a meeting about how sales are going interact with a everyone for a few minutes. I learned how the inventory system goes and how important I was to the store itself. Management they weren't the nicest people in the world they had the assumption that they were managers so they could talk and treat people any kind of way. Co-worker were laid back some about their business some are childish but for the most part they were easy to work with. The hardest part was when we had more than two people to call off and the few that was there had to run the whole back from grocery to the toy section. Most enjoyable thing working there was just getting the work done after a heavy night the satisfaction of completion is great.
good,I was salesperson worked in clothes department. stocked returned clothes.  I colorized and sized clothes on shelves and racks.
good,"Wal-mart takes pride in making it's customers have an awesome experience, but do not take the time to invest just as much interest in their employees."

good,"move prodcuts from the warehouse to the storage room, my physical performance increased, management was doing their job, co-workers were doing their job, the job was easy, most enjoyable part was getting the job done."
good,"monitoramento, portaria, ajudar ao funcionamento da loja."
good,A typical day can be quite chaotic bouncing from one area to the other. I learned to just go with the flow and do what I was asked. Management can be demanding. The hardest part was learning to pull from the back correctly and set mods correctly. I love the people I worked with and liked that I could stay busy most of the time to make time go faster.
good,i enjoyed working with the public.i learned how to work cash register.management was okay and my coworkers i enjoyed.the hardest part of the job was  my schedule is never the same so it isnt coinsiding with my homelife.i am a single mom with 2 children so i never no when i am going to be available for them.i enjoy the job.
good,"Gostava de trabalhar nessa empresa, mais infelizmente é uma empresa que sobrecarrega os coolaboradores e não os reconhecem com as devidas promoções mesmo quando já exercem determinadas funcões."

good,I liked working here because they always kept me on point with my cusotmer service.
good,"I went in every day and unloaded trucks that had been in the sun all day for minimum wage. I learned the flow of a large store like a Walmart Supercenter. Management is easy going, but firm. The people I worked with were all pretty level headed and cool people. The hardest part of the job is pulling 2 ton pallets of water throughout the store with jacks while trying to meet their impossible time deadlines. Towards the end of the day things get more relaxed and mingling with customers in down time isn't so bad."
good,Nothing too bad. Depends on what walmart location you are working at

good,It was alright working there but they never wanted to work around my schedule since I am a single mother. Then when I told them about having to work over night so I could take my daughter to doctor appointments the lady in the office told me that she didn't care if I loss my job or not.
good,"I was a backroom associate at the local walmart for about half a year. It was an OK environment to work in. I learned a lot about team work and being able to get things to the sales floor so it can be used by customers. "
good,As a cashier the hardest part of my job was trying to make every customer happy after they may have had to wait in a very long line. The most enjoyable part of my job was the relationships I had with my managers and coworkers.
good,"I learned a lot about managing my time, associates. I had a great bunch of coworkers and we always worked as a team. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep the customers happy without the tools to do accomplish it."
good,"El ambiente de trabajo que presentaba wal mart al momento que yo me saliera no era muy agradable., la gente se la pasaba quejando por un mal manejo de la tienda y por medio de sus comentarios lograban hacerte pensar igual que ellos y bajarte por completo los ánimos."
good,I would clock in and go to the register and cash customers out. I left because I accepted another job offer.
good,I quit I am looking for a better  paying job the truth is their is no over time and some time hours are cut . I understand it . but I would like to work for a company where their is opportunity to get some over time
good,Great opportunity to meet new people. Fast pace at times and a heavy work load. Stressful at times but manageable it is what you make it. As a CSM you are over all front end activity from cashiers and maintenance to cart pushers and customer service areas.You are in charge of all store complaints and resolving customer issues so if yelling customers upset you CSM isn't the job lol.
good,Enjoyed working with the associates as well as the customers
good,Good place to work with lots of friendly coworkers and friendly managment
good,"I enjoyed working at Walmart but once you see  a manager mess up, and reported they're all friends and you will get terminated!"
good,The management here was reasonable and understanding of employee's needs.
good,"The company mainly lets you work about 4 hours a day. "
good,"I did not mind working for the company, I learned a good deal of profitable experience to help me enhance my skills."
good,"Stock was easy but tons of product to put out. Cashier was interesting, either the public were nice or they weren't. Se la vie"
good,Nice career when your working towards a degree. Takes alot a detailed work in most department and team work.
good,"Clean Call Center. Friendly Employees and Management."
good,good place to work.  pay wasn't the best but good for the job you were doing.  hardest part of my job was when trucks were late and having to rush to complete 8 hrs. of work in 6.  most enjoyable part of the job was the people you work with.
good,"I started out as a part time cashier at Wal-Mart.  Within a few months I became full time.  I held several positions while employed there.  I went from cashier to the service desk to Customer Service Manager.  After that I was the claims clerk, then I went to the accounting office which at that time was also the HR person.  I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart.  There was a lot of stressful times there too.  Any time you work with the public like that and so many employees and several different store managers over the years, you just have to learn to deal with different situations.  I sometimes wish I had stayed there."
good,the managers were very poorly organized and it was hard to find out when you were working till the day before
good,"Personally, working there from 2006-2009 and then again from 2010-2012 I did not enjoy this work atmosphere much at all."
good,"shifts were never that long, straight forward work, but with poor management"
good,"I worked in the electronics department for Walmart. I would help the store achieve sales goals and supply excellent customer service. Each day I went to work we started by having a store meeting to catch the entire team up on daily sales, targets, goals, and responsibilities. Once the meeting finished we would all go to our designated area's. My position included helping customers troubleshoot problems with electrical equipment, or compatibility of various technology equipment from accessories to computers and televisions. The job experience was highly enriching as I got to migrate other departments, not just my own. When I went to overnights I was limited on my experience but was still fun because management left me to my own devices and tools to complete my responsibilities. Co-workers were friendly and we all worked as a team. The most difficult part of working for Walmart, in my opinion, would be the terminology of technology. Customers with little to no experience with technology often don't understand the terminology for technology. This can make solving the problem difficult for some customers. At the same time this is also the most enjoyable part of the job because it's a learning experience. The customers who don't understand ask questions. I can learn better ways to explain products, and I can learn how different customers might relate to the experience."
good,"cross trained ,was in deli,produce,frozens customer service,cashier and unloaded trucks"
good,"I was a cashier, was polite and respectable employee. Always greeted the customer with a smile. Always tried to keep my lane flowing going as fast as I could."
good,Everyday at work I would meet someone new. The job taught me how to deal with the public and have great customer service.
good,"I enjoyed meeting new people as this job, but then again its a lot of hard work, but not enough pay."
good,Learned a lot at this company over 13 years. I was able to do all different kinds of jobs.
good,walmart was a good starting point for me to enter into sales. always gave my 100% i may not have always been noticed for my work but i always put my all into it because every day you work is a day you have to prove why your there why they are paying you and why you deserve to stay there.
good,"Primary Duties:"
good,"It was fun and educational for me as never worked as a sales associate before "
good,"A typical day at work I would get to work and clean the restrooms,bottle room and start the safety sweep around the store.The co-workers were great we would help each other out."
good,A typical day there was either a long day or short day depending on your job function. I used to work 11 to 12 hours a day while i watched others leave after 8 hours. I learned many skills in the warehouse industry and also learned to to operate many different types of indoor industrial equipment. Management was okay but interested in being your friend than being your boss. The company liked to hire people outside of the company to manage warehouse operations and that slowed everything down. The co-workers and work environment were good  and helpful.
good,Always a challenge. The goal of helping the customer before the end of the business day is part of company culture.
good,"Open the wireless center, run programs to startup software, help out in electronics department, check pricing and labelling of merchandise, help customers with troubleshooting."
good,"Worked in Sporting Goods Department.  Team oriented organization.  Hardest - rude shoppers, enjoyable - Teamwork, learning different departments"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job was at the photo lab. Seeing happy, funny and some interesting photos :)"
good,working was a new experience everday and co-workers made you feel welcomed.
good,I loved watering the plants in the Garden area. The co-workers were really helpful and helped me a lot when needed. The hardest part of my job was when I was asked to carry out something that was heavier then I was.
good,"overall a good company, good benefits, physical, but did not like the management team."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing a smile on customers faces after assisting them with purchases.
good,"I got along really well with everyone I've worked with, there was a lot required of me."
good,My role has a Merchandise Supervisor was to ensure I was leading a strong and productive team on a daily bases by ensuring there were always on task with there work. Also I had to make my team schedule based on the hours that company would project based on the sales forcast
good,I learned a lot about cars working in the tire and lube department of the company.
good,i would be assigned a cash register and that is where i stayed all day.
good,"Cashier"
good,"fast paced love working retail, loved working with people, and most managment was great"
good,"great work environment, fast paced, helpful supervisors, not enough pay, excellent discount program for employees"
good,"Management and my coworkers were very professional and great communicators. The hardest part of the job was being a full time senior college student athlete while working. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the community of Jamestown, North Dakota while providing them a dependable and friendly service."
good,"I had worked in the front and the back of the pharmacy but personally enjoyed the back more."
good,"Working at Wal-Mart is not a bad job but it is more difficult than it needs to be. At my store we typically are about half-staffed everyday so the workload doubles and even triples for me. There is little to no communication between upper management and many benefits are only offered to full time employees of which Wal-Mart only hires temp employees and part time employees now. Wal-Mart also underpays most of its employees, does not reward learning new tasks or skills, and offers a maximum of $0.40 raise each year. After 4 years of working there I still make less than $10/hr. I like what I do there because I am always busy and constantly moving around. The hardest part about the job is actually just forcing yourself to show up."
good,"great place to work, but a lot of policies to which i personally cant relate or understand"
good,Overall I would say Walmart is a great stepping stone for anyone. Walmart has been a great fit for me for where I was at in my life because my managers were always super flexible when it came to my schedule in order for me to be able to go to school full time.
good,"this is an overall good place to work"
good,Wal mart  is unorganized and over work their employees; need to train management to improve customer service.
good,"I have done a lot of position in the workplace. from warehouse worker,  assembly line, to site to store, sales rep. I have difficult times with customer from time to time but i am able to keep a professional attitude."
good,Walmart is know for really good hours but they pay isn't worth the work you have to do.
good,This place is OK. The only thing wrong is they are unorganized  and they show favoritism.
good,This was the first job i every had. If I could go back and do things over I would have made this my life time career Job.
good,"A typical day is to go to the back grab a cart then go to the fitting room to get returns.  Start at one end of the department straightening it up putting away returns.  Help with phone coverage.  It's a multi line 5 lines as well as a store radio while assisting customers into the fitting room & sorting out returns.  I help customers and put out freight.  "
good,"started as cashier, get my drawer and open my line. i check out customers. i found my co workers were very helpfull.. liked meeting new people everyday. then i also did work with putting stock on shevles."
good,"My typical day consisted of being assigned to a certain module and accurately labeling packages to be delivered to the distribution area. I also had to bend, twist and stand for long periods of time and pick up 50lb+."
good,It is a good job if you are not involved in school as well as trying to work.
good,A work day starts by pharmacy technicians filling out the prescription orders that were requested overnight via phone.  At the time the pharmacy opens prescriptions are ready for customer to pick up.  Pharmacy technician take in prescriptions from patients and drop them off in the system and then input them.  This is the first process in order to fill prescriptions.  As the time goes by technicians fill prescriptions and help patients in the pick up process.
good,"The first 6 years it was great place to work, but the last 3 the way they went about running the company made it worse for associates to work there."
good,"It's a good job for while in school, but after that the hours just aren't there to support a family, and when the hours are, the wage is too low"
good,A typical day at Walmart is satisfying the customers and getting ones assigned task completed. I've learned that alot of things can be handled by cooperating with a customer instead of going straight to management when a difficult situation come in to play. The management here is very willing and time driven. They make sure that things are done in an orderly manner. One of the hardest part of the job for me is speaking up and suggesting new ideas. The most enjoyable part of the job is that it provides me with a warm and safe environment.
good,Was looking for more of a career than just warehouse position
good,"There wasn't anything particularly special about the people I worked with, but there wasn't anything un-special about them either. Everybody was fairly nice, a little disgruntled and dissatisfied with the low pay, but nice people. Nothing about the job I had at Walmart was awful. It's just that it wasn't great. I thought everything ran fairly smoothly."
good,"Responsible for accurately filling store orders in a safe and productive manner. Chosen to participate in Shadowing Program leading to performance of area manager’s duties ranging from shift start-up, operational success, to end of shift report generation. As area trainer, responsible for imparting to newly hired associates the information and skills necessary for their success."
good,"un dia en wal mart, es muy eficiente, aprendes diario algo nuevo; al inicio de turno realizo la poliza, en seguida realizo mis cambios de precio, en seguida asigno cajera, levanto cortinas para el publico, de ahi solo se van dando las actividades, por ejemplo, si nos llega cruze, osea mercancia, me dispongo o asigno a alguien para que escanee la mercancia y darle entrada, de ahi el acomodo de la misma, en el transcurso del turno van llegando proveedores a los que se les va dando recepciòn, y posteriormente se les va pagando las facturas electronicamente y asi susecivamente. El manejo de personal ha sido para mi todo un reto ya que he aprendido a delegar para llevar un buen hambiente de trabajo, y lo que mas me ha gustado en esta empresa es la confianza que me gane a base de mi trabajo con mi jefe directo., el que el en poco tiempo me diera la responsabilidad de encargarme de la tienda yo sola sin necesidad de su supervicio."
good,"Fun environment, helpful co-workers."
good,It gave me a glipse of what it is like to work in sales.  I thoroughly enjoyed my job.
good,Well the work is somewhat hectic as an ICS Associate wouldn't recommend it to slower paced workers
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart would consist of modular resets, price changes, building and tearing down displays, assisting customers, leading 6-10 associates in daily tasks. All of my retail experience comes from Wal-Mart. After working with the company for 5 years I learned many different things I can use in many different aspects of my life and career. Wal-Mart's management and my coworkers helped build me into the strong employee I am today. I enjoyed my job at Wal-Mart mostly because I felt very comfortable and confident in all my work."
good,can become quite hard to deal with at times when customers are unhappy or in a rush
good,It was an okay job. I had one good csm that I really enjoyed working with. The most of the coworkers were friendly
good,Enjoyed the people I worked with and most of the customers however opportunities to work full time are zero unless you are management or work over night which I ended up having to do
good,Fast past and busy store. Fun place to work. Great management. Great co workers.
good,nice environment to work in and the people there will help you with certain job performances
good,"A typical day at work for me as a photo associate is very productive. I handle many transactions per day and I maintain our photo equipment. I also help in the electronics department. I have learned how to better assess a customers needs before I engage them. If you pay attention to a customer and what they are doing and looking at you can easily walk right up to them and make a suggestive sale. As far as management goes, I believe Wal-Mart would run more smoothly in general  if the associates were micro managed better. Which brings me to my coworkers. There are a few of them that ignore their responsibilities. Of course that makes the job harder for those of us that do not. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing all of the new technology come and go and being shown gratitude from customers for meeting or exceeding their needs and expectations."
good,"Great place to work if you want to constantly be on the go and be occupied, It is also very independent work which I realized I love. They don't treat their employees as well as they could, and play favorites."
good,"A typical day at work, always busy and its a good place to work. I have learned everywhere you go give it all you got."
good,"i would refer people to work for walmart, i liked the night managers and they helped me through alot"
good,"No matter where you work, it is a job. Unless your doing something you love, then it is a job, nothing more."
good,"very unorganized, poor management and over worked and understaffed ."
good,"learn how to move at a fast place "
good,The company just don't care about the workers anymore.  I was there for 6 yrs and just in those 6 yrs. The company changed. And with every year that went by the company just didn't care about the workers anymore.
good,"Unload the trucks"
good,"A typical day consists of attending a meeting followed by performing specific job duties; sorting freezer/dairy freight into departments, stocking freight, putting overstock into inventory bins in freezer/dairy.  Learned how to properly use a handheld computer which is used for various inventory functions.  Most of my co-workers are great to work with, we work together as a team to accomplish each nights tasks.  I do not find any part of my job to be difficult or hard.  One of the most enjoyable aspects of the job is the ability for the department I work in, to govern ourselves with little or no input from management."
good,"The company I currently work for is under staffed. We are required to be able to run the drop off, input, fill, bagging and pick up stations with one technician and one pharmacist. So my typical day is busy. The hardest part of the job is managing the time to help the customer with out getting to far behind. the best part of the job is when you get the smile and (I am glade you are the tech here today!) complement from the customer! I truly love my job and all it in tells and all the new thing that can and will be learned from this field."
good,"over all good experience."
good,Co-workers made the job enjoyable even when the job wasn't all that fun.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers, while I would push carts in the rain,snow, ect, I worked by myself most of the time, Management was around sometimes when I needed them"
good,Good Work environment but managers like to play double edge sword they act one way one day then act different the other day which is not fair for alot of employees and managers like to sit back and not help out with employees (most managers (not all))
good,Working at Wal Mart is always an adventure.  The customers and associates make it a home away from home.  My daily routine keeps me busy and focused.  My hard work shows in my department's sales and appearance.
good,"worked in a meat cooler constantly unpacking the meat, pricing it, and stocking the shelves"
good,Cashier training and interacting with customers. Mainly dealing with the customers was my favorite part of my job because they are the main reason i like working with customer service.
good,This was my first job and it allowed me to gain a lot of knowledge and skills needed.
good,enjoyed cleaning homes with he crew. good conversation and no complaints good job
good,"I enjoyed working with management and co-workers. I enjoyed helping customers try on jewelry, I also learned how to pierce ears. The hardest part of my job was the shoe department clean and organized! I loved talking and getting to know all my customers and co-workers so to me the most enjoyable part of working at Walmart was my customers.."
good,There's a pretty good work atmosphere there although sometimes it could feel more like a high school. I work overnight and my hours work well for my schedule. Work is not overbearing and management is usually friendly. However I think there is too much favoritism..
good,"Estimula o funcionário quanto a premiações mensais, mas infeliz mente paga pouco quanto ao serviço realizado, a carga horária é muito grande, o nº de funcionário é inferior ao necessário sobrecarregando o outro, mas tem me ajudado muito até agora como renda familiar e eu agradeço por isso."
good,"a typical day was helping customers and providing friendly service but there were some management issues."
good,some of the policies are just tooo rigid and cut-throut to allow the things that come up in life such as sickness or family commitments the scheduling system and time-off request system is just too complicated everything is electronic even for the simplest of tasks to change or do and the training is not personal either you sit in front of a screen for over 10 hrs of videos
good,7 horas trabajando 30 minutos de comida buena paga muy buen ambiente de trabajo
good,"Working Over Night was ok and I worked with great people."
good,good place to work if still going to school or if you are management. pay scale low
good,Very busy paced job.  Lot of work for very few people.  Was a learning experience.
good,Busy company that is always going 24/7.  A company that becomes your second family due to the hustle and bustle.  I loved training and developing people and knowing the business of the frontend of the store and the backend of the store
good,"A typical day at walmart is always different. Its very interesting, you interact with many different types of people. Its sometimea very hectic but its good skills to have that will help in the long run at other jobs."
good,I learned alot for this job. I learned how to make desicions on my own. I learned how to manage many cashiers. I learned how to manage my time better.
good,"Worked in an inbound customer service setting. Fixing customer accounts, reporting fraudulent accounts,assisting customers in placing orders."
good,Walmart has its good and bad points. The hardest part about working at Walmart is not knowing if there witll be adequate staff covering on a daily basis.
good,"With this job you I can never say its boring. I am able to meet so many different type of people from different cultures and learn new things as well. The days are never the same it constantly keeps me on my feet and lets me improve my knowledge of products with all the changes in technology. "
good,"My daily job involved greeting customers and helping them find things when they were unable to do so. I also had to keep my work space clean and tidy, so no mishaps took place.My co-workers were very easy to get along with. I got along with both co-workers and also managers. Management started to get much stricter and they were harder to please than they had previously. My hardest part of the job was not being able to move as freely as I would have liked. I was in a wheelchair but now am able to walk a bit more in uncrowded spaces. The most enjoyable part of my job was communicating with my co-workers and also seeing all the customers. I tried to make everyone happy and hopefully made their day!!"
good,"Learned a lot about working in the US, interacting with different cultures."
good,Worked here through college. Moved on to better opportunity. Good co-workers and good place to work for a student. Job was pretty exciting.
good,"A typical day at work would be assisting customers at the register ,the drop off window answering the the phone ,logging in drug orders,putting up drug orders and filing perscription.       What i learned at the job is that everyday is a struggle for many and that your kindness and patience can make a difference in someone life.  Co-workers we where a team so it made everything peaceful.    There was'nt any hard parts of the day only if you was'nt feeling well. The most enjoyable part of the day was putting a smile on the customers face when there meds where available to them when promised and when the co-workers where in playful mood , made time go by fast.p"
good,"As a cashier I worked on the cash registered, helped customers, and sometimes stocked merchandise at low customer volume. "
good,"Depending on if the schedule was made correctly, somedays we wouldnt have nearly as many people as we needed. Some days we would be missing out supervisors and someone that knew how to do the supervisors job would have to step in therer place. Honestly I learned how to be much more patient. On a day to day basis my coworkers were amazing, I think that was the best part of the job."
good,"There is always things to be done, new things to learn "
good,I was a four star cashier I checked customers out answer phones and helped customers when the need to find things in the store
good,A typical day at work for me consist of completing my accounting duties then assisting all of my fellow coworkers with their tasks.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of walking the deli department for cleanliness, assign associates to clean if anything was left dirty. Assign associates to make a certain amount of production and follow up to ensure pace is being kept up to goal standards. Scan items on sales floor if out of stock or low and order according to how many items are on hand. Order sandwich and salad set-ups and food Begin stocking floor with freight from the cooler and freezer. Follow up with productivity of associates. Help out with customer service as heavy public contact occurs during lunch time. Once finished stocking the sales floor, process claims by scanning out expired food and processing it. After the food has been processed, then I can begin to help with production in order to successfully achieve production goals. The most enjoyable part of the job is when there is enough production made to fill the sales floor and still be able to have time to make extra production for the following days."
good,"too much work, not enough employees but starting pay isnt bad for overnight workers"
good,The old Walmart values do not exist. It was very tough after many years of struggling for advancement as a female.

The managers were great as well. co workers were friendly. never was really a hard part to this job, it was very simple, and with proper training I was able to learn my job duties well."
good,"I cook, clean, and shave meat. Greet and help customers with any questions or concerns."

good,"I was everyone's go to guy, everyone from the cart pusher's to the GM new if anyone, be it deli dept., grocery, or logistics or any customer wondering about any item in the store or any dept. looking for some help they would come to me first."
good,"At walmart I come in on a typical day at 4am and prepare and bake bread for the day and prepare it for the following day. I also stock the floor and receive trucks . With the job I also close at night that requires cleaning the department such as floors, sinks, tables, trash.  Working well with your coworkers are  a must because every single person in the department plays off one another. In my opinion the hardest part of the job is not knowing exactly what your job is going to be for the day because it changes so frequently.  I enjoy the most is working with the customers and being part of a team."
good,I was a dairy person first I stocked shelves and stocked refrigerator and then I was a door greeter because I could not lift due to doc orders so I passed out flyers and carts and watched customers all day
good,Lots of broken promises.other then that too many managers and not enough workers

good,"Overnight Grocery - Hard work, hard hours, fast paced.  "
good,"If you are interested in learning all aspects of the retail business, Walmart is the place to work. Associates have the freedom to work towards advancement and go as high as they want."
good,"I helped in the electronic departments as well as connection center. I answered phones, set up phone contracts, answered customers questions and concerns."
good,"It was a lot of hard work, but many days the customers made it worth it. Some of the most memorable moments were the times when we'd have those children customers that just wanted to talk. The most rewarding experience I can remember was helping a lady shop for a needy family for Christmas. The mother of the family only asked for clothes and toys, but this lady went above and beyond. "
good,collected money for products and made a lot of new friendlily people along the way.
good,was a good summer time job i really liked working in the back with my co-workers.
good,Great environment to learn many skills necessary for customer skills and other business areas.
good,Management tends to play favorites and does not always recognize someone's hard work. Some co workers are highly inappropriate and make the job difficult to like. The job does pay decent and has good health benefits.
good,average job. The only real benefit I got is medical. it was a filler job until I found something that drove me.
good,"Working at Walmart is enjoyable and I meet new people everyday. I service the customer's by helping them find items and keeping the shelves stock. I appreciate this job , but I will like to have something in my field."
good,"Management played favorites while I was there.  Third shift was the best to work, but if you didn't work past your scheduled shift to get your work done, they would write you up."
good,Challenges you. only when it comes to meeting different types of people all day long. trying to understand them and their attitude. satisfying the customers is always an easy thing to do.
good,"I really liked working with customers but hated it around the crush of the holidays cause the lines got horribly long and tempers got very short quickly.  It was easy ringing up customers, bagging groceries and cash handling."
good,"bake bread, bag bread, label bread, pan out for next day, stock, decorate cakes, deal with customers with friendly service, cleanup"
good,the job was ok but the management department could of been better
good,walmart was a very good place to work put have changed over the last 5 years  enjoy doing the work and working with my co workers
good,Wal-Mart was a great place to learn and has so many opportunities to find what department you fit best. If your a people person the front any has many areas for you to showcase this. If your more of an independent worker there are also many important positions behind the scenes where you can showcase the best you as well.
good,environment did not meet expectations nor did employees hold of expectations of any means to a professional standpoint.
good,Customers are great and co workersfeel like family .They pay good and work with you on anything.
good,"I didn't work at Walmart for too long. My typical day at work consisted of customer service in the deli, slicing lunch meat and cheese, frying chicken, preparing the hot case and salad case, cleaning, and a lot of lifting. I didn't learn anything at Walmart because I worked at Publix before Walmart and I did the same job for the most part."
good,"Empresa que dá oportunidade de crescimento imediato, assim que surge vagas, sem tempo mínimo de contratação."
good,"I had one of the best managers ever at Wal-Mart. She was fair, hard working, and honest."
good,"ok place a little diffrent,but overall a nice place to learn the basics"
good,"you build your customer service skills up by working there, you learn a lot from either the customers, employees to management. its very interesting you see a lot and hear a lot but over all its a nice place for the most part."
good,"The majority of the time was spent identifying, apprehending shoplifters. Also be expected to identify Internal subjects and communicate to the DLPM for potential Interview."
good,"Un día típico era entrar a las 17 hs , a eso de las 19hs (a veces antes a veces después )  me tomaba mi descanso y charlaba con mis compañeros, tomabamos cafe, comiamos medialunas ( los cuales brindaba la empresa en forma gratuita ). El descanso constaba de 20' y luego de eso volvía a retomar mis tareas. Y a las 23 hs terminaba mi jornada laboral."
good,"Enjoyed what I did, great co-workers, not real advancement opportunities or pay increase."
good,"I spend time answering consumers' questions, resolving their complaints, taking their orders and signing them up for new services."
good,very bust fast past environment great employer would work there again
good,"this is just a regular job. you go do your job and come home,   the benefits are horrible and nothing is gained except stress"
good,"Working for Super Wal-Mart has allowed me to learn different job duties and responsibilites.  I also had the opportunity to be a tire center lead and work with my own crew.  I had to learn alot on my own which helped me to be self proficent and lead by example which my team and I pulled together to get the job done.  "
good,Learned a lot working at this company get stressful at times but manage to pull through
good,I worked there part-time while I was in college. The job was a typical grocery store job where I had to stock shelves and help customers find their desired products. The environment was relatively relaxed with a very structured chain of command and daily duties.
good,"deal with customers"
good,I liked working for Walmart mainly because I knew that evan in the colder months I would have work. I also liked that I got to interact with customers on a regular basis. The constant ability to move around with in the sore is a huge benefit because a chane of scenery is always nice.
good,"for walmart it was ok, it was just difficult when you were trying to go to school and they would give you a hard time working around your school schedule but I would go back it was a decent job"
good,"work from 8 am to 4 pm"
good,"Company have always put me around my co workers. no matter what time, there will be a co work next to you for help. the hardest part about the job is doing more the one position at times. the enjoyable part about the job is the ability to be very flexible with the job"
good,I used to stock the shelves & clean up after ourselves. We made sure the store was ready for customers during the day. We also helped customers when they needed help...
good,"On a busy day , depending on the area of the store, cashiers and sales associates are brought to the front of the store to assist on the registers. Other areas while busy tend to be left with little or no help to the associate(s) in that department. I learned a lot of detailed work within the Money Center that led me to feel quite independent even with numerous clients at one time. I have worked with some really great co-workers in the Money Center and assisted training others who caught on well. The hardest part of this job was sometimes being over loaded with a room full of clients waiting . Although it could be the hardest , it was also very enjoyable due to the many compliments I would receive from the clients based on my speed , accuracy and timliness ."
good,A fine position for what its worth. Just looking to grow and evolve in my career.

good,"Workdays were always busy with lots of tasks that needed to be done in a short amount of time, but it helped make the time go by faster and i enjoyed it and the people I worked with"
good,Walmart used to be a family/associate based company but it has turned into a corporate company which means it does not value its associates or customers as Sam Walton had done but instead is more interested in making more money.
good,"Responsible for the appearance and cleanliness of the entire store, outside and inside, including public and employee spaces.  Duties included trash collection, floor cleanliness, bathroom cleaning and fixture repairs. "

good,"Working for Wal-Mart has been a learning experience. I learned many skills required to do a good job here and I am continuing to learn whatever they ask me to learn. I have been a fast learner and have done everything my supervisors needed me to do. I have learned how to deal with people effectively and calmly. I get along with all of my co-workers and they all seem to enjoy the days I am there. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with everything that needs to be done on a daily basis and making the department I work in (grocery) look nice. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers with whatever they need. Although I enjoy working for Wal-Mart at the time, it is not something I would like to do for the rest of my life."
good,My current job is a very changeling job. The communication within management is horrible overall the company is a good company. I love working with the public an I love helping out the customers that shop daily. I also feel that their is no room for advancement in my work place.
good,"Working at Walmart has been quite the experience, in good ways mostly. I've been able to work in 6 different areas and have had a lot of fun with all of them. The job I am currently doing is probably my favorite. I work the graveyard shift stocking shelves. So much gets done at night it feels like I am only there for a few hours and then it is time to go home. The people that I work with are pretty great and the bosses are pretty fair and fun to work with. Sometimes there is alot more than we can handle, but we do the best we can and the day managers are understanding as to why it is not all done."
good,"Got this Job after graduated form high school started at the bottom just pushing carts and doing carry outs. Then moved to the Truck crew and unloaded trucks and login merchandise into store computer. finally moved to the Tire Lube Express where I would do oil changes, tire changes, and Flat repairs."

The people and managers were friendly and answered any questions I had when I first started working there.

good,"I miss the fast pace environment of this work. While working with the pharmacy I felt like I was doing ""good"" with my life in helping others, and I loved the fact that my mind was always learning new information to help treat others."
good,great pay but production is set to make a worker over work. responsible for 10 hours of production even when 1 hour of the 10 is for lunch and 2 are for clean up.
good,"es una empresa seria muy buena su personal se caracteriza por ser muy atentos, aprendi mucho en base al sistema que maneja la empresa sus gerentes unos son poco agradables otros son de carcter fuerte y en ocasiones se pasan en el trato al empleado, de mis compalñeros son unas personas atentas y solidarias en el area laboral la parte mas dificil fue adaparme porque a mi no se me dio capacitacion alguna ya que entre en pleno inventario de tienda"
good,"Opportunities to see and meet new people, Help people with whatever issues they may have, Always remain polite."
good,"The company is huge and everyone wants to be the boss.  I would work for this company again if I had to.  It's big on customer service, which is good.  It helps one to become a better people person and learn how to make small talk."
good,"On a typical day in my position as an apparel sales associate, I would generally come in and meet with my immediate supervisor or manager for department assignment (Men's and Boys, Ladies/ Women's. Intimates, etc.). From there I would report to the back stock room and move all necessary merchandise to the floor and fill shelves and racks accordingly. When all merchandise is moved I would then recover (straighten) and clean my designated department. Also throughout the day we are to go up to the front customer service desk and retrieve all returns from my department and put away all functioning and clean merchandise. We would all occasionally switch off fitting room duty which also required us to answer the store phone and direct all calls to the appropriate departments or management. When all tasks are completed, we are to continue recovering as much as possible to maintain an organized display of merchandise. "
good,gathered buggies. worked after school part-time until soccer season. enjoyed having my own money in high school. good experience
good,I worked the front end and i think from this job i learned patience over all.  There were so many managements that i can't even remember who mine was. Co-workers were friendly.
good,A typical day at work consisted of assisting customers with finding items and collecting and ringing up their merchandise. I learned that a small conversation can change a persons attitude as long as you are polite. My mangers were excellent. The hardest part of my job was inventory. The most enjoyable part of my job was meeting new people.
good,An overall good place to work. Polite friendly people. The managers are friendly and give good direction as well as instruction to tasks.
good,relocation is key to work for this company. This is the type of company that you would like to grow with.
good,Walmart was my first job ever. Which was a big stepping stone.. i learned to gain patience and persistence... i learned that people arent always friendly especially to retail associates when things arent goin well. i was a cashier.. i was responsible for ringing up peoples goods in a timely fashion. the hardest part of the job was holding my tongue for rude customers but i enjoyed all my coworkers and the nice customers.

I learned how to fold clothing ""properly.""  Management was pretty good although with most companies you get a few mean managers.  Co-workers were okay most were pretty lazy but most of the time everyone got their tasks completed.  The hardest part of the job was reaching the top shelves to stock and straighted items.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a few great co-workers and of coarse hot dog fridays when one member of managment would grill hot dogs for everyone on third shift."
good,"Some days are slower than others. I learned more about plants, cash register options, products and their location/section. The hardest part about my job was staying positive to rude customers. The most I enjoyed about my job was meeting some loving and caring customers."
good,My typical work day consisted of training new employees for various departments and informing current employees of their CBL-Course Base Learning training segments that were taken throughout the year. I learned How to help more with Human Resource duties.  Management was very helpful.  I had to interact with managers due to departments during trainings.  My interaction with co-workers were very beneficial to my growth in the company.  The hardest part of the job was confirming that current staff would complete their CBL training guides.  The most enjoyable part of the job was making sure that new employees were properly trained before moving to their current post.
good,"Worked in receiving for 8 hours making sure the trucks were unloaded properly. I learned a couple of new things such as it is hard to come back after a L.O.A. Management was fair, but they did have their clicks. Co-workers are defenitly a lot mor easier to work with than management. The hardest part of my job was coming in to a mess and have to clean it up before I could start my hob duties. Most enjoyable part of my job was completing a task before the end of the day."
good,"not the best, take care of the meal violations"
good,"It is retail. What do you expect? Think about this. Retail industry is a low profit margin industry. They either underpay you or overwork you. "
good,"Aprendí mucho en esta empresa, empatía, tolerancia, trabajo en equipo."
good,I did stocking of shelves and folding clothes. My typical day were mornings
good,"I enjoyed working with a lot of the people and had a lot of great customers. The management on the other hand was not always the greatest to work with. The hardest part of the day is trying to work more than one area for coverage purpose, but i always do good."
good,Just a typical retail job. Learned the basics of starting your career with minimal training.
good,"A typical day at work involved arriving one hour before opening to fill overnight drug orders, return prescriptions which had been in will-call for 7 days and check IVR for any prescriptions left on voice-mail."
good,"My primary responsibilities as a cashier were to maintain helpful customer service, process sales quickly, accurately, and efficiently, and cash register operations. I received payment in many forms, issued receipts, refunds, credits and change due to customers. Other responsibilities included greeting customers, keeping work area clean and orderly, resolving customer complaints, and offering customers carryout services at the completion of transactions."
good,I work in the backroom where I am scanning boxes of product to see if they would go on the sales floor. I have to count the items in the box either take them out to the floor or put them up in the back.
good,"Every day at work it is a highly fast paced day at work, Makes time fly by. friendly environment with co-workers"
good,Walmart was a great company to work for. They always gave back to the community as well as associates. I enjoyed working with all the associates there. That was my most enjoyable part of the job. There are many managers there and it was very hard to maintain consistency among them
good,typical day gat work is filled with learning new information everyday about Wal-Mart procedures and policies. I have learned how to handle irate customers and how to handle large amounts of money. I have a pleasant set of managers whom are very helpful and my co workers as well. There is no hardest part in my job in my opinion. Helping the customers is the most enjoyable part of  the job.
good,"management skills"
good,"Hard working, loading and unloading pallets. Management was busy so it was up to us to keep busy making my innovative in creating work to be done."
good,"I really didn't learn much at Walmart."
good,"A day at the store that I worked at was a lot of freight to be worked to the floor, cashiering, and covering other departments. There is always something to do to keep you busy during the day. I learned a lot about time management in order to get the tasks for the day completed. I also learned a lot about managing others that I work with, mainly the new individuals that don't know what they should be doing. My management was hard to get a hold of so you had to make sure that the customer is taken care of at all times no matter what the situation is. This brings me to the next thing that I learned a lot about which is dealing with customers. At Walmart it seems that you get a lot of individuals that already have a bad perception of the store and therefor aren't happy so you have to learn to deal with a lot of different individuals that are happy or upset. The hardest part is making sure that the customer gets what they are looking for and that you go above and beyond to make sure that happens even if you have a lot of other tasks to complete. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with the individuals in the apparel department. We have a lot of fun together and get things done when everyone is getting along."
good,very stressful place to work. mangers and csm's are not very friendly
good,it was just working and doing taxes. and making sure the numbers were right when finish.
good,"Good structure and work environment. Management is well organized, co-workers were very friendly."
good,"Most importantly I get along with all people, I'm a team player, and most of the time, a trainer to new associates. In the 5 years that I have worked for this company, I've learned how to work fast and efficiently under pressure while able to produce quality work. I am an Inventory Associate, but I've worked in just about every department in the store. On a normal day, I pick merchandise and bin merchandise by the end of each shift. My job is not very challenging, but it is tedious and takes patience and time."
good,Walmart was a great place to learn retail. There is a lot of room for advancement yet you are not given the tools to do so at most times.
good,"Loved my employees, went from cashier to manager in 2.5 months, still can walk in there and everyone still misses me, and i miss them."
good,Fun place to work. Worked around your classes if your were in school. Pay is not that good though.

good,"I enjoy working at Walmart I've learned a a lot in the years that I've been working here. I have had the advantage of working in several departments. and i enjoy working with other associates, and managers as well."
good,"Helped when supply trucks show up by unloading cargo, sorting it, and then loading it on lifts to be distributed to the store. After the trucks are done, I help fill the shelves."

good,"Keeping people under control to get there job done and food out to customers"
good,I enjoyed working for Wal-Mart it was a fun and fast paced place even working overnight stock. I loved talking and helping customers find what they needed.
good,"co-worker were fun, supervisor was very nice and hard working right with you on the bag line. Our managers was like outlaws. the most enjoyable part is when the customer walked away very happy."
good,Walmart is a company that provides chance for advancement.  The hours can be long depending on the need of the business.  Associates love for you to work along with them to show its a team environment.
good,"Intake and pre-screen patients, manage doctor's schedule, maintain policies and procedures, act as manager when needed."
good,"Picking for first part of shift, one hour lunch, binning merchandise for the rest of shift."
good,I enjoyed working with different people. It taught me how to deal with other peoples personality. I learned how to multitask at this job.
good,Management was hard to deal with at times but overall it was a great working experiance
good,"Working overnights for year and half. Exhausting and taxing on social life. Be honest when you interview; if you want a job to pay the bills you have one, wanna make a career out of it can probably get placed on fast track. Overall a company of over 2 million employees, what can you expect?"
good,I enjoy interacting and resolving problems for patients with different insurance companies.
good,"was a good place to work, but the hours i had, had alot of people that carried drama."
good,I liked associates we had but the managers always would go to far
good,"Aprendi a trabajar bajo presion del cliente y realizar mi trabajo lo mas rapido posible. Este empleo tenia un buen ambiente de trabajo y una buena direccion,  lo malo esque no respetaban los horarios de trabajo teniendo que estar una hora o mas despues de el termino del turno."
good,Large employer with limited advancement opportunities.  Long hours and low pay but secure employment.
good,"Fun job, just not steady enough hours. You get to know the people who shop at your store and build relationships with them."
good,"Wal-Mart taught me everything there is to know about the retail world and gave the tolls needed to work in the industry,"
good,"un dia normal atender al cliente y ayudarlo cuando buscaba un producto, aprendi diversas cosas en cada area que estuve de llevar un control de caducidad en farmacia, mercadear ropa y hogar, checar la frescura en carnes hasta contar bien mi dinero en cajas llevar un control de los vouchers y retiros de dinero. lo mas dificil diciembre por la cantidad de gente y mercancia pero no imposible lo que mas me gusto todo lo que aprendi a nivel laboral y personal."
good,I learned a lot about customer service and retail.  Moving up is difficult in some stores.  The co-workers are usually nice and team players.  The management team could be more interactive with everyone.  The hardest part is trying to provide good customer service on a skeleton crew.  The most enjoyable part is hearing positive feedback from customers.
good,Wal-Mart is pretty much a family oriented company but however that only applies to select few within the company. Recently I have heard that the company has changed there policies numerous of times however the policy only reflects to that one store and not nation wide. My experienced there pretty much was a basic job that I completed everyday but everyday was not always the best but the customers were my main purpose to focus on and not the employees.
good,"a typical work day at work is good, as long as you have a great spirit and greet each and every customer that you come in contact with your day was great."
good,"Its an okay place to work for. A typical day for me as management is doing as much as I can to make sure that my deli runs smoothly. I have learned a lot of different skills with the company, and enjoyed working with all of the different types of co-workers."
good,"fast productive hectic loud unpredictable. i learned how to better associate my self with customers and merchandise. Management was fair. co-workers usually kept to them self's. Hardest part would be canceling credit card transactions. what i would enjoy the most, all the different experiences"
good,"I enjoyed my experiences at Wal-Mart. I was able to interact with a great variety of people, I kept busy and was given encouragement and praise from management."
good,it was a typical day at work.i learned how to work fast without hurtin my self and without breaking merchandise.the management team was ok but no the best.the co-worker were fast and consitant at great work/the hardest part of the job was workin all day and trying to make over time.i didn't injoy this job but I work it because I had bills to pay.
good,Managers ask too much of underpaid associates. Associates are hired in 1 department but work all of the departments for the low wage they pay.
good,"Working at Wal-Mart was fun the year that I worked there. I made several friends and we got an hour lunch. It got rough around summer and winter but that was to  be expected. I learned the importance of working as a team there. The management could certainly be improved as they were harsh and unreasonable. M co-workers I liked very much. I particularly enjoyed working on a pleasant evening but who doesn't, right?"
good,My typical work day is helping customer in anyway that I can.
good,On an average day it did`nt seem like i was there 9 hrs because of being busy performing duties all over the store. It was great learning about and performing inventory management. And i`m thankful for our management team`s patience with me at times. And  i enjoyed being around/working with my co-workers and what i learned to help me from most of them. And the most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with most everybody there.
good,"I learned how to interact with and help customers, I enjoyed my coworkers."
good,"Door greeter and stock. Over worked for the pay received."
good,There was no structure to this job. Each day they were moving me to various departments. The co-workers however were great. The hardest part was having to drive so far for this job and not having reliable transportation.
good,I as a CSM made sure that the front end of the the store ran as smooth as possible.  We make sure that are customers are satisfied as they leave the store.  CSM's also made sure that our customers was also satisfied when they had something to return.  We make sure that we take out the time greet and meet our customers needs at all times.  Teamwork is the key to help are customers as needed no matter what the situation may be.
good,"Unfortunately I do not have a high opinion of the management of this company now.  In my opinion, they have stepped out of the box in the traditional values and ideas set forth by Mr. Sam Walton."
good,"Doing cell phone contracts, sales, customer service. loved my co workers I believe they made the job enjoyable."
good,"muy buenas condiciones de trabajo, comedor en planta, buen compañerismo, pero no evalúa la efectivización ni el desempeño personal correctamente."
good,"Dia normal, com muita tarefas para cumprir"
good,"my day started with coming in at 8am getting prescriptions ready that were either left over from previous day, called in overnight. I also worked on prescriptions that were in troubleshoot because of insurance or other errors. At 9am open pharmacy and greet costumers filling prescriptions and taking orders. In the pharmacy i did inventory, answer phones, costumer care, insurance biling, and etc."
good,"wal-mart is busy place, well what i have learn so far is that treat everybody equally and respectfully, some manages are good going people, all the people i work with are easy work with and good too, i don't think their is a hard part of my job it easy, enjoyable part is when check out a customer and he/she is happy with you for a job well done, i feel happy inside of me when that happens"
good,i enjoyed going into work to see the customers and my co-workers. i dreaded going to walmart because i worked long hours and made minimum wage
good,overall enjoyed but was a very stressful company and no job security
good,a typical day at work would be clock in greet customer cash them out and answer all inquiries about store mercandise
good,"I stocked groceries to the sales shelves, unloaded freight from trucks, lifting, pushing, pulling, building shelves, and removing outdated groceries from shelves. My co-workers were wonderful and I am still friends with most of them."
good,"A typical day at Walmart for me was overall very busy, I worked in the photo lab, connections, electronics, and dotcom. I learned a lot from this company. They taught me that no matter what day you are having, the most important part of retail service is that  your customers are happy at the end of the day. Management and I did not see eye to eye on some things, I think the major factor was a lack of communication within the management team, without it something is going to go wrong. My coworkers were awesome, I am huge on being able to work efficiently and effectively with fellow associates. The hardest part of my job was being able to calm down customers who were treated badly, but the most enjoyable part was seeing their smiles when they walked away from me happy."
good,"I spent 8 hours walking the floor and using cctv observing individuals, looking for shoplifters."
good,A fast paced always changing enviroment with opportunity for growth and development
good,Customer services handleling money making gun sales ammunition sale cleaning hardest part of the day when managers are stressed they take it of on employees best time of the day when the store is full of customers and your helping them thruout the sale
good,"Stocking / Keep Store Clean "
good,"I stayed with this company for 5yrs, learned alot, can't believe I stayed so long. This company had it's up and downs overall they needed to be for the employee's but instead was more about making money. They both can be balanced when done right."
good,"Arrive at scheduled time, check status of all previously taken orders and prepare for the day's work.  In spare time, Zone the automotive area.  "
good,easy to move up in this company if you want. pay is not really good unless make to higher management.
good,First manager I had was great.  Second manager I had did not like me and let me know through work.  I left Walmart because of that manager.
good,"Wal-Mart is a great company to start off with for experience. They have a great training system that helps point associates to good jobs outside of school. Wal-Mart's are like schools when it comes to management, they teach associates and only communicate with other management. Your member of management of your department will apply any necessary information to you and your co-workers."
good,It was a big warehouse so u have space to show them that you are the right one for that prosition. The pay was ok but you had to work as a temp first
good,"A typical Wal-Mart gives you so many options. As a teen I worked the grill, cleaned the fish tanks, watered plants, operated the register and drove a forklift. If you keep yourself interested you won't get too bored."
good,When I first stated working for Wal-Mart time management team and co-workers were very helpful in getting me to know the store and its regulations
good,I rang customers out and made sure that the floor was safe for them.
good,"this was a good company but the pay wasn't good enough, nice company though"
good,the job was a good job but they were disorganized. the managers were good people and some of the employee were fine but it was just the structure was bad. that could be because the store is only a year strong.so i have faith they will pick up the slack sooner than later.
good,"i work with some very good people and have made lots of friends, co workers and customers alike. It's a very demanding job, but I've learned a lot from just being there."
good,A typical day at work consist of getting re-shop from customer service and putting them back in the right place greeting customers and helping them with what they need!
good,"Provided great customer service  "
good,"when I work for walmart back then it was a great place to work and learn new things , back then store would give great bonus and really cared about it's people."
good,"Covered all arears of store, learned how to pick,bin use pallet jack. Most of management was pleasent, they did rely on me as their go to employee to get the job done.  Some coworkers just showed up and got their paychecks but was friendly.  The hardest part of my job was being relyed on constantly. It seems to me that I had to work twice as hard to earn my paycheck because management could not count on other employees."
good,never work full time or was ever offered full time and never had enough hours only work less then part time
good,Management is interested in the personel. Making customers happy was a larg part of my job. I enjoyed working with customers and other staff.
good,"A typical day at work was coming in,feeding and doing all the other things to my fish tanks. Doing my counts and ordering. I learned a lot about business and how to run a department. My upper management were very polite and would teach you anything you wanted to learn. All of the department managers worked together well, if one had a very large project we would all team up and knock it out. The hardest part of the job was the upper management didn't communicate amongst themselves very well which made things hard on us. I enjoyed working with my fellow department managers and my fish tanks were my pride and joy of everything."
good,"I loved my job very much, but as time goes by. This wasn't for me any more. You can only do retail for so long before it gets old. But how ever I miss it so! My co-workers were great to work with. The hardest parts were being the boss and the write ups but as I told them your time is your and work time is business. They understood and no hard feelings came from that. Just got to know people and how to speak to them. My most enjoyable part was that the employees looked up to me I had alot of respect wich made me feel great. I had customers on a regular basis and some followed me from kmart to become walmart shoppers what a plus."
good,"Its pretty much a safe job, but the pay is not that great. I would have to stay there for awhile to be able to have an apartment, The managers are nice. Coworkers have their days. The labor i would say would be the hard part of a night stocker. Doesnt take much brains. I dont feel im at my full potential working there."
good,"management give assigment ,then u go to the ale and then u start throwing freight. i learn that it is very freindly place to work. management is soon time friendly . very good co worker to work with. working with the co-worker that dont pull  their work load, and they work to their work ethic."
good,I liked the people that I worked with and I worked in three different departments during my time at walmart. The problem in all dept. was that there were at least 4 people that I had to answer to and that I'd get different answers about my questions. It'd be better if there was a clear chain of command and if the customers and the staff were cared about a little more.
good,The company has had many opportunities that seemed potentially attainable. The only thing holding any associate back is the lack of mentoring and having associates working more positions outside their pay grade that they do not get to progress and learn as they would like. As a retailer I must say that they offer some of the better benefits and better full-time to part-time ratio.
good,"this employer provides excellent opportunities and great camaraderie."
good,My typical day at work was a fast paced easy job only because I knew what to do.
good,This is a good job for young people to start out with. If you want the great benefits and great pay this is not the place.
good,"I have learned a lot with this company and strive in many ways, all the employee's are family to me. The most difficult part is the managements communication. which made our jobs more frustrating."
good,Walmart was a good place to work that provided hours and a structured environment.
good,"a typical day at work involved alot of preparing and cleaning. I learned how to check cashing, money handling and returns/exchanges."
good,long and over worked for $7.65. only good thing about working at the walmart in manhattan ks was that i got to me great people.
good,Great starter job not a career. This company is very difficult to advance in due to their desire to hire previous experience from outside the company for management positions.
good,zone your department look to see what needed to be stocked  help customer  out  when it get busy in the front help cashier or bag order items that where out put items on sale if it come up and say it was on sale.

I also set tasks for my associates to complete daily ,  Ensure the back room is up to OSHA and K-chemical codes and requirements,  comply with all state codes regarding food and country of origin labeling.  In addition to produce I also help out in the Meat department, Frozen/Dairy, and over see special assignments assigned to me and or associates around me to complete. Use Mechanical equipment to move, lift, transport, and store merchandise. "
good,This was a job that worked well for me whilst I was taking college classes during the day.  The hours were perfect.  The job was doing the same thing each day but I learned that keeping busy made the time go quicker.
good,"I love working at walmart it was a great experience, i learned a lot from the company"
good,"Typical day is continuously pulling overstock for floor stockers and placing back in inventory what could not be stock. I learned more about the back room operations when it comes to inventory accountability. I enjoyed my co workers, we had an awesome team but the managements was less to be desired. The hardest part was constant weightlifting the entire shift aside from breaks and lunch. I enjoyed being part of a team and enjoyed meeting new people."
good,"I worked a ton of hours at work at the begining, but then they cut back my hours a lot. I live on my own and i needed the hours to pay my bill."
good,"A typical day starts with stocking the merchandise for sale. It is a timed enviroment and steady paced. Everyone have a department to fill and once finished, they help others to stock their area. We make sure products are up to date and not expired on shelf. Everyone lends a hand to help keep the flow of stocking and reshelving going. The hardest part of the job is to keep shelves stocked and the easiest part is once the shelves are stocked the customers are satisified."
good,"My job is enjoyable. I work 8 hours overnight stocking the bakery shelves and bakery cooler with cakes, cookies and other items. I also make salads and grinders for the deli department."

good,most days under staffed enjoyed my co-workers learned how to be a customer service superviser
good,A typical day is ringing up customers.  I have also learne to be patient.  Management wasn't too bad but they expected a lot from you. Co-workers were a joy to be around.  The hardest part of my job was dealing with rowdy customers.  The enjoyable part was being able to help.
good,Enjoyed working with the other employees and meeting new people.
good,"Walmart has given me the chance to grow in the knowledge of different ares within the store. From learning to set modulars, maintaining instock and supervising other associates when I was a department manager. With my last position as a overnight stocker it consisted of stocking the new freight along with old merchandise from the backroom. Many times I would switch out endcap features for cosmetics when they came in. The most enjoyable part of the day was helping the customers and working with co-workers when they needed help within their departments. Management would be there to oversee if work was going to be completed on time, and one manager  would step in to help with the cosmetics when a massive amount would come in that night."
good,"Working in the Wal mart pharmacy provided a great opportunity for me to gain computer skills, as well as customer service skills."
good,"My responsibility was to attend to the frozen department in such a way that products were neatly stacked  and rotated. Often customers would ask where to find a product and I showed them where it was located. I felt management was fair and I was part of a good team."
good,"I was at walmart for 5 years, as long as you work hard and strive for excellence you can move up quickly"
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is a very busy one, filled with constant interaction with customers,assisting them with inquiries and concerns,and informing them of products.Working at Wal-Mart has really helped me to learn how to be more efficient in dealing with many different situations. The management team are basically pretty nice and associates usually work very well together. The hardest part of the job is knowing that at the end of  two weeks, what awaits you is a very low paying check. The most enjoyable part of the job is communicating with customers and providing customer satisfaction."
good,"its fun, I get in and do my job. the management is great they really strive to help keep the employees and customers satisfied"
good,"The Type Of Day For Me At Work."
good,I started out as a Cart retriever for the store and was promoted to Dairy Associate within 8 months.  Then within a year I was promoted to Department Manager for the Meat Department.
good,Its a ok place to work as far as general labor jobs are concerned. I enjoyed my time their I made a few friends so over all I have no regrets.
good,"I would come in count and balance draws for customer service. Provide assistance with returns, exchanges, www.walmart calls, site to store orders, moneygram agent, handled money transfers including sending and recieving and bill payment."
good,Working at Walmart can cause emotional and mental stress. Not willing to support associates but still expect work to me done.
good,"Worked twelve hour days. Did not mind at the time. I was saving up for a car and was much younger than I am today. I worked the service desk, and in the cash office. I was also a monitor for all cashiers. I began this job while still in high school and was promoted quickly. They found out about my honest nature and expounded upon it. I never turned in a drawer that displayed a negative. They always balanced out. Had some fun, learned the trade of making change quickly and learned how to make myself presentable to employers. Thoroughly enjoyed working and learning with them."
good,Unload grocery trucks and dairy trucks. Interact with the customers to make sure their shopping experience is great.
good,"I was in charge of ordering product, customer service, inventory management and supervising employees. It was challenging at times, but I learned alot. It made me a better employee all around. I enjoyed mostly working with everyone, sometimes that was challenging due to being a supervisor. I enjoyed interacting with the customers and giving them the service they deserve. Because without customers, who would have given me a paycheck?"
good,"I loved the people I worked with. They knew the meaning of teamwork. I liked interacting with employees and vendors. The store manager was a wonderful person to work with. She was fair and consistent. Sometimes it was hard when employees or management didn't complete their job efficiently. I am a firm believer in doing the job 100%, because that is what you were hired for."
good,"Underpaid associates"
good,"overall a great place to work, but not a great place for advancement."
good,my work day is juts like any other work day I'm friendly to the customers and co-worker i get my work done in a reusable time then i proceed to go home
good,"A typical day at work consisted of greeting customers at register and making sure they found everything that they were looking for if not offer my assistance to make sure that all needs were met. I learned how to do inventory, set modules, price items, set shelving, run the register and stock items properly. Management was okay for the most part they asked if you needed anything and helped you out because they wanted you to help them and not be frustrated and not be able to focus on task at hand. Coworkers were pretty helpful and willing to work as a team. The most enjoyable part was meeting different people and putting a smile on their faces."
good,Great Job for students and for passing through. The job is great for students because they will try to work with your hours but only good for passing through because they only move up the people they are buddies with not who is best for the job.
good,fairly simple job. maintained a clean and friendly work environment. also kept an accurate drawer. i had a secondary position as a cart pusher/parking lot cleaner
good,Mostly stocked grocery and kept up with the inventory. I learned how to categorize stock. Management was very hands on and very helpful. It was so many co-workers I didnt really get a chance to really meet and like that.
good,"The associates all tried to help each other , but was difficult at times because of being so short handed. "
good,I would work where I was needed. I have done layaway in the past and ran the sporting goods department as well as stock and running cash registers
good,"Walmart is an enjoyable place to work. As long as you get your work done, the management is pretty laid back. Pay wasn't quite worth the work, but money is money. There are a few lazy employees, but for the most part, everyone does their work."
good,could be very stressful at times mostly when managers didn't communicate with each-other.
good,"I would clock in, stand at register and check people out, help customers find what items they were looking for throughout the store.  I worked on my people skills while working at Wal Mart.  The hardest part of the job was the occasional rude customer.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the regular customers I had."
good,sometimes it was hard to get things done. a place you felt like a family.
good,"Receive payment by varies methods. Issue receipts, refunds, and credits. Count money in cash drawers at the beginning and end of shifts. Greet customers entering establishments. Maintain clean and orderly checkout areas. Establish or identify prices of goods, services or admission, and tabulate bills using, cash registers, or optical price scanners.

good,friendly place to work just not enough hours for me. management was great and so was the co workers. I liked working with the customers. And I learned how to work a regestier so that's good.
good,"A typical day at work? It was enjoyable. Learned new things took initiative and i loved helping customers and stocking merchandise."
good,I would get there clock in then go to work help customers.  I received management experience.  Co-workers were nice.  The hardest part was dealing with upper management not knowing what was going on.  The most enjoyable part was working with the customers.
good,"era tranquilo de trabalhar, onde iniciei o gosto por trabalhar como caixa, gerente muito atencioso, colegas trabalhavam em harmonia, a parte mais difícil é q tinha q trabalhar aos domingos e a parte mais agradável foi as amizades."
good,Had to deal with customers regularly was a fun experience. Also dealt with cash and never had a problem with money at the end of the night.

good,Great company to advance with. Great opportunities to explore.
good,typical day was like any other work your hours and go. I learned about people. Hardest part of job was waiting to get paid. Most enjoyable part was looking for new positions to come open to advance sometimes.
good,wasn't at this job for this long but I really enjoyed working overnight the hours were perfect
good,No negatives or postives about the company. It's a regular job with regular benefits.
good,"Dinâmico com pessoas que gostam de trabalhar em equipe. Fornece estabilidade, convênio dentário e hospitalar. Passa suas culturas e valores que usams em nosso dia a dia"
good,They are more worried about money then helping the employees learn about the jobs
good,Managers are sometimey except for the store manager. The job is loaded with hard work but is simple to do.
good,"always got there early, then start work right away. i did stock, cashier, and IMS. very tiring nights, worked overtime"
good,"Changing Oil, Selling Tires, and daily routines for automotives."
good,Walmart is an enjoyable place to work with a family oriented environment.  The work each day varied somewhat depending on the size of the delivery truck we received.  Working as team was extremely important in order to get the truck unloaded in a timely fashion.
good,"it's a nice workplace. there's a lot of lifting of merchandise, stocking and zoning, that's the core part of being an overnight stocker. the hardest part of the job is when there's a great volume of merchandise that comes. the most enjoyable thing is that you learn and do displays of products for the opening of the store with the consent of the immediate boss, of course. the pay doesn't meet my expenses though this is my bread and butter for now.  That's why i am looking for additional job on my days off even as an on-call as a Certified Nursing assistant or any job that i can work during day time."
good,"assigned a register for the day, organized and cleaned my area then on to checking out customers groceries.  Manager would come and get me to cover breaks at the customer service desk , there I would cash checks, return merchandise, Money Gram.  I will go back to my regular register after breaks are done and then go back when the regular customer service girl goes home.  I will then close the customer service desk , clean and organize."
good,tipico llegar a trabajar en el area y esperar la descarga del trailer asi tambien separar la mercancia para mandarla a sus areas.
good,I liked working the night shift it was a lot of fun and you got a lot of work done. meeting all the different customers that come in and out at night  being trained on how to do all the different departments
good,"co-workers were great, management was super, typical customers,"
good,"Walmart provides plenty of education for you to grow"
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart starts with walking in the door, proceeding to the time clock and admitting to yourself that you are officially there. Then the procedure begins with walking to the customer service desk and signing off slips for recently returned merchandise, verifying proper procedures and guidelines have been followed and that all is well, at the moment, for the customer service associate(s). Proceeding on, the Customer Service Supervisor podium needs reviewed and balanced to maintain cash flow in and out of the registers. A constant total must be maintained within the podium to produce needed small or large change when needed. Next steps involve reviewing staffing and break/lunch positions, reviewing if any one needs to be going anywhere other than remaining stationary at their register, if any additional help is needed from the sales floor to maintain decent customer to cashier ratios and keep customers steadily flowing through the checkout lines at an acceptable pace. This above all is the focus of the CSS position - always maintaining adequate opened registers to allow maximum efficiency of customer traffic and the HIGHEST level of customer service possible. To BE the best, the friendliest, fastest checkout in the market, that is your goal."
good,Working at Wal-Mart opened my eyes to different things in the workforce.
good,unloading trucks was the only highlight of my day to sweat and push the other guys to work hard and fast.management were good some were bad but over all okay.co workers were hard at first but came along fine as we worked together more.The hardest part about my job was being short handed to unload trucks.i really enjoy interacting with the customers helping them find what they need.
good,"A typical day at work: I work as an accounting office associate at Walmart store. I work over night form Fri, to Monday. I punch in at 10:00PM then get the keys from the manager. Balance the room after I get in the accounting office. After that, I process the pick up 1( process the big bills-over twenty's of register bags)  prepare the first deposit after the pick up 1 ended. Next step I reset ATM. Then  I start process pick up 2- all register bags: count the coins by coins machine and record the amount on the slips. I need to separate the bills, coins, checks, coupons, bottle redemption receipts, refund receipts while I process register bags. "
good,A lot of multi tasking which is why its a perfect job for gaining customer service skills
good,"a typical day i first clean bathooms.,then floors,exits entrances breakrooms then take out trash"
good,"learned a lot about the merchandise, learned how to interact with the customer."
good,"is a friendly inviroment"
good,"Going in at 9pm, Stocking overnight groceries, Getting out at 7am"
good,management doesn't care about overall health and wellness of their employees. They constantly change employee schedule without prior  notice and the employee gets disciplined for it. they say they pay you according to prior work experience but always start you from the lowest they can possibly pay. the only thing thats worth it is the health insurance its low cost and covers a lot
good,"A typical day starts with getting in 5 min early and clocking in. then zoning, stocking product, checking out customers, and assisting other departments... i gained skills i needed badly, like Cashier training and learning how to use the auto registers. management was.... ok... most of the time, often they were just huddled up chatting in their office, or if a customer wanted to speak to a manager at that exact moment they were nowhere to be found... hardest part of the job was being responsible for 4 departments during a late shift when i have only been there a week... most enjoyable part of the job was the other sales associates and most of the customers, along with being able to use my customer service skills regularly."
good,I worked for probably the best manager I have ever worked with the first year and a half I worked here. My work day consisted of frying all the food for the deli hot case and the family meals. I also helped cut fresh deli meats and cheese when it became very busy. I often closed the deli down on the days I worked which include cleaning everything from dishes to the floor. The toughest part of the job was holidays and filling all the orders people place while still serving walk-in customers. I really learned well how to control stressful situations while working here. My co-workers did a good job most of the time and we all got along with each other for the most part.
good,"I got to work all the hours I wanted, and in a department I loved."
good,"After being at Wal-Mart for 22 yrs ( since I was 16) it has lost the core values that I loved about the company."
good,"our department is responsible for filling the sale floor and maintaining the freshest produce possible throughout the day. this includes the removal of poor quality or damaged product, maintaining the cleanliness of the area, receiving truckloads, getting the product out to the sales floor, managing product placement, and the organizing of excess product for storage. all of this is done while maintaining a high level of customer service. i have learned the importance of maintaining back stock in such a way that the proper product goes to the sales floor, planning features to deal with overstock, and to discern the freshness of products i had no previous knowledge in. there are five levels of management above myself within the store, with the department manager being the most direct supervisor. our department works well together without major conflicts, making the work day go by quickly. the hardest part to deal with is being one of the last stores to get feature products. often sale items in the flyers are not available to us until a sale is over, then we get an overabundance once the other stores have had their fill and no longer need it. the most enjoyable is watching the sales rise dramatically after being set on a feature of my design or by merchandising various products into a display to make it more appealing to customers. it is surprising how an item can not sell in one area, but sell very well just ten feet away near another item."
good,"Love the work environment, however I would like a better pay rate."
good,In the beginning the vision centers had a medical environment. It became a retail environment with upper management that had no optical background.
good,"Although the job did not seem to allow room for growth or advancement, it was enjoyable working with the public.  I enjoyed knowing my job and being able to assist customers in the store."
good,"Ringing up customers quickly and efficient. Learned something new every day. Management was great. Co-workers were friendly and inviting. Hardest part of job, nothing. Most enjoyable part of the job was cleaning the store."
good,"Wal-Mart is good to work at especially with the customers and fellow employees. Management takes advantage of their employees and expect way more than what one person can handle. I dislike the time limits that are given to us. So since I have a family to provide for, I deal with it and do what I can. I love assisting customers and the other employees are a joy."
good,"Management here will try to work with you, but they have such unreal expectations that they expect everything to be done when they want it done. Even though we are understaffed in every department. Usually resulting in one to three people having to deal with an entire department or multiple departments."
good,"Walmart is a job that will make you decide one of two things in your life: whether it shall be a career, or to help aid you in another path your trying to go"
good,meeting people and learning different departments. chance for advancement and you get yearly raises
good,"A typical day usually ends in no time. Its very fast pace."

good,"meet tons of new people, and how Wal-Mart works behind the sceen"
good,"heavy lifting, walking all the time, management is never around if something goes wrong, they are sometimes easy to get along with, lifting is the hardest part of my job, what I like about my is dealing with customers and how the customers think they are getting away with a lot of things."
good,before i left walmart i learned a lot more of working with the public.
good,unload the product off the trucks and organize in the ware house.
good,"You will not make much here starting out. Minimum wage to be exact but if you work hard, you will get a raise in a short amount of time. Management knows their jobs and coworkers are friendly and helpful."

good,"a typical day is good day were you get all your work done.ever day you learned something new like stocking , computers .co- works are helpfull and pull there end up..the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and new places ..."
good,Over see the back room   inventory control stock and clean  proper binning and getting staff in proper places
good,"I did learn alot from working at wal-mart.  (merchandising, leading others, and operations)  Most co-workers are very nice to work with. Management could be more hands on instead of stuck in the offices.  The most enjoyable part of the job is teaching, and helping the customers."
good,Great job for a beginner. Learned customer service skill and how to work with others
good,My day was good I did all my work. My job required me to multi task I always had many things to do in one day.  I meet with management on a daily bases.  Went to morning meeting so I could talk to the associated on updates with the company and also any new paper work that needed to be done
good,It was okay in terms of jobs. I really just did what I was assigned and I was okay.
good,"good, fun coworkers. not hard working conditions. very little pay but would give you the hours you wanted up to 36 or 40 hours."
good,I enjoyed helping people find what they needed and setting prices to benefit both the company and the customer.
good,As a customer service agent it was my job to handle the difficult customers and also to make sure they were satisfied with the end result. I was responsible for returning or exchanging merchandise that the customer was not happy with. I enjoyed the hands on customer service part of this job.
good,"Prepare foods, cook meat, operate slicers and weigh scales, food serve."
good,A typical day at wal-mart is stocking shelves and zoning the merchandise. The atmosphere is a lot of team working to get the job done. The hardest part of the job is making sure each and everyone of your customers leave happy.The most enjoyable part of the job is satisfying your managers and your customers so that they return again...
good,Difficult to get needed time off. Working long time between breaks.
good,a kool place for a college student would not want to do it agin.
good,i liked this place of employment but it was only temporary..we always kept busy and all employees did what they were supposed to do. the atmosphere was pleasent to work in but it was only temp
good,"I usually punch into work on time, employees are cheerful, not too found of the Cashier supervisor in the morning."
good,"I was able to learn a lot from my co workers. "
good,This job would not work with my school schedule and they worked me too hard for the little amount of money they paid an hour
good,"Take customers orders, cash out orders. Cooked batches of food such as fries, hamburgers, and other foods."
good,I enjoyed the job great coworkers only complaint is low wages by most employees
good,My co-workers were great people to work with. Daily we serviced customers slicing meat and cheese. Cleaned up the floor and wash room at the end of the day. Management was pretty good.
good,"It's the same thing day in and day out, no appreciation for what is done, just what you didn't do."
good,management made working at walmart bad. They didn't like it when you are friends with other workers but management can go out and get drunk with each other and nothing is said about that.  People believe that they are in titled to something because they have been working there since the store was opened
good,"Ordering, training associates, counting inventory,setting displays and customer service"
good,"Walmart promises you hours you don't receive, schedules WAY fewer people then you need. You are over worked and extremely under paid. Yea the $10 whatever was nice but not when you are getting 15 hours a week..."
good,If you dont want a life and are looking for some fast cash this job is terrible. But if you want to work there forever. Its great
good,"Worked 4 nights a week at ten hour shifts. I learned how to stack cases in trailer in a bricklaying pattern, also use a computer that scanned inventory.The management i thought was fair for the most part. All my co-workers did the same types of jobs i did so we all worked together to achieve what had to be done by the end of our shift. The hardest part of the job i would have to say when holidays when come around because there were not enough workers for the volume of work that had to be done. The most enjoyable part of the job i would have to say would be working with people that would help you when needed help which grew us all closer together more like friends not co-workers."
good,"At Wal-mart, the days are very busy. I have learned about retail, responsibility, and helping others. The hardest parts of this job is having communication between you and other employees. The enjoyable part of this job is the people you get to meet."
good,A normal day was to unload and organize the merchandise then haul it out to the sales floor. I learned how to work with people and how to manage all the merchandise and equipment. The management was cool and laid back but still stern so we wouldn't slack. My co-workers worked hard and had fun while doing it. Id have to say unloading the truck was the hardest part but it was only for the first two hours. I loved the environment and working around all the customers.
good,"fast paced the full 10 plus hours you are there"
good,Wal-mart is slow to promote in each store it is who you know and if your there favorite before you get into management . but it is a stable job and pay could be  a bit more . for the work you do.
good,The hardest part of this job is pleasing everyone.  They have the csm going in all directions and it's hard to be in all places at the same time; especially when there is only one csm on at that time.
good,"I only worked there for a month, it was seasonal for the Christmas rush."
good,"Not a great Workplace, Management was unorganized. Not a lot of opportunity to grow."
good,"Many repetitive tasks, very easy work."
good,I enjoyed my time at Wal-Mart Pharmacy. It got my foot in the door to an overall great work experience. I loved everyone I was able to work with. However I needed something a little more stable and better pay.
good,I had a clear list of regular responsibilities as well as unscheduled duties such as cleaning spills or receiving trucks.  I learned to work quickly and efficiently both alone and with my co-workers.
good,At Wal-Mart I loaded and unloaded 18 wheeler trucks by hand and with utilizing equipment.
good,"It's your typical retail job so you know what to expect there. Working nights, weekends and very little pay. I guess it's up to yo :)"
good,Unloaded and stocked products onto the shelves; Co-workers were like family and enjoyed interacting with them and the customers
good,"Typical work, didn't learn much from working there. Management was no great, Hardest part was working with managers that had know idea about there job."
good,It is a good organization to work for but lack of advancement opportunities
good,I go to work I clock in get on my register for the day I have learned how to count back money to deal with customers the management is horrible. My co-workers are nice and easy to get along with at least the other cashiers anyway. The most difficult part of my job is having to go to work knowing it is going to be a stressful day because I have to deal with one of my Customer service manager always telling me off when I know I am doing everything that I am suppose to be doing and I know I am doing it right to. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to meet new people.
good,"logistics warehouse good if your content, not a lot of chance for promotion"
good,"The management team stands behind their workers and gives support where needed. If a family emergency arises, they work with employees especially if they need time off."
good,It is a great place to work in accordance to hours. It can be a lot of work at times though.
good,"I've been with the company for 8 1/2 years. There has been so many changes. It's not the same as it used to be. When i first started, it was a fun place to work, everyone got along with each other. Now it seems like everybody is at each others throats and doesn't want to help each other out."
good,"I worked third shift at this location which was rough for me. I was however flexible to go almost anywhere that they needed me to go in the store some night I was on the grocery side and sometimes I was on the (GM) general merchandise side.  We would get there and have our nightlight meeting I never knew where I was going to be and I kind of enjoyed that for the most part. "
good,Staying busy getting my work done in a timely manner. Learing how to work with different people and different styles of doing a job. Working with management to get things done on time. Making everyone happy all the time is the hardest. I enjoy putting a smile on peoples faces.
good,stocking can be both fun and back breaking. Taking a shelving blueprint and applying it is very rewarding. I really liked the challenge of creating a seasonal display without a blueprint and having upper management acknowledge my display at a daily meeting.
good,"I input prescription ,log in and put up medication ,wait on customers .The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers."
good,"There are certain areas of Wal-Mart that are easier than others. The harder areas are HBA, Consumables, and Cashiers. These are areas that need constant help. If you are in one of these areas do not expect to ever get what is expected of you done in one day. It almost always takes more than two days to get a task done. Because of this expect management to not always be happy with you. "

good,"This was a good job with great benefits, great pay for what it was, and mostly good people to work with.  Management, however, was not particularly very good at what they did, not that it was totally their fault.  Managers put in an average of 60-70 hours per week, are overworked, and most of the time just don't have time for their employees.  If you can deal with lousy management, this job is not too bad."
good,"It was a good job"

I learned to go a steady pace and stay focused on my job. the manager is nice I get along with them well they say a do a good job and that means a lot to me. I get along with my coworkers I try to help them when I can after my work is complete. the hardest part of the job I guess would be all the lifting that you have to do but im used to it by now after doing it for so long. the most enjoyable part of the job is helping the customers getting the items that they need.

My work day consisted of unloading a truck load or more of merchandise and getting it ready for stocking, there wasn't really anything hard about this job, my fellow employees were a great help. The managers would give advice and let me know if i needed to do something different without berating tones. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to enter-act with my fellow employees."

good,"Wal-Mart is a decent company to work for and I've enjoyed for the most my time there. I would recommend this company as a potential place of employment but not if someone is looking to move up into a higher position within a few years. It takes a while and a lot of hard work to move up in the company, but the plus side of it is they are willing to work with you if your interested in moving to different departments in the store. The thing I enjoyed the most about working at Wal-Mart is managements willingness to work around your personal schedule. "
good,This is a very innovative company to work for. They drive personal development for each individual that works for them.
good,Understanding with school schedule. Management could use a little help when dealing with employees.
good,"The management team was not trained properly, and they showed no respect for the associates. "

I think if they got back to the ethics and respect for their associates it could get better."

good,i worked on the remodeling crew to help finish building the inside of t he brand new walmart passed commonwealth 20. I worked in the electronics department and it was a great experience and eventually chose overnight work as i began to go through school and became a stocker.

good,"I liked working at walmart, But they were unfair at times. My coworkers were great to work with. I was a cashier so the job was none stop till I got a break."
good,"use to like walmart.... these days hate it.. wage blows I have over 10 years in retail three years are with walmart and I am now a customerservice manager/ssupervisor and I am paid 9.90 a hour .... they start people off at 7.75 a hr... medical sucks but better than nothing. No benefits for PT employees. Managment here are all stuck up and refuse to help, unless its complaining they sure love that. under staffed like every walmart. (gotta be able to give salary their big pay checks right....) not a fun place anymore even discounts are horrible. "
good,I hated my manager but loved my co workers. The managers are snobby and don't do any real work.
good,"Not too bad of a job, very friendly people but not all were the nicest. Simple and fun learning experience helped me get another job when it was needed. Too much stress working there for no reason."
good,"My typical work day to work in the meat department as a sales associate.  I also work as a team player and go to whatever department I can do to help out.  Then, on inventory day and if I am schedule to help out with inventory.  If new modulars are needed then I would help out with that.The most enjoyable part of the day is when I have customers come up to to me and tell me thank you for being such an enjoyable person.  I have worked in the deli and meat department and help train others.What I learned about this job is that no matter how much work will be put on you if you put your mind to it you will be able to complete it.  I also, learned that you have to work with anyone and work is a team with others.  "
good,"Depending in what department you work in, the work can be fun or challenging. It can be fulfilling and enjoyable, but can be very hard work for incredible hours."
good,Walmart when i first started was a fun place to work. After some time it was all about stressing the job and everything must be perfect with no time to do it. There is no overtime and you must cut your overtime hours on your lunch. for getting paid almost minimal the hassle is not worth the job
good,"I go to work and before the day even begins there is a lot that needs to be handled. We are considered ""cheaper"" than most pharmacies which enable us to do, undo and redo the work. People want to pay less regardless of the benefits provided by the medication. When working together as a team, things go smooth in most cases. When not working together it is a very undesirable place to work. The hardest part is dealing with a stubborn customer who will not take no as an answer. The most enjoyable part is when a customer recognizes our hard work and is thankful and grateful for our services. "
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the great people."
good,"typical work day consisted of collecting shopping carts from the cart corrals & parking lots, and loading them into the shopping cart bays for customer use. Also had to monitor recycling machines & help customers with large carry out items. "
good,Walmart in my experience was ok at best. The company has a lot of values and history. I worked for two different stores and each of them had management that just seemed like they didnt want to help anyone suceed unless you were apart of their friends. Not to mention they had no trust in their employees. 
good,A typical day working for this company can either run smoothly or be very busy depending on incoming orders. I was forklift certified through this company.  Safety and customer satisfaction were top priorities which is great. 
good,every day was different-advancement was great-management good
good,Wal-mart gave me an opportunity when I needed one. Met a lot of good people and displayed good work ethic.  
good,"I  did customer service  and cashier, helped customers on a daily basis ."
good,"Wal-Mart was a good place to work. There is potential to move up within the company, which is always a plus. I never had any problems with management or co-workers. Everyone stuck to themselves and got the work done. It was a good job when I first moved to San Angelo but conflicted with my schooling once that started. "
good,"A typical work day consisted of:"
good,The only thing I am not happy with is the low pay for the employees.
good,Kept product stocked and also helped customer's. Was a part time job. 
good,"Stocking meat constantly in the meat department"
good,"On a typical work day I would normally be on a cash register in the garden center as that is my department. When there are not many customer on a given period of time, I would be zoning and condensing the areas; to ensure the department is always kept organized.  I was able to gain more knowledge about the different products that were offered in the garden center.  I enjoyed working with my co-workers as they were all very friendly. "
good,"a typical day at work consist of  stock product, setting features , helping customers and preforming other task given by management."
good,"On a day to day basis, customer care and handling cash were the main duties, along with logging incoming and outgoing camera films. How to give very good customer care, doing the inventory of the merchandise, and logging incoming and outgoing camera films. Most of the members of management were fair and respected. Of course, you would have the ones that weren't quite respected. Co-workers were easy to get along with and everybody were willing to help anybody that needed help with their jobs. Dealing with unruling customers when you had to show them nothing but respect. I enjoyed loggining incoming and outgoing camera films and inventory of the merchandise."
good,"A typical day at walmart is very busy. There is alot of multi-tasking and switching direction of what your working on. The customer service part of it is fun you come across many people some are genuine and nice, but then there are others who know if you create a scene at walmart that the customer always wins. It taught me alot about change and working for a big box company with some aspects that are not so great. Being there for 7 years i came into contact with many different managers. Some can be ok and understanding then there are others who let the position get to their head. When i first started i learned alot from managers but walmart is always headed in a new direction so ive noticed that going to a newly hired manager an associate is most likely to teach them instead of the manager developing the associate."
good,"I had the privilege of being a highly competent worker when I was hired. I've been promoted over and over, but alas, the pay does not scale well with the workload. I started out as an overnight stock boy and I'm now in charge of a large department within the store and (yearly raise excluded $0.40) make $0.70 more than when I started."
good,"I work 8 hours a day giving outstanding customer service. I handle cash all day, I help customers find what they need, and educate them about the products. I use computers to pull up orders and to do wireless phone contracts. Some nights I run 3 departments at a time. I volunteer to work all departments of the store"

good,"I worked the service desk and was a cashier when needed. I learned how to handle upset customers. I am very good at keeping my cool and calming them down. My co-workers were easy to get along with. The hardest part of working at Wal-Mart was the holidays, very tiring. I do however like to keep busy. It makes the day go faster. The best part of the job was talking to customers face to face. I love being around people. "
good,My hours are 5 am to 2 pm which works for my evening school schedule. My typical day starts with making sure the whole store balances and there is enough money to run the store.
good,"As an electronic sales associate, I help with the sells of computers, stereos, televisions and various other electrical devices. I am also responsible for displaying the items in the store, handling returns and operating a cash register. "
good,"My position as Features Management Coordinator offers many challenges.  The position is about maintaining the endcap merchandise and the freestanding or ""PDQ"" merchandise.  I have to ensure that each of the 250+ in-store locations are current in the system.  I have brought our store's accuracy rate from the bottom of our market of 9 stores to the top. I have learned a lot about how Wal-mart handles their retail markets, their stocking patterns, and their various marketing approaches.  We have a very good management team at the store level but management is not good at all above our level.  My co-workers are one of the big pluses about working at this store.  We all get along and take care of each other.  The hardest part of the job is primarily due to being at half the average staffing level for a store of our size.  Depending on the position, an employee can be pulled to work many different jobs all day sometimes before they have finished the current job they are working on.  This fire brigade approach is tiring and demoralizing.  The most enjoyable part of my position is that I get to work alone with minimal supervision and establish the criteria whereby I am competing against myself to get my daily goals completed.  This has resulted in great success and job satisfaction for me."
good,I worked in the cash office as an accountant i worked close with all floor managers  and security
good,"Wal-Mart was a good place to work for me at the time, but I never thought of it as a career. However, I quickly grew to appreciate so many of the people I worked with there. All sales associates, and even department managers and assistant managers, seemed to have the same goals of getting the job done so we can get on with the rest of our lives."
good,"My day is answering phones, running the fitting room, doing freight , doing rolling racks, taken care of returns. I am responsible for 2 walkies that runs the store. Plus help any customer that needs my help.Tell the other people in my department what management needs them to do."
good,I worked 3rd shift and it was ok quiet and had great people I was working with
good,"Everyday it was the same thing, pick cases for 10 or more hours in the freezing cold while trying to do it at a fast pace around new people. I learned to work hard, lead others, strive for better for myself, help others. The management was not very good. Half the time you couldn't find them when you needed them. Half of them played favorites with certain workers.  And it felt like only a few knew what they were doing and that the workers new more then they did."
good,Love the job just not enough hours. I had  managers that treated me with respect and cared. just was to many of us working with not enough hours.
good,"iM 22 years old and ive been shopping at walmart for over 20 years. I absolutely love walmart its like the go to store, however working for their company is totally different than being a cutosmer. When i started working for walmart i learned alot about company that i never knew before. "

good,"I enjoyed my time working for Wal mart. Its always busy and there's never a dull moment.

good,Its a good job for the summer. To get work experience and have as reference.
good,They were not very organized and had problems keeping employees.
good,"My time at Walmart was good. ill normally come in  start working I was a cashier my job was to make sure each customer had a friendly but speedy check out , also make sure they found everything they was looking for and 95% of the time they did. my co-workers they were okay they spoke we all got along never a problem with them. the hardest part about working with them was when it started to get crowded I just felt like the (C.S.M) didn't really help us cashiers out  as much as they could .but the most enjoyable part was seeing all the friendly ,happy smiling faces that walked through the door ."
good,A day at Wal-Mart was always busy and full of things to do. There was never a chance to become bored there.
good,typical day at work was cashiering. I learned that cashiering is not something I want to make my career. management was good. My co-workers performed job positions good. the hardest part of the job was trying to stay busy when theirs no customer and my work area is neat and orderly. The most enjoyable part was interacting with the customers. 
good,Walmart is a productive place to work if you want to be treated like a work horse for little pay
good,"While sometimes management can be very helpful, Third shift at wal mart is woefully under staffed, making it a challenge to get everything completed.  The part I enjoy most is the constant moving around I get to do "
good,"A typical day of work consists of stocking shelves and guiding customers.  It is also a an unpredictable workplace because there are many situations where you have to work in different departments that you are not accustomed to.  Management is very serious at wal mart.  They are always making sure their employees are getting their job done, and if you are not performing well, they will not hesitate to get rid of you.  At Wal-Mart all my co workers have a variety of different backgrounds, from part time college students and adults to their late 20's and up.  The hardest part of the job is satisfying management.  The most enjoyable part of the job for me is talking to and helping customers."
good,Its was pretty cool at first but after a while you start to notice the lack in management
good,Pleasing people is really hard to do at that job. some didn't understand all they wanted to to is fuss and carry on really fustrating.
good,you can grow in the company where you will not only learn one thing but numerous things through out the company. the company is big so you can grow fast.
good,"I loved working with my other co-workers and management. They were great to get along with. Hardest part was they did not want you to take any kind of time off, even when using vacation time. I learned a lot at this job, all retail stuff."
good,This was not a bad job until I got fired for basically doing what I was told to do by my team leader.
good,"Being an ""unloader"" at Wal Mart, really opened my eyes to the work life. I made awesome friends, and we had hilarious memories together. When the baler exploded cardboard all throughout the backroom, when we made a maze out of toilet paper, and the night I flipped a pump truck. "
good,"The actual job wasn't bad, but the more you learn to do outside of your job title the more you are expected to do for the same pay. "
good,I really enjoyed the job but daughter got really sick. the job was fast pased and managers and co managers were wonderful! 
good,"I worked as a cashier. My typical day was to run register. I would handle cash, checks, and cards. When I wasn't busy with customers I would have to stock candy and zone merchandise on the shelves. My coworkers were all great. I got a long with everyone and we all worked as a team. Management was not always the best. They did their job with as little contact to floor employees as possible. The hardest part of my job was dealing with angry customers, especially when their problems were all directly related to management. The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with customers on a daily basis. I liked to help customers and give them a great experience at our store. "
good,I really didn't like working there.  The managers at night time really didn't do there jobs and some took it overboard to where people was quitting.
good,"Wal-mart is a productive company, they are the biggest store worldwide. As a cashier it had its ups and its down as with every job. Many of the other employees are nice and friendly, the managers included. The job can be stressful at times.

good,"As well as my other jobs I ran a register. Very simple, and pleasant job. Management was good when I first got hired, but then new management was brought in and they weren't as helpful or friendly. The co-workers turned into friends. The hardest part of the job were unfriendly customers, but that's just the way it goes. I quit due to my pregnancy and management treating me bad because of my pregnancy."
good,I spend my day cooking food and servicing customers who come to the counter.  I also maintain a clean work area using the proper chemicals to keep all food related items sanitary.  I interact with my fellow workers to promote a team effort so the deli runs as efficiently as possible.  The most enjoyable part of my day is interacting with customers.
good,"* Forklift & Walking Stacker Operator"
good,"Working for Walmart is an ever changing, never boring job. Time management skills are a must. Being able to go with the flow is also a must. Working with associates and customers is rewarding when you learn something new and so does someone else.

Preparing your associates for whatever their goals are and being able to better yourself all in the same. "

I was trained very well at my job by my coworkers who were also great.I learned a lot of skills like time management, forklift operating, cashier, and how to stock and inventory backrooms. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the drama at this particular store. Good workers were fired bc of drama among managers..the most enjoyable part of this job was the coworkers and the fact that it was nightshift.which I particularly enjoy."

good,If your motivated you can work your way up at Wal-Mart pretty quick
good,I started out as a salesclerk-cashier and worked my way up to and assistant manager within no time
good,"is a good place to work, i worked several departments and i learn a lot."
good,A typical day at work I would handle the cash register and interact with customers. I learned a little about produce and how to process it at the register in a transaction. I learned what numbers identified each fruit at the register. I never really interacted with management but the work was always at a steady pace. My co-workers were very friendly and easy to make friends with. The hardest part of my job was trying to get the customers out in a timely manner with very few cashiers working in the busy enviroment. I really enjoyed working with the customers.
good,"I worked for walmart as a summer job, didn't really care for the supervisors there, they were rude and always in a bad mood. Fast paced job, costumers were always a pleasure though. "
good,"My job basically required me to provide good customer service, run a cash register, and stock merchandise. I was also required to display merchandise in a neat manner, so that it looked good for the customers and improved store cleanliness"
good,I enjoyed working for Wal - Mart and meeting new people everyday. 
good,"Employment at the retail giant was neither fulfilling nor rewarding in a psycho-social sense, but it provided a level of stability and professionalism that are often missed in times of economic downturn. As a male cashier, I was susceptible to being thrown out into the hot or cold when the carts ran low or when the cart pusher decided to take an extended break or not show up to work. This was impaired by the sentencing to run the service desk when it got backed up or those employees took vacations."
good,Fue una herramienta para empezar mi carrera como cajera y ganar experiencia que me sirvió para otros trabajos.
good,most enjoyable part of working at Walmarts was meeting people and working with them.
good,Good for customer service experience. Worked for this company for 5 years.
good,An ok company to work for. If you want to work for them it's up to you
good,"A typical day at work starts with a safety meeting then its off to our assign tasks. In our areas (otherwise known as our zones) we are responsible for making sure it's swept in the isles as well as under the shelving, moping any dirty spots around the edges, as well as trash and cleaning the restrooms."
good,very good people to work with .I learn a lot I enjoyed helping the people shopping 
good,"A typical day at work is mostly tiring due to long hours and heavy work loads. I was hired as a people greeter and within a few years, I've learned how to do other jobs around the store. I almost learned every position in the store and was seeking to become a manager. I've learned how to check out products and returned them. Also, worked as a phone operator and customer service representative. I did money grams and helped consumers solve their problems. The management in the store was fair but had major problems with their favorability. Work hours were cut if store did not make enough productivity, and holiday hours were too long. At times, the store was under staff and workers had to work extra hours just to meet deadlines. I never had any problems with my coworkers."
good,It was a decent job but people got away with a lot that shouldn't of happened. Management was good and it was a very physical job for me but I didn't mind.
good,"I have a lot respect for the coworkers and am always learning from others,we team together to get the work done,and are mindful of each others feelings,and try to inspire one another.Culling the produce is the hardest part of the job ,looking through every fruit and vegetable to pick out the bad and unsalable. Management are all good people ,that try there best  to make sure we have what we need to do the job as there pressing schedules will permit.Cant say enough about how much i enjoy the co-workers that a short conversation's that help lift spirits.When everything comes together just right and the sales floor is clean culled and filled,the expression on the costumers face that words cant describe is by far the most enjoyable part of the job,and when myself and others face what seemed impossible together we can make it possible. "
good,Fast paced environment that serves as a learning experience.
good,unload freight seperate freight by departments  then bring out frieght onto the sales floor for restocking 
good,"Good times"
good,working here aloud me to encounter a lot of different people my job was to assist with filling and inputting 
good,"start off your day with baking, and preparing for the next day, I learned alot about how to bake bread, the management was extremely helpful, they like to teach and it made your job every easy, people you work with are helpful at times. I enjoyed the people that I worked with! They got along very well and they enjoyed life! They had a passion for what they did! "
good,"I would come into work and make sure the lab was running in good standards.  I learned that a could make a team work extremely well under me.  The management was one of the things that could have been better.  The upper management did not associate much with the area that I ran.  My immediate supervisor always treated me with respect.  My co-workers made us a great team to the level of number one in sales the first year that we opened up.  The hardest part of the job was working late hours and being away from my family.  The most enjoyable part was helping customers and learning about new technology.  The wireless area was not as rewarding for me, because I prefer the creativity of being in the photo lab."
good,"Good job for just turning 18, okay place to work for, a lot of things can be changed to better the employee. "
good,"   I work overnight at Walmart, so around the time I arrive, all the customers are being cleared out of the store. I store is quite messy at the end of the day. Given the location, it really isn't a surprise to me. The associates are quite outspoken and free spirited. There are some that are also quite rude and disrespectful also. Many associates do not have the great work ethic that you would expect but I just make sure I do My part and work from start to finish."
good,"I worked at Walmart for two summers while I wasn't in school. It was a great job for something like this, but I don't think I could work there long term. It was an extremely easy job and paid well."
good,team meeting before every shift stock shelfs all night. learned how to use a price gun. co-workers were good to work with. 
good,"A typical day at work includes stocking the dairy section (i.e. milk, eggs, cheese, and juices), unloading trucks, organizing pallets of groceries, cleaning the cooler and surrounding areas, providing assistance to both customers and other areas of Walmart (i.e. frozen, produce, meat, etc. departments). I have no complaints about management. I was pretty much all by myself when I came into work."
good,Working in the Seasonal department was interesting. The department changed with the season. It made for a fun work environment.
good,as with any retail facility there are always opportunities to advance quickly. You can get a fast education of the industry as Walmart is a multi faceted organization.
good,I have learned a lot about customer service while working at Walmart. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with different people. My co-workers are fantastic and make my job much more enjoyable. 
good,I learned how to give great customer service and the importance of delegating. 
good,"Never expect to do the same thing on a daily basis, There is many different things to do. Expect to meet a lot of new friends."
good,Walmart was once a great and enjoyable place to work. Now its a job.
good,Everyone at the Walmart I worked at was satisfied with where they were in life already.They were un driven but I was always looking for ways to better myself not only for the Walmart company but for future companies to come.The work was fairly easy but I made it interesting by challenging myself to do something better than I did the day before.My favorite part about my job was satisfying customer needs and making sure they had a smile on their face.
good,"a typical day at work consisted of cold temperatures heavy lifting and constant customer interactment. i learned that not all coworkers care about their jobs and that i cannot let it bother me or interfere with my work. the management was on top of there duties but the training i received by coworkers. was confusing and frustrating. most of my coworkers were kind and curtious and friendly. altho one of my coworker started to yell at me in front of customers and i was not only very upset, but i was also embarrassed. the hardest part of the job was the freezing temperatures, and the easiest part was working with the customers."
good,"The job was ok. I loved the people I worked with. I loved some of the managers that worked there. I just needed more hours and more money. What really turned me off about Walmart was that I was scheduled days off and then, would re-check my schedule after that day I was off, and they had me down to work. They would schedule me hours and not tell me. "
good,I learned to manage associates and how to be profitable. Work environment was structured but yet flexible. I enjoyed learning how merchandising products differently can increase sales volume.
good,"great coworkers"
good,My job is just a typical everyday hard working and passionate place.
good,"Awesome place to work. People are willing to teach you to do your job, "
good,Required knowledge of electronic. Stock items and retrieve them as well for the customers. Also would ring out customers. Requires different shifts and no full time was available.
good,"The job is fun. Department Lead easy to work with and great communication skills, no benefits, very strict attendance policy especially for single parents with children."
good,learn with us unloading the trucks and pulling merchandise to the floor it wouldnt be much of a store and alot of missing merchandise on the shelves like the job but got laid off 
good,enabled workers to experience many different responsibilities 
good,I enjoyed the clean working environment! I was placed wherever I was needed. I appreciated the learning experience.
good,"I enjoyed my time here. It was an overall decent environment. I learned a lot during my employment at Wal-Mart. I even walked away with a few good friends. I learned how to operate a pallet jack, how to print labels and give great customer service."
good,"Wasn't very professional, and the managers really didn't care about their employees. "
good,"I ran 4 different areas. Toys- I did price changes, ordered, did seasonal modular changes. Camera dept.- I did the same things. Photo lab- I was able to run and work on the machines, did the ordering of supplies, help customers on the kiosk machines. I had site to store- took care of any problems customers might have with their orders. And the seasonal layaway. You run into a lot of problems in all of these depts. You learn how to deal with this and go on with your day. "
good,i had a decent time with this job. It was a nice job and I was in the one department that I wanted to be in. For the most part the co-workers were fun to work with but there were a few that took some getting used to. My manager however was a different story. I rarely saw her or had any contact with her so as far as her manager skills go I can tell you that she wasn't much of a manager to me at all.
good,"empresa com um excelente plano de carreira,colegas de trabalho maravilhosos excelente treinamento"
good,"I really enjoyed this job and dealing with the customers, as well as, maintaining inventory and some light stocking. "
good,"My duties were to assist customers with online ordering and solve other issues concerning online products and services in a timely manner. I learned how to navigate through new software programs and how to properly calm irate customers down. My coworkers were helpful and humorous. I enjoyed talking to people of all walks of life and interacting with them, making them laugh and letting them know that I was actually there to help them."
good,Easy place to work checking customers out.  Workers tend to get in their groups.  
good,"What can I say?!? Walmart is not a bad place to work. The benefits aren't great but they aren't bad. The customers were usually good to interact with, of course there are exceptions. I mostly see this job as another one that so long as you show up you can keep this job."
good,Dealing with all the associates. Having the day to day interactions that can make a difference.
good,"Everyone knows that walmart is sucky as an employer. Most folks know that they hire people barely above minimum wage on a part time status so they don't have to offer you benefits. I can remember being sent home at 38 hours because I had accrued too many hours for the week so they wouldnt have to hire me full time. With all the money this giant makes, they should be ashamed not to share the wealth. This is why their associates don't show much enthusiasm for working there. This is why most of their associates have to apply for state benefit insurance in order to have any insurance.. This is why their customer service is downright awful. When you treat your associates well, they will generally take care of your customers. But I know walmart doesn't care, because they know that regardless of how customers are treated, they'll continue to shop walmart because generally the stores are a one-stop-shop and generally their prices beat their competitors. "
good,Only worked here a summer but was a good place and better people.
good,"É uma empresa boa de se trabalhar, dá a possibilidade de crescimento e conhecimento. Um bom ambiente de trabalho."
good,"ela não muito boa tem bastantes regularidades, como trocar seu fúncionarios de cargos todas as horas do dia."
good,I actually liked working at Walmart. We could work at our pace and the work was never hard. 
good,"i enjoyed working at walmart, customer service, meeting new people everyday, fast pace."
good,"I typical day consists of me clocking in and checking what is called myguide for any assigned tasks. I start them one by one and they vary from unloading a truck to picking and stocking. Picking is using an electrical device known as a talzon to virtually ""pick"" items from the backroom shelves.So that it can be stocked on the salesfloor by me or another co-worker. I start these tasks and stop them upon completion. I've learned how to use three types of machinery since being employed at Wal-mart:The stacker,forklift,and the electric jack.The management is your typical retail management. They instruct and correct.My co-workers are exceptional workers.The hardest part is the beginning of the day,and once you make it over the hump your golden.The most enjoyable part is the last thirty minutes of my shift."
good,unloading trucks to meet the company needs and working with others learning how to be a leader while maintaing a safety enviorment to work in. one of the hardest part was the job was the hours of work 4pm to 2am. A postive was getting paid every week 
good,Overall it was a ok job that paid decent. Management treated some employees different then others. People would get away with doing nothing and I would get in trouble for little things.
good,"Great people to work with, fun interaction with customers."
good,"Helping people find what their looking for."
good,Labor intensive job cold temperatures working condition. Long hours of standing walking and very manual labor.
good,"work environment is good except for some management team who have little or no respect for their employees. my typical day on the job consists of maintaining a clean and stocked sales floor assisting costumers to the best of my abilities. I've learned a lot working in this establishment and that is that working hard does not get you anywhere but to be utilized.  all assistant managers, zms, including store management take full advantage of their hard working employees.  the hardest part of the job is trying to maintain your department up to par while at the same time your pulled constantly to do somebody elses job.  the best part of the job is the knowledge of merchandise I handle and the ability to make the customers day or shopping experience all more enjoyable."
good,"busy busy busy.. your job is never done, it made time go by. meet all kinds of people."
good,Working at Walmart taught me that some companys just dont care how hard you work at the end of the day its about the company not the employees...But overall I enjoyed my job the most rewarding part was helping people. 
good,"Work started at 10 pm, stocked an isle with merchandise, I learned how to use a pallet jack and talk to costumers. management and co-workers at walmart are very good and lovely to work with."
good,"The day is filled with greeting and serving the customers. Dealing with the co-workers was probably the hardest part of the job; they always talked about the next person and worried about nothing of their business. The management team did not communicate amongst each other which was another problem. Too many managers on the same shift and they all tried to be the chief. It was very unorganized. I didn't find any part of the job hard, but I think it could have been a little better if the managers actually communicated with one another. The problem was that they were all given assignments at the same time. A human is only one person. There is no way several orders could  be carried out at the same time. The most enjoyable part of working with Wal-Mart is working with the people. Maybe because  I am a people person. I found it easier to deal with the public instead of my co-workers including management. I enjoy meeting new and interesting people. It wasn't always a pleasant encounters, but I am trained to handle different types of  situations. I can reason and diffuse most situation. I tried my best to satisfy my customers."
good,I've really learned alot form the Dr. My co-workers made the job more bearable. I would say that the hardest part of the job was trying to please management.
good,Working at the Distribution Center is for hardworking dedicated people. Standing for the majority of the shift and maintaining production is challenging. Friendships are made with other employees which helps the work go faster. 
good,I usually work in the afternoon.  I learned that the human relationship is the utmost important thing in Walmart.  Management is normal.  Co-workers are good.  I had to carry the heavy things (over 50 LB).  People were nice.
good,"Sometimes, after I would clock in and make my way up to the registers, I would immediately find myself red lining, waiting for customers after straightening the register I was assign to up. It was a little boring because I did not have much to do to keep me busy. So I would look for to my breaks because I would typically go into the break room to and listen to my co workers talk and watch them just be themselves. My co-workers are what made the job bearable most of the time, if not all. This was my first job so learned a lot about the retail businesses like Wal-Mart such as how to work a register, how to process a WIC voucher,  and zoning."
good,The job was ok for the most part but they treat u like a number there
good,"Interacting with customers."
good,learning things were easy. just dealing with some coworker was difficult.
good,Guiding customer inside the place was the typical day at work in Walmart. Priority work was customer service. Management concern was safety. Hardest part of the job was you do your best at work and yet management do not care. Meeting people.
good,"stocked shelves here"
good,"As a typical day as a cashier at Wal-Mart, I would clock in and go to my register. I would log in immediately, open my drawer to count my money, and then start taking/greeting customers. I learned great communication skills and also how their cash registers. The management was very focused on their jobs as well as my co-workers(for the most part). The hardest part of my job was dealing with stubborn customers. For example, if a customer forgot his ID to buy alcohol, we would have to refuse the selling of the alcohol causing the customer to go into a uproar. I enjoyed my work because I was surrounded my friendly people and love to communicate."
good,"I would spend my days rotating stock, off loading stock, and cleaning."
good,"Sirve de experiencia y queda cerca de casa. El trabajo significaba limpieza de todo tipo desde depósito baños cajas, hasta juntar papeles en la playa de estacionamiento. Lo mejor del trabajo era el descanso con el cafe calentito."
good,I provided basic customer service to customers in the pharmacy and worked as a cashier.
good,"it was nice while it lasted....i had to transfer stores because of a move for school, I wish I had stayed at my original location"
good,"Temporary job that required interaction with many different kinds of people. Sharing knowledge and having discussions with customers and team members was a daily necessity. The job was fairly easy, and most co-workers were lacking in technological knowledge. Overall and decent part time job."
good,"A typical day at work would be is operating and responsible for cash register.  I would handle cash, credit, check, and W.I.C. transactions.  Also, I would assist customers with various needs.  If there was no customers at my register, I would organize around my register until I would get a customer.  What I learned at Wal-Mart is that I have to be fast to get the job done and that no job is easy.  I would be friendly and try to get along with the management and my co-workers because I would want to leave a good impression upon everyone.  The hardest part of the job was not knowing how each day will go by when working.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people when in need and being around people."
good,"Working at Walmart has definitely enhanced my multitasking skills.  I have found out in retail, things can change on the fly and you have to be able to react but, react responsibly."
good,A typical day at work is mostly geared in Java programming in my area. Sometimes you end up finding yourself doing to many extraneous tasks while trying to develop. A good example is having to press against other teams for assistance when project managers are not reaching out in your place for issues preventing you from continued focus. i.e. when you need infrastructure tasks completed you may find yourself chasing it down rather than the pm.
good,Typical day as a cashier easy and mostly friendly co workers customers hard to handle at times and decent pay and benefits
good,Coworkers and management were friendly but there was a lack of communication between management and coworkers. The company has standards to meet to ensure a safe and friendly work environment.
good,"I spend a large amount of time assisting people with their needs daily. I also work large amounts of freight. My immediate supervisor is very nice and we make a good team. My co-workers are some of the best, hardest working people I have ever known. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing someone truly satisfied with my assistance. "
good,i was a cashier/ stocker the management was good i learned alot on how to be a cashier i really liked my co-workers
good,"Each day was the same thing. I learned how to cope with customers and their complaints. Management was a bit corrupt, messed up schedules at average and they weren't well organized. there really wasn't a hard part about this job.  "
good,"a typical day at work, I learn how to connect cell phones and how pay go phones work"
good,"i enjoyed working for the company, i learned a lot in the 3 years i was there. there is always a chance for you to learn new task, and have a full work day, but on the bad side we were always short staffed and always given more work than the average."
good,I work anything in the backroom that need to be done i alway have a smile on my face eveyone say. The hardest part about work be Management has me doing one then dont want me to do it so start something all over again 
good,"A typical day at work would be overseeing the cashiers on the front end and at the service desk. This includes giving change, doing price checks, and taking care of any customer conflicts. I learn that each day can bring unexpected challenges, for example when we are short handed and don't have enough help. This changes the whole day because now I have to still provide service as if all the cashiers were accounted for. My co-workers are what make my job more enjoyable and keep me in high spirits when I am at work. The hardest part of the job is not having enough help and lack of support from management. The most enjoyable part of the job is service to my customers. If I can help someone out to make their shopping experience more enjoyable then I will do that. Hearing someone say thank you means that I did my job. "
good,"Not a terrible part time job.  You go in, do your work, and go home.  There isn't much more to this job.  But, if you wanted to work your way up to a manager, it is possible."
good,wal-mart is an alright company to work for. the pay isnt to great but benefits are actually OK.
good,The job itself is fantastic if you can get along with management and the politics.
good,"A typical day for me starts by being on time to work than get any assignments and start my day.  I have learned that team work is very important both to employer and employees.  I have always gotten along with my employer because i know that I'm here to work my shift follow along with the rules and ask for help if needed. I have not had any problems with my co-worker that i can recall.  I am easy to get long with and if we can help each other if's makes a good work place. The hard part of a job for me is learn a new skill within a very short window of time like half of hour however, when learned it's a skill forever, To know that I am doing the best job possible and helping others."
good,i learned that people depended on me in order to take care of their monthly and weekly financial needs
good,"I did many positions while at walmart to include stocker, cashier, assistant supervisor, and cart pusher. The schedules rotate some days you work mornings, some mids, and swings. you learn to work with all kinds of people and how to work around customers. "
good,I liked working at walmart just because I liked my job I liked working with the customers but my bosses treated the employees unfairly. I didn't want to leave my job but I was always walking on egg shells.
good,"Unloaded freight to but down the island you are on to stock the shelf's and help others if I got done,"
good,"Being a WalMart cashier/customer service helper is a very upbeat and on your feet job.  I did not like the price matching part of the job or having to push carts, but aside from those two things it was a really nice job.  Management was alright except for the fact some managers will tell you one thing, and then some other managers will tell you a completely different thing regarding the same policy.  My co-workers were friendly and I actually got a long with all of them.  Also the most enjoyable part of the job is when people would tell me how polite and respectable I am and that me being that way made their day a lot better.  I love putting a smile on a customers face and seeing them walk out of the store happy instead of angry or feeling like nobody wants them in the store."
good,I enjoyed working with others at this job and helping out the customers.
good,"changes like a drop of a hat"
good,I worked the security side of the store and we never received credit for risking out lives to protect store assets
good,"Unless you've got a management group that has a good system running amongst themselves, life at work can be sometimes confusing. Other times, there isn't any management at all. I can't say for all of the stores Walmart owns but the one I worked at was hectic. Employees disappeared often, management was hard to locate and seemingly avoided their walkies. Most employees were reliable but some were flat out lazy! Even after reporting them, nothing came of it. "
good,Nice place to work just management does not communicate well with eachother other than that a good place to work.
good,"Not enough employees to cover some of the jobs so I am always asked to help and I always step up to be part of the team.  Always busy and I like it that way.  "
good,"Working here was okay, but there was definitely room for improvement. I worked overnight and it seemed like we always got the short end of the stick when it came to how we were treated. More than once we were made to stay over our regular shift because someone fell behind. However, it's a great job if you're not much of a ""people person"" as the Wal Mart that I worked at was relatively slow at night."
good,"Typical day at work would be taking back returns cashing checks and sending moneygram"
good,Walmart has many different positions that allow associates to gain valuable experience. 
good,Bouncing from one potision of the store to the next not getting paid what every one else made in those different departments
good,Busy but a good experience.  I learned a lot about what it takes to work in the community.
good,"I learned how to stock certain items, how to use a pallet jack, how to help customers with their needs and provide a safe working environment for all. "
good,I worked here while attending college and can say that the benefits were better than expected. It was a great learning experience as well and presents many opportunities for growth. 
good,"It is a good work out."
good,"Un trabajo arduo, muy interesante , y bastante exigente y eso me encanto , pero mi proyecto de vida va en busca de un empleo donde aterrize mis conocimientos en lo que estudie"
good,"It is what you make it. It's one of those places where you get what you look for, but I guess that's life."
good,"great job security, the benefits compare well with other companies, pay is better at Sam's "
good,"Working at Wal-mart taught me how to deal with customers face to face daily. I handled stocking as well as receiving while also working over the jewelry department. Actually, working with customers in Wal-mart prepared me for being a CSR at Telvista."
good,"Trabajo eventual, en el cual nos dedicábamos a cobrar a los clientes, mantener limpio nuestro sector. Con el descanso que correspondía. Exigentes a la hora de la rendición de la caja diaria, con muy buenos conceptos desarrollados. "
good,I would clock in for work head to the hub/ computer to find out what I was doing for the day. Started out unloading the truck(s) for the day. Go on 15 minute break usually once done unloading. Return from break and my job would be sort merchandise in boxes that came in individually as to what department the item went to and in several of the departments it would also be broke down as to what aisle it was located on. Lunch break for an hour. My co-workers where all guys that didn't really have any manners at all because I was the only female team member on my shift. Management would occasionally come to the back either to try to find an item or see as to how everything was going. After lunch break would pull freight on pallets to the sales floor for the overnight associates to stock. If time allowed would pull merchandise out of the bins in the backroom for other associates to stock. The absolute hardest part of the job was the lifting and tugging while unloading the truck and the hours that I was working because it was real late evenings. I really enjoyed pulling merchandise out of the bins in the backroom that would be used to stock the shelves with.
good,They will work around your schedule which is the best thing about walmart
good,"Wal-Mart is a busy place to work for and in some cases not all of the management are on the same page with certain issues. The Customer service does tend to lack, however there are some associates that go out of their way to make sure that the customers are satisfied."
good,A typical day as a cashier at Wal-Mart I would clock in and find the CSM for my register assignment.  I started to learn the customer service desk but later was transferred to the pharmacy department.  I really enjoyed working in the pharmacy.  There was more to do and more skills to learn.  No day was ever the same unlike same routine at a cash register.
good,"Fun place to work, good culture values, nice people, and an entertaining job."
good,"This job is great for learning people skills and solving associate issues. Working closely with management and associates has a positive impact on time management and prioritizing skills. Good opportunity for engaging and recognizing associates. "
good,"The co-workers at Wal-Mart are great. Although I can't say the same about all the members of managment. I learned quite a bit while I was employed there though. Such as how to work a new cash register with multiple opporating functions. I also learned how to work a Telxon gun, binning and picking merchanise in the backroom."
good,checked out customers at registered helped customers locate items
good,typical workplace for walmart dealing with rude customers who just take advantage of your kindness
good,"All jobs as there things that people don't like, but the days I spend at Walmart yes I do really feel I make the best of it, keep a positive attitude, but we work in a box and everyone else's attitudes can rub off on you. There is a lot of stress. Walmart policy is confusing one minute we have to do it this way the next you know it has changed. I have learned a lot what the meds are how to do some management jobs. My co-workers are great. The hardest part of job is not letting the atmosphere bring me down sometimes it is not good exspecially since there is no stability. We have had a pharmacist (manager) fired and another brought in just to leave us for another store and right now there is a temporary pharmacist, they cant find anyone that is interested the position. The most enjoyable part of my job is the co-workers and some customers."
good,"Ive to be a hard working  person takes patience and having pride in your work.  I've learned alot from management and how to help team member's enjoy their job not just for the paycheck.  Being employed makes a person have a self worth not only in job, but homelife too. I love helping people."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be clocking in and going to my department (which is jewelry) and placing jewelry orders and call customers back with the status of their order. I also assist in other departments in the store when needed. "
good,My personal experience with Wal-Mart  is the managers are really nice and all the employees that I have worked with. Wal-Mart didn't really have a lot of negative or rude customers when I was working there.
good,"A typical day at work was busy not crazy. I've learned that you really have to let certain words or comment from some customers go. Managements are just too busy to pay any attentions to their workers. Co-workers are pretty nice and friendly. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unhappy customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you were able to help the customers with their needs."
good,I didn't work during the day because I would babysit in the day and work at Walmart at night. I learned work with others you have to be a team player. I feel like management could of been more in control. The hardest part of the day was dealing with co-workers and customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was that at the end of the day I was going home. 
good,Walmart is a company where who you know is everything. Enough said.
good,"I really enjoy working with the customers. I met all kinds of people and learned alot about life. Definatly would not want to make a career of i"
good,with the exeption of a couple managers this place was great for a first job
good,"Good place to work with people, It seems as if the job changes just a little bit every day."
good,"Customer service, merchandising, and cleaning."
good,"Regularly as an associate, I've taken the initiative to order any needed resources and supplies, assisted in inventory tasks, provided constant professional and friendly customer service, trained any incoming associates, and assisted in any position when needed. My co-workers were enjoyable and easy to work with, although much of the store's management team is unsuccessful in their efforts to show respect for their associates."
good,Learned to run Register and more info on using tools for inventory
good,"Walmart is a great place to work if you don't mind walking around on concrete most of the day. The hours are ok, but the benefits are so-so."
good,This is an okay place to work.  The work can be demanding but is rewarding.
good,"worked in a fast pace enviroment"
good,"There was nothing special about working at Wal-Mart. I felt like I clock in, do my job then go home. It wasn't spectacular nor was it rough and difficult. "
good,"Good company to work for, at least back then. Door greeter back then stood near the entrance and was often faced with unpleasant customers who would dump their frustrations on the first person they see."
good,"A day at walmart in the clothing department was to put up returns, make sure area was clean, be a phone operator, deal with customers within the store, and having a positive attitude at all times."
good,"bake, prep bakery, stock area, customer service, Deli prep"
good,"Worked there for a day so just cleaned and maintained the work space, didnt really learn anything important there co-workers were chill guys older guys hardest part working late hours most enjoyable part was that i was close to home wasnt a far drive,"
good,"Typical work day included operating a cash register, and stocking.  I really enjoyed working with the public and providing customer service. "
good,"- Assisted the manager with the daily store operation,"
good,Deals with unloading trucks and placeing merchandise on a pallet to be sent to to the floor for stocking. I have learned how to operate many different machines dealing with the unloading process. Management is very clear in giving instructions on tasks that have to be followed.The co workers do a good job with team work so all of the work is not put on one person. When you can't help a customer find what he or she needs. When you help a customer find what they need and it is for a good pirice.
good,"easy going place to work. good work environment, really helpful people and staff."
good,loved  the  people  i  worked   with  they   felt   like  family  hours  were   the   greatest   but   if  its  ust  you   and   you   dont  have  a  family   to  supposrt  it   be  okay   
good,"It's not a horrible place to work when you're young and need a decent part time job. I wouldn't exactly recommend trying to make it a career, but there are opportunities if you choose to do so. If you're looking for part time work, and maybe to move up in the company later, it does offer some promotions within the company. It's hard to really review the company as a whole. Each store is different. "
good,Aprendi uma profissão evolui profissionalmente!!!!!!!!!!
good,"Helping Irate customers"
good,I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart. I always stayed busy and there was never a dull moment.
good,"I loved this, my first position as a Pharmacy Technician.  I was hired on as a part-time employee, but new management came in and only wanted full-time employees, so I was eventually edged out.  I did obtain knowledge needed to complete most jobs, but as a part-time employee, I was unable to keep up the numbers the full timers had, which ended in my termination.  The job itself was rewarding, very interesting, challenging, and fun.  I enjoyed working w/my co-workers, and of course our clients/customers were, for the most part, great!!  Looking forward to a new experience."
good,"management needs to communicate better, overall not a bad place to work."
good,I go in and do any thing they need.  I work sporting goods and I work in all departments for them.  I take care of my customers at the the counter and zone my department.  I work picks and pull merchandise out of bins and stock it. I help unload trucks and organize freight.
good,"I stocked grocery shelves overnight at a Wal Mart Super center. I learned about merchandising and signing product. I worked along side an assistant store manager to accomplish receiving tasks. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, although the hardest part was the language barrier. (I only speak English). The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to give good customer service. "
good,It was fun to work here I learned new skills such as how to stock items and zone areas. Management was reasonable but some got praised more than others. My co-workers and I all got along as well as working as a team to get the job done.
good,"They aren't horrible to work for. But it's retail, which means working weekends and holidays. This is just the way of retail. But the people I worked with were great. I did enjoy the management and even working with the public wasn't bad. The main problem was the pay. "
good,Help customers and associates. Help other associates in different departments. Co-workers are mostly great to work with. 
good,"It is a very good stepping stone job to expand your working experience,you can also switch departments to get a different work feel"
good,It was an okay job. This was my first job and I learned cash handling and customer service there. I liked the people that I worked with and the management were always around to help out where they could. 
good,"Busy ordering, stocking and managing employees. Working for Walmart was awesome, management though was the hardest . I love working with my co-workers."
good,always busy crazy shifts but meet great people.the hardestpart about this job is dealing with management.
good,"I enjoy working with this company it has been almost 10 years. I am ready for a career change. Wanting more out of life by helping others, and assisting to their needs. I have learned a great deal by working with others as well as on my on. I have worked with many types of people and many different situations. I consider myself a hard worker and very caring. I enjoy making a difference for the better. My typical work day is customer service and working as a team to complete the tack ahead. The hardest part of my job is there is not enough time in the day. The most enjoyable part of my job are the people I work with and serve."
good,"great at times ! there was good days and bad days"
good,"Show up to work, work shift and go home.  Usually management left hourly employees alone as most were well trained to do jobs.  Management was at times enjoyable to work with depending on the individual from extremely nice to a few who were literally a pain the neck at times.  Co-workers were on average good to work with except for lazy and uncaring individuals who were there only to get paid for work not done.  "
good,"Be ready for a challenge...on a daily basis, the scope of the job is basically the same, but the parameters you have to work within could drastically change."
good,Most challenging part about working at the Wal Mart is having to work in an unorganized enviornment.
good,"Unloaded 18 wheel trucks for wal-mart it was a really demanding job, fast paced and good environment.  i really did enjoy working here while i was there but again the money just wasnt there."
good,Daily task program with freight making sure to get the job done in a timely manner.
good,I believe that they may have grown to large.  Management guidelines have changed to a point that having people skills is no longer required.
good,it was fun working for walmart for a while then I started disliking it because of the mgrs their because they had their favorites
good,A job where there was always something to do. Always busy and required employees to work extra hours from time to time.
good,"I worked for Wal-Mart for three years. In the time that I worked for Wal-Mart, I was treated fair. The only problem was not having enough coverage in all area of the store. The management could have done better with scheduling. The typical day at work, was making sure all the customers were taken care of in a timely manner, and making sure that merchandise was fully stocked. I learned to deal with all sorts of customers. I also learned how to sell wireless phones, which was a great experience. The co-workers that I worked with were always nice, and fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was making sure the customer left happy, if the customer did not leave happy, that would make their shopping experience a bad one. Most enjoyable part of the job for me was, all the learning experience that I gained in the amount of time I worked for Wal-Mart, and meeting new people."
good,Productive and management was not good. they need to have better benefit for employees
good,Normal responsibilities a casher would do. Fast paced is required
good,"I enjoyed working with the customers, co-workers, and some of the mangers. I really enjoyed the older customers and being able to help them find what they were looking for or helping them cash their checks or send money to someone or pay their bills. "
good,good place to work. Employees stay a long time and the pay is decent but they don't give enough hours. depending on where you work you can either be on a register or stocking. 
good,A Massachusetts Walmart store was the only place that would hire me at a dire time of need. I will be forever thankful. Employment ended for me upon graduating with a medical degree.
good,"I gave Walmart Superstore 2 years of my life. The most enjoyable part of my job was the customers (most of the time.) I also liked working with my immediate co-workers out in the parking lot. Pushing and pulling carts for 2 years took a toll on my body specifically my shoulders. The weather was one of the worst aspects of the job; either it is too hot in the summer, or freezing cold/raining in the winter. The early morning shift would help with the summertime. "
good,Greet customers and check them out as quickly and efficiently 
good,Worked directly with customers and salespeople to develop a quality action plan.
good,"Overall I like doing the job I do and being responsible for the 2 highest profit departments in the store, I just feel I am underpaid by a lot. My day usually begins with price changes, then its on hand corrections. After I usually help the stockers because the store is always short staffed on stockers. I bin and pick merchandise. Build displays. Deal with vendors on a daily basis. My co workers are great and a lot of time we share the same frustrations as far as pay goes, but we get a great sense of accomplishment and pride in our jobs. One of the hardest parts about retail jobs is time. I am not salary and could only work 40 hours a week. Getting promoted has become a frustrating effort."
good,could be better if they would just let you do your job.   They expect you to take 12 poses of families when the family doesn't want anymore then 6 or 7
good,"Working for walmart was a good learning experience for retail, most of the employees were hard working but the management structure could use some work"
good,i liked it there because i got to work on cars. i like getting my hands dirty. i would go back there if they payed better
good,"Although I enjoyed my job and working with the people, the ever changing rules were hard to work around. My job with them was secure and I could count on the same hours every week so that was good. I got to work in many positions here and got a lot of experience. "
good,"I feel that it really depends on your location and who you work with. I worked at two different stores and had two completely different experiences. I felt that this kind of job is not really for anyone looking to advance unless you want to bend over backwards for some people. Their advancement system is based on a computer system that takes account of performance evaluations, how many days youve missed and wheter or not youve been late. It takes alot of the personal aspect out of it. Ive seen plenty of people who didnt do much get promoted just because they had a good record, but people who worked in departments that were a bit more fast pace and they had excellent reviews, they didnt get a promotion."
good,"Walmart allowed room for advancement, but the time frame to advance was very limited. "
good,Walmart was a steady cleaning job.  I worked hard in Walmart and was liked by my supervisors because I did a very good meticulous job.
good,Answered all phone calls and directed as needed... Not enough hours to stay employed
good,"Quick paced environment with considerable upgrades to procedures on a constant basis. Productivity oriented to get more done with less,but often customer service was compromised. I enjoyed helping customers and training associates to be the best they could be"
good,"I have learned a lot about running a company while working here, both the good and the bad. It is a stressful job and you never know what you will be working on from one day to the other. I have had to learn to roll with the punches. My co-workers are like a box of mixed nuts but are top notch people and are willing to stand by you in a crisis. "
good,"The job wasn't bad. I liked working the registers, but in the end I chose school over the money."
good,"eight hour shift"
good,"As owner of Version5 Consultants, wrote a Contract for the Installation and Development of a new software for HYPER-MART Store in Topeka, Ks. Reporting directly to the founder of WAL-MART Corporation, Samuel Walton, I had the opportunity to be involved in changes for the Cash Center of the Store. Moved to Des Moines, IA., as Technical Sales Associate, after two years I was assigned to Analyze the Systems for the New Store (Jordan Creek), install the cash registers(32) under the initial help of the Philips Corporation, ;providing the equipment for the installation, also for the Visio Center and Pharmacy including the hardware necessary, and testing. I was placed in charge of the group, trained and instruct users. During the year "
good,i would get to work and start unloading the truck and puting it all on palets. i learned to be quick at my job and have it be right.
good,"clocking in and starting my day"
good,You must have tough skin to deal with daily obstacles of this company. Great stock options.
good,"This company has lost its values. You used to feel save going to work, before I quit, the company was letting go many long term employees. Prior to this, this was a great place to work."
good,cashier and stocking was basically all i did. the hours were good the pay was bad. enviorment was good.
good,Learned how to deal with all types of people and how to stock merchandise correctly.
good,"I started at Walmart in 2000 thinking that i would be there for six months till i found something else and it turned into 12 years. I worked in almost department in that store . From frozen food, back room, sporting goods and many more. I was learning as much as i could. I most enjoyed the people that help me grow to be a manager in that same store. With all the hard i put in the long hours help me to grow and take care of my family."
good,"Fast paced team/individual work environment, extreme patience needed to deal with all types of personalities. Hardest part of job is doing your best to keep customers happy. Most enjoyable part of job was getting to know a lot of different people."
good,"I was an over night cashier,The management sucked,I did like my co-workers.The hardest part of the job was when I was first starting out,the most enjoyable part of the job was when the managers left you alone and let you do your work"
good,"It became a very routined schedule,there wasn't much room for growth. The management team was fair,I enjoy working with others so I had great co-workers, The hardest part of the Job was staying interested,but the most enjoyable part was being able to meet new people and provide great rewardable service."
good,"good managers, low pay, nonexistent benefits, typical workload, customers can be angry, low amount of hours, good for military members"
good,Permanent policies would be changed by management and pepole would always talk bad about other pepole.
good,As an cashier the job was okay. The pay wasn't so good when I was working there not sure if it has went up or not.
good,Communicate verbally and in writing to answer inquiries and provide information.
good,"A typical day at Walmart starts off slow from around midnight to 9:30am, so an employee is able to restock grocery bags, empty trash cans, clean the register and belt, and do re-shop on items that don't belong in a particular area, as well as assist customers when its slow and busy. I learned the various vegetable and fruit codes, so that i could move at a faster pace and be able to move my line of customers along faster. I also learned how to process regular checks as well as WIC checks. The management is fine to work with, however when it gets busy it is very hard for managers to take care of situations in a timely fashion. My co-workers were very nice and work at a fast pace like myself. The hardest part of my job was doing exchanges on items because I very seldom had a chance to practice doing it. The most enjoyable part of working at Walmart for me was putting a smile on my customers faces."
good,It was stressfull at times but a good place to work at. the people was ok to work for
good,A typical day at work would be clock in get to work help customers stock shelves zone areas help with cashiering if needed
good,um i liked working on the till but it was too long days working by just standing i like a job where i keep active and learn more everyday.
good,A typical day is is filled with excitement. The management team there is very helpful and kind.
good,It was the graveyard stocking shift. Good co-workers and a good store to work for.
good,"A typical day at work involved cashiering, restocking, and customer service. I learned a lot about being patient and trying not to take things personally (you deal with a lot of angry people being a cashier at Walmart). It really helped develop my patience and my backbone when dealing with stressful situations. Management was so-so, they would forget my breaks now and then, and demanded a lot of hours out of you (which makes you tired and stressed all the time). My co-workers were friendly, and I made a lot of friends when I worked at Walmart. The hardest part of the job was how demanding and stressful it could be. The best part was meeting so many different people, and becoming close friends with your co-workers."
good,"A typical day at work wasn't too easy, wasn't too hard. Had to work in a lot of other departments other than the one I was hired for. Co-workers were great."
good,"The best part of my job as the OTC Manager at Walmart was the interaction with the customers. I was responsible for special orders, which gave me a sense that I was going the extra mile to take care of my customers' health care needs. I also enjoyed the many price comparisons and research into new innovative ways the help the customers. The difficult part of the job was in the fact that I was to answer to three hands on managers, each with conflicting tasks set for me to do in their minds. For example, I was told by one manager that I needed one more four-way shelving stand. Another manager told me that I could not have it, never taking into account that the other manager had assigned the task of setting one up. There was not enough communication between the managers, and when I addressed the issue of the conflict, I was yelled at, like I was the one causing the problem."
good,"walmart was great enjoyed working there, they provided flexible hours while advancement opportunities arose."
good,"The first few years of my job at Wal-Mart of Hartwell were pretty good, making good money and getting good benefits. However the last year that I worked there, things turned sour. I was stuck in a certain section of the store and was looking to be promoted to a better position but I couldn't get it past the management. Also the demands of the job had become unreasonable as of late. They were essentially asking us to squeese blood from a stone. I figured there might not be much of a future for me at this store so I decided to quit. Still, from my experience it was at one point a decent place to work but with the coming of the troubled economy, I think it took it's toll on management and then management took it's toll on us associates."
good,"Everyday at Wal-Mart was dedicated to creating the best shopping experience for the customer,"
good,You are expected to do the work of many people with very little help!
good,The job was very fast paced and required you to think on you feet responsibility
good,"Open customer service desk, helping customers with returns/ exchanges, paying their bills, processing money orders, doing money transfers via money gram. Learned to work with difficult situations and make the most out of it. Enjoy working with my co-workers, and being a team player. The most difficult part is handling unhappy customers and making them happy and satisfied before they leave the store, to listen to their needs and help in any way possible."
good,"Customer service is the most important part of working at Walmart. A welcoming personality is key to enjoying this job, or any job for that matter."
good,"The pharmacy is always busy, there is never enough help, there are 3 places where you have face to face contact with customers which should be covered plus someone has to answer the phone and count medication. We were lucky if we had 2 people there most of the time and people don't like it when there prescription is not done when they were told it would be, which happened a lot depending on which pharmacist was there."
good,I felt racism while working there. They would check each and every item of a brown people and when they are white they wouldn't care if we missed an item. I asked a week off for my sister's wedding and they kicked me out.
good,um lugar onde é muito exigido de nós mas muito agradavel de se trabalhar.
good,"Walk the floor with the evening manager to find out what special projects need to done or what departments need more attention or that has a lot of freight to be worked before store opening. Hold beginning shift meeting. Assign the staff areas to where they need to work. Hold weekly safety meetings. Hold monthly grass roots meeting. This is where the staff can bring up any concerns, or have ideas to make job better.Teach new staff of protocals and procedures when working on the floor."
good,I was always busy and I like that about a job. The only thing I was upset about was I would always get pulled through out the place and my job title was for photo lab and I enjoyed being a lab tech for photos. I maybe spent a couple of hours back in photo lab for a day because I would always get pulled. I loved talking with customers and helping them. I enjoyed my job the most was because I got to talk with the customers.
good,"My typical days at work used to be mostly busy and sometimes slow but I always managed to find something to keep busy during the slow days. the only thing i did not like is my schedule, i had to work different shifts in different days."
good,"fast pace customer service detail, team player co-workers are good people to work with. management is easy to work with. the hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers. helping other people is the most enjoyable part of the job"
good,I made sure product was on the shelf to fit the customers needs. My most enjoyable was my customers and suiting there needs.
good,"Very productive, busy, good customer service. There is no hard part and what I find most enjoyable is assisting customers and making sure that they have a good shopping experience."
good,A typical day at work a lot of moving around and moving things.
good,"Kept you busy, great interactions with co-workers and managers."
good,"My review isn't about the job, it's about my experience at the interview at the Barrie North location."
good,"its not the job you sign up for, people there have bad attitudes because of the job"
good,Stock shelves in different aisles
good,"A typical day of work consists of me checking the Customer Service Desk and gathering my department's returns. At times throughout my shift, I may be called to be on a register to help get customers flow out of the store as quickly as possible. Mostly, I clean out the fitting rooms, zone the merchandise and at times work in the Jewelry Department. I show customers items from our display cases, answer any questions, sell protection plans for certain items and answer phone calls regarding inquiries and our departments."
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart was always fast paced. As a cashier I made sure the cusotmer found everything they needed easily and if not I tried my best with assisting them with their needs. I would cash them out in a fast and friendly manner and payed attention to detail with the way I bagged their items. I was also able to learn and broading my skills within the company by learning how to work the customer service desk. Working the customers desk consists of helping customers make returns in a fast and friendly manner, cash handling for returns, money orders, and western union payments. My co-workers were great because they always tried to make the most of their work day. The hardest part of the job would be getting the long lines down, because nobody wants to wait all day at a store to be cashed out."
good,My time at Walmart was a great learning experince I learned alot about retail.
good,They were very strict about breaks/lunches but no one was willing to make sure you could go to break on time
good,"A typical night at work was unloading the truck and stock the store. I enjoyed working with my co-worker. the hardest part of the job was leaving it, and the most enjoyable part of the job was going to work when ever I was needed."
good,fast past busy surroundings. standing for long hours at a time.
good,"I have never worked for a company so willing to work with an individual to get them the time off requested. There are many positions at Wal-Mart, if you are not satisfied in one then there is always another one to try. There are many associates that come and go at Wal-Mart for varies reasons. The work load at times can be overbearing but as long as you do your best than you have nothing to worry about."
good,Very nice co-workers and management. Loved being challenged with daily demands.
good,"customer service,teaching and training , reports, budgets,fun people to work with."
good,"Meeting people from all different walks of life, helping with there shopping needs from band aides to bananas. It's a great place to sharpen up on your people skills. Sam Walton left a great goal for all employee's to reach , great customer service is our goal! The great people that you meet working at the Wal-Mart stores are people for your community, churches, schools, gyms, and your job also. Just everyday people with smiling faces and a willing to help with your shopping needs. This is not a hard place to work at to be honest, but being short staff from time to time makes it very awkward to run the front end. I enjoy the faces of a happy shopper that come up/comes back and give comments on the great customer service they have receive from one of the employees or from myself!!"
good,I had 8 hours shifts maybe more i would check customers and ask the managers what tasks needed to be completed today before i get off i would water the plants help customer with loads if they get any bricks or etc. check to see if the bricks are strait or needed to be moved if so i would use the forklift to move them if customers need something off the highwall i would use the scissorlift to get it down I would zone the whole department if needed go to other departments if need be
good,"A typical day on the job included unloading a truck, stocking the shelves or retrieving the carts outside to be put in the bins. Most often the co-workers that were around were very competent in their own personal jobs however when it came to others trying to make them understand how you did things was difficult. I wouldn't say things were enjoyable or un-enjoyable, however i would say that the whole experience was unique as a whole."
good,"I come into work, collect carts for 5 hours, then leave. No socializing just work."
good,"Most staff keep to themselves in close-knit groups, customers for the most part are friendly, some are impossible to please. It's not a bad place to work by any means, not glamorous either."
good,Learned to lead a vast number of people and learned the ability to multi task.
good,Started work at 7am Monday through Friday and was always ready to go. Walking throught the doors put my hard hat on and would make sure my knife and leaterman was on me and would await orders. The last week of the job was to recover all missing parts to everything and to put the extra parts in one pile till their home was found.
good,A typical day at walmart was great at times but i loved and enjoyed my customers and my co-workers. I waorked at a cash register everyday were i assisted customers as in if there was an item they did not find I would try and find out if we still carried or have the item. What I learned at walmart was the values of a workplace and thatt customers are always right and to never argue with a customer and to respect everyone that i came incounter with. My coworkers were very awesome people to work with. The most enjoyable part pf my job was meeting new people and having a nice talk them a person can never know what others are going thru unless you talk with them.
good,"I liked working at Walmart, I loved being a cashier, but at that time I was having a hard time medically and the supervisor wasn't exactly friendly about it."
good,"Overall it was a great place, great and very exciting people to work but due to many amounts of hour cuts, I made the choice of removing myself."
good,Always busy and repeating work. so always knew the task for the day. Knew almost everything before starting to work. management good not to demanding. good people to work with a lot. the hardest part of the job was everyday some task everyday. never had to ask what to do next always had a task to do.
good,-workers are wonderful
good,"typical day includes mutilple task needed to make a pharmacy run smoothly, I have learn so many new things in the pharmacy like what meds can interact with different medications. what medications can interfere with what a patient is taking now. I have learned how to process insurance claims to different companies. I have learned that management is behind you in everything that you do. if you need something they are there. the hardest part of the job is to see a patients health deteriorate as they get older ,and to hear of someone passing. the best part of the job is getting to know your patients on a first name basis and making them feel comfortable taking about their issues."
good,Front line cashier . Greeting and assisting guests.kept front register clean between guests.
good,A typical shift could be 5 hrs to 9 hrs long. I learned very fast that I liked working with the public. Upper management was great to work with but it was the day to day floor management that was difficult and somedays you wonder if they really liked their job. My co-workers that did the same job as cashiering were wonderful and supportive and we still keep in contact today. The hardest part of my job was we always had to be focused on how fast we were getting the customer through the checkout and it seemed really inpersonal and you wander if that person would come back to your store again. The best part of my job was just getting to see all the different cultures and families and items that were in the store come through my checkout line.
good,Has good coworkers and managers. Work can be stressful but is challenging which is good.
good,"Always something new to do everything day, not the same old routine."
good,"average work experience, a lot of room to grow but it takes years, cool coworkers"
good,"I restocked the shelves and provided great customer service, helped coworkers with assingments"
good,"A typical was to come in unload the truck or trucks and then do the next task on your list because they were different sometimes. I learned how to operate a pallet jack, forklift, scissor lift, and electric pallet jack. Management was alright. My co-workers were cool, funny, diligent, and entertaining. The hardest part was pulling freight to the floor when there were customers everywhere you went and it was difficult to move around. The most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out and going home."
good,"Stocking shelves, Pulling pallets with palletjacks. Customer service, Clean work ethics. Hardest part of the job was that it was a fast paced job. The most enjoyable part of the job was that the co-workers were very friendly."
good,My work day would start off by counting the till and preparing the studio to be opened. After opening the studio I would follow up on the days customers who were coming into the studio for portraits and prepare myself for any situation that may come with the days work. In between shoots I would deal with answering the phone and other customers in a friend professional manor. I usually worked alone unless the day was booked with a lot of photo shoots which in that case I would work with one other person. The co-works and management were good to work with and for. I enjoyed working here and making customers happy with their ending results.
good,to be honest i wasnt too crazy about working for this job but i did it anyway cua i needed to work but i still made some money and went to work everyday like normal
good,Durante el tiempo que trabaje aprendi a ser un lider y a apoyar ala gente a ser mejor por medio de evaluaciones personales ademas de que checaba los lotes y la materia seleccionada pesaba la materia prima y se escogia de escoria y pedaceria de segunda mano para poder fundir metal a liquido para generarlo en lingotes asi como tambien se realizaban estudios microbiologicos y temperatura para que el material se mezclara con otro tipo de materiales
good,i learnded how to deal with customers on a normal day i carry soil to customers cars who buy it i rearange mowers put mowers swings an chairs together managers are cool nice to work for co workers most don't want to do there work there really isn't a hard part to my job an the most enjoyable is when i'm putting stuff together i'm working by myself so much easy and faster doing it by myself
good,The people i worked with were very helpful. The hours begun to wear on me however because it was a full time overnight position.Management was understanding and weren't afraid to get their hands dirty which i like. The hardest part of the job which was very active and physical were the hours.
good,Did not enjoy going to work everyday. The gas used on the drive alone to get to the warehouse used up most of the pay check
good,This was a general fast paced environment that sometimes forced you to think on your feet.
good,"Honestly Walmart really used to be a fun place to work. They actually used to care about their associates. But the last few years that I worked there, it all seemed to just go down hill. I thought it was maybe just the store I was at, but I have recently learned that it wasn't just my store, it's all stores. They seem to care more about keeping the money for themselves and hire less and put more responsibilities on the ones that are still employed. Even customers notice the decrease in help. We are human and we can only handle so much and have so many hours in a work day to accomplish tasks."
good,"People were nice, co-workers, and management"
good,"I enjoy my job. The Customer Service part. I love being the one with the answers to the customers' questions. I like seeing new faces every day and having the weekly customers that I recognize and can have conversations with. I do wish, though, that the managment team would back up their employees more. Those of us without the title of 'Manager' are the ones riding the front lines. We deal with the public more and we see more things than most could understand. We get cursed at on a daily basis and no one supports us. I truly believe that Walmart, as a huge corporation, is amazing to work for. But I also believe that some people lose sight of that a little too easily."
good,"A typical day of work would include opening and running the registers, customer service, and stocking."
good,Good place to work. Management where good. Easy planograms or modulars.
good,Ran many departments in the store. Learned a lot about the grocery side of the buisness.
good,The hardest part is keeping your paycheck and not giving it back trying to catch the sales!
good,"Tough job but the benefits are worth the hard work. Working in a warehouse can be tough, but the money is worth it."
good,"Each day is always different. There is never a scarcity for challenges, and work to do. The hardest part of the job is to meet the never-ending demands. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people...customer and associates."
good,"on a day to day basis i worked as a cashier, i checked customers out of the store. Each work day was fast paced, i dealt with various attitudes overall it was an okay job to have."
good,"I went to work to do my job some days were really tough to get through, some days were great!"
good,I loved working for this company. I had to leave this job because I couldnt do the 9 hours on my feet anymore.
good,"Great job, good schedule, advancement opportunities, and always busy."
good,It was a great night job while I attended college in the day. I was promoted very quickly and I can say they value their associates.
good,the consumers whwere my favorite part of every day hardest part of the job was standing on your feet so long on concreat
good,good job anyone can do the work its very easy and the people are easy to get along with.
good,This is a nice place to work. I mostly stocked in the evenings.
good,"My day involves greeting customers, bagging items, working on a register and accepting payments. Every aspect of the job requires training, even something as simple as the proper way to greet a customer. Management expects employees to train in different areas. All co-workers are different, but in time of need we're helping one another. The hardest part of the job are the weekends when most customers shop. The most enjoyable part of the job is when customers recognize and appreciate your hard work."
good,"Very challenging work environment, very diverse workforce for managing."
good,"My typical work day was zoning, or straightening, my department; cashiering; stocking; and customer assistance. Each day would include various managers telling me to do one thing while others would say to do another, which pressured me into trying to do all of them that led to unsuccess. My managers would good people but communication was distorted causing more work on me making my day hard. The most enjoyable part would be getting a project to work on that took time but was rewarding with no distractions. I have learned that the customer comes first and also that your fellow co-workers can help you and vice-versa."
good,"Returned merchandise, cashed pay checks. I learned to be a good listener. Management was very open , enjoyed working with coworkers. There really was'nt anything hard about the job. I really liked helping seniors locate merchandise in the store"
good,"I would start the day by opening the cash registers and getting all of our electronic hand helds out and signed on. I would then wait for the first customer of the day, while I was waiting we would put tires away clean up the garage and ready ourselves for the day. When the first customer arrived I would greet the customer find out what services they wanted, get there keys and go out to there car and get all the information from it i needed then pull there car in, and have them sign off on the work to be done after i went over what they wanted done again with them. After the work is completed i would page the customer back and ring them out at the cash register and send them on there way."
good,"i learned so much in this company,,,,socialization in other races,,,,"
good,"While i worked at Wal-mart, i worked in tire and lube department, and my day consisted of changing tires while also keeping track of tires on the shelves. I also had the job duties of changing the oil in motor vehicles and making sure their maintenance of their vehicles were up to date."
good,"I have learned how to deal with all types of people and learned to be patient and understanding. I love most of my co-workers and get along well with all of them. A typical work day includes a great deal of stress trying to get the customers out in a timely manner. One of the only bad parts is that management seems to not really care about their employees, if you call off for being in the emergency room it still counts against you. The most enjoyable part is being able to interact with the customers."
good,A typical day at work for me would to be in the chemicals department stocking all the households product making sure that all the shelves is fully stocked within a certain time range.
good,"A typical day at work is running a cash reqister, smiling and being polite to customers. Some times it is fun and we are able to joke around with each other and our customers. Unfortunately, there are also times when things are not quite so much fun. We do have to deal with people that are not very nice for whatever reason and this makes the job difficult. You try your best to make their experience a good one. For the most part everyone is friendly. I go out of my way to get along with everyone including my co-workers ... many of whom make it a pleasure to go to work each day."
good,"Greet customers politely, answer their question and provide information in a friendly and courteous tone."
good,Hardest part of the job is the pay and lack of hours. And kowing that I don't get benefits or vacation for a year if I get it at all
good,"I worked for this company for over 4 years. I started in the company as a cart pusher working the cold winters, and hot summers. They promoted me to an hourly manager, which was quite a fun experience. Although they arent the best company to work for, they did help me gain the experience I needed to get me where I am today."
good,Stocked merchandise on a daily basis so that it can be available for customers to purchase. The job was hard and strenuous and back breaking. I didn't enjoy my job but it paid the bills.
good,a typical day but is not limited to:
good,"I have worked for Walmart for 6 years. It is a great place to grow as for as leadership positions. However, the training is not providing so there are alot of leaders in the store who probably know less than the regular associates. It's very unorganized. The location that I work is very diverse, so you get to meet alot of different people. I have gained alot friends at this job."
good,you do not get recognized if you go above and beyond what is expected of you so you do not get the raises you deserve. you do not succeed if you do no suck up to management. they treat you like a kid.
good,Its a great job if your used to it. I liked working with the people there.
good,"clean for the most part, procedures change about every other day."
good,i liked it there they have decent benefits.the job was fun i liked decorating cakes
good,"Price changes, reset the department, on hand counts, stocked merchandise on the shelves."
good,"Good company to shop at, not so well to work at. Many people and a very overwhelming feeling with all the different managers, schedules, proceedures, etc."
good,I like working with all my co-workers. Like any company we have our good days and our bad days. I have learned how to put inventory stickers on items that come in. Hardest part is when we are short handed all the time and doing cleaning by yourself when left for two or three hours alone. My most enjoyable is working with the customers.
good,For being a college student this is not a bad job to get your feet wet with the work force. This is not the right place to spend the rest of your life at though. The opportunities to move up in the company are very limited.
good,Always something to do . Meeting customers needs. Very enthusiastic people to work with.
good,"When I was just a cashier and not a sales associate, it was the best job and I thoroughly enjoyed being there, It wasn't until I became a sales associate that things started going downhill. When I transferred departments management was horrible. They would yell at me for doing things that, not only I was doing, but other associates were doing as well. and I would be the only one who got into trouble, I really didn't like being in a regular department, but when I was a cashier, I was respected and not yelled at for doing something that someone else was doing."
good,The work is hard when you have to throw freight all day or build displays for the holiday seasons. But the workers are nice and management is ok.
good,It depends which walmart you work in how the experience will be!
good,A typical day at work consist of zoning the store and helping customers find certain products that they may be looking for. I learned that you cant satisfy everyone.
good,"A typical day at work was busy stocking shelves as this was a second job. I learned how products come into the store, how they are sorted and stocked and how to drive a forklift per company policy. My co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job was when the customers were rude no matter how awesome your customer service was, dealing with the customer sometimes was a challenge yet I mastered it. Smile and provide customer care. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different people and learning the history of the store/products."
good,I didn't get my vacation time or break time till later. Also the boss was very hard on me too.
good,The people I worked with were great and caring .
good,"Meeting first thing for what aisle you got.Second start stocking,and Third straighting up aisle at last.What did i learn?Symbol , number , teamwork.Co-workers were team effort.Hardest part of the jobs is satisfaction, and the most enjoyable part of the job is satisfaction."
good,A typical day at work was generally busy. I learned how to assist people in customer service. Management was fair and helpful. The hardest part about the job was standing in one spot for hours at a time. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people.
good,"I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart because of the different people you meet on a daily basis. The only thing didn't like was that we never seem to have enough coverage and it was known by upper management, but we never received sufficient help to keep the customers happy, in my opinion. I enjoyed working with my co-workers, they were pretty unique and cool to work with. The hardest part of my job was trying to satisfy all of the customers during the busy time, with very little coverage. I enjoyed working with the different customers and meeting different people on a daily basis."
good,-Forklift operator
good,inventory bin and label custcomer service cashier down stack pallets unload trucks
good,"Everyday I stocked shelves. I really didn't learn much, except that Walmart doesn't pay its employees what they deserve. Walmart also has cut back many jobs so that most employees are part time making it to where no one can get health care. The CEO of this company makes more in an hour than what a regular employee makes an entire year. The management of this company is very understanding and fun to work with. The co-workers are the same. The hardest part of this job was staying awake because I was working this job full time, another full time, and going to school full time. The most enjoyable part of this job was the management."
good,This was the first place i ever worked and it seemed good for that purpose.
good,Would go back if they would have me!! I had a great time and leaned alot
good,"At first it was easy to learn and pick up new things to help save time. But as weeks turned into months the managers treat you with less and less respect. Also, the people I worked with were okay. Some were not happy to be there so that made the day seem longer. The hardest part was learning all the ins and outs of the job with the managers expecting us to know everything after the first week. I would have to say the most enjoyable part of the job was making a couple friends and being able to have free food in the break room every now and then."
good,The work was fast paced and plenty busy. Problem was the management didn't communicate with each other so things never seemed to get done the way they should have. Loved the people in general though.
good,"Worked as part time 4 hrs/day, learned how to make or duplicate keys, how to issue fishing and hunting licenses, my immediate superirors were all professional as head of the company, and most enjoyable part was when you clocked out from worked."
good,"good place to start of as a first time job, do not make into a career. a lot of co workers meas a lot more drama."
good,Walmart hired me while attending college for Health Information Management. They have decreased opportunities because of the economy and I cannot move into a management position or full-time position here.
good,"The one thing I learned is it never hurts to ask ""ARE YOU FINDING EVERY THING OK"" or ""HOW CAN I HELP YOU TODAY"" the most enjoyable part of the job is to have some one walk away with a smile and a thank you"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of us coming in and downloading all the merchandise for the pallet, that came in on the truck. The enjoyable part of my job was the friends that I made."
good,"it was a good job just bad hours. The managers were not very nice, but they also didnt care when you made mistakes. They were too demanding though."
good,To be the most valuable employee possible by helping all customers in finding what they need. Being a team player in all you do.
good,"Helping customers shop for difficult items, coworkers work well with you."
good,"work in the deli cutting meat, cooking food, cleaning up and closing learn how to be patience management was great just always short staff co-workers fun to work with"
good,my work day change sometimes by the moment. multitasking to accompish the goals.some management was excellent others needed work .my coworkers all looked up to me. getting others to help was hard at times.leaving work knowing i accomplished my goals
good,my typical day at work would be a very busy day. customers hate how busy we are and how long the lines are and no manager or anyone well help them so they can get out of there quickly. the management over me really isnt that great. theydnt care about there jobs or there customers. my coworkers i love working with cause they know how it is and a typical day at walmart. the hardest part of my job i would have to say is trying to communicate with ur supervisors or ask questions on something that needs approval. my most enjoyable part of my job is making my customers happy and puting a smile on there face.
good,"A typical day at work I swipe my badge to see my daily tasks and area coverage,grab returns,help customers,stock,zone shelves,put up overstock,bin and pick merchandise,be a back up cashier,work on projects,cut fabric and blow up balloons.I learned at Wal-Mart the value of making someone smile,how it can change your day and theirs.Working their I have refined my people skills and problem solving.Management some are great,and others aren't very proffessional or helpful.Although You learn so much from your co-workers.The hardest part of the job is not being able to use my Medical Clinical Lab Assistant and Phlebotomy Skills.The most Enjoyable part of my job is the customers."
good,"Good company overall, but all employees are overworked and undervalued, including lower management."
good,A typical day at work would be fast paced. I learned to not allow other co-workers to affect my work ethic. Management had its times where they had their favorites but if I stayed on my job and did what I was asked and supposed to do I didnt have any complaints or worries. The hardest part of working for Wal-Mart would have to be the customers. Some of them really knew how to give a cashier a hard time but with a smile it can help you move on with your day without showing any signs of frushtration. The most enjoyable part of the job woud be talking with new people everyday and working on a team that cares about how the performance of the job matters.
good,I worked at the distribution center Tuesday thru Friday and it was alright.
good,* Management is OK
good,"I want to start with the good, 70% of our hourly associates move to managment, stable job in our unstable economy. Horrible pay on the amount of stress and labour demanded for every position. Confusing management team with no communication, mixed direction and ever changing priorities."
good,"Learned a great deal about retail while working there, both on the sales floor and in the overstock room. Some managers were good, others were not. Co-workers were great."
good,i had fun while it lasted but they suck about telling the truth
good,As a part time job it was as expected. The management was fine. The coworkers were interesting. The customers were eclectic.
good,"A day at work i would be taking shelves apart, putting shelves together, stocking shelves, moving shelves, moving products."
good,As long as you work fast and stay on task you can work with little to no supervision. My managers were very nice and willing to work with my schedule.
good,"This was a good company to work for while working for them, but they did not give very good notice at the end of the season."
good,"Job was very demanding with little rewards. Pretty sure all Walmart stores are not like this, I'm pretty sure I just applied to the ""ghetto"" one."
good,"Enjoyed co-workers. Really liked the opportunity to create when doing displays. Customers, of course, aren't always nice."
good,nice place to work very nice people and you can have fun by working there and work at the same time.
good,"I will sign on to a register and greet the first person in line, making small talk as i help them get the things they are choosing to purchase today. also answering quetions, if they have any, about where things are and how to find them. Also I ask the customer how their shopping experience was and if there is anyhting i can do to make it better. When the transaction is finished I wish them a womnerful day and greet the next person in line. Two hours from starting i get a break for fifteen minutes and hop back on a register. Two hours after that i get a lunch break, two more hours and then there is my last break."
good,"This is a graveyard position. I've worked 32 - 40 hours for almost a year. Occasionally, management will cut graveyard shift employees hours making it difficult to budget. I'm seeking a full-time, day warehousing position with benefits. I'm pleased to work weekends and overtime. I've enjoyed working with my co-workers and management, but believe it's time to move to a company that offers 40 hours consistently and desire working a day shift."
good,"ótimo local de trabalho ,empresa dinâmica agradável de trabalhar,aprendi muito sobre respeito aos colegas de trabalho,a parte mais difícil era quando faltava um colega,a parte agradável era finalizar o dia com o meu trabalho feito sem reclamações."
good,I worked all over the building. Just cause you have a job title does not mean that's your only job. they will make you work anywhere.
good,I have been with Walmart now for almost one year and have come to relize that the work load of an over night stalker is very heavey and not appreciated.
good,Walmart is and always should be an experience when it comes to working somewhere
good,I always know that the door will still be open for me to return to work tomorrow and with awesome benefits it's hard to walk away. Unfortunatly they don't much family time and open all holidays. They also don't hire enough help. But I love the people I work with and I have even made friends with some of the customers..they will be missed.
good,ok job for students. I really enjoyed as a student in school they are always willing to work around your schedule.
good,"I know that some of the large chains e.g. Walmart are not really great to work for, people I know some say you are treated like a number, not a professional pharmacist. I believe the salary, benefits e.g. payroll stock purchase, the insurance they pay for us is helpful."
good,Enjoyable job with new challenges everyday but experience varies based on store manager and not a great work/life balance.
good,It saddens me that this company closed. I really enjoyed working at the company. It was very simple and easygoing. People really loved us and we loved our clients.
good,"A typical day at walmart is standing at register and greeting our customers and making sure they found everything okay, I learned that making sure customers were satisfied and happy made the day a whole lot happier for everyone. Management there was Really not up to The standards they should have been, I feel they were a Little bad on social skills with their employees. My co-workers were great. There was no hard part about the job. The injoyable part of my job was making the customers happy."
good,Good place to work. I would work for them again. Pays well. Good benifets
good,- Same routine everyday
good,"Short Staffed leads to short tempers, which leads to an unpleasant experience for employees and customers. I was fortunate to work in the Cash Office. Although this dept. has it's own stress levels it was still where I would prefer to be. The management over the front-end was not very forth coming and this made things difficult. I helped train my co-workers and enjoyed all I did. The hardest part of the job was picking up after an employee left with no indication of what and where to begin. Example would be filing system of old documents and labeling. My most enjoyable time was working by myself with little to no interuptions."
good,Responsible for helping to get the store prepared every night for the next morning
good,Ok place to work if like to be aroun a lot of people daily. Gain knowledge of customer service.
good,"Se trabaja bajo presión de la gerencia para que todo se lleve de acuerdo con las normas y procedimientos de la empresa, aprendí a trabajar en equipo, a tener gente a mi cargo y cuidar que todo se haga de acuerdo con las normas de la empresa, las partes dificiles del trabajo se pueden resolver apoyandose con otras tiendas ya que usualmente cuando las cosas se ven dificiles es porque en alguna parte se cometió algún error la mayoria de las veces reparable."
good,busy seaons was the hardest u was luck if u ever got a break but working in a fast pace environment was great
good,constantly busy. standing there all day assisting customers with their transactions.
good,"I began my career with Walmart as a cashier. I then moved up and worked at the service desk for two years. Feb of 2012 I promoted to work in Accounting. I come into work at 5 am and I finalize business for the day by 9 am. I reset register bags for the next day. If there are any overages or shortages from the business day before I research and check registers to find or figure out what happened. I balance the room and that's how a day in accounting ends. I learned how to manage a lot of money and sending out checks to the Bank. The hardest part of my job is the research which has to be done in a timely manner. It can be stressful but I love working in accounting, it's a great learning experience. I'm glad that I had the opportunity to work in the office."
good,"This place is fun and very alive. The co-workers are funny and they come together like a huge family. The haredest part about this job was making sure you got hours. At one point in time they didn't schedule me to work for almost two months. Some of the managers, who no longer work there anymore, were very unprofessional."
good,"It was enjoyable. Meeting new people, Co-workers help when need worked good as a team. Hardest part was lifting heavy items. due to that i have a bad back."
good,loved being surrounded by so many people
good,"My job is a fast pace race every day. We bin all merchandise left from the truck the night before. We count products on the sales floor, then audit the bins in our back rooms and pull the products that need to go to the floor. This way the customers always get what they are looking for. Getting all this done daily is a hard task when we recieve more frate then we have room for. I enjoy the people a work and the team i have. Me and management don't always see eye to eye but we get things done and work well together."
good,i learned here how to be more physical in the jobs that i do because customers are counting on me for merchandise on the shelves
good,I loved working at Walmart but management didn't really seem to care about their staff. That is why I quit working for Walmart. I didn't get the respect or time of day like I deserved. I worked at Walmart for 3 years and even when I left management still treated me like a new person.
good,"Great job, but they didnt take care of their employees. Compensation was lacking, pay was pathetic, scheduling was rediculous."
good,"I worked at Target for about one and a half years. I enjoyed working there, but quit because I was only getting around 15 hours a week. I needed more than that. Other than the hours, I enjoyed working there."
good,hung and folded clothing to asure store was presentable at all times
good,Walmart can be a fun place to work. I enjoy working with the public and Walmart associates. I have daily challenges that require on the spot decisions. That just makes my job fulfilling and interesting.
good,I was a stock clerk and I cleared the parking lot of carts. The hardest part of the job was that i worked overnight. The managers and crew were very easy to work with.
good,Everyone is like family..The customers can be rude and sweet at the same time...
good,I had great coworkers and learned a lot about retail. This was my first retail job and it was fun but hard work. I worked in the produce department and hauled 60 lbs crates around to stock shelves. I also did a lot of cleaning and organizing for the department. I liked the cultural diversity of my job and the customer service. I just wish some of the higher management could be a little more helpful and respectful of the lower associates.
good,"É uma empresa que abre oportunidades de crescimento e desenvolvimento, inclui os colaboradores nas participações de lucro, Pessoas bem receptivas."
good,"After a team warm up and stretch routine we would discuss current sales,and other events.I learned of cross food contamination,freezer cooler temp ranges. Management are people too. Loved working with the people on my shift. The hardest part of the job was always the last hour,very stressful but still fun.The most enjoyable part of the job besides the pending weekend ,was seeing a customer with a smile knowing it was you that made the difference. It makes you feel good to do good.and that's bottom line..!"
good,I have a more respect for the individuals who work there. Having been in their shoes from unloading trucks to stocking shelves to working black Friday you can brush up on your customer service skills as well as exercise.
good,"Easy customer service job. Clean departments, assist customers, advertise sales, put out new inventory."
good,a typical day at work for me is getting their 20 min early having a cup of coffee doing my strectches looking at the goal for the day taking my notes paying close attention to the instructions giving and completing that goal of the day
good,Not the best place I worked but gives you challenges that make you a better worker.
good,"communcation and dependability is the key to success. We loaded and unloaded trucks all day. I took inventory of merchandise. My subordinance followed my lead. Being done on time, gave us all satisfaction ."
good,I enjoyed interacting with the customers on a daily.
good,They will always only have so many lines open and the line are crazy long. You have to keep you productivity down and keep the lins moving at all times or you will be there all day.
good,Good job granteed hours decsent people to work with very safty environment.
good,It was ok. The pay wasn't all that good. but i did learn a lot as far as work skills.
good,"-As a cashier with over two years in experience in customer service, I worked in a friendly but timely manner, following the right procedures when it comes down to checking out any types of liquor and tobacco. My goal was to keep all customers happy and assure that they would visit Wal-Mart again. I enjoyed working at walmart."
good,I enjoyed working with the public again. But as far as lifting and standing 8 - 10 hrs a day isn't very kind to the body
good,"Easy work. Easy to get bored. Same job everyday. Load a pallet, unload a pallet."
good,I was a dependable worker for this company. I met my husband there.
good,"Working in Wal-Mart's deli involved a variety of duties to include opening and closing cleaning, food preparation, and my favorite responsibility, customer service. Management was lacking so there was a certain amount of leadership and responsibility involved also which due to being in an entry level position was the most difficult however it improved my skills in tact and leading without being in a leadership position. The most enjoyable part of the job was that although it was minor in comparison to my experience in the army I still had the opportunity to improve a persons day."
good,"While the company generally will work with you around your life schedule, and there is plenty of advancement opportunities, it is still retail. It has become a rather overtly corporate entity in recent years, and the company culture has changed, but that does not mean it is a horrible place to work. If a skilled management team is in place, working any position on the job schedule can be enjoyable."
good,"its been a while but my coworkers were great as was the management most of the time, but if they need help somewhere outside your area they would have no problem sending you there, like sending you into the cold rain to collect shopping carts when the cart pushers got sick of it and quit...."
good,"Walmart is a good place to work but I have been with the company for going on five years and I have seen alot of changes in the company. I would love o stay with the company but I am not getting the hours I need to survive. Therefore, I must seek other options."
good,"We have a great community in Walmart. The people there are so kindly and very nice. The management team help us a lot to improve our skills. The problems that I encounter in this company are low salary, no profit sharing, no fix schedules, and working below 40 hours."
good,walmart is a place to where the work principles are abit......different and they tend to do only what you let them do which can determine alot of factors from job security to how management treats you to your values of the entire business. its not 1 of the best places to work but it is 1 of the best places to go if your on your last leg.
good,"This wasn't a bad job, just wasn't anything I enjoyed doing and the people I worked with were very judgmental which added to the stress of working there."
good,not too many days are the same ....i have 30 years experience so have almost seen everything....the most enjoyable part is the interaction with customers and co workers
good,If it was an ideal work environment with proactive career growth I'd probably still be there. It wasn't. It didn't. I'm not.
good,"it was a nice atmosphere to work in, great staff and management, would recommend."
good,I Learned To Be A Hard Dedicated Worker. It was good while it lasted just very crazy Texas weather.
good,"LLegar recibir domicilios o rutas para realizar el trabajo, e ir a campo a realizarlo"
good,A challenging and diverse company with advancement opportunities.
good,"A good place to work if you like people, can be busy at times, but you will meet all different types of people and the ones you work with are nice and helpfull"
good,Graveyard shift 10p-7a
good,Good staff to work with.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of punching in, checking out what department(s) you were going to stock or backroom consolidation project you given, and then doing exactly that. I learned how to stock and consolidate in the backroom. Management was sufficient enough to keep general operations running decently. Co-workers were diverse and interesting. The hardest part of the job was often being understaffed with too much expected to be stocked. It was also always a circus at the end of the night trying to get everything organized and off the floor in time for store open. The most enjoyable part was having the ability to determine how you go about your work."
good,I rung up customers and stock the selves. My supervisors ask me to do alot of things that weren't my job. I always was told to do something. Cause were forever under staff.
good,liked working there but hurt my back and i wish they would of done more for me
good,"I was at work every night on time, in dress code, ready to work. It was good, satisfying work. The yearly review process was somewhat generic, and less specific.I learned that Wal-mart is a very big company, so it makes some decisions that are good for Wal-mart, but maybe not its' employees.I liked the work, the people,and the managers.Helping customers is also satisfying."
good,"Really enjoyed working for them, offered a chance for advancement"
good,THey do not really care about their employees. They care about protecting their butts and getting done what they need to to keep corporate happy
good,"fun and easy job with a lot to do, learned how to do price changes, managers are not really good. co -workers were great to work with."
good,"helping customer, stocking , inventory i like cashiering, and making sure they get what they are looking for"
good,It was a while ago. A typical day would be to cash out customers and to do returns and exchanges.
good,Maintenance on machinery
good,"As any job starts out it's a great place to work. After almost 3 years of dedication, hard work, and loyalty. It's not my choice of work. I learned a LOT. How to use the machinery, different parts of gas and diesel engines. The best part of the job was actually working on the vehicles. I enjoyed customer interaction but not all customers can be satisfied."
good,Working here allowed me to gain some form of work ethic and become more respoosible overall. It was a great atmosphere to work with different people.
good,"I learned at this job on how to do oil changes, tires, batteries, and headlights properly. Management there though was not the greatest. I did enjoy working with some of my co-workers but there were others that just was full of too much drama which made working there very hard as well."
good,"Enjoyed working there, just didn't pay enough for my bills, and they had alot of managers for each department, but overall decent"
good,"I enjoyed working at wal-mart, my co-workers were friendly and the managers were nice, the only problem I had with this place was we were under staffed when things were really busy, they have 20+ cash registers but only 6 open at a time."
good,productive and fun place to work at
good,"Good job if you are right out of high school, most of the people are nice and its an okay place to work. The downsides are the benefits are pretty bad and there are a lot of lazy people working in the stores because its a starter position."
good,They take managers straight out of college with no hands on experience. Walmart has got to do better!
good,A typical day would be me doing most of the work with fellow associates standing by talking to other associates. I have learned many skills working in Tire & Lube. I have learned much about the vehicles and how to properly service them as well as what the requirements are to perform these services. The hardest part of the job is getting along with management. They are easier going on their favorites as far as getting to miss days and arriving late. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to services the vehicles. My passion is to become a reliable mechanic that can work on all the different varities of vehicles.
good,atendimento ao publico
good,It was ok working for this company. I enjoyed my job and dealing with customers but the management team was terrible. Very unorganized and unprofessional.
good,"I enjoy helping people and learning daily. To give the best customer experience is my goal with each and every customer. I enjoy cashiering, listening, laughing, learning, helping and do so with all my energy, daily and full time."
good,"A typical day as a Walmart Department Manager consisted of taking care of new merchandise, rearranging the department, making price changes, folding and organizing merchandise, answering a multi-line telephone and managing the fitting room as well as all apparel associates. I learned how to handle disagreements or concerns associates had. My co-workers were very friendly and easy to get a long with. The only part of my job that I did not like was that there was not much room for advancement especially if you were not able to stay at the same store location."
good,restock sales florr until shift is up. Didnt really learn anything new that i didnt know how to do. The supervisors should help out more often. The co-workers were fun and brighten up the job. The hardest part was not getting acknowledge for the good job your were doing. The best part of the job was working with the staff I had.
good,"Lifting boxes weighing up to 90lbs, manual labor, 12 hour shift, Employees are great, the hardest part of the job was making production even if the amount of freight made it impossible to do. most enjoyable part, the amount of donations the company offered to families and children that were less fortunate, that allowed us as employees to participate in."
good,"A typical day at work consist of stocking freight, customer service, and running a register."
good,A typical day at work would be greeting customers as they came to the counter and assisting them any way possible. I had learned to be more open and learned how to work well with others. The management was easy to work with and very understanding when something came up that I had to miss work for. My co-workers were fun to get along with. I guess the hardest part of the job would be having to lift and move heavy objects. The enjoyable part would be meeting different people on a daily basis and getting to know them buy looking at their pictures they brought in for development. I liked this job because it opened me up in a way that I did not think possible.
good,Clock in. Sign on to register. Count money. Start checking costumers out in a timely manner while making sure everything is checked and accounted for. Showing a positive side even to the costumers that are not so polite.
good,Did cashier and customer service doing returns. Dealt with angry and happy customers. Its an okay. job
good,So far I have worked two locations with this company and it's always the same. You have to work to acheive a goal for the company that is not reachable in the conditions given. Its a very secure place to work. Depending on the location you work at will determine how well you get along with managment.
good,I stocked shelves overnight for the day time customers and also did some receiving and shipping duties as well.
good,"I learned how to use a Gemini scanner and printer, use teamwork in an effective manner. My co-workers were friendly and helpful people."
good,"My job consisted of interacting with customers, arranging display tables, processing freight, and more."
good,"Walmart is the most massive company in the country. But this particular store was the highest earning and busiest in its region. It required a lot of hard work, which I give, and a very strong ability to handle pressure. While I don't agree with their ethical treatment of employees, they have given me a place to work. I can't argue with that."
good,"I only worked here as a temporary, never been a permanent or regular, but Texans are very friendly and had a great working experience since its my first time to be employed."
good,"aprendi ekl manejo de dinero,buen marco laboral,me gusta aprender y emprender proyectos nuevos .aprendi a frentear los productos a ser cordial con los clientes,soy ordenado,comprometido con el laburoy sin horarios ......espero servir a la empresa.gracias"
good,"It was a great place to work. Although management had me doing not only the position I was hired for but multiple other poitions, which didnt increase pay. It was a great learning experience in customer service and working with a cash register."
good,I am always ready to take on my duties for the day and end it off with a smile on my face knowing that I was very productive for my full shift. I Love to be a team player and help out whenever help is needed. The hardest part of any job is wanting everything to be perfect. I have a very high expectation and pride in my job where ever I go.
good,"I worked any day of the week,coming in many times to cover for other employees.I was trained to open and operate the service desk,and worked in several departments throughout the store. The work was steady and the people you met were sometimes stressful."
good,"I spent about 3 years with Walmart in Loss Prevention. After being there for awhile I began to train other people to do Loss Prevention. I also traveled throughout the district and worked in other stores. It is very boring at times, but at any given moment there could be a ton of excitement. I don't know what it is, but catching someone shoplifting just gets your blood pumping. It was all undercover so I dressed like I do when I am not at work. Overall Walmart is not a bad company. I have a good friend who has disabilities that works there. She would not be able to work anywhere else because of her condition. I praise them for giving people with developmental Disabilities a chance to be part of our working society. A lot of people knock Walmart because it isn't what it used to be, but everything changes. Though I don't work there anymore I do still remember some of the fun times I had there. They got an overall rating of 3 because they do need to work on a few things, but I learned a lot from this company."
good,"Enjoyed working close to home, started off higher than minimum wage"
good,"Its Wal - Mart. Pay isn't great, but hours are available. Work is simple in nature. And for most part you work in your station without close supervision."
good,Wal Mart to me so far has been a fun place to work but in my opinion the work that an individual puts into their department is not shown in the compensation received. The management team at my store is great and very understandable about time needed off among other things. The largest problem that I have with my current job is the compensation.
good,changes from supervisor to supervisor no accountability way too much work per associate lack of communication between stockers and department managers
good,This is a good company when orders are relayed and people are working. The only problem is that sometimes directions dont get relayed or get jumbled through the grapevine.
good,"Overall good company, but hard to advance and bad benefits."
good,"I enjoyed the job itself, but I couldn't get used to working nights."
good,"I worked for WalMart a little over 3 months or so. My day consisted of my job plus several other departments because they were always understaffed. Even when the staff was there, they took them out to cashier up front and leave me to run 7 departments by myself. I didn't like it at all and the job was not challenging or rewarding."
good,"buen ambiente de trabajo,conoses jente y creces en la compañia acuerdo a tu desempeño."
good,"Dealing with ordering and setting up of the area, training new associates and making schedules."
good,walmart is fun place to work when u are fist starting out in the work force alot of work but fun
good,Walmart is a fast paced environment that I enjoyed working in because of the great employees I worked with however the managers were very power oriented and didn't pay much attention to their employees needs.
good,great work place i enjoyed it but neded more hours managemaent was not so great different managers nearly every month
good,"Greeted customers, rang up customer sales, stocked shelves, helped customers find what they were searching for."
good,"A typical day at walmart consists of being customer friendly, patient and having basic of knowledge of exactly what you are working on. Running a cash register and knowing how to move at a pace where each customer is in and out."
good,All of the management I meet while I was there were very nice and weren't afraid to help others out with there work if needed.
good,I learned various new skills but scheduled hours vary and can be decreased without notice.
good,Having a plan of actions in order and knowing how to pass them on to fellow management. For a better productive day.
good,"got paid great, just the bosses were horrible. make you work harder than you should."
good,"Good learning experience , employer and employee are understanding"
good,"Working at night is different then working in the day. Quiet and slow, but the night drags on and your shift never ends. The pay never seems worth it and the day people leave you with all the work they never got around to doing. People at night were sad to work with, because they were normally bitter and angry because of all of this."
good,Very busy enviroment as it was a training/model store.
good,"There's the good days and there's the bad days. I learned how to teach other to adapt to the work place. Management are our teachers they tell us the right way from the wrong. The hardest part about my job is that I control half the store by myself, that's when I have to juggle my time in between customers and other areas. The enjoyable part of my job are my customers."
good,"A typical day at work insisted of preparing the produce to a very high standard of freshness and quality for customers. I learned a lot of important skills and values for example how to properly handle food, WHIMIS, and CPR. The management team is highly focused on providing the best possible service to every customer that walks through the door and the same can be said about its co-workers. To be honest the hardest part of that job was putting out the garbage at the end of the shift. The easiest part would have to be helping the customer in anyway I could."
good,"A typical day at Walmart is stocking and facing the shelves in my department or running the register at the check out lanes. At Walmart i learned behind the scenes of 3rd shift, i learned how to properly stock shelves, and setting up displays. The management at Walmart were not very involved, as a 3rd shift employee i hardly ever saw management. My co-workers and i all got along well and stayed on task. The hardest part of my job was getting used to the 3rd shift hours. The most enjoyable part of my job were my co-workers they really make me feel like family."
good,"Most days were the same, the simple work of smiling at customers and cooking bbq chicken. Many different types of machinery were unfamiliar to me before this job, I learned a great deal ab operating a pallet jack and compactor. The managment from my experience was mediocre, it seems they tried to solve the many difficult problems they had without the resources needed to conquer them. My co- workers were very polite and seemed quite adept at handling most problems they faced. I felt that the hardest part of my job was the fact that i worked very short shifts, requiring me to work more of them or be very short on pay. Conversly the most enjoyable part of my day was bring smiles to the customers who came to my deli. As well making many friends in the process."
good,Open the shop and set up machines to do the days work. Wait on customer and fill their needs. Learned everyone is no the same and you have to respect people for who they are and their needs. I get along well with co-workers. Changing tires for the big trucks. Being with others and meeting people.
good,"The benefits were nice but really didn't pay enough, but it wasn't bad. Management could have been more organized in what they wanted us to doing when giving special assignments."
good,Didnt like the management.
good,Management working for Wal-Mart where easy to talk to and understanding for the overall most part.
good,Worked as cashier assisting customers with purchase. Good company to work with.
good,Work is always tough because the shift before doesn't do their job knowing that we have to finish whatever left by morning. Not much to learn really. Management aren't very friendly or understanding.
good,"It's a good place to get started when you have no work experience. Does get kinda over whelming during the holidays. There are plenty of friendly people who work there, and who are willing to help you when it is needed. The days can get boring. I liked working there overnight better than the day shift."
good,Decent pay for the small town I lived in having no college education at the time.
good,"+A good night was always a breather. A bad night was whenever we were short on people because they didn't have the greatest mindset on scheduling, and had to work triple as hard to pick up the slack. Or especially when people quit."
good,"great team of coworkers, very helpful and spirited. I learned a lot in various areas of store. I started off as cashier and ranged out to claims in grocery and regular merchandise. I was excited about my new positon but was disappointed in lack of assistance and skills in management team"
good,Excellent job that give opportunities to have a great experiencies with costumer service.
good,Loved customers and helping them find porducts.co-workers were great enjoyed my time with them. Learned how to mix paint .
good,I had fun at times but you need to work hard and dedicate alot of energy and time for little compinsation.
good,Filled Rx
good,"working under pressure and i have learned to work very fast and keep to time, helpful and nice co-workers. very freindly environment,. being patient and attentive to details."
good,"Clock in, go to the register. Help Customers bag their items and put in their cart. Accept all forms of payment and count back change if cash is paid."
good,Supervised 3-6 Sales Associates.
good,"learned different things everyday, management was real nice because i was a really reliable person. I liked getting challenged with new things, i enjoyed woking with my co-workers i was more of a team leader i got along with everyone. The hardest part of my job was probably nothing, the most enjoyable part of my job was that i was in different departments everyother day!"
good,I learned that there were many different types of household products and there is a definite difference in quality when it comes to price for household products.
good,"At work I typically will do some type of audit throughout the day, and catch shoplifters. Management is ok they call us if they need help or if they see anything. The walking all day long is the hardest part of the job. Reducing shrink is the best part of the job."
good,This is a good job for young people to work to get a good grasp of many different things.
good,Me personally I really enjoyed my time working at Walmart. The employers made the experience a wonderful one for me. My only criticism is the pay. I felt as though the hours I put in did not reflect on my paycheck. Other than that I loved my management. Of course I had my down days but overall Walmart was a cool job for me. They really love people with great personalities and those who just do their job. If you possess those two things then you will be just fine and considered for promotions quick!
good,"The first task would be to unload the truck. Once that was finished we were expect to pick orders, unbox and hang clothing, sort mixed boxes of freight, and down stack grocery pallets. Once these tasks were completed we would normally go to lunch. After lunch we would pull the freight to floor and continue picking orders from the bins till time to go home."
good,"Uma grande empresa varejista, porém não muito organizada fisicamente, ambiente agradável de trabalhar."
good,"I was only there a month, though I found the management to be sub par and most of the staff to be drama obsessed."
good,i loved working at walmart. it completely changed my outlook on life and opend me up to be the person i always thought i could be. i really enjoyed working with people on a daily basis. and would go back in a heart beat.
good,a busy day unloading and loading trucks and its hard unloading trucks wit not enough on shcedule
good,Walmart was very dysfunctional. I do miss the people I worked with but as far as the store itself I don't.
good,I was in high school at the time so it worked out for me.
good,I would go to work we would have a meeting to tell us what department we would be in and then we would go start downstacking our pallets and stock the shelves. Managment wast really around at night because wasnt many customers in the store. My co-workers were great. Nothing was really hard. i enjoyed working with the people and i loved stocking frozen foods.
good,Very diverse cultural atmosphere. Fast pace environment.
good,"Company has processes and routines put in place, but associates along with middle management are not allowed to complete or are side tracked with what upper management thinks is better. Had the routines been followed all issues would have been addressed."
good,not enough hours the staff was ok to work with some days where fun and some where very busy.
good,no good hrs. No good pay. Loved the work but never got paid more than min wage
good,overnight stocking... not much room for growth. benefits are acceptable.
good,"Very hard work, I went in having skills so I did not learn a lot some of my co- workers were great others needed my help in order to be more productive, the hardest part of my job was being in two or three places at the same time its basically a typical day in a retail store, and when its over you go home .."
good,Was able to move in to management in a pretty faced pasced manner
good,"best part of the job was some of the co-workers, hardest part was the hours, but overall a good place to work"
good,"It was a fast paced job.. Started in Charlotte Mi. transfered to Poinciana, Fl. Worked in Mi. 4 yrs. and the rest in Fl."
good,Empresa com ótimos princípios e com politicas uteis.
good,"Walmart is a great place to work, I meet many people everyday and also have regulars that come to my job and say they only come when im working. The management expect alot from you but as long as you get your work done you will have a great day. The co-workers are great to work with I never had an issue, I think the hardest part of my job is durring the holidays because its really busy and not enough employees at times, but other than that the most enjoyable part of my job is getting to help my customers and meet new people."
good,"It was a good place to work before the store opened. Now that we're open, the stress and miscommunication amongst associates and the management staff has hit turbulence."
good,"mis compañeras y yo nos apoyabamos mutuamente en las labores, lo mas dificil era cuando nos llegava mucha mercancia muy pesada me gusto el compañerismo ademas del apoyo que nos daba nuestro jefe del departamento (prichos)"
good,"I think walmart was a challenge from the start, it had a lot of work to come in with, and balancing thing out as I went on would be a good way to put how I jumped over some things. I already had the customer service experience from my prior jobs, and my natural well manors, but I did get a complete hands on experience with using litterally 'my hands' and tools to build and assemble things. Management can be very good there or very bad at any walmart. Thankfully the management is great at my walmart and couldn't be happier. The hardest part of my job is figuring out how to build something that wasn't suppose to break, and then I would figure out how to make a fix for that thing that just broke."
good,"assisting with cutting fabrics measuring fabric, restocking the shelves, retrieving go backs, and when really busy being a back up cashier."
good,"had a steady schedule, learned alot of different types of bread doughs, fast paced, and the company is very important to society"
good,My coworkers were wonderful. Not enought pay for the work. Very stressful and way understaffed.
good,"I believe Wal-Mart (Hazlehurst) was just not the right place for me. I did not get along with all management staff. Each day it seem to be someone different over me, telling me to do this and that. I did learn how to set madule displays for showcase and to appeal customers to buying products. My co-workers were a joy to be around though, which was a plus. The hardest part of the job was not knowing what part of my department I would be working. The only thing I enjoyed about the job was lunchbreaks."
good,"I enjoy the job I am doing. It is very challenging and fast paced. The hardest part of the job is the deadlines on the days that I am the only one scheduled in the office, instead of the normal two person schedule."
good,"Hard work, customer service, managing associates, profit and loss"
good,"Working at Walmart gives you the opportunity to meet many new people daily. The customers that you meet sometimes become regulars and so you get to know them, sometimes by name. The hardest part of being a cashier is the fact that you have to stand for long hours."
good,"When working as a seasonal part-time cashier at Walmart, it has its ups and downs, there is always a point in time where you just wish the week was over, but the people and the co-workers are all nice once you get to know them. Everything is well organized as for schedules and meeting the needs to when you need a certain day off, overall though, the most enjoyable part of the day in when you know you've helped someone and sometimes they may even put in a good work for you at management."
good,No room to move up in this company. Cause they didn't like to give out more money.
good,pay is good might go into work and think you are working 12 hrs and find out you have to work 16
good,i make myself very useful to the job i love Walmart but sometimes its very hard like most jobs I'm looking for something better more pay and very positive surrounding
good,Stocked merchandise from truck to shelf.
good,A typical day fast pace and kept you awake. Long lines and busy. At the end of the day it would slow down a lot.
good,"Typical day was busy, but I enjoyed busy. There were Associates that had been there 20 plus years they taught me a lot about the company. Management was ok. There wasn't really a hard part to my job, I wanted to go to work and do the absolute best I could to work well with others and be there for the customers."
good,"I worked as a cashier over the summer. I over all enjoyed my coworkers and management. What I did not enjoy was the irregular scheduling that makes it hard to plan outside of work, even though they do give you your schedule 3 weeks out. You have to know your plans 3 weeks out or it is near impossible to make plans. they do not plan well around college schedules/or attempt to give a manageable one where you can easily plan for your hw which was why I quit."
good,"customers are key, a typical day was between 4 and 8 hours long. I ran a register and had fun when the customers were in a joking mood. my co-workers were always making me laugh when we had the spare time. The management i would say could have been a bit different and a little more trained. The part of my job i liked the most was the customers. The least liked thing was the management."
good,"A typical day was a brutal day. Every day was a struggle. either i would be in a heavy lane or i would be bouncing back and forth between two lanes. I learned how to lockout tag out electrical boxes for individual lanes, i learned how to stack freight from left to right bottom to top with heavy freight on bottom and light freight on top. I also learned how to operate power equipment such as a walkie and a PE which is a vehicle that can lift and transport two pallets at a time. I learned how to make pallets of non conveyable freight and how to use a shrink wrap machine and also how to shrink wrap pallets and secure trailer loads using pallets. The management as a whole was a decent management, but as far as the management just in the shipping dock was concerned, it needed vast improvement. The shipping managers seemed to much on a high horse. They were to quick to get people in trouble rather than to try and help people to fix problems. My co-workers were great to work with we all tried to help eachother. The hardest part of the job was loading all non conveyable freight on trailers when you were running a heavy lane or running two lanes at a time. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers."
good,"worked my way through high school and college at walmart. But, when I had a required internship for college they couldn't figure out a way to make my internship schedule work with my work schedule..."
good,• Rotating Product• Down stacking• Quality Control • Product Labels/Binning • Inventory • Filling Outs• Organize cooler/freezer • Assist on sales floor
good,Kept you busy which was a plus!!
good,I began working at Walmart in december of 2008. I started working as a Courtesy Associate (Cart Pusher) and for my first job I don't complain too much. My co-workers were really great and treated me with respect. One of the hardest part is that you don't have a consisted schedule and your hours go down a lot.
good,"No day is the same in the retail sector, there is always something new to learn and a new problem to solve each and every day, therefore you need to have good organising and planning skills, which i have learnt and mastered"
good,You can almost see and hear everything at Walmart. Theres never a dull moment
good,Its a friendly eviment to work in and I learn many skills
good,I enjoy working at Walmart because of the people I meet. My co-workers are on the whole good people to work with. The cons about
good,"A typical day at work was stocking, ordering, straightening, counting, price changes, paper work, managing stock and employees, customer service, answering phones, doing new modulars, changing signs, cleaned fitting rooms. Co workers and managers were mostly nice and I learned everything I needed to know about retail. The most enjoyable part of my job was customer service and organizing.The hardest thing was keeping the sales floor nice and neat."
good,"A typical day at work entailed unloading trucks if we had any, and stocking shelves. It wasn't very hard work. I never had any major issues with management or co-workers."
good,trabalhei so a metade do mes e adorava trabalhar eu fazia de tudo um pouco
good,"Es algo dificil que a veces te ponen mucha presion sólo algunos de los jefes porque estoy de acuerdo que en todo trabajo hay algo de presión pero algunos si exageraban, por lo demas se vive un ambiente muy agradable entre bromas y platicando con los compañeros claro sin dejar a un lado el trabajo."
good,"i worked has deli saleperson. I learn about all types of meats and how to prepare a meals for parties and personal events. I enjoy working with my manager and co worker which was and advantures and learning experiences. The hardest work was whjen i had stayed over to next shift because they didnt show up on schedules. The enjoyable parts was meeting new customers, learning about meats cuttings, prepared meals for events, doing inventories and recieved,etc."
good,you have to be very decicated to walmart its like your second home.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is a day of good old fashioned hard work. The tasks assigned may change multiple times throughout the day, but at the end of the day, the job gets done. Management usually takes the harder route of completing tasks because they do not like to be ""undermined"" when a faster solution is presented to them. I believe that was the hardest part of the job. Trying to help in a more effective and more productive solution and then being told that it is disrespectful to present ideas. The most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction. There is nothing better than to make someone's day by giving them the best customer service that can possibly be provided. Happy customers lead to more business."
good,Love dealing with people face to face. Fast paced and good work environment.
good,"As soon as I clock in I find my supervisor to find out what they have for me to do. If the supervisor is not there then they leave what each person is to do on the schedule posted in our work place. I have learned to use the hand-held Telzon, run the forklift, walkie stacker, cherry picker. Co-workers typically try to help one another out if they can."
good,"The Wal-Mart Central Fill pharmacy is a great place to work. We fill almost 30,000 scripts or more per day."
good,"You start the night out with a short meeting, then right to working your freight, you start with the brakepacks taken out the basics, underwear, T-shirts, scoks, bras, ect. then you open the new freight. you learned how to sort the clothes to be put out. management works on your own. My co-workers we learn to work as a team. The hardest is at the end of the night having to pull the remaining of the freight to the back. The most enjoyable part is going home at the end of the shift."
good,Great co-workers. Easy job. I've learned that if you work hard at something opp
good,I felt you needed to be in the popular group to get any form of a true advancement. It didn't matter how much hardwork and commitment I had it wasn't enough.
good,Walmart was a great place to work. i had great co-workers and management.
good,a typical day at work was to come in an have a group meeting with our supervisors an set goals that we needed to reach by the end of the shifts then be place with are tasks for the shift. the hardest part about the job was working from 10pm until 7am
good,"Walmart is a very unappreciative company. They are a revolving door and can't keep employees. They do not treat their floor people with much respect and their lower management with even less respect. Your hours are all over the place, and if you can't do the hours they set for you, they are not flexable. My coworkers were great many different diversities and culters. They are what made working at Walmart fun."
good,"I worked outside as a Courtesy Clerk. My usual tasks included gathering and restocking the carts, assisting customers with shopping, battery storage, and other duties as assigned. I had a great team of guys to work with and I think this job really improved my speaking abilities. The management was friendly but very disconnected in light of the workload we were faced with. When one of my coworkers got frostbite on his foot while working, they wouldn't allow him to collect workmans comp and he was let go. The hardest part of the job was pushing enough carts to keep up because the snow added a lot of drag. The thing I liked most about this job was communicating with customers."
good,I came to the cash register and I started to help people with transactions all day.
good,Multitasking is a beneficial ability
good,you need to be a district manager or higher to really make any money
good,"Typical day of work was to, for the first 4 hours, use the handheld computer system to pick and unbin various items that needed to be stocked onto the sales floor. The last 4 hours were just the opposite. Using the same computer I needed to inventory and bin all the overstock from the new frieght. I learned how to Drive a forklift, walkie-stacker, and electric pallet jack. Management could have used more training, or experience."
good,"working in the department, putting out the products, helping our customers and making sure they find what they want. people there were so nice, people talk behind people back and it spreads there. i like working there because i knew the department good plus the people were so nice to me."
good,Ennjoy opportunities to learn and perform new responsibilities. Work well independently or in a team environment. Looking to grow and expand my professional experience.
good,My favorite part of the job was helping customers find what they were looking for and even making suggestions or substituting for what we did not have.
good,Management did what they needed to to make sure every shift was covered. My co-workers were hit or miss. Depends on how happy they were working in their own departments. There was really no hard part to the job. The most enjoyable part was just getting to work with people and not by myself.
good,"clock in, find out what area i work in, go pull pallets to my area, sort product out, put up what needed to be put up, take back overstock, sometimes bin it if needed helped, run the cash register when ever needed, greet and answer all customers questions, do price checks if needed, take down and put up new end caps and features."
good,Start by restocking the front end while placing cashiers as they came in for shifts. I would answer calls from cashiers with questions or issues. Assist customers who had questions or needed assistance. Would coordinate breaks and register audits with the next CSM that would come in for the day all while we continued to stock the front end answer cashier and customer issues. This was usual day at Walmart.
good,"I balanced cash drawers, stocked, interacted with the public daily,and eventually held the CSM position The management on 3rd shift was really well trained and easy to work for. My co-workers were very helpful. The hardest part of the job was working 3rd shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was handling the cash drawers, balancing my cash drawer, handling the cash loans to cashiers, and interacting with my customers."
good,"Stocking running the register and customer service, helping customers find what they need. How to work in a fast work place. I enjoy my management they are great to work with. I enjoy some of my co workers. The hardest part of my job is some of the co workers i work with that dont work. The most enjoyable part of my job is always having something to do."
good,IT was not fun at this job. I learned that its hard to constantly be nice to people when they are grumpy all the time. My manager was okay but I just didnt like this job because it was non stop busy and we would miss breaks and it was hard to get to know the other cashiers when you are working so hard all the time. The hardest part of the job was working long hours with no breaks and the best part was how easy the job was.
good,I was the only one working in the optical besides the Doctor who had prior Optical experience. Nobody that worked here had any prior knowledge of optical at all. They were hiring people to work in the optical from the frozen foods or clothing section of the Wal-mart stores. It was a very frustrating job. I definately do not recommend anyone go here to get new glasses.
good,Like the fast pace but that is about all I liked about this job. They really don't treat their workers the best.
good,Hard to make production . Co- workers are good people. Can be phyically demanding @ times. enviroment is either cold or hot with the weather and it is always dusty.
good,Assist customer with merchandise. I learned the policies and procedures of retail. Management and my co-workers were helpful throughout my growth as an Wal-Mart employee.
good,Fast Days
good,Aprendi a montar um supermercado antes de inaugurar e a trabalhar em equipe.
good,"Clocking in then straighten up all the produce while checking dates on the products, and if they needed me on the cashier then I would work the cashier"
good,a typical day at work is going in at the time scheduled and run the cash register until time for breaks or go home
good,Not enough full time positions. lack of benefits. freezer stocking is hard on skin.
good,I would come in at 10 pm and restock the shelves at night help organize the items help customers find things in the store.
good,Checking in and viewing tapes. Taking care of any matters pertaining to working with working law enforment. Learned how to install and properly set security cameras per protocol. The hardest part of the detaining potential threats to the corporation.
good,"The managers will not learn your name and there are over 500 people working there at one time, you are just a number to them and they do not respect you. Long hours at times with no break, they will wait until the last minute they can without getting in trouble to get your break in."
good,"very easy job, very fun learning all about the company. management team willing to help u the best way they can."
good,The bosses at this Walmart were not very good at all. I was told I good have time to take care of my dad who had a serious injury and the lied to me. They got rid of me for bad attendance even though they approved it.
good,"helped out alot just not with school,loved working with the customers the associacte seemed to not likealot of people though."
good,Daily operations of a large retail store. Manage people and make sure we were in-stock.
good,A typical day at work for me is awsome. I greet customers help them by ringing their items up.
good,"There was nothing hard about this job. Stocked groceries,assisted customers. The most enjoyable part of my day was when it was about over."
good,"loved the people i met learned management skills ordering ,price changes and inventory"
good,I overall loved my job. But in the end the politics won. It was not what you knew it was who you knew.
good,"Very entertaining, always kept busy which helped time go by very quickly."
good,Its a pretty fast paced job. Good for college students and people who want a part-time job. I wouldnt recommend it to anybody who wanted a Full-time job. They are starting to take benefits away.
good,I like how overnight associates get paid $1/hr more and we have a set schedule each week.
good,"Don't pay attention to your job description because you will never stay within it. They will have you doing anything and everything. The pay is so low at this job that it is barely enough to survive and they never give raises, if they do it's only like 40 cents or something cheap like that. They do not allow any over time whatsoever. Good luck trying to get a day off that you request, but they will always get you to switch your schedule to work on your day off. They do not allow you to call out no matter what. Even if you're dying in the hospital, they will still consider that an unexcused absence. Most of the co-workers are really nice but the management are always power tripping and they are very fake, they talk and act like they are your friend but then they'll turn their back on you in a second. The most enjoyable part would be that there is always something to do. You will never be bored."
good,Wal-mart is a very busy place to work for! The thing that pushed me away from them was the management lack of taking care of business!
good,Very busy work days. Learned proper customer care. Fair management and placement. Easy to get along with co-workers. Always enjoyed working in Sporting Goods and helping customers find merchandise.
good,"start recieving and unloading everything out of the truck , then we palletizing and take them out to the floor and start stocking until shift is up. learn how to work with other people. management was good.co-workers some good and motivaded. unloading the trailer we had to do it in at a certain time. competing with employers how fast you are."
good,Many interactions with customer to help fulfill their needs. Use of teamwork with co-workers to get tasks completed. Management readily available to help answer and concerns.
good,A typical day for me at work is just keep moving. The moment i slow down I feel like the time just slowed up on me. I learn ever day to be a great person and respect everyone cause u never no how their day is goin. I mostly manage the back making sure that everything in the back of the house is done before i leave.
good,Learned lots within the company and was able to work my way up in the company
good,"Average work environment, average work, average opportunities, but miserably sad and angry coworkers."
good,"A typical day consisted of stocking, cleaning, checking customers out at the register, assisting with sale and customer questions. I learned the value of having a strick inventory system. Management was very inconsistent. Co-workers made the job more interesting. the hardest part of the job was standing for long preiods of time. There was really no enjoyable part of the job to me."
good,Typical day at work was very demanding. People think that cashiers just stand there but it is much more than that. Management was very accomadating whenever anyone had an issue. Training was very positive.
good,They care if you go to school or not and are more than willing to help you
good,i worke in the warehouse so it was all about porduction its ajob
good,ok job location is a big deal some stored a slot better than others
good,Most of my coworkers are great. I like that I can have my work schedule work around my school schedule.
good,"The work is repetetive but not terribly so. I learned customer service. Management left something to be desired, mostly in the way they treated associates. Acting as if we were below their kindness/respect. The co-workers were great people. Most of them hard-working and fun to be around. The hardest part was the physical aspect, which wasn't really hard. In general it was pretty easy work. The most enjoyable part was being in the store after hours with good humored people."
good,"I have learned better communication skills, also helping and answering questions for customers. Co-workers did not enjoy their job. Fast environment, rude customers, and unorganized workplace. Most enjoyable part about this job was helping out the customers with needs and questions."
good,"I started out working as an overnight cashier. I enjoyed meeting many different people. After about a year and a half of being a cashier, I applied for a position in the accounting office. I was granted the position. I took on a great responsibility of handling large amounts of money. I enjoyed my fellow co-workers in both my cashiering position and my accounting office position."
good,i clocked on stood t the register and rang customers out. I bagged the food.
good,Walmart is an alright place to work with but there are several coworkers that thought they were better then everyone else and dropped the blame on the people that worked hard. Managers don't do much about the people who are bad workers.
good,"you have to be very flexible with all aspect scheduling, job duties , departments etc"
good,"sales is very fast moving line of work, it didn't pay much but i learned a lot from the managers and co-workers"
good,it is a friendly place to work and do your job. The mangers are good but need more training and more people skills. i start at 7:00 and fill shelves til 9:00 and then meetings and order and clean and the stock more shelves til 4:00 pm
good,"Cleaning and maintaining store, taking a lot of different managerial advice and direction, enjoyed due to thge maintenance factor and being able to share my own ideas."
good,I mainly worked in electronics but had the oppertunity to work in several other areas as well. The nice thing about that was that you never got bored.
good,the management there can be alittle rude if you need to take the day or night off cause of anything personal that you have to handle and can be a pain on how fast you get work done
good,The hardest part of the job is getting the shopping carts when there's a few inches of snow on the ground.
good,"Open bakery, review cake orders for the day, start decorating so cakes are ready on time for pickup by customers. I learned customer service. Co-workers were easy to get along with."
good,I clock in access my department look at my outs and lows and then go to my cooler and access what I have that needs to go out immediately based on sales and put it out. The hardest part of my job is not having a particular set of people to work my department the most enjoyable part is when I have a hardworking team and we can be very productive and have all of my work done before I leave.
good,A typical day of work at Wal-Mart as a cashier is quite tedious. The environment is fast-paced but close attention must be paid to detail. The hardest part of the job is that employees must strive to ensure that each customer receives quality care despite the daily stressors. Wal-Mart made it necessary to learn how to professionally and cordially interact with a very diverse group of people and to efficiently maintain clean and orderly checkout areas. The staff at Wal-Mart is generally friendly despite a few members. The most enjoyable part of this job is the opportunity to interact with some new and friendly faces.
good,Walmart is a good place to learn how to deal with customers and practice how to deal with them.
good,I learned a lot from this company. Time management and patience has become a very big attribute.
good,"Walmart is to big for itself. By this i mean corprate and managment dont talk and they dont have the time to better an associate. Granted I did learn alot of stuff through walmart, it still isn't a real ideal place to work....Since same walton died the managment team and the core values have been missed."
good,Working at walmart is very demanding on the body. It is a steady job with good pay but not a job you can do forever. The job is not very self gratifying for me.
good,"helped out customer once they arrived in my department..I would stock and make sure the shelves were clean and fully stocked..Would put away inventory, and set up shelves. Made spare keys for customers. Overall, the job was fun and easy. I got to work at my own pace and really ran that department since my shifts were generally after my manager left for the day. The sport department where it was located was nice, since i did not have to deal with customers asking about other items like houseware, jewelry and all of that. if the customer came to the sporting goods they generally knew what they wanted.."
good,A typical day at work is full of enjoyment. I have learned how to deal with raging customers. My co-workers are fun to be around. The hardest part of my job is ordering supplies that we need. The most enjoyable part of my job is working hard to make the day go by faster.
good,there are a lot of complaints about wal-mart and how they treat their employees. Some of them i experienced to be true others i did not.
good,Walmart as a company is a great company to work for as a part time job. This particular location was not so great but overall a great experience
good,"A fun place to work, but they pay minimum wage and there is no benefits for a part-time worker"
good,Standard list of duties.
good,Got fired due to being sick because of medication my body had to get used to.
good,I assist customers with any questions or problems they may have. I help maintain the sales modules and keep merchandise displayed neatly and in order. I often work with large loads of merchandise ( ranging from 20lbs - 120lbs). I have great co-workers who make the work place fun and lively.
good,"I am an experienced manager with great communication skills to go with my solid leadership skills. I am all about people leadership, motivation and recognition for solid work done daily. I lead 350 - 400 associates currently and am looking for new opportunities."
good,This was my first job! I learned everything here from cleaning to tendering cash and performing great customer service. This is a great job for someone who is in High School or just home for the summer. Wonderful first job for teens.
good,"A typical day at WalMart consisted of me clocking in, Getting the key for the cart pusher and a walkie talkie from the Customer Service Manager(CSM). I then would go out into the lot and start retrieving carts stopping when I got all the carts or I needed to preform a carry out. I learned how to use a cart pusher and the importance of proper lifting. I never had much interaction with Management just seeing them out on the floor or in the back room. The hardest part of the job was defiantly being out in the cold at times my shoes would soak through from the snow or puddles. I liked being out side when it was nice. My co-workers were okay. I only really had 1 co-worker I enjoyed because he almost always came in for his shift 2 others wouldn't show up a lot and I would have to clear the lot by myself."
good,a day consists of cashing and ringing up customers. Straightening up aisles and monitoring stations
good,"Good mix of talent,"
good,"Some of the stores might be good, but generally this company has gone done over the years. The have turned their eyes away from what was good and working. The co-workers were great to work with but the management has a lot to learn."
good,"Adquirí experiencia en atención al cliente, control de mercadería ( pedidos a proveedores, control de stock etc).Muy buen equipo de trabajo."
good,"""Too many chiefs and not enough indians."" A quote I've heard all too often. Easy to work for however it starts at minimum wage."
good,ok place managers sucked and played favorites did not like training people in other departments
good,its was alright I the fact that i was given steady hours at work and the part i kinda didn't like was it was overnight but overall i enjoyed the job.
good,Management is always changing so there seem to be problems with that. There are a lot of opportunities for advancement.
good,"Was a good place to work, very close to home. I worked with a great group of people."
good,"Walmart was founded on three basic beliefs, and our adherence to these principles has created a unique work culture at Walmart."
good,"They higher mainly part time work which means no benefits or insurance. From what I have seen, to get full time, it is a long time waiting to impossible."
good,"I needed a job and the came to town, so I applide and the hired me."
good,"Good at working in a "" team oriented "" environment"
good,"lots of customer service, daily cash audits and problem solving. answer phone and make pages"
good,"hard to get answers, management was always absent minded. yet the people that work there are fantastic."
good,the customers their families were the nicest however when it came to team members it was a gossip feast
good,fast pace working place. Good people worked there mostly all were hard working.
good,"Graveyard stock, good job. Treated fairly, family oriented."
good,- Busy workplace with heavy lifting.
good,"Gun work example exceptions, price changes."
good,"They don't pay well. THey want to be able to schedule you differently every week making it hard to have a life. They want control with little pay . My managers are wonderful, though"
good,Fast paced
good,Working for Walmart was great before I got accumluated with everything and learned how the system worked or my department I should say. The daytime workers in my department are told to not to bring any freight back to the back so they just put it any where they find space and when I come at night to stock nothing is where it belongs so it cuts into my stocking time. When management was informed they did nothing to help sovle this problem simply because it would result in more work for them. Co-workers were very helpful but a few were rude. The hardest part was having to bin in the freezer considering that it's always below 10 degress.
good,"Every day was the same, I start working at 8:00 am interviewing people, filling forms, applying and interpreting psychological tests, all day long."
good,"somewhat enjoyable, poor management"
good,the pay to start is min and you get 32 hours . They will not work with you to get a second job . They have a lot of stuff to make your work day fun .
good,"customer service, lab work, insurnace filing were just some of the duties that I would conduct through out a day. I enjoyed meeting new people and my coworkers became like family to me."
good,Loved with with customers in a good atmosphere.My coworkers were great people to work with and i made lots of friends working there.
good,"A typical day a work would be requiring me to give a speedy checkout while insuring the customer has had a great customer service expeience. Also im required to do returns, exchanges and handle any other customer issue thats brought to my attention"
good,Walmart is an ok place to work for. It was better in the past before sam walton had passed and left his fortun to his sons to take over. Ever since then its gone down hill and to most people that work for walmart it is considered just a job. and we have to have one due to the economy to just survive. Walmart needs to step up on their pay level and help out these thousands of employees they have working for this company that used to be #1.
good,"a typical day is usually very busy, i work at night so we have to make sure that any trucks that we have gotten that day is completey done before the day shift comes in."
good,I worked for Walmart for almost 8 years at first it was very easy to move around in the store. But as the years go on and upper management find thinks you are good at is very hard to move up in the company for the fear of having to find someone that is welling to step in and work just as well as you have done. Nice people to work around my co worker where great I still have a relationship with some of them.
good,Walmart has great benefits and a lot of nice opportunities. They also let you move up if you want to.
good,"Very enjoyable place to work at in the MD area, not so much in the WV area"
good,-cashiering and customer service
good,"The best part of all the positions I had was meeting alot of awesome people. From co-workers to customers. And just giving people my ALOHA SPIRIT and great customer service, because they only deserve the best and thats what they got from me !!!"
good,This is a good company to work for but the compensation for everything they expect you to do does not match. With the amount of money this company makes in a year they can definitely afford to pay their associates more.
good,Someday's where different from others. You would have smooth days and you would have days where the store would be a big traffic jam.
good,"eles nao dao valor o funcionário,tem hora pra entrar mas nao tenhora pra sair, mal a pessoa pode ir ao banheiro pois e uma correria só na epoca a gerencia era boa os colegas era todos legais."
good,"As a Store Manager I was responsible for entire store duties including, UPC, Invoicing, Direct Manager of 125 employees and indirectly managed 325 employees, reviewed pay bands with District HR, performed employee evaluations, P&L, Budgets, Sales, Merchandising, employee scheduling, customer services, cash office, loss prevention."
good,Working overnight provides a different type of person to be able to do it. I learned a lot about the retail business.
good,Working with people is the best. I enjoyed working there and helping customers. Management were good. I enjoyed my co-workers very much it was a great team. The most enjoyable part was helping people on a daily basis. the worst part was finding stock in the back room but we all manged as ateam.
good,"Typical day, answering phones, putting away drugs , filling scripts, maintaining a clean n stocked work area. I learned something new everyday; it could be about a patient or new drugs, or side affects. My co-workers were great if i miss anything about the job it would be the friendships that i made in the 10 years i was there. The hardest part of the job was watching the older patients fight with there insurance companys to pay for there scripts, and not being able to get there meds. The most enjoyable is having a great group of people to work with and patients that are understanding."
good,"When working here I learned many new things, such as; reading lables, preparing shelves and product, and then placing the product on the shelf space avaliable. Team work is important to this company and I liked the open door policy. This policy insured the employee could discuss any issue they may be having with other employees or even the managers; without being push out of their job."
good,I've worked for Wal-mart 9yrs and It was fun and pleasent at one time. Times has changed and Wal-mart has changed. Not for the better. It is a great place to work at if you are a student tryin to get a start in the work force. Like every job it has its ups and downs. Hardest part of this job is customer service dealin with the customers. You must have patience and never get upset please your customer at all times. This is what I do best thats why I've been there 9yrs. Most of the co-workers are kind and eazy to work with but not all. My enjoyable moments was when the store first opened I had fun being an employee there for the first 3 yrs.
good,Experienced inventory requirements and the importance of the appearance of the merchandise
good,"I got along well with almost everyone in the building, they were very friendly co workers."
good,"A typical night a work consisted of checking customers out, sorting merchandise into the correct department to be reshelved, stocking of the front registers, managers wall, cart rail and candy department."
good,"maintained my area,customer service, handled the register"
good,"Stock merchandise,zoning the floor,keep the departments nice and clean.work over there teach me how to deal with customers,be patient in diferent situations.Management was pretty good.,most of the time flexible with the employees in emergency situations.Work on"
good,Working at Walmart is a very busy day. you have certain task u have to fulfill before u get off and you have to make sure its done right. working here is alright. walmart is a very busy place and you get a lot of people.
good,going to work and running my department to the best of my ability in order to provide complete customer service. I learned every part of the store that my manager needed me work in. I worked some really great managers. The hardest part of my job was working my department with out any help. The best part of my job was helping in every department they wanted me in. Helping other people to full fill their jobs in a timely manner.
good,Worked here for almost four years now. Its been okay. There is room to advance within the company you just have to be there for a while and make your self noticeable. They do work you like a slave child and expect you to get your job as well as other peoples job done. I would only recommend this job as a last resort. I've been through the good and the bad with this company.
good,"work is busy most of the time, i worked in various weather conditions."
good,"would come in at night time would wash floors, strip, buff and wax floors and go home. I learned how to wax, strip and buff floors. Management was very strict. Some of coworkers were good workers with some exceptions. Hardest part of job was dealing with upset customers and management, most enjoyable part of job was pay."
good,"Entre varias coisas o atendimento ao cliente dando informações, preenchimento de planilhas de estoque com validade dos produtos,gerencia com trabalho de motivação do funcionario,um ambiete muito agradavel com trabalho em equipe.Tive um pouco dificuldade em troca de horario os horarios eram variados."
good,"i worked as a 3rd shift stock associate and attended college at the same time, the managers knew this and still schedualed me for 40 hours a week for 12 weeks straight then drop me back to part time hours just in time to ensure them not having to give me benefits."
good,well the job was for feeling when staff was scheduled which wasnt that often most of the time i delt with three or more departments and customer on the floor and at regesiter. i would check was wasnt on the floor or instock and then either order or check what night before truck would bring in. which i loved because it kept me busy. the only thing that i didnt like about job was being a depeartment manger and not even making 10.00 an hour.
good,Empresa justa de acordo com os direitos trabalhistas e que tambem oferecia bom plano de carreira.
good,Chain retail pharmacy. Late hours and weekends expected on a regular basis
good,"I am in charge of up to a nine member team in my department and I am expected to stock and maintain the presentation and quality of my store's produce department, which requires constant attention to detail. It has taught me to be vigilant to my duties and aware of my duties to make a successful department."
good,"I liked the people I worked with, just didn't like how the store was run. Difficult to get time off."
good,Everyday is new day with new customers and some regulars too. I have learn is that everyday is new and never know what is going to happen. Management is all different in their own way. Most of the people I worked with were nice.
good,production requirements are very hard to reach. There is also a problem getting equipment to help.
good,"todo bien organizado,aprendi el manejo de la caja registradora,atencion al cliente lo mas importante.la parte mas dificil cuando se caia el sistema y no se podian pasar las tarjetas de credito y colmaba de clientes.La tranquilidad laboral y la buena organizacion fue lo que mas me gusto"
good,I was still song
good,Enjoyed working with different people. Meeting new people was exciting as well. Assisted in customer complaints as well as assisting in customer check-out procedures.
good,wonderful store that has everything you need. I learned how to work on the sales loor and how to run a register. i enjoyed meeting new people.
good,Good Job for after high school but not a career or not for me but was a fun place to work.
good,Good advancement opportunitites. Good job if you have good people skills and like to work with others.
good,managed day to day interactions with customers and associates in TLE
good,It was enjoyable.Learned how to stock and load/unload trucks. co-workers were nice.
good,I had an ok time working at Walmart. The benefits werent all that great if you were part-time and they barely had employees working on a day to day basis which makes it hard on the employees and dissatisfied customers.
good,Customers satisfaction was always priority. I learned retail and sales and inventory at this job. I learned that management was very involved in employees relations.
good,"A typical day at work for me as a customer service manager was never the same. Depending on what day of the week it is determines the challenges I will be facing that day. Busier days everyday tasks such as maintaining breaks for my associates, keeping customers happy, and ensuring the front of the store ran smoothly was a little more challenging. Some of the management at my store are very supportive others are not which is typical of any job. I love most of coworkers and worked very well as a team with them. The hardest part of my job would be feeling like I didn't completely succeed at doing the best job I could. Sometimes customers will just not be able to be be pleased or we have an upset associate who isn't going to happy with anything. These areas are hard for me to fail at because these are the core aspects of my job. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to interview and look at potential new employees,"
good,A typical day is extremely productive always something to do weather i'm working inside or outside of the cash office. Also its always a learning experience either finding out how to perform specific task inside the office or dealing with customers in good and bad situations. Management as well as my co-workers can sometimes be hard to deal with for the simple fact they would just rather tell you to do something instead of explain what they want you to do and why so that you understand yourself what is going on in the store or your department. The hardest part of my job is knowing that I'm in a position that will no longer allow me to grow inside that field. The most enjoyable part of my job is that despite all the cons within my co-workers and management i love what i do and also the different things I learn inside the accounting office because i know it will benefit me in my career goal.
good,"Managed cashiering activities in areas of purchasing, returns, and exchanges, and enforced store policies."
good,You can figure this one out! it's a job and can fill the needs of a job.
good,"Walmart is a good place to work if you are looking for something temporary. The benefits are not that great and they will only hire part time employment, but it gives you an opportunity to make money and to talk to people and get out of the house. The pay is not great and part time employees don't get any benefits for a year except for the employee discount."
good,I was part time at walmart because thats all they hire unless you are being hired as a manager.
good,You work very hard. Its a fast paste environment. I love the fact that I am surrounded by many different cultures. You have a very heavy workload and you are always under staffed. I also love the fact that you are able to develop and train others to be the best that they can be and motivating them to take pride in their work.
good,This is one of the hardest jobs I have ever had. I highly recommend it for the learning experience alone though. It will teach you how to be a hard worker and team work values.
good,It was a good company to work for. The management is good about working with schedules. I learned leadership and overall it was a good experience.
good,"Working a Wal-mart is crazy. Some days are good some days are not good. You will Co-workers that dont want to do there job and you have to do both yours and theirs,. To have a good day at wal-mart is to keep a smile on your face and keep work untill its time for your day to end."
good,none
good,Working at Walmart had alot of challenges. Going in to work dealing with different attitudes can be a hassle but Im a strong person that can handle it. Ive learned that even if pressured its not good to react to certain bliss. Management was ok and the Co- workers were fine. The hardest part of my job was changing shifts. I would be so use to a certain shift and it would be hard to adjust to another so fast but I manage to do so. The most enjoyable part about working in Walmart is that it was very convenient.
good,Was a good company to work for but there was no chance for advancement
good,"4 to 5 days work with team work, helpfull mamagement."
good,"Typical night at Walmart (3rd shift) is stocking merchandise and helping customers find merchandise. I have learned the retail system and why its important to place items in the correct places and make sure prices are correct. Management in corporate and in the Super Centers needs to communicate better with department managers, assistant managers and other support managers. My co workers are hard working. The hardest part of my job is always working black friday, holidays and Walmart never closing to let employees enjoy the holidays like everyone else."
good,"I have been with wal mart for 5 yrs, i have learned a lot about customer service, also before i transfer to the vision center i had no clue about glasses prescriptions and so on now i can look at a person with glasses and i know what kind of lenses the have or if they are useing contact lenses. I've learned how to work with the different 4 doctors that we have, it has been a great experience."
good,Typical- Busy at random hours
good,"Uma empresa boa de trabalhar mas ão valoriza o funcionário,mas mesmo assim tive muito conhecimento em praticamente vários setores.Tínhamos horário de entrada mas raramente um horário certo de saída porque era um serviço onde eles queriam aproveitar bem o serviço do funcionário.Os benefícios eram bons mas o que estragava eram o pouco tempo em que ficávamos com a família."
good,Not a company that is very family friendly anymore. Always shot handed. Very clickie.My most enjoyable part of this job was working with customers and being able to help them out.
good,"I cashiered for walmart before I decided to go to college. I learned through working at walmart as their cashier, that retail was not for me."
good,daily schedule for me is very busy not quite enough time in the day for everything i would like to accomplish
good,"A typical day started with me scanning and ordering out of stock inventory items. I had to ensure that they were truly out of stock and not just off counts in the perpetual inventory system. I had to correct any wrong counts to accurate counts. I supervised a crew of associates and had to train them as well as assign them daily tasks and responsibilities. I had to ensure these were done correctly and in a timely manner. I was also responsible for checking in merchandise and ensuring accuracy on the invoice. Most of my co-workers seemed unhappy and only cared about getting a paycheck. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the lack of communication between management. Managers varied greatly, some were great at their jobs and that made my job easier others struggled and that added more work and pressure to me. I enjoyed managing the inventory levels, improving sales, and dealing with customers and suppliers."
good,my managers were great to work with
good,"Reabastecia produtos faltantes e reabastecia produtos devolvidos, colocação de preços nas estantes."
good,"good company, low pay, good people to work with on overnights shift. 1 hour lunch break."
good,"typical national retail chain. a slave to corporate policy and protocol. severely understaffed and and way to busy for all the workers to adequately handle the customers. not good enough pay, they cut way to many corners like the door greeters which allows people to just walk out the door with 55' LCD tvs and the like. needs to go back to thinking more about the customer and employee rather than the almighty dollar."
good,"Worked there for about half a year before moving out of Maryland. Stable work, but low pay."
good,"I stock shelves, work in the back room binning merchandise or am up front helping cashier. i have learned that working in a fast paced job can be hectic, but you have to be patient and get through it. The hardest part of the job is having too many tasks in one night, due to management not fully making everyone work their share for the night. I believe that everyone should have to be held accountable for their responsibilities and actions at the work place. I enjoy my co workers. The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to help customers find what they need or to help them in any way that i can."
good,"Job duties are to run freight, know about new and popular items and handle customer service. I learned a lot about interacting with the public. Management was usually nice and will listen to your troubles but will rarely do anything about them. Co-workers vary everyday. The hardest part of the job is handling multiple departments because the stores are mostly understaffed. The most enjoyable aspect of the job is helping people find what they need."
good,"For the most part Walmart was a good experience to work at. The first store I worked at I felt was better at working with you if you had a family emergency or something of that nature, while the next time I worked for Walmart I didn't feel the same type of family-oriented environment. The pay wasn't always based on experience or how long you worked there and basically everyone got the same thing. Benefits were great for full-time associates, but for part time associates it was a lot more expensive and not as much coverage."
good,A typical day starts with reading email for company directed changes or recalls. Checking for and performing any price changes and on hand audits.
good,Walmart has many opportunities to advance and to make a name for yourself. They have good benefits and allow advancement in the company.
good,The staff at Wal-Mart are good people from all walks of life. The management at Wal-Mart are helpful to a certain extent.
good,"You stay busy all the time and most of the people you worked with were great,if you stay with the company the benifits are out standing"
good,"I liked working there. You are in a fast paced environment and your day goes buy fast. There is a lot of drama that can go on there, and the managers tend to show favortism when it comes to promoting."
good,"wal mart, going in too a day of work would my really busy with really no staff on hand just 1 other guy. the part i would say i loved the most was helping the customer.."
good,"the way they treat customers are terrible, & customers will not treat you with respect"
good,"nice co workers,long days some good days, slow days as well, mostly busy days"
good,"Empresa com plano de carreira de fácil ascensão, porém exigência de horário prolongado sem controle de cartão ponto."
good,to much gossip. will work you with full time hours but will not make you full time. very stressful work place.
good,hours cut. You will have plenty to do. I have gainned alot of knowledge as far as maintianing the OTC Pharmacy. I like the
good,it was a great place to work at and i got along well with all the other associates
good,They work you like a dog and pay you like a slave. Then expect for you to want to stay another year by offering you a thirty cents raise. lol
good,Due to the position I held I cannot comment on the details of it. I met a lot of new friends and made okay money.
good,"Worked as a unload-er and our team was one of the best and fastest at unloading trucks. Clock in for the day and busy, busy, busy. Organize our rollers and got ready to unload semi trailers. Organization was very important for our job."
good,"Early in the morning I have a little meetings to distribute a different duties,and work in the back room."
good,flexibility is the key - schedule changes weekly and there is never the same thing twice
good,WalMart is a wonderful place to work. The company is great for college students. They are willing to work around your schedule.
good,I learned a lot of customer skills. Coworkers are friendly and nice to work with. Working at this walmart is like joinging a family awway from home.
good,"em geral e uma empresa boa resumindo em alimentação dentro da empresa, beneficios de saude, lazer... mas o dia dia em qualquer cargo e bem estressante, tanto que o rodizio de funcionarios e bem grande, dificil gostarem de estar la mesmo tendo esses beneficios."
good,"I enjoyed working with people no job is perfect but, Overall it's a great company."
good,"Typical day: 10pm - 6:30am, Mon - Sun"
good,"I enjoyed meeting new people everyday and making conversations, hardest part of the job would have to be taking care of those customers that are not very nice. Management is very nice and always there to help when needed. I have learned that there are always days that customers are in a hurry and not very nice."
good,"I would go in to clean, cook, make sandwiches, help customers. I learned how to use the equipment at the store for the store. Management was good, but they did have some quirks. My coworkers were good people to work with. I can not recall the hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customer walk away happy."
good,Love working the people and helping customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the smile on the customers face i have helped.
good,"Wal-Mart is a great place to advance for a goal-driven individual. In every position, no two days are ever exactly the same, thanks to our wonderful, diverse customers. Wal-Mart taught me how to deal with people from every walk of life, and how to problem-solve on your feet. The hardest part of working for Wal-Mart would be the occasional conflict between focusing on the bottom line and customer satisfaction, which is something that is faced in any retail situation. I will say that I had more latitude to satisfy the customer at Wal-Mart than I have seen in other retail organizations."
good,"A empresa WMS supermercados do Brasil, é uma empresa multinacional, boa para quem começa seu primeiro emprego."
good,lots of projects and things to do always busy. scheduling was good great hours
good,This was retail employment which I enjoyed at the time. I truly enjoyed meeting people everyday and being able to help provide a solutions to their problems.
good,a typical day at work
good,"An average day at Walmart would be us clocking in at 4 p.m. then heading straight to the docks to unload the merchandise truck. That would usually take about 3 hours with a 15 minute break 2 hours in. After we finished unloading all the items off the merchandise truck, we were then split up into groups and are either sent to unload the grocery truck, separate the miscellaneous items from boxes, push carts, hang up clothing or stock on the floor until lunch break. After lunch break we then brought out all the organized items from the trucks out onto the floor on pallets and/or carts. When we finished bringing all the pallets and carts to the floor we did picks, meaning we used a tool called a Telxion to check inventory and refill/replace bins of items in the backroom. At the end of the day we cleaned the backroom area until it was time to clock out."
good,"Walmart is a good first job but i want to expand my talents. I have learned how to count inventory, manage my staff and their schedules, count money, food handling and more. My co-workers have been awesome no complaints. the hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers. the most enjoyable part of the job is learning new things everyday,"
good,A lot of confusion from day to day...put in different area everyday.. mot doing the job you were actually hired for.
good,Busy job working at the DC. Fast paced and very tolling on your body. Management is usually good at listening but not good at setting an example themselves: for working hard or even following the same rules as hourly employees.
good,"A typical work day consists of going in at night, doing a safety sweep of the store, cleaning bathrooms, running the floor scrubber, taking out the trash, talking to the occasional customer advising them where to go to get what they want, then another safety sweep before I get off. I have learned very little working here but still has been a good expirence. The managers are always different but they all know what they are doing so the store stays up to date with them all working together. The people I work with are great if I ever need anything most of them would be there to help. The hardest part of the job is staying up all night then trying to get to school the next day. But with the bad they also have the good the most enjoyable part of my job would be the interactions you have with the customers when doing your job."
good,My typical work day began with meetings in regards to my employess and any company updates. For the most part of the day I remained in the front part of the office to supervise secured access amongst all employees. Conducted my asset management team to complete walk throughs and all other asset protection functions.
good,"A typical day at Walmart is very busy. Customers coming in and out and your expected to smile at everyone. The hardest part of the job is having to deal with irate customers. Even though they may be wrong, in Walmart's eyes the customer is always right. The most enjoyable part of my job is definately meeting new people everyday. My co-workers are great and I made some great friends there. The management was awful. They just seem as if they didnt care about their employees."
good,"Fast paced, work day went by pretty fast. Different types of people at one place. Everyone treated fairly and accordingly."
good,"a typical day at work is always different most of the days are very busy because of all the freights, rolling racks, modulars and zoning."
good,"A typical day at Walmart included working in different departments, performing different tasks, having to working with managers that are not knowledgeable of their respective positions; had an opportunity to work at different levels culminating in a departmental manager position. The hardest part of the job, was the constant actions of getting pulled to other areas due to personnel shortages while not having the time to work at my areas of responsibility. The most enjoyable part of my job was that I established many personal connections with other staff members and customers alike."
good,Walmart gave me my first break as a full time employee in the force arena and I will be grateful for this opportunity.
good,"Honestly not that bad of a place to work. Enjoyed working as an electronics sales associate, the management at my first store really cared along with the common folk. Being an overnight stocker was alright, just boring,and management was way different from prev. store"
good,zoning area folding clothes putting away returns
good,"I check in to our daily tasts, do the task that is required, check them off when completed, then around 6pm we do our maintaining and clean up of our department we are assighed to. sometimes more than one when under staffed. At end of shift I complete my day. Also during the tasks we also help customers and what ever our management wants us to help them with."
good,The competence of the management was lacking which resulted in slower than normal working results.
good,"Ringing up and bagging groceries, flexible schedule, mainly worked alone unless training."
good,"I have to be prepared for a day of multi-tasking. Not only do I cut fabric in the Fabric Dept., I stock shelves and zone 3 other departments. I also help customers find products in other departments near my apartment. So I need to know a reasonable amount of knowledge of our product line in all of the store."
good,"buen horario, buen ambiente de trabajo, pero lo malo que era contrato por temporada."
good,The training can improve. The short staffed can improve.
good,Too busy. Management or employees need more training. Overworked. Not enough employees.
good,"Generally pretty laid back place to work, the pay isnt all that much, you can expect minimum wages."
good,wal-mart is a very busy store. learned to work with differnt cultures and ethnicities.
good,"The day to day work was not bad at all. I enjoyed working with my peers, but management needed help."
good,easy job
good,Great place to learn about product and also to help people out.
good,"Steady, reliable employment for short term or long term for some individuals."
good,Co-workers were nice and team oriented. Management was fair. Not a bad place to work.
good,"Typical day was stocking my department, helping customers with questions, cashiering, and heavy lifting."
good,You would expect more from this successful global retailer then the minimum benefits and just above minimum wage pay. Walmart is just a job like like any other regular business.
good,"A typical day at work requires patience and prioritizing. Never having worked retail before, it was an eye opener. There are times when day to day responsibilites are the same, then at times it is very demanding and fast paced. You need good communication skills between management, associates, and customers. There's always learning opportunities. I've learned a lot of patience with this position. You have to be willing to adapt. Changes are common and if you do not like change, good luck, Unfortunately, poor attitudes are also common with this job and I think that is the hardest part of the job. You see it in customers, co-workers, management, You have to maintain your composure. What I do love about my job is the friendly customers and how they can bring me back to reality. Good conversation while helping a customer makes my job so much easier. Although being on my feet all day can be a pain, everyday is something different and that makes it bearable. I enjoy being with co-workers and teamwork. My employer has a reputation for not appreciating its employees at the corporate level but I feel with the responsibility I am personally given from my department manager, the respect from my supervisor and open communication with store management I am valued. Honestly employees are stretched a liitle too thin here but if you make the most of it it says something of your work ethic and sooner of later advancement is bound to happen for you. You have to wait two years before receiving health and vacation benefits, which is a bummer. Needless to say I have respect for associates who have"
good,management is sketchy at time but a enjoyable place to work overall
good,I work in the parking lot mainly and help throughout the store as required. This job is very physically demanding.
good,"A empresa era muito boa, oferecia benefícios, pagava o salário em dia, mas era muito puxado, às vezes entrando para trabalhar às 10h da manhã e saindo na madrugada; colocava poucas funcionárias para trabalhar no caixa, por isso, tinham longas filas, os clientes reclamavam, e eu ouvia muitas reclamações em xingões no caixa."
good,"well, its a hard place to work for, the management, are not careing people, they have screwed alot of people around, they have messed with me alot, they never gave me help when help was needed,its not a good work place to work for,they have no compassion for their help at all, they dont listen to their co-workers like they should, groton walmart is not a good pl;ace to work for."
good,"Typical day of work included personnel evaluations, purchasing supplies and equipment and monitoring the progress flow."
good,when i first come to work i do the alerts which are sales floor counts than i do the picks once they are finished i do the inventory counts
good,"management did not treat everybody equal, and they liked some employees more then others"
good,I never really wanted to stay as long as I stayed with this company. Overall I give them a 3 Rating.
good,"I liked this job because it was fun to roam around and just move. I also liked a lot of the customers. Some of the co-workers were a bit on the dramatic side, but I always ignored what ever issues were going on. If I could I would work there again, but probably a different shift."
good,Wal-Mart is an great company to work for. Wal-Mart is like one big Happy family
good,"Being Wal -Mart you can move just about anywhere in the company, even from store to store since they are all over the place. The benefits are good and the people were friendly."
good,"We bandaged scrapes and bruises, took temeperatures, treated bug bites and stings."
good,Even though I only worked there it was still a good experieince of course you run into the occasional ignorant customer but you just keep doing your job no matter what. The co-workers are friendly and helpful as well.
good,"É uma empresa com um tripé de valores básicos, porém a prática não é seguida por alguns gestores e isso a torna desagradável."
good,"Great company to work for, coworkers were nice and friendly, if I didn't know something they would try to help me out. Most of the manager were nice but of course there are always some exceptions. I enjoyed being able to help people with their needs and answer questions for them if I did know the answer and if I didn't I would find somebody that knew or could help them."
good,"It was nice getting to meet new people everyday, although some customers can be very rude. I got along with all my coworker. Only down side is it is not a very steady job if you are looking for a 40 hour week paycheck, sometimes i would get only 8 hours in a week and i knew people that they just completely took off the schedule for a week."
good,A typical day at wal-mart is all about customer service making sure the customer have what they need or find out what they re looking for. I learn that you really do alot of work and get paid very little. Mangement is ok and the co-workers are very cool. The hardest part about the job is doing others work for them and they dont appreciate it. The most enjoyable part of the job is your lunch break.
good,Management was not employee friendly. They were not very pleasant to new comers.
good,"Depending on the location you can like it or hate it. Management is filled with a lot of different people. Some you like and some you don't, just varies who you get."
good,I was in the bakery until I hurt my back down-stacking pallets of frozen food. They moved me to cashier to see if my back could get better without having to go to a doctor. I just stand at the cash register checking out customers.
good,"Wal Mart is one of the world's biggest company and the one I work at is very busy. On a typical day, I am working on the cash register, assisting customers, stocking shelves, selling firearms and ammo, and Security the area from thief."
good,Dia de muito trabalho sabado.
good,I love working with new people its a big place to work at I enjoy the people I work with we all stick together as one team and we all take up each others responsibility as one
good,"A typical day at work was very busy, especially at this specific location, i learned that keeping busy would at least make the day go by faster, the management is ok other co workers were kind of diffrent, but for the most part nice."
good,I met great people and management was great at working with your schedule. I would say that benefits were okay for parttime associates.
good,"Working with the best team, helped eachother in rough situations and would cover eachother with workload, breaks and time off. We all worked in unison and made a great team. Management of the store was less than satisfactory, main reason why I left. I did not like to be a part of that ""statistic"" that the store manager was implying. But otherwise great experience and gave me the experience now what I am doing as a Medical Assistant."
good,the customers were good for the most part i enjoy the customer service end of the job making the customers happy is number one.
good,"not enough hours to live on, management very caring and considerate, co workers awesome, loved working there just couldn;t survive on hours...."
good,A regular day at work. I learn alot about retail. Management was pretty good. I got along with co-workers good. The hardest part about the job was not working enough. I enjoyed working and serving the customers.
good,I really enjoyed the associates that I worked with . It was a disorganized workplace.I do appreciate the Customer Service Supervisor training.
good,"The Walmart i worked at was a great place to work if you are going to school. They are very flexible and great about scheduling around your school. Other than that, I didnt really like working there. You were expected to not only do your job, but the jobs of the other departments around you."
good,"A typical day involves handling associate/customer isssues, complaints in a very professional manner aiming for a quick resolve of the issues. Teaching and training associates to safely perform their job duties and adhere to company guidlines and policies."
good,typically you fill orders and wait on customers.Its very fast paced you learn to multi-task.My coworkers became like family.The hardest part of the job was not getting enough hours.
good,This was a poorly ran location so just about everything was difficult about this job.
good,Stocking and receiving Semi Trucks. And prep the store for the day.
good,"I was still young when I started this job, so it was not too bad. Also, I worked along side my best friend so it made it fun"
good,A fast pace work place on some days active but at times it can be really slow. I learned more to control myself and to work with others even if they dont want to work with you. The managment was ok not very attentive as they should be. They try to keep you moving but if you are a fast worker its hard to stay moving. Some are nice more attentive then others.The hardest part of the job was to deal with the most outragious customers that go over and beyond about little things. The most enjoyable part about it was my co-workers. I guess yous can say thats maybe one of the reason why i came to work was to see and interact with them.
good,"I work 8 A.M. to 5 P.M., Monday through Friday. I work by myself three days out of the 5. I am expected to cook, make sandwiches, do any prep work that didn't get done the night before and keep the work area clean. The other 2 days out of the week; I have a coworker to make sandwiches and to help me do dishes. I have learned how to do everything in the deli department and I enjoy cooking and working with food. Our new managers are in the process of changing how things are done and who does them."
good,The hardest part of my job is running two departments. Toys is an extremely busy department that takes a lot of my time. It is sometimes hard tomato time to focus on photo as well.
good,"I learned how to order merchandise, set up modulars and encaps. I learned how to prepare medicine for the pharmacist to check and bag and release to customers.. The management was very stern , but good, and they were always there when needed. My co-workers and i always worked as a team to get through the day and split up the work day tasks. The hardest part of the job was to stay calm with irate customers or dissattisfied..The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you made someones day by allowing them to receive their medications for whatever reason...."
good,"I enjoyed working there and learned alot, I learned to cash checks, issue money orders,make in store annoucemnents, and process returns"
good,assist customomers with Cashing out customers while providing quality service
good,-meeting le matin
good,Worked as a cashier and receiving clerk. Cycled stock on store floor to ensure all product was not expired. Enjoyable work environment.
good,I enjoyed working with this company - they have excellent benefits and plenty of growth opportunity.
good,Meeting & enjoying variety customers
good,Learned a lot in total management of a store. Leadership skills are very important
good,loved working there. worked alone and wasnt bothered with non sense.
good,Assist customers for purchases required
good,I would work my assigned hours and get off and spd my spar time wi my children.I learned that I loved my job at Wal-Mart. I ended up leaving because I had a sick grandmother that needed my attention.
good,I only worked for Wal-Mart so that I could help pay bills while I was at school. Definitely not a career path.
good,"What I learned the year and a half of me working at Wal-mart is how to deal with customers on regular basis and how to make them feel welcomed and comfortable. Also, I learned how to do site to store meaing when customers order items online, I get them from the back for them and make sure the items are not damaged and that everything is with it. I learned how to do W.I.C and how to handel money correctly. I also worked at customer service and learned how to do returns, exchanges, cash checks, and to deal with cutomer problems."
good,"The management team there is slowly getting better everyday, the tools that I learned at my previous job got carried over to here as well as the use of power equipment."
good,i stock the shelves with merchandise that comes in almost every night then i work backstock and bin overstock in backroom with available time left I get along with management and co workers I enjoy doing the job but i am part time
good,"dias de semana muito bom para trabalha, aprendi muitas coisas que num tinha experiencias anteriores, varios colegas legais a conheci, a parte mais dificil era quando trabalhava sozinho mais nada era impossivel !"
good,"This jobs ranks amongst the average. Not great, not bad. It's a decent job and I wouldn't mind going back for some part-time money."
good,"While I did enjoy working at Wal~Mart while I was there, I feel they had too many chiefs and not enough indians! What I mean is that they had department managers and section managers and managers on top of managers, and when the dept. manager would give you a task to do, more often than not one of the other managers would pull you to do something else without conferring with your dept. manager. That was a long time ago and I sure hope they have changed that! ;~)"
good,"Love interacting with the different customers. Never know what type of person is going to be standing across the register from you. The hardest part of the job is standing still waiting for customers to wait on. The most enjoyable part is getting to go out into the store to put away the returns; learning where different things are located; and being able to tell customers who don't know where something is, where they can find it, or maybe even take them right to it. Love night shift."
good,well run company meet lots of interesting customers. management are extremely busy as the staff is. typical day assisting customers with makeup and anything to do with products eg. from shampoo to laxatives. showing customers where products are in other departments and assisting them with any questions. hardest part of job is being understaffed and not being able to do my job to the best of my ability since it is a big store you are expected to cover other departments and not knowing all the products. co-workers are great and do help each other out. most enjoyable is when we have full staff and I can do what I'm expected to do and do it well.
good,you have to learn how to deal with management and also learn to be patience because of the pressure
good,"Overnight stocker, pretty much left alone, little management contact, often too much was expected. no support or appreciation."
good,"I worked in the fitting room and answered all incoming calls to our store, I liked helping the customers the most."
good,"Company will give good hours if you are a full time employee. The work was always busy. Felt like you ran a marathon by the time you got off work. Good for weight loss. The management was mostly nice with a few tough cookies. The coworkers I still miss. They are very good people that you stay friends with even after your'e gone. Advancement is hard to come by, but achievable if you are there enough years. Paycheck was steady and good."
good,I loved the job. I was pregnant with my daughter and stayed sick all the time and ended up being put on bed rest.
good,"A typical day for me starte at 1000 pm and begins with trying to find equipmetn that was useable to pull the freight to the floor. Once the freight was onthe floor, the goal was to work all of it onto the shelves while at the same time zoning (Organizing/cleaning) the shelves. in the morning the goals waas to have a 100% stocked and cleaned area of responsibility. This is very difficult with the workload depending on the store or area of responsibility and the number of employees and there attitudes of responsibility. The cooworkers for the most part were worried aobu their own areas, and most of them would not voluntarily assist those that need the most help. The hardest part of the work was actually moving the freight from the backroom to the floor then back again. The reason being the freight is often very heavy and the palelet jacks were ussually nto i n good shape. The best part of the job was actually clocking out."
good,"While working at Wal-Mart I have obtained skills in organization, attention to detail, and social skills with associates and customers. All of these skills that I have learned will follow me to your business. I learn knew tasks easily, and can work under pressure and a fast pace environment."
good,"Inventory, making price flags for my department, stocking shelves, moving pallets, making sure all shelves were full of stock. Ordering product and other duties as requested."
good,the people were very nice and very helpful but the work was very fast pace and hard. you had to keep up and had a quota to reach every day.
good,"too many managers each one wanted to run store thier way.Some of the other workers are not team players.When zoning,only,some of the people zoned.What I learned about Wal-mart is that if you don't butter up to the boss they will find a way to get you fired before your 90 days are up.Was working by myself.The hardest part of my job was when they would bring the stores on to the floor,for your area ,and finding somethings that didn't belong in your area and you had to take it to that area and put it away.And if they were signed out of that task and you found something that belong them they wuld not put it away you had to put it away."
good,"Walking in in the morning was horrible. There would be pallets of freight left from the overnight shift. Not because they didn't do their job, but because there was just no room for the freight in the bins. Management would tell you it all had to be off the floor by the end of the day, which was an impossible task, since I still had to clear the inventory management screen also. I loved the people I worked with and loved being out on the salesfloor helping the customers."
good,"A Typical day was pretty busy, I love the work and the customers and had good experience with the customers and I was appreciated from the customers."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my experience. Duties were originally reasonable, and hours were manageable. However, management started piling responsibilities without any further compensation, so the work to money ratio diminished overtime. I was cheated of wage increases since ""I was only a part-timer"". No excuses."
good,"Easy job that can be fun at times, although repetitive. Our store was always busy so everyone was always working. In a typical day you deal with hundreds of customers, some good and others not so good. I learned how to deal with all sorts of customers, along with how Walmart is operated throughout the store. Management is not bad even though there wasn't much help in trying to advance in your career. Co-workers are extremely nice and I got along with everyone that I worked with. Hardest part of the job is not having a set schedule along with difficult customers. The most enjoyable part this job is working with my co-workers."
good,The hardest part of the job is that sometimes there are to many members of management. All three of them can tell you to do something different in the same hour.
good,the most enojoyable part about working at wal mart was i always got to talk to people and i met knew people everyday.
good,I worked there while I was going to school since I ws the only support in my house. My schedule was not good since I used to work 5pm until 11pm every day even weekends
good,Hard to get promoted. Not paid enough for all of the stuff that you do and go through.
good,"A day at work was long and prodoctive, I learend alot from wal-mart i was there for many years and experinced many differnet postitions."
good,"constant helping of customers which i love to do, some managers do what they are suppose to and follow the companies core values others dont and some co-workers get away with not working and slacking and that seems to be a big problem at wal-mart as well as not having enough stuff throughout the day when you need at least 5 people in the deli and most of the time there is only 3 its horrible, the deli position was great its just the management isnt so great"
good,"I've done retail in the past and it was ok back then. I was a kid graduating from school, so its logical that whatever I get next would be the next best thing."
good,At wal mart you never know what nexts. Day to day is a suprise.
good,"I like working with others as a team, I've learn alot by managers to follow instructions, I get along with co-workers, Hardest part is getting the job ready for next day, and enjoyed working in housewares dept."
good,"My day at work would consist of taking care of all cashiers needs as in sending them to breaks and lunches fixing all registers, making sure they had momey for their registers.I learned how to multi-task and how to delegate certain jobs to others. I had a good working relationship with my co-workers.I treated my coworkers as I wanted to be treated.Hardest part of my job was to fulfill all the needs of customers and cashiers while trying to do other jobs for higher up ,with out having enough help.I enjoyed having a one on one relationship wiht all who were below me."
good,busy most of the time.that most people arent bad people.manament was lame an some co-workers.getting carts in the wind or snow n rain.people
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart consist of zoning,stocking,doing price changes,assisting customers and manning the fitting room."
good,"I would go in clock in, then go to the register and ring people up, answer phones call in item look ups, make sure everything was nice and stocked, kept my area cleaned made sure a customer left satisfied. Learned how to use there computer, to do inventory, and stock merchandise. Management was good, they where always there when you needed them for something. Co-Workers where all pretty nice and friendly, The hardest part of the job was not getting out tell some times 2 or 3 in the morning. The most enjoyable part of the job I would have to say ringing up people and meeting new people."
good,Working for Wal-mart was fun but you never got everything done if you worked in the evenings. From 2p.m. to 10p.m. If you worked on the floor to help face you always got called to cashier because there was never any cashiers. Then you get in trouble because your area wasn't done. But it was fun to work there because you meet customers that always where in need of a friend to talk to.
good,"Walmart treats the customer with the most upright respect like they should be treated. The employees on the other hand are not that well treated. Managers can go against the rule book but when an associate goes against the rule book, it's a write up. It's about what is fair."
good,It was very busy each day.I learned how to bag groceries and and different keys were for.
good,Didn't stick around long enough to find out anything about advancement
good,It provided job security and had decent benefits. But there was different rules for different associates.
good,It was an ok company to work for as a young adult.
good,"I enjoyed my time at Walmart, and took away some wonderful skills."
good,Took and prepared orders for costumers in the drive thru and front registar.
good,Learned a lot about costumer service and how to better serve people.
good,"Very good place to work, lots of nice people learned how to balance cash drawers, and how to maintain trust"
good,My doctor told me I needed bed rest and they told me that was my problem.
good,Very nice place to work for.had a great 8 years.hard to get off 3rd shift once you are on. The support manger position gave me alot of advancement. Do i think i'm a strong leader. Yes i do. Working at walmart is a learning experience.And it most for sure made me a better and stronger manger.and leader.
good,Is a wonderful place for high school and college employees. They also offer upward mobility for those who are intersected in management position.
good,It was a okay job for a starter to get a idea of what working in retail is like. You interact with the customers face to face and assist with finding merchandise.My coworkers were nice and were always willing to help assist with store projects. The most enjoyable part of the job is during the holiday season when we prepare the store for the events that we had such as free photos with Santa Claus and Black Friday.
good,A typical day at work was taking care of the customers needs. I learned social skills and how to make dealing with people easier. Management was there to help us with anything I possibly needed to deal with taking care of the customer. My co-workers would work with me to fix a problem if there was one. The hardest part of the job was the bouncing back and forth from store to store when helping stock a new store before it opened. The enjoyable part of the job was the money i was making in overtime to go to the other stores to stock them.
good,"Assisted customers, team work on getting supplies stocked"
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart would be to be very productive, work safe, and be respectful of others."
good,I learned that it will take a lot for me to move up the ladder into higher management.
good,This was a really steady job with good benefits. Hourly night differential pay.
good,Walmart is an OK place to work. They don't really work with people who have medical issues.
good,The management team in Walmart have no guidance or order. They think on the spot and do not plan. Sometimes this can cause confusion and chaos.
good,Walmart was a fast past environment. I had to keep the lines down and have lots patience. The customers were always trying you but I did what I had to do to get the job done.
good,"a typical day at work is very busy with frieght and dealing with customers, I have helpful team members."
good,"Communication between employees and management wasn't always good. Communication between management and themselves wasn't always good, but somehow things got done."
good,"I learned alot from being at walmart. i learned that i loved to work in the retail industry, i was very good at my job. i loved my co-workers. Some of my bosses were hard to take but that comes along with any job. I learned i love to be pushed, to work hard and fast."
good,Cashier Training
good,It can be stressful at times. Good if you don't want to deal with customers the majority of time.
good,"Presently I work on the overnight shift and because of my positive attitude I have brought the overnight associates feelings up. I verbally appreciate people for their contributions and feel that it helps them give me their all. I encourage them to contribute to the store with how they envision things; I help make it their store. When I worked as a day manager I was primarily working with the office associate reviewing mark-up/mark-down reports, overseeing the accounting department, overseeing the personnel office as well as the front end and backroom processes. Hardest part of the job currently is the requirement of doing more with less people; teaching and staffing the store would make it a win win situation. I enjoy that my job affords me the flexibility to focus on people but at times get chastised for how long I spend on them."
good,"OK Job while in school, Regular face paced retail environment"
good,"Working at Walmart was very stressful. I would rather not work there again , bUt still a great company and I still shop there nearly every week."
good,"Everyday was okay, the managers ignored policies again. I would wish that the managers headed to the strict guidlines of the day."
good,"Great Co-workers and team inGeenville and Meadville PA, also in Hartsville SC"
good,I loved this job because it allowed me to zone out with the business of my work. I mean at nights we would have to tell shoppers we are closed and will not cash no more.
good,*Unload skids and stock the product
good,"Overall it was a great experiance, Meeting life long friends sharing our families together and learning and growing together."
good,"Unload the truck, stock the pallets, pull pallets to floor, and then pull merchandise. I learned how to use the high stacker and electric jack."
good,a wonderful place to work has great benefits. that was a job that was worked at night.
good,My position there was cool because I worked in the frozen foods department. I learned that there's a lot that goes into running that store and we had a really good team.
good,"Unloader. Unload freight trucks, stack freight on pallets, pull pallets out to the sales floor then stocked afterwards, Operated forklift, scissor lift, and pallet jacks."
good,"Hours cut,took on 3-4 titles to equal 40 hours. Never saw assistants .had to fill in and complete more tasking instead of serving our customers."
good,"typical work day i do counts and clean the deparment check on the flowers, i work in the garden center so its seasonal so just depents on the seasons, i have learn the most for this job invovceing statments, the thought me better customer service skills, managment dont really care for there, they change managment so much you never know what manager our going to have or if the dislike for no reason. There is no hard part about my job i have learned it for the inside out. There are enjoyable parts for my job i love the same customers that come back and they always ask me to help them. Also i do like my other co-workers"
good,"it always atarted of com then the kaos started with managment, i learned how to run a retail store. Managment was really poor with the employees, my co-workers were a blessing to work with. the hardest part of the job was trying to keep up with the stuck when there was no stuck. the most enjoyable part of the job was the money that i was making by the end of the week."
good,Clock in every day at 10 o'clock. Go to the break room for a 10-15 minute meeting with the overnight managers about the stores production & other announcements. Co-workers are easy to work with & easy to understand. I believe the hardest part of the job is to manage our time wisely while stocking the groceries. The most enjoyable part has to be zoning the aisles after the groceries are stocked in their appropriate place.
good,"Ambiente de trabajo agradable, pero empleo no estable, ya que estaba trabajando por agencia y me llamaban para trabajar no mas de una semana por mes. No era con continuidad, por eso no me servía. Yo necesito un trabajo continuo y estable."
good,customer service is very important but sometimes you need to have support of your supervisors to get the best and sometimes I felt all by myself taking important decisions
good,"Although working very early hours, the job kept me busy and I was never bored. I enjoyed the people I worked with and the benefits."
good,This was a customer service type enviroment. Met alot of interesting people on a daily basis.
good,You are on the go nonstop and you are working with some friendly associates.
good,The only thing I found that made this job worthwhile is the fact that they were willing to work with my availability. There were no other perks to this job.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart started out with lining out the day, Employees and daily job requirments to put things in perspective to the amount of time everything needed to be done in. Orders and required counts were done, displays zoned and filled for the morning, Touch base with your asscociates what needed to be done and when on a timly basis. Reciving the notes upper management gave out and completed them as soon as possible not to exceed noon. Continuie stocking what mechandise needed last possitions was over produce so I was constintly refilling tables and refridgerated wall. Supervizing all employees though the day on their jobs like breaking down pallets, stocking, cleaning, and modular sets."
good,I met alot of wonderful people that have since left the store due to one issue or another.Alot of the problems had to do with the way that those in management positions handled issues that arose between workers. Also a few needed sensitivity training and more time learning the departments in which they were in charge of running.The hardest part was training associates and then having them leave for issues that could have been resolved.The most enjoyable is all the different personalities and seeing how they interact with each other or pull together to accomplish a common goal.I learned that you can have fun at work and that people are willing to do their jobs but no one wants to be talked down to or belittled.We are all adults and should be treated and respected as such.
good,"Atypical day at work was fun i liked working in domestics, and stock was exciting i like to keep things in order."
good,I enjoy my job and enjoy the working with customers and other employees. Hardest part of job is running from end to end and all over the store to help on a moments notice. Most enjoyable part is it feels like family.
good,Interesting place to work. Walmart was a new facility to Alaska.
good,stocking shelves and assissting customers when needed was the social norm at Wal-Mart.
good,"A typical day at work make sure all cashiers have on their name tags and have the proper uniform on. Make sure all cashiers have the necessary utensils needed to complete their shift as well as enough change to keep their work more steady and quicker. I learned that we have a responsibility to make sure the customer is happy no matter what. Being apart of the management team gave me the insight to understand that your employees feed off of the vibe you give off if you are negative they will be negative, if you have an attitude they tend to have one. The hardest part is making sure everyone is following policy and making sure the customer is satisfied. The most enjoyable day part of the day when everyone is happy associates and customers."
good,"in all fairness i understand the need to place guidelines for walmarts associates when it comes to stocking the freight, but a computer generates a time based on how much freight an area is given and the associate in that assigned area is expected to meet that time. in my experience the amount of freight versus the time does not match up and never has. so i was terminated for not being productive enough. i had 2 areas to do and 2 hours in both areas and at least 8 pallets of freight all together for both areas, one of which had 4 pallets that stood as tall as me and im 6'0. management when told about this never really offered a reasonable explanation for the untimed freight. they just would tell you that the times were right and that you needed to work faster. i learned alot about the reatail side of business and i loved the fact that just by finding a customer a certain product that was out of stock on the shelves could really make their day"
good,"Working at Wal Mart has been my only job. I was there over 25 years. There I made great friends and enjoyed working with my co-workers. Being able to help customers and having ""regulars"" that came in made my day run smoothly. I learned that working as a team makes the job easier and work day sail along. I was apart of the management but that did not stop me from seeking to help others. The hardest part about my job was dealing with dissatisfied customers but you cannot please them all. All you can do is try your best."
good,"theres never enough employees for each shift, sometimes management won't help you when u need it, most of my co-workers are really generous and the rest I feel don't appreciate the work place,"
good,Overall working at walmart was a wonderful experience. I learned many great things that I will take with me throughout life. I felt that our management team could have shown more knowledge of everyday issues. The hardest part of the job was trying to keep the satisfaction at 100% and the most enjoyable part of the job were the customers. They make the store good or bad we wouldn't have made it without them.
good,day begins past paced must be ready to hit the floor running.
good,"This job taught me great customer service skills, and to be quick at the job."
good,"Wal Mart is very steeped in daily routines, in every department. My main job there is cashier, which means i run the register, clean & maintain the immediate impulse buy areas and wait for new customers. Before i started at Wal Mart I had not done much retail work, so this was a learning experience for me. More specifically I learned more of the day to day aspects like product placement, and marketing strategies when i worked in other departments like apparel.The management at all levels was always fair and reasonable and available if there was an ever an issue that warranted discussion. The hardest part of this job was dealing with customers who got impatient or were just unsatisfiable. It usually resulted from circumstances beyond my control like computer malfunctions, or issues that required a supervisor's approval and the time it took for them to resolve it. I really do enjoy customer service work so that and my co-workers were the best part of the job for me."
good,I learned all about speed and endurance checking at a cash register.
good,"The most enjoyable part of working for Walmart was satisfying disgruntled customers, developing its employees, and ensuring products were stocked on the salesfloor. I learned how to make decisions aligned with company guidelines, develop talent, and priortize and manage work loads."
good,i started off in assembly part time i moved up to a full time ics associate in only a few months. i helped track and stock inventory. pay was low management was not great.
good,"A typical day see how was the clients are looking for security problems, how to work every day"
good," Identified, reviewed and applied policies and procedures to make informed judgment."
good,"Wal-Mart is a job not a career. This company has went down since Sam Walton died. It's not family oriented anymore, integrity is a loosely used word that's rarely ever followed, and the pay isn't enough for the physical stress, mental stress...."
good,"The overnight shift at Wal-Mart was often tiring and strenuous work, but at the end of the day you could take solace in the fact that you helped supply the hungry people of Las Vegas with something they need. I learned excellent time management skills, as well as higher level customer service experience thanks to Wal-Mart's one-of-a-kind employee to customer interaction protocols."
good,Its a job that pays the bill. Depending on your location your stress level will vary.
good,There was too much control by superiors. No freedom as a professional pharmacist to do your job to the best of your abilities. There is a lot of nit-picking about little stuff and you constantly feel as if someone is constantly looking over your shoulder. All this while you are filling 600 rx's per day.
good,"Its not a bad job but its draining. i learned more about the retail side of business firsthand. The management generally is great to work with. Reasonable, easy to talk to if you have an issue. The most enjoyable part of my job is my coworkers, the hardest is dealing with the corporate requirements that everyone is forced to abide by."
good,When the economy went bad the hours got cut and there was more weight put on us.
good,"My workdays at Wal-Mart would consist of assisting customers (both in person and over the phone), being knowledgeable about computers, televisions, & other types of electronics, heavy lifting, setting modulars, keeping merchandise zoned, and using a cash register. I learned a great deal about electronic devices and about working with people. Management was good for the most part, but there are some managers who show unfair treatment towards some associates. My coworkers consisted partly of friendly people who did their jobs well, but there were some who had very poor attitudes and work ethics. The hardest part of the job is working with those certain people who have negative attitudes and seemingly personal problems with me. The most enjoyable part of the job (for me personally) is working with the video games, making sure all the new games are out and staying up to date on future game releases."
good,"assited customers, restocked shelves,assited co workers when needed"
good,"Walmart was a good place for me to learn more customer service because it requires a lot of patience. Despite that, it wasn't a place I could see myself working at long term."
good,Wal-mart is not the best company to work for because they do stand up for their employees.
good,"This company was my first job, but it taught me a lot in that short time. This job taught me that you have the rights as a worker. They did not work well with the front end workers. The management did what they wanted, gave breaks when they wanted, the list goes on. My co-workers were very immature and always were starting arguments with each other. The hardest part of the job is staying focus because of all the unprofessional work that was going on. The most enjoyable part of the job were the customers."
good,It is a great company but in order to move up takes many years.
good,Compancy policy was to not schedule any person more than 6 days in a row. I was scheduled many times 7 or more days in a row. I even brought it up to the HR and they didn't fix it. The job was fine. I liked it. I loved be able to decorate cakes once in a while. Dishes were fun too. I disliked bread.
good,"-Typical day at work involves finishing jobs left by others, dusting shelves, restocking shelves, facing product."
good,Working at wal mart your given a chance to expand your knowledge in the retail field.
good,My daily obligations was making sure the stock on the shelves were not out dated adn counting inventory and customer service. I was also responsible for doing the monthly invetory and ordering.
good,"I assisted customers with whatever needs they might have also stocked the deli/bakery on a daily basis. I did inventory once a month, kept up with daily sales report for the department. Supervised 5-7 associates on a daily basis to ensure the department to run affectedly."
good,Puts customers above all. Always busy so work day goes fast.
good,"Co workers are awesome, pay is decent, however too much emphasis on selling their MasterCard rather than giving the people what they truely want."
good,would ring up customers goods and get them out the door in a timily fashion. managment was good new what they where talking about and always there when you requested them. Co-Workers always had good conversation and a smile. the most enjoyable part of my day was when i was able to put a smile on the customers face.
good,When I would get to work I would clock in and go stright to the register were I would stay until time for break or lunch then go right back. Management seems to think they were better then everyone else. Co-workers were ok. The hardest part was doing the samething over and over again The most enjoyable was working with the public.
good,"Wal-Mart is a large company but every store is different in their values and in their management. A person will never go to one store and have the same routine or the same settings it's always different. Some stores are better than some and some are worse than others. Going to work I would never know one day to the next what I would be doing, it always varied. My title was CSM and I would be helping unload a truck that night or helping with inventory. The most enjoyable part of my job was my customers and employees, they were a wide range of carismatic and sensible people. There was probably one or two managers that I actually respected and that was because they took their time to teach and give knowledge and carefully handle situations, the others were too quick to jump and not think and that to me is a huge flaw."
good,"I like working for WalMart ,I just don't feel I have much opportunities at the store I currently work in"
good,"Pushed very hard, fast paced, stressful, time clocks are placed in the back of the building which is at least a 5-10 minute making people late more often."
good,I learned to operate a walk behind forklift very well. I learned to improve my manners and respect for other people.especially elders and the hardest part is unloading the trucks in the heat it is extremely hot in those trailers and exhausting. but i met some very great people here and very very nice people.
good,Have a fairly good management team. Except any problems you are having do not get resolved promptly...
good,my over all review about this company is that this store is a good job and you recent good experience for other jobs.
good,"A typical work day was filled with helping customers with everything from pointing out where the dog food is, to mixing paint when a ""Hardware Associate"" wasn't available. Most of the time I was faced with repetitive tasks. For example bringing loans and making change for the registers, but the rest of the time I was okaying and denying returns, based on policy and upper management say-so."
good,ok work enviorment co workers are pretty cool worked overnight for 4 years
good,I ran the register most of the time. There were times that I was sent to help out with other departments. I learned that working in a department store is fast paced. The management favored the employees in the departments. My co-workers were always fun to be around. The hardest part of the job was getting customers rung out fast. The most enjoyable part of the job was to help them find what they needed and get them out.
good,Typical day would be loading and unloading pallets and stocking shelves. I learned how to do hard work at a steady pace. Hardest part of the job would unloading the trucks.
good,The company had good work conditions. This was my first job and I learned about stability. Most of the management was great. I got along with all my co-workers. I enjoyed the work when I stayed busy all the time.
good,"Up beat fast paced days, I learned that rules and regulations change everyday. Management was open and in different directions. Co-workers were helpful and friendly to new hires. The hardest part of the job completing orders from several different managers at the same time. The most enjoyable part of the job, meeting new people and providing customer service."
good,enjoyed meeting different people
good,"good fast paste good, environment to work in. i learn to treat people with respect, and be kind to each other and be gentle. my co workers are good we all get along very well. fun people. my hardest part of my job is to push, shopping cart. when i'm stocking the shelves,and when i'm helping customers,"
good,"Walmart as a work place (My store, at least) can tend to be..... disorganized. Each manager doing their own thing, and never knowing what the other is doing, until they're yelling at each other later."
good,good place to work if you like to help customers and bad thing is one can not do overtime
good,"Overall, not a good place to work! Need improvement in Management! Never given respect or praise for what you do! Job security is great though! Feel comfortable about that! Have learned more and more how to deal with people, good and bad and people of all nationalities! It's a typical day at work nothing too exciting but can be fun at times! The money is alright but could be better for the job you do! The hardest part of the job is understanding the customers with a foreign accent that don't speak your language! Or, just trying to understand them in general! The most enjoyable part is the customers, especially those you have become close to and those you have already known, that know you and come looking for you on the job, that brings a smile to my face every day! And for me to give a smile right back! And some of the co-workers are fun too!"
good,"You are expected to do more work without any more money. Great company to advance with. Some of the managers don't have people skills, and don't know the basics of the company. You get to meet many great and exciting people daily. Can a be a great company to work for if you don't have any other responsibilities."
good,this is a okay place to start off working don't recommend that you try and make it in to a career management is alright but they tend to cut hours to the point where you are only getting paid enough for gas
good,is a pretty good starter job for high school kids not a good job for people want too live on there on
good,Collected inventory shipments stocked shelves daily. I made sure that new merchandise was set nightly out for overnight employees. I always made sure the work atmosphere very enjoyable. So work can go smoothly without any interruptions.
good,Wal Mart was a great job for me. I gain most of my experience from working with the company. I learned how to operate heavy machinery and how to supervise over other employees. The hardest part of job was overly working. The most enjoyable part of my job was the interaction with the customers.
good,"Fast paced at times, very slow others. Employees are over worked most of the time. sometimes whole shifts without a break."
good,A typical day would be stocking shelf's helping customers find the best product for them and completing transactions. I learned how to sell for the best of the person and the best for the company management was not around as much as i would have liked coworkers were great and helpful. hardest part of job was not knowing a answer and no one in management around to help. the best part of job was helping people get what they want at the best price.
good,"A typical day at Wal-Mart is one that is productive and educational; I learn new things every day. I have learned how to communicate effectively with customers and employees, delegating task, lead associates, work under pressure and multi-task. I enjoy working closely with both management and my co-workers, it helps keep me motivated. The hardest part of my job is dealing with rude customers. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping customers with all their shopping needs."
good,This was a new store and needed people to put up shelves and stock. Working in a high risk area took good job and safety skills. Management was great and the staff was also great. The hardest part was you had to work fast and constant. The best part was I worked alone and didn't see anyone until break or lunch. The hardest part was there was palates to lift and stack.
good,"Empresa onde tive um bom reconhecimento profissional, facilitando meu crescimento na empresa. Ambiente corrido, por ser uma loja pequena e com alto fluxo de clientes. Poucos recursos, diferente do Walmart Supercenter que são lojas bem maiores. Salário razoavél e carga horária puxada."
good,It was ok. The people there was great. The harderst part was trying to be every where at once.
good,Establish rapport with customers to identify needs and interests as well as address concerns. Maintain relationships by providing personalized service. Provide customers with an extraordinary shopping experience on every visit. Anticipate and respond to customers/guests needs and requests to ensure satisfaction.
good,The hardest part of the job was dealing with rude customers.
good,"Overall I enjoyed working at Walmart. I really did learn a lot; It was my first job in high school and I stayed there some time after, so it was a really good learning experience for what it's like to work and be an adult and I think it's pretty much like any other retail company to work for there are always good and bad sides to any job you have."
good,"I had to switch to overnights caz it got way to stressful on swing,I actually got sick. But had a fun crew overnight and will never forget them."
good,Management seemed to forget about the smaller guys and take credit for everything.
good,Daily I make sure inventory is stocked and received correctly along with making sure proper coverage is applied correctly
good,"I did whatever needed to be done- usually stocking, customer service, setting mods and building displays, and occasionally cashiering."
good,"Walmart is the kind of work place where you walk into work and never know what kind of day its going to be. Its a constantly changing atmosphere, esspecially working in customer service where its absolutely vital to find a balance between company policy and customer satisfaction. One of the best lessons that I've taken away from Walmart has been to be willing to accept new challenges, and don't be afraid to seek out answers to questions that are vital to preforming the job efficiantly."
good,It has flexible schedule's that work's good for college student's. If you're full time there are benefits but if you are part time there isn't any benefits.
good,"A typical day at work is stocking, and checking to see if we have any back stock. I have learned how to work at a consistent pace. Managment was thier when I needed anything. My co-workers were good to work with, never and problems. The hardest part of the job was dealing with cusstomers, who wanted items that were not in the store. The most enjoyable parrt was meeting new peolple."
good,"Stocked shelves, waited on customers, handled cash, scheduled for department"
good,They are a good place to work. I just had medical problems otherwise I'd try to work their again.
good,was good experience in department management customer service experience.stocking and organizing own department maintaining a clean and safe enviroment for customers as well as employees.
good,"I wish I now had the hours I worked here at my new job. I saw the particular store I worked at start to drastically take a downward spiral and there was no job security here. I got out at a good time. I miss some of the people that I worked with but as far as management went, there were too many chiefs and not enough indians!!!!"
good,Working with Wal Mart for over 3 years I met a diverse background of co workers and enjoyed working with them.
good,"A customer would call in with a concern for their phone, I had to troubleshoot the phone and try to assist the customer with getting the phone working. The hardest part of my job is when a customer called and was upset, most of the time I was able to calm them down and find out what the problem was, then we were able to correct the problem. It was a joy to me when they would thank me and tell me that this was an ongoing problem but when they called in the representative didn't fix the problem but I did."
good,"Operate Sitdown,clamp and slip sheet forklift and manual pallet jack"
good,"I stocked shelves, dealt with customer issues and complaints. I enjoyed working with the public."
good,I enjoyed working at Wal-Mart because i enjoyed the people i worked with i enjoyed our camaraderie but there was some flaws about my time there. i never had a problem with management but it seem like it was just to many people taking over its like you do one thing and in the middle of you doing that a manager that is not even over you area comes and has you do something else and that leaves you task in you area unfinish other than that I enjoyed my time i spent at Wal-Mart gaining customer service skills and working with a team.
good,A typical day at my job would start off with me clocking in and reporting to my manager and getting assigned to a register. What I liked about my job is that it is a very busy place to work. I pretty much got along with all of my coworkers. I would say the hardest part about my job was not having a set schedule. I would say the best thing about working at wal mart is that i got to meet new people every day.

good,a typical day at work is pushing in carts and cleaning the lot of trash
good,My day changed from day to day. You could be one place doing a job and get told to go somewhere else. A task was hard to complete because to many people would be tell you different things and ways to do it. Management had problems working together as a team so it was hard to work for the group of managers. The hardest part of my job was trying to be everywhere I was told to be at one time.

The hardest part of the job is lifting heavy freight and the most enjoyable part of my job is completing the learning assessments.
good,A typical day was to unload a trailer under two hours. I learned how to use a forklift and many other machinery the time i was their. The management had very poor comunication and would not work with my college schedule at all wanted me to stay till they said it was ok for me to leave at the time i had college classes at 7 in the morning. My co-worker didnt really help me out and would not act like a team at all i was the only one stuck working hard and pulling all the frate my self. The hardiest part of the job was to finish what we had to do under the time limit we had. Their was no enjoyable part of the day.

I felt the managers could have done a better job in hiring better people with more work ethic to work in the areas that I often had to cover in and help out.Also could have been more fair and understanding of my situation and condition and why my productivity in my department would seem low at times.

good,"The management was never around, I had to learn things on my own basically. One person would teach me a section and would only be with me for less than an hour then I was on my own. Their schedules were made two weeks ahead of time and you got in trouble if you didn't ask off before the schedule was made. My co-workers complained a lot about the company."

Obviously to this day I have been away from the person that did this to me and I have a protection order against them."

good,Wal-Mart was an ok company to work for. The management wasnt to bad they didnt ask the impossible. They worked you kinda hard for the money you get but it was alright. Now the only problem I have is witht the pay. Wal-Mart is the lowest paying of all the major retail stores so go figure.

good,Managers tell you when you are hired that they work with your schedule. That does not happen.
good,A typical day would include pushing carts and helping customers with questions and carryouts
good,Wal-mart was interesting. It can get a bad wrap and sometimes it's deserved. When I was applying I felt like a person and that each manager interviewing me knew who I was by name and so on. After I was hired it was very clear I was just a number and most of the friendly/family values they preach during interview aren't seen. The only way to get time off is with a first come first serve system that allows you to sit down and go days and weeks down the line if putting you at the top of the list each time. Family issues don't seem to matter to them and if they lose 1 employee of their 50-100 staffed the store will apparently fail.
good,being a cashier at walmart is very unpleasant at times but has some rewards to it :)
good,I enjoy the job but would enjoy it even more with my hours and more pay.

Even the pay is good, especially to start. Not too many jobs start above minimum wage. Management, I'm not too pleased with. Upon being hired, as long as you don't need to speak with them about being sick, having to leave early, death, or anything of that nature.. You should be fine."
good,Learned how to work under the most tough situations.
good,Working for Walmart is easy enough but it isn't very challenging or stimulating. Time passes slowly.
good,"I enoyed working at Walmart. The employees there were friendly and always willing to help one another out.I began working in the Christmas area. I was a was nonstop customer assistance and cleaning. After the holidays I moved to the jewelry department. There were inventories to be done and shipmements to check in and arrange on the salesfloor. I learned how to open all types of watches and replace batteries as well as removing links to resize them when needed. One day the manager of the Pharmacy Department ask if I would consider coming to work in the pharmacy. It was a step up and I accepted the offer. The pharmacy was like it's own little entity.Sometimes the Walmart rules didn't always apply to us. There were no ""mandatory""fifteen minute breaks.I was working three ten hour shifts not knowing when my break would arrive. My knees and my legs were so swollen I ended up having to see a vascular specialist. But there was the hostility between the other branches of management and the pharmacy so I was forced to leave a job that I really loved."
good,"Management changes all the time, staffing issues, schedule conflict."
good,"If you enjoy working with the public, then this may be the job for you. Quick paced atmosphere so there is no time to be bored."

good,"A typical day at work was always very cold in the market and customers were very inconsiderate most of the time. Co-workers didn't like helping and management was good one day and bad the next. The hardest part of the job was keeping a smile on my face for each customer, but the most enjoyable is knowing at the end of the day you did what you could to help each customer who came your way."
good,Responsible for careful handling of all merchandise to avoid damage. Stock shelves
good,Busy times and always packing stuff to be shipped back to the companies. All the broken products.
good,Their pay is pretty good. I really enjoyed some of the people that I worked with. Others weren't enjoyable to be around including a couple of the members of management.
good,"I enjoyed my associates, but the management lacked proper skills."
good,"I managed multiple departments which required daily stocking, inventory, checking out of stock items, resets, and time management. I learned to better multi-task and prioritize.

good,"A typical day day at Walmart consist of me gathering carts and trash out the parking lot. I learned how to work by myself or with a small group of people.

Then checking to verify if any associated where sheduled to work the areas I supervised and if not developing a plan for accomplishing the work load.Helping customers to attain the products they desired and if not in the store trying to locate at another store within a reasonable distance.Ensuring price integrity and ordering of stock if necessary.

Really liked working with most of my co-workers although some I didn't get to know as well because they worked on the other side of the store.

good,"I would usually be left alone to cover 3 dept. Working at Walmart taught me to make the best out of any situation. Walmart didn't have the best management. The manager over my dept cold never be found. My main job was based outside and my co-worker would leave and go inside and walk around, leaving me by myself. The hardest part of the job was being alone in the garden center, having to pack bags of dirt and bricks then run back in to check out customers then run to another dept to make or mix paint. The most enjoyable part was making the people happy."
good,Work environment depends on management team. Tardiness and absenteeism are monitored through automated system with no leniency.

Management has been a positive influence and have taught me how much work goes into making things run smoothly. My co workers and I generally work independently but they have been a great source of help and I've been able to help them as well so that mutual respect has been great. The hardest part of the job is the inconsistancy with the work hours, when it comes to a night job its difficult to have to switch from night time hours to day time at a moments notice and plays a big role in my decision to look for other work. The most enjoyable aspect of my job is the work itself, it keeps me busy and active I have had the opportunity to attain permits for machinery I had never tried before and the opportunity to experience new positions within the same company."

good,I really liked working there but I feel like other employees were not made to do there job. I would come in to a mess that the leaving shift had made. I went to several of the upper management and it didn't seem like they did anything about it.
good,"Fun place to work,great people too work with. Duties are simple to maintain. Flexible with my school schedule."
good,Although Walmart is a big company they don't ever higher enough employees. You are always running around picking up slack for missing employees or just not enough on the schedule's.
good,"I had a great time working at Wal-Mart but I think it was mostly due to the people I worked with. The people in my department made it a really fun place to work but If they weren't there, it wouldn't have been as worth while. The management definitely has some problems because one manager would tell us one thing and another would tell us a completely other thing. But benefits and pay were OK. Altogether an OK place to work if you are looking for a part-time job - not a career."
good,I begin my day with walking through my department and fixing the little things that are wrong with the aisles. Assisting customers is a major part of the work day; bringing the customers to the item and answering their inquiries about the product.

good,Very busy work environment.
good,"it was a fun job,it was sad that i had to leave because i moved."
good,I feel that a company like walmart should not go by hear say the should get all the facts
good,Worked as a cashier enjoyed who I worked with and meeting new people
good,"The job itself isn't hard. My worst experiences were with managers and other co-workers. Too much going behind others' backs to undermine the ""team atmosphere"" that i initially thought would be the the way things always worked. Many people i know who worked and still work there would like to quit!"
good,everyone loves walmart but when you work for the store its totally different. I had a terrible experience because the managers were rude and mean and very disrespectful to the associates. They need to learn more about there managers before they are hired point bank period.
good,Retail is low paying and quite tedious. The timed task system does not work well. It leads to sloppy work. The hour lunch break is excessive. The corporate rules are strict and unyielding.
good,"Receive freight and organize accordingly, then put into designated areas to then be scanned into the inventory system."

good,Walmart is an ok place to work. The hours are not very stable. Sometimes I may have 12 hours one week and 30 hours the next week. I dont think most of the managers care about the employees
good,Working at Walmart is great for someone who has never held a job before and is seeking customer service experience. I've been employed there for 2 years and I've learned a lot of customer service and communication skills. I have met and gained a handful of friends who were initially my fellow associates. The hardest part of my job is the scheduling. I work a different shift everyday and its difficult to balance with my life outside of work. The most enjoyable part of my job is that I meet new people.
good,I've learned different aspects of how Walmart stores run by learning different departments to see how they all pull together. I regularly work as a cashier which a typical day includes cashing out customers and providing good customer service. The most enjoyable part of my work day is when we are appropriately staffed and efficiently running are lines so we don't receive complaints from our customers about the wait to be cashed out . Most of my Co-workers are friendly and helpful if needed and management is usually the same.
good,"Great place to work, but pay not good. Work was not hard but could pay better"
good,A typical day at work is fast pace and different task everyday
good,"Typical day at work: Start by pulling all the pallets to the floor and opening them. Hang all clothes on appropriate racks, and change sales prices if need be. At the end of the night set up new displays for the next day, pull pallets back to the storage department and make sure store was clean for the next day. I learned the meaning of hard labor. The management there could have been better, because for the shift they seem to be a little to laid back. They seem to play around a lot and didn’t always provide us with the knowledge we needed complete all the task correct the first time. The co-works were for the most part pretty good people to work with we always helped each other out. The hardest part of the job was getting use to the hours and the intense labor. The most enjoyable part was learning about different merchandise."
good,reset registers
good,"An upbeat, active, and pleasaant work environment. Most co-workers were enjoyable trowork with on a daily basis. THe hardest part of the job was some shifts whereby I worked late 2 nights in a row, then early the next. Overall, a good place to work."

good,i enjoy working in many environments.
good,"A typical day at work would be me ringing out merchandise in a check register system, bagging customers groceries, answering questions for customers, balancing my till daily, and keeping my register area clean. I learned retail experience there. I never saw management much. I didn't talk to a whole lot of my co-workers except on breaks. This job was very easy.
