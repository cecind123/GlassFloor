good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Where do I start in this absolute shambles of a company. EASILY THE WORST COMPANY I HAVE EVER WORKED FOR! There are a lot of bad points and if I had to write them all down it would be the length of the bible. The actual job itself seems okay at first but as soon as you hear the words academy run a mile, the mentors are not at all useful and are so cliquey. If you dare ask for help you get ignored and if you don’t get ignored then you get told to look for it yourself. Your not allowed too even though your sat down for most of the day. The break system is very dodgy too as you get in a typical 9 hour shift a 30 min lunch and 2 10 min breaks, however if your call goes over the end time then you have to stay, sounds fair? knowone is allowed a toilet break out of the designated breaks so if you need the toilet you have to wait and for the smokers, good luck as the smoking shelter is about half a mile away. The bonus scheme is CORRUPT, knowone gets paid it as you have to fight it. Why should people who work for the actual HSBC get paid more for the same job as Concentrix. They shove overtime on you as the turnover of people who leave is the highest I’ve ever been apart off. It’s amazing how people start off happy in there first few to a few weeks in being miserable. Some of the people are amazing and I had a amazing group of people in my team but by the third week half of them left and quite rightly. The cafeteria is small and ANGIN, the toilets smell like the sewers and for the people who are high up they don’t do anything other than talk in their groups and still get paid whilst"
bad,"Operations and HR departments have completely different vision. HR promises too many things but when you enter the floor, you find nothing but a biased bullies tagged as managers.  They'll never ever let you express your views if it's otherwise from their's and am saying this after working for almost nine long years."
bad,Employees are immature most of the time no respect for other privacy at all. Enough said go at your won risk.But if you just need to work til something comes in better  than your ok
bad,"Company is disorganized, not flexible with hours like said, the don't tell you the horrible hours they want you to work until you have completed training and on-boarding, everything is fasted paced in training. "
bad,I would not recommend anyone for this job unless you have a second job. The Mgt looses hours worked causing you to not be paid probably and over time pay varies without notice
bad,This place is completely fraud! They don’t treat their employees good at all and therefore their employees hate to be there. No one wants to work somewhere they hate going
bad,"It’s a bad place to work. The call center sucks!! No room for advancement. They need nurses on the floor for insulet to give the customers medical advice instead of telling them there’s nothing you can do for them. HR sucks. They pass the buck, they can’t get payroll straighten out for the life of them. Horrible place to work for and I will NEVER go back!!!"
bad,People are scummy.  No class at all.  Dirty bathrooms.  Expensive food.  Absurd security.  Filthy parking lots.  Dangerous parking lots.  Lousy management.
bad,"This is a call center with multiple programs.  This could be the easiest job you can have.  The interview process is also the easiest, because all you do is show up and you have a job offer."
bad,"They’re really big about bragging rights to the point that they just seem pretentious in a bad way. They brag about spending money on items and services that seem kind of useless at the cost of other more useful things. Like for instance they go on and on about this stupid slide they have and constantly remind us that they paid 56,000 USD on it like this is a good thing. Yet our benefits are not very good and could be much better. A great example of the problem at Concentrix is the fact that everything looks very pretty but everything is very uncomfortable."
bad,"High pressured sales, little breaks, and often angry customers. The most difficult challenge of all was always working late nights, holidays (Christmas included) and weekends. The company values sale proftits more than the employee. Yes, working at home is nice, but the company will fire you if sales are not kept up."
bad,"the management sucks, they don't care about your well being, they will tell you one thing then go back on their word, if you're not dead they expect you to be on the clock dog sick and all"
bad,"Training very stressfull, lack of structure. Pay structure non existant dont pay you right, no pay slips"
bad,They Fired me three weeks ago and I still haven't gotten my last check I hated there Concentrix Arnold location better don't waste your time not worth it
bad,"Concentrix is a ripoff place to work, u work and they dont wanna pay you, all they give you is excuses. Poor management and HR services. They dont care about anyone but themselves."
bad,"This company ate up my vacation accrual mentioned on the pay check. Not only mine but of everyone’s who leave the job."
bad,Well Lets be honest Management is horrible. If you are  not liked you will constantly be picked at about your work. Training is garbage. You don't learn until you are  actually on the floor. Good peers really help you learn the ropes if you sit near one who is professional. Rule change every single day. No written notification
bad,They don’t care about family or the need of the staff  the main and only focus is the business need scheduling is horrible  and favoritism is at an all time high
bad,"Poor working environment, management in it for themselves, very little support. Tools constantly changing, or not working, constantly set up for failure."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"A good starting point to consider, because you will obtain a lot of training and challenging experience. Pantry offers usual dishes but a little bit pricey from the usual."
bad,"At the start Concentrix was a decent place to work with a decent wage. But then? Time progressed and the reality of management decisions regarding who or the type of individuals that they promote is highly questionable. After almost 2 years working there, going to work there daily is becoming increasingly more challenging. There are NO raises unless promoted. Being promoted means that you NOW have one foot out the door. I have watched person after person get promoted only to be then, fired. Management consistently changes  the rules of the game"" to keep from being found wrong. "
bad,Too many negatives to even begin listing them all. There's a lot of favoritism that goes on at concentrix. Most of the supervisors refuse to help you.
bad,"Location in St. Louis is very ghetto, unprofessional, and loud. Employees do whatever they want. It’s a very highschool work environment. You work with people from the ages 18-60+. Bathrooms was trifling, smelled horrible, sanitary napkins on floor, toilets are stopped up, and etc! Over all would not work there again! But they are good when it comes to their pregnant employees. They do suppose the womenz"
bad,"TL’s at Concentrix are awesome, it’s above those TL’s that the problems occur"
bad,"Concentrix is the WORST company I have ever worked for. Their clock in/out system has been broken for months. The employees have to stay after work filling out “exceptions” and then get shorted on our checks and have to wait til the next pay period to get paid. Shift bids are supposed to be based on seniority, metrics and attendance and they certainly ARE NOT. You get whatever they give you."
bad,"Very poor culture and knowledge for a multinational company. No basic understanding whatsoever of how different cultures minds and psihology works. Money, money and only money - no care for their clients or workers. Not recommended at all!"
bad,"Management is grossly under qualified, they will do whatever they can to accentuate your negatives which has basically ruined moral. They also now allow monetary bounties on coworkers if you turn them in for basically anything against policy (as small as ""sent me a text during work"") it is a toxic environment."
bad,They don't care if you are sick and 2 persons allowed to take leave per day. Most unit managers have no idea on their duties and responsibilities. They don't care about the health and condition of their agents. Lots of anomalies.
bad,"Terrible experience working here. I worked on the BT contact for 13 months and quite simply put, the company doesn't care about the employees one little bit. "
bad,"Good company to work for, now I am looking for part time closer to home in dunnville area, excellent training, excellent benefits, excellent hours, able to pick hours"
bad,"Absolute horrible place. They act like they care about their employees but they don’t.  You can only go so far in the company if you even want to stay that long. "
bad,late night shifts which were not fairly. The only buffet food was served which was overpriced and average quality.The work environment was okay managers were decent enough just to talk business.
bad,"Lies from day one.  No consistency.  Horrible training - no prep for when you actually go on the phones.  Scheduling is not conducive to a family life.  Tell you one thing expect another.  Write ups for anything and everything, even if you've been misinformed.  Dr notes don't mean anything, can still be disciplined for attendence.  No real commission or incentives for sales. Lying to customers is encouraged.     Supervisors spend more time gossiping about employees than working or helping employees. Hostile work place, bullying, and your job is constantly being threatened verbally."
bad,"Received new hire email beginning of January welcoming me to the 'family.' When I asked for ADA accommodation related to my disability, the recruiter who just welcomed me to the 'family' ignored me. After more than a week, I was finally emailed back and told that the position I was hired for was filled. Instead of accommodating me, they ignored me, and gave my position to somebody else."
bad,from my experience schedules were on 2 day notice and also even though some team leads are nice they are very hard to talk to. salary is to low for the work they expect of you and if there is an issue the decision pre made before you enter the meeting. had to work with broken systems work and home life is not great. if you wanna go up the ladder in the company the management must like you as a buddy and a yes man. they dont like constructive criticism.
bad,"This job mentally sucks the life out of you Then it's always a daily or weekly problem. I'm not going to go into a lot of details.....If you are is dyer need of a job this will do until you find something better.However, it is NO CAREER"
bad,The management is rude. They have an awesome training but once you get on the floor you are on your own.Rude and discriminating comments from the TL team lead.
bad,"Stay away.  They hire you with the promise inbound chat only! LIES. They change your schedule without notice of any kind for their Holiday Schedule, and then hit you with points if you do not change your plans and work. Beware of the black ceiling tiles, looks to be Mold! Very High Turnover Rate!! DO NOT WORK THERE!"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

bad,"inkompetenta ledare har noll koll på arbetsflöde och hur arbetsuppgifter skulle fungera, mycket mobbning"
bad,I’ve been working at call center’s for over 20 years and this by far is the worst one I have ever set foot in. It’s a good in between job because you can get hired right away make a little bit of cash to hold you over until you find a real job.
bad,This company is a generation Y run company and well lets just say that most of the older staff members there don't get a chance to move up and get more skilled and there is no real support most of the management team are there for themselves and don't care about anyone else except themselves
bad,my experience with Concentrix is a VERY BAD one. they don't like to pay you for the hours that you work or the overtime. they don't give you your back pay from when you get your raise after training. my training was over in october. it took them a month to give me my raise. its now january and i still haven't got my back pay from when they gave me my pay raise. when i do overtime they don't pay for that. when you ask them about it they say they looking it to it but there is no updates on the pay.
bad,"Unfortunately they have so many employees that they simply just don't really care about you, its not a great place to work unless its for a short period of time."
bad,HR are disorganized in completing your access eventhough you have completely submitted all the necessary requirements.Took us almost a month to have our system access.Lots of salary disputes to the extent that we even had a special pay out.Sick leaves are not credited properly even you have medcert which leads to another dispute.13th month pay here is taxable.Some support are somewhat rude and make fun of you whenever  you ask questions.The transition TL is so plastic and have favoritism.She is somewhat rude and offensive most of the time.She doesn't deserve to be in position.
bad,Not a company to work for. Best to work for anyone else but this company you wont ever get ahead they have their own cliche's and horrible management. Equipment is always broken
bad,Poor work hours. staff was kind but the amount of work hours was not able  to provide a full 40 hour week. (full time position) Mandatory time off was used when there was not enough call volume. names were thrown into a hat and drawn randomly for workers to be sent home.
bad,I hated being there. The site director and operations manager are horrible people who only care about themselves. I don't recommend anyone to work there ever! If you don't have open availability you can't work there. They make your schedule and you have NO say so! They play favorites there with certain agents/staff and its very unfair!
bad,"This company was difficult to navigate. No upward mobility opportunities, incentives, and or bonuses. Unprofessional management, and employees.  The absolute worst"
bad,Does nothing to Retain a key employee. Very bad employee policies not at all an employe friendly company. Not recommended for women at all. Male centric company. No growth opportunities for females.
bad,They do not care about the employees. They will fire you even if your the best worker there. Horrible place to work would not recommend to anyone. I was fired and denied unemployment until the phone interview then I did get the unemployment they could not justify why I was let go.
bad,"Funny there is always a positive review for every negative TRUE review. HR/Marketing obviously trying to hide the truth."
bad,I applied to work from home with the so called wonderful company. I spent 6 hrs on the phone with the it rep trying to get my computer to accept there programs and software. I was told I had to buy another computer cause their software/programs wouldnt work. Really!!! When my brand new is still under mfg warranty. Plus I took it to the store I purchased the computer from and they told me there was nothing wrong with my computer. I spoke with my supposed be trainer today and he would not give me another chance and told me to get another computer again. How can they expect you to go out to purchase another brand new computer when they only pay $10.50 An hour. Really again!!! Now I am glad I dont have to work for them even though I might have to work to drive to work to far far off distance land of employment. I told the trainer that I was going to post a unpleaset review about this issue. Its not fair.!!! But god will find me another job and better employment.
bad,"If you want to be stuck and make no advancements in your career feel free to sell your time to this place! One of the worst places I’ve ever worked for, they do not care about you all they care about is fulfilling their contract with Apple. If you get hired here you might as well just start looking for others jobs as well because I guarantee after the training classes are over it will be absolute garbage!"
bad,"Not a positive environment . No room for promotion or growth . Overtime wasn't paid properly. Management had relation with employees, lack of integrity and respect"
bad,"they are always hiring and now i know why, they fire people for every little thing and there is also a lot of favoritism. this company needs alot of work especially in the IT section."
bad,"Wow, talk about the worst dehumanizing job I have ever had. Not allowed to bring my chocolate bar in because it had a wrapper on it, no paper allowed.... you are a criminal in their mind without any proof."

bad,They never communicate with you or other managers about medical issues going on so if you had to leave early or had to take a little longer lunch for appointments you would get in trouble. Or wrote up
bad,"Mann wird ausgebeutet ."
bad,they were not nice and they couldn't help me out when my dad had a heart attack they threatened to fire me because I had to leave. I never went back...
bad,"Do NOT work here. They suck at managing. They don’t work with your schedule, they don’t give out enough training. They write you up if you do something wrong. They hardly ever recognize you if you’re doing well. Probably the worst place to work."
bad,"The worst work places I've ever seen!"
bad,"Client base and metrics rule "
bad,"- They hire basically whoever applies and then fire the weakest ones at the end of training so be warned! "
bad,Nobody helps you apart from the odd manager. The customers talk to you like trash. If you want your holiday login you have to wait for a million years like myself. You have pointless briefs every day and they never say anything positive there is also 0%morale and nobody enjoys there time here. The interview is nearly impossible to fail. to

bad,"Every single person there working on Humana project is paid 11.00 dollars an hour no matter you’re education or experience or tenure all they care about is how many enrollments a day they can get... they don’t care if you’re sick and have doctors appointments or have children, let’s just say you could have epilepsy and have doctors excuses and notes or have a car accident and your u call them and the first question is are you still coming to work? If not you’ll be here tomorrow right??! And then bring in the accident report for them to make copies of that’s not excused and anytime you leave early or come in more than 5 minutes late then you receive a point and after 8 points your gone.

bad,"No one will join "
bad,This was a horrible job sprint account can’t support something that someone wants to quit. Retention tactics were beyond goals and bonus was unattainable
bad,They always paid late or the check never comes. They try to offer gift cards instead of a pay check. They don't want to let anyone take a day off or it will count against you (point system) Horrible place to work if you have a family or taking care of the Elderly. You can only change your work schedule during the 3 month cycle and it's still not guaranteed that it will be better.
bad,When I first started I was ready and excited. Once I hit the production floor all heck broke loose. I ended up having medical issues which made me very sick and caused me to miss work which I had notes for. I was told accommodations were being made since my medical issue was messing up my adherence. Then a few months later on my day off I fractured my ankle was rused to the er I came to work the next day I had PTO I asked to use same day. While healing I missed several other days due to appointments or pain and swelling and needing to have my leg above my heart which was again in a drs note. I ended up my final point having the stomach flu I was told it wouldnt effect my job since I didnt sign the corrections yet they lied I was fired

Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Unprofessional management and toxic environment. The management only cares about their numbers and doesn't care about their employees. People in the managerial position are not even fit for their job.
bad,I did not like working there and there was no support and Management was not good and not supportive and less considerate to employees. It was for going there.
bad,"For a fresher not a good company waste of time, talent and employs centric is zero "
bad,They hire anyone just to keep their business afloat but its full of druggies yet they're anti pot though. Talk to their staff like they're drill sergeants and don't respect your rights.They'll fire anyone in a heartbeat if you stand up for yourself. Rude management and unprofessional HR. Terrible company to work for rude jerks!
bad,"Disgraceful company to work for! They don’t pay your wages properly let alone bonuses promised! My national insurance is about twice what my mum pays in her much better job! They punish you if you’re poorly, treat you like dirt and the management are a disgrace!!! Do not work here! It will make you feel suicidal"
bad,"Do not work here for any reason. Poorly run company with a inept and under qualified bunch of people in charge. Employees are not appreciated at all, Very stressful, Miserable experience."
bad,"I worked at the charlotte nc convergys/concentrix location for 2+years.  The job was easy,  they hired basically anyone who shows up.  And it showed we where all treated like children. My issue is with management at this call center they were aware of harassment from certain employees directed at me I am transgender but at the moment still present as a male or non-nonconforming way.  Other trans co-workers went out of there way to ""other"" me.  It was a pervasive thing management knew about it.  i heard some of the managers making derisive comments toward me.  There is a TL in emergency who I heard making comments about me about what he feels I am or am not,  is gender therapy in your concentrix job description?...no.  There was a another gay trainer there that made comments about me extremely unprofessional comments about what he felt  I was and that I still look like a man...and thing like that.  Other coworkers treated me like I had the plague or something because I am not  stereotypical.  I recently quit this job because the stress became unbearable to me.  I have never been so miserable in my life.  Management did nothing to stop it nothing to address it. There was not a TL I didnt hear saying something about me and that extended all the way up to the ""ops managers"""
bad,"Worst place without a doubt! Bosses are the biggest problem, no respect for employees, they always find something negative and they always force you to work extra"
bad,"Concentrix på den danska sida. "
bad,Its not a good place to work. A toxic environment.  Also they aren't good with scheduling they say they will accommodate you but they won't. The managers arent trained well at all.

bad,"Metas fora do normal, Men-tem para os CANDIDATOS dizento que é vaga fixa  mas na verdade sera temporario, acabou campanha de lançamento de algum produto novo...acabou seu trabalho e dispensa..mas obrigado por ter mandado...nao ia ficar por muito mesmo.  Eles mandam pessoas embora em MASSA apos campanhas de lançamentos de novos de produtos acabarerm. SUPERVISORES MENTIROSOS  UM PIOR QUE O OUTRO."
bad,"They push you from where your doing great at into departments you know nothing about and basically throw you to the wolves. The managers are suppose to coach you and work with you , but if your numbers are bringing them down you are let go instead of them trying to improve your metrics and help you succeed."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"This job was absolutely horrible! Management would not do their job, it would take them over 30 mins sometimes to come to the phone when a customer asked for them. If you had medical issues and had to be out they would not work with you. They also push you so hard to make sales instead of making sure the customer is taken care of and then get made when you have bad surveys. They also have you do really shady things to get people to buy stuff, so basically you are taking advantage of people to sell them things they don’t need!"
bad,An awful place to work. Potentially the most mismanaged place I have ever worked. The recruiters lied to me about the amount of money I would make. There is no redeeming quality of this place.
bad,Please don’t work at Concentrix nor refer anyone to work at Concentrix because that place does not care about their employees. They use us to satisfy the client
bad,"Management is completely biased. If you are well liked, you can get away with murder. The turnover is ridiculous. It would be better if they actually meant the things they tell employees. The worst part was going on breaks and seeing peers not only consuming alcohol, but also driving away after drinking to get more."
bad,too many cliques. Ppl were vengeful and ugly the managers were ugly to employees. Not good advancement. Too strict on employees. They did lowdown dirty things.
bad,"A customer service representative supports customers by providing helpful information, answering questions, and responding to complaints. They're the front line of support for clients and customers and they help ensure that customers are satisfied with products, services, and features"
bad,"Went there to interview for sales position at Managua office, didn't feel the position was good for me, so I asked if I could apply for tech position, they said I could. I have worked in another call center as tech support for 2 years and even got some awards. I did short video for them just a short informal video, and then they send me a rejection email, saying they werent even going to bother after telling me otherwise.....what? So regardless of what they say, or my experience they could care less about giving opportunities to someone whose qualified. Terrible company."
bad,"Awful place to work. Training is two weeks in a class room reading off a white board with an ‘instructor’ who can barely spell his own name never mind control a class. Third party employees are horrible and treat you like dirt. Timed toilet break, horrible atmosphere. Out of 17 that started on my course only 6 of us were left by week 3! Horrible place to work!!!"
bad,"Prepare to be overworked and underpaid! They will give you far too many hours when you don't want them, take them away when you do want them and all along they will make mistakes on your cheque that take months to fix."
bad,if they don't like you.  you know off the bat and you know you will be fired.  there wasn;t any support for help on calls.  \no coaching on what you did right what needed to be improved
bad,"This place is a joke. They use to be awesome until the company was bought out, now they are just terrible. They will just treat you like you are a number, no Matter how far you get in the company."
bad,"Working with Concentrix has proved to be the most difficult and most stressful job I have had so far. I worked with Comcast Outbound and the company promised a lot to me when I applied: bonus, vouchers and a very relaxed job, in which this was a lie. In my time with the company, I received nothing.  This job is for the lazy who can sit for long hours at time with very short breaks!"
bad,"Company is all for itself and not for its employees.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when you were able to assist a customer with what they were looking for and the satisfaction received from the customer.  The hardest part of the job was management was not helpful at all.  They sat in the group and watched EVERYTHING you did.  You could be on the phone with a customer and they would be skyping you on what to say to that customer.  Very distracting.  They always had their watchful eyes out!"
bad,"When I frist apply they told me ""They move to other candidate"". Next week, I got the job. I turn down a perm job to come here and its temp. They're  unorganized, rude, and no people skills."
bad,"I started in July and training was for 8 weeks that was the best part as you got help and support once you go on to the floor it’s bye bye all the help and support and having to find information for the enquires on my own , I had no step up as call volumes were high so there was no extra support and I always struggled daily with the enquiries. management is poor too and you have to run around looking for someone to help you! I am so much happier now I have quit I wouldn’t ecommende this to anyone it’s horrible"
bad,"Advisors are forced to take emergency calls and disaster calls that they are not prepared for or properly compensated for. "
bad,Management dont know the job that their Reps are doing. They have no training in what the projects were. The reps just feel like a butt in a seat and just another number.
bad,"Place was very unprofessional,ghetto. Managers were ghetto. There was no dress code. Lack of communication skills even home training. You don’t have your own personal space or privacy."
bad,Only work here if desperate for a job. Performance expectations are very high for a low wage. Security is crazy high.  Poor and insufficient training.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

bad,"Bedbugs. Lowest paying call center in Richmond. Ewww. Just thinking about the mice, roaches, and bed bugs crawling in that building turns my stomach! ."
bad,"My decision to pursue a higher position  from Convergys was based upon  the company being purchased by Concentrix., I was employed with Covergys for 3 years, My time at Convergys was rewarding in the aspect I gained valuable skills that prepared me for the career I  currently maintain."
bad,Concentrix was one of the worst companies I have ever worked for. They just hire anyone to be a manager with or with out experience. They have no floor support and there training is straight BS! I would never recommend this job to anyone
bad,"Inconsistent hours,  mandatory overtime,  not enough pay for having to deal with very rude, cuss you out customers. Favoritism. Management suck. High turnover"
bad,Customer service answering phone related issues to assist customers of AT&T with any problem in to their mobile services. I was trained to resolved customers issues in any type of situation. Customer service was a number one priority to handle each call in a timely matter.
bad,"Very stressful place to work, job is mentally tough, low morale, pay is not competitive. Difficult to advance. Shift bidding causes work/life balance to be challenging."
bad,"This company is a joke.  Upper management is nowhere to be seen. Will not address their team. The management in place is uneducated in the process as they themselves, do not actually do what you do. You're lucky to find one good person to help while everyone else ignores you or talks down to you like a child. Not to mention the bugs..."
bad,"Horrible place to work . Worst management ever . Unfair practises at work . Management thinks they run the place and not it’s people . "
bad,Concentrix was a horrible place to work. It's a third party company so the perks are no existence. Hours are fixed. You have no choice in overtime either you work it or fired. Manager and team leads never know what's going on and there is no communication between them. The pay starts off great till you find out that you only get a 15 cent raise a year. No sick pay. You do get 40 hrs a yr vacation
bad,"Training and TL's do not work together as well as what happens on the floor isnt taught to you. You need to know if you are not liked you will be gone in a very short time. They fire good people and keep ones that don't do their job. Totally unorganized and management does not help you whatsoever and i won't even go into the fact that they send people home even tho they are scheduled"
bad,"No proper communication with employees, company will induce fear rather than helping their employees "
bad,"If you dont want any bonus, increment this is the best company for you. Also you will not be to take your own leaves. Even if you are sick, your TL will call you and ask you to come. They will give the increment when they wish too and that also max 20k per year. No night allowances, rotational shifts every month and rotational week offs every week. They will send you emails about how much profit they earned because of your hard work but you will never receive any bonus."
bad,"Horrible place to work. You are paid by the min. You can submit what they call “bio” breaks if you have to use the washroom during your shift but they take it off your pay anyways. Managers do not care, it’s all about making the numbers. The client Apple sets one standard but Concentrix sets its own way above what Apple puts in place making it almost impossible to make bonuses."
bad,"horrible place to work. Don’t go there unless you like an unorganized, no leaders to help, and they throw you on the floor with only 2 weeks of being on the phone but training technically 6 weeks but that’s in a classroom doing nothing"
bad,"Concentrix is an extremely toxic environment to work in. With the lack of experience you get from training, you're thrown into a fast pace, high stress environment where you will rarely see a supervisor. Now a lot of customers will ask for your supervisor, good luck telling them that your supervisor isn't there or just straight up refuses to take the call. There are so many topics not covered in training that you're just expected to just guess. Truly an awful place to work."
bad,"It's very busy day at Concentrix."
bad,Stressful they say u don't have to sell but u do to keep ur job. Point systems are ridiculous . It's stressful to have to get good surveys but you literally have to push a sale on someone until they have said no three times by the time you get to the second no the customers already mad
bad,Not a good place to work if you want to actually stay there and not get laid off... I did not enjoy my employment after concentrix bought Convergys...
bad,My team lead was fine but another team lead was harassing me and they did nothing about it  I even talked to HR and our supervisor  they simply refused to help
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend concentrix. The management is poor. They also treat their employees poorly. Your employment here isn't secure. It Not full time work - wasn't able to go to the bathroom without time getting docked. Things may be different now, but this is how it was when I was there 3-4 years ago."
bad,They under pay and overwork. They expect you to perform without providing the necessary support or tool. The location I was at (Mississauga/Toronto) has infested with ants and at one point had not heat in the winter and A/C in the summer. we had to wear winter jackets and gloves at our desk because they were using space heaters.
bad,"Not sure where to begin....I worked on the First Direct campaign."
bad,"This was am error, I worked for Convergys, and not the company that is listed.  System would not allow me to go back or make another selection to not fill out anything."
bad,"Poor work ethic through out the company. "
bad,Job is highly stressful. Not paid enough. Incentive wasn’t nearly enough. What I did like was my schedule. That was the only good thing about the job. Management was trash
bad,"-in the beginning you think working with  friends and family,but when you wake up you find yourself in a street clans ."
bad,"Unprofessional TLs and OPS managers. "
bad,"My time at Concentrix was slow and unforgiving, they do not treat employees fairly, they hire people from everybackground and will fire people with out a second thought!"
bad,I miss the people not the company. What I didn't like was being lied to on a daily basis. I have very strong ethics and could no longer continue working for an organization that didn't.
bad,"I put job titles such as ""administration"" or ""IT Technical"" or ""Librarian"" in the search and keep getting ""lifeguard"" or ""oil rig maintenance"" in."
bad,"Terrible company ! very unprofessional, very LAZY, very rude. Scheduling is terrible, point system is trash .. Team Leader’s annoyed when called upon for assistance. HIGHLY do NOT recommend."
bad,I worked here and left wen everyome started dropping like flies. Always give u promises but never do. No benefits. No incentives. No rewards. No recognition. No experienced managers. Everyone including managers are scool leavers. I srill have nightmares about that place. Best thing i ever did was walking in on the day and saying 'CHEERIO'. Absolutely glad i left. I am now a manager in my new job. . also check out the video on the eveing times about acrion fraud lol
bad,"The most toxic environment I have ever worked in to date. "
bad,Training was unclear and very hard to understand. Trainer was always smokes as if we don't. Always smoke without asking if we understand the lesson/topic.
bad,The training is not good and the place is too loud you can't hear the person on your phone.  You end up feeling very illequipped to do your job.  If you ask for help sometimes you wait for 20 minutes.  Then you get in trouble for hold times.
bad,"Training is awful you learn more on production floor"
bad,Awful place to work. Dont do it. Feel dreadful going to work everyday. Recongonition is mediocre. Before they fired most of the fun people it wasnt so bad.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"One of the worst company to work, never been focused on employees concerns, all political games within the management, birse IJP's, no proper communication being delivered to employees."
bad,Worked there for a year and because the client removed the contract concentrix decided to hire either the newest employees or external for other clients rather than the ones with tenured.
bad,"Worked there for a year, during that time was moved from billing to tv support to internet support to everything support. If you know what you are doing they will just use you to help the ones that don't until you are burned out."
bad,"Joined concentrix after being at home for years raising my children, when i started i was honest about what i could work and management aparently agreed. When it came to joing my team they retracted everything they promised me, also wages where short and like every conversation i had with staff you never get the truth or you have to chase them for answers. Training staff where great and friendly however the training is lacking the amount to feel ready to join a team especially when your TL is unwilling to help you. My TL was rude and definetly on a power trip. When i went to HR about my hours situation i was then met the next day by my TL minipulating me into leaving and ""staying home with my kids"", she tried to scare me into the beleiving i was in trouble for going to Hr and lied to me about conversation. She was a bully and definetly gets her power from lowering other womens self asteem. I approached HR again however after a day of being made a full of and being brought to tears i left. Thank god i did as i then the next day was offered a job with decent people in a place with more opportunities although still a call centre this company have values. Glad got out before destroyed me. PLEASE AVOID AS FAKE AND MOST TL ARE NOT THERE TO HELP"
bad,"Completely mismanaged organization.  Supervisor(s) constantly looking for issues in which to change schedules, changing company rules without informing the workforce."
bad,"We had a terrible trainer. I wrote an email to the boss explaining everything that was happening. Myself and 5 other people ended up getting fired because we were in a Skype group talking. The boss is a liar and HR doesn’t know anything going on. The equipment they send is garbage and shuts its self off at random times. Even if I severely needed a job and they wanted me back, I would not."
bad,"they dont tret there employees, they dont psy well, and the hours are terrible snd to far from home , overall concentric is a terrible place to work and so on"
bad,It was good it was just a drive for me and the pay wasn’t worth the drive in my opinion. I enjoyed my coworkers a good amount I also wanted to take a break to focus on my education.
bad,When I say do not work here I’m telling you from a guy that worked here too long... I’m seriously trying to help you this place is a jungle it’s full of animals and most of these animals and senior managers who are their to watch how many sales you are getting to figure out ways not to pay you if you hit.... if u don’t hit you get sacked if you do hit they will try to take that money back off you.. this place is really bad....... minimum wage... big turnover bad management bad commission if you hit... maximum u will get is about 300-400 for hitting if you are lucky to work at McDonald’s you can earn more than this place... that is not a joke...
bad,I been working at Concentrix for about seven months when I decided to put in my two week notice and once they knew I was trying to leave they took away my PTO time I do not recommend anyone to apply here at all
bad,"Trabajo bajo presion, no vale el pago mesual. Muy mal experiencia."
bad,"I was a contracted vendor when it was Convergys. Even as a contractor, it was horrible. Nothing but a bunch of pigs and vandals that work there. Most of the management are clueless. I watched two of the big property management companies that Convergys hired rob them blind. "
bad,i worked at this company before they changed there name   i do not know any one that liked working for them after they left.but it was like a grate weight  got lifted after my last day.
bad,Bad place to work they don't treat their employees with respect they work their employees and don't pay them.  They suck the life out of their employees and don't care
bad,"Pior empresa que trabalhei na vida. Ambiente pesado Colaboradores são meio que forçados a fazer o que a empresa pedi, tipo p sair na mídia como a melhor, caso contrário, são ameaçados a serem desligados. ."
bad,HR is horrible. She is two faced and unreliable. Upper management doesn’t support lower management. All they care about are numbers. The people only mattered if they liked you on a good day. It was all bout the politics. They showed favoritism to some. Very unhappy environment.
bad,I don't feel like going into details about why I do not like this place. It was stressful & most of the people that work there are unethical and unprofessional.
bad,"This is the worst paying company I have ever worked at. The goal is to get the experience and get out. Ive been there for quite some time, ive had great performance reviews but never a raise. How does that motivate?"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I have never worked with this company before. I had worked with Convergys but not concentrix."
bad,"This is an unethical company that puts applicants through several screening processes with one set of requirements, but when you begin to work there, it all changes! "
bad,I was working for Concentrix in Tempe Arizona on the Sprint account. But something happened to where our trainer quit and they started us working from home. They never sent us another check. All the HR people an management actually were rude about it and kind of blaming us. Saying we probably cashed out checks and are trying to get a new. Which every company can see when the employees cash their checks. We are all working with a lawyer for a class action against Concentrix. If you want to get paid to work DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY!
bad,The management is poor they lie all the time they say it’s a no pressure sales job then pressure you to sell and if you disagree with a lead they try to find ways to fire you it’s unfair and not worth working here
bad,"They bought our site so they could take the foot print overseas, cheaper pay. this is what they are doing. places of employment all over the globe and they need the business to take it overseas"
bad,"I loved working here when I first start working here then it became stressful, if you have kids this is not the job for you. If you can’t keep up with your metrics or if you WANT to take care of your member then this is not the job, if you want to implement first call resolution this job is not for. Everything you are suppose to do to take care of the member you can not, they care so much about numbers and not the members themselves it’s ridiculous stay away!!!"
bad,Very low pay not worth the money nor the time we have no security cameras in the parking lot so someone can walk up to you take everything you have and nothings going to be done about it I saw a girl get beat up in the parking lot nothing happened because there were no security cameras  also they promote you even if you don’t want the promotion is not worth the stress for 50 cent more Also you only get a few hours of PTO every pay period But is very hard to use They only approve the FAVORITE workers who been there a while
bad,"*** If your break was at 1:00 and you couldn’t go on it by 1:02, you had to post in a chat room and wait for RTA to send you to break, which sometimes took hours. They claimed we weren’t meeting intervals and held people’s breaks and lunches up, just for doing your job with a customer .***"
bad,"This place is clique and the management team is not very professional...they force you into departments without the proper training, hour to work ratio is brutal with the company asking that you be available 24/7....any medical or personal time needed is frowned upon, payroll/HR discusses personal information with reception and others that are not even employed with company, there is no open door policy, when presented with"
bad,"They mess up your hours and checks. Too many people thinking they are in charge. They changed the dress code notified us on a Thursday that it would change on Monday. So we were expected to buy new clothing to wear in this dirty call center that never gets cleaned. I’ve seen mice in there, the Spanish people who “clean” there just get the trash and dash. Pay is terrible"
bad,"Worse job by far management sucks, they fire people for stupid reasons treat you like you dont have a home life if you're a single parent or a parent at all this job isn't for you. If you get sick alot this job isn't for you."
bad,"The job overall sucks , the only good thing is being able to work over time.  But they take that away based off of a few stats you have no control over ."
bad,"unprofessional ,"
bad,If you have children don’t work here they don’t care about life outside of this place. I’m currently looking for a new job because of my work schedule conflicting with my schooling. I asked for a certain shift and was told I could have it but it has yet to happen
bad,"They sucked.. didn't care bout their customers or employees. Management never seemed to want to help and always threatend to fire if you messed up or didn't follow the steps, if you asked for help or didn't understand, they refused to help you."
bad,"Worked for 3 months! What a waste of time! TL's don't coach or help you in any way! They tell you to find the answer in one of the many useless documents after the customer waited on hold for an hour in some cases just to get through! Ridiculous place!! It's sink or swim! Turns out I wasn't cut out for this daily guessing game of am I doing it right!! Bathroom breaks are counted during your actual break time. Takes forever to get to the washroom, hand dryers are slow!"
bad,That place needs to shut down because if not they will be looking at many lawsuits due to poor management. Concentrix will have you thinking you doing a good job when really they management trying to figure out how to get the next person over. The Site director is racist and rude. The operation manager tries to hit on any woman in his site and will do anything to keep that woman there so that he can continue to look at her. They are  dirty!!!
bad,HR especially.. God awful. Company itself is unfair.  The work environment is trash. Company gets over on people. We use google to search which is the same thing we charge member for
bad,The stress of being yelled at by the customers was too much to handle and the managers didn't really do anything to alleviate it. Employee turnaround was so quick that they didn't seem to care. The Employees themselves were given idiotic policies to follow and no explanation for the customers. Even if we were able to help the customer out or their complaint was valid we were advised not to do anything.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Just about every year the project you’re on closes and you have to stress for months if you’re even going to have a job and be transferred to another project. Forget about keeping your schedule if you do get transferred. They pay horribly too
bad,"Honestly, this is one of the worst places I have ever worked for. Long hours, no social life, keep changing bonus structure, managers are two faced so you need to stick on their good side, HR is not reliable and talk about employees behind their back. You make one mistake and they get rid of you. High Turnover rates because they overwork employees whilst not paying enough. The job description they have are lies, they don't pay bonus monthly, bonus is received every three months now, and almost every two weeks the pay is wrong and they take forever sorting it out, I regret wasting so much time working for a company like this. Typical day of work is non-stop call after call, hardest part of the job is sucking up to Managers and OMs. Most enjoyable part of the job is you end up having a laugh with some colleagues, but even your work mates don't end up staying long. The cafeteria is small and there is hardly any place to sit at lunch if between 12pm and 1.30pm, so if your lunch ends up at this time during your shift then do what I do and just eat in your car. Parking spaces are not enough too and they keep hiring more people. There is always a fight for seats with managers at the start of the day."
bad,"Concentrix was a terrible company to work for, and I would not recommend them to anyone. The managers were horrible, and in case of a real emergency, the company did not help you at all."
bad,after colonial Penn left the place went downhill management  always lieing no recognition for perfect attendance or good quality scores upper management not knowledgeable for jobs they possesss
bad,Promise you everything but give you nothing. When pay is wrong they take about 2/3 months to get it back but by that time you've more paydays wrong. Worst place I've worked for. Just a number and far too much favouritism in there. Don't waste your time going.
bad,"Concentrix does not make decisions based on what is best for their clients, their client's customers, or even themselves. Decisions are based on favoritism and how to make this month look profitable, even it results "
bad,They are very strict and instead of following their own guidelines about first a verbal warning then written. Then final. They terminate for no good reason.
bad,"been here for several years got progressively worse, looking for another job, as management dont care about staff just hitting there targets for clients, its minimum wage max stress"
bad,Management is a joke. Only time they speak to you is when the client is there so they can make themselves look good. They don’t care about you’re mental health and the toll this job can take on it. They are all full of sh**. But if you like drama and bullsh*t bosses go for it.
bad,so unprofessional! they like to act like they do their jobs when the client is around but they curse and act like CHILDREN when nobody around . and by they i mean the TEAM LEADERS
bad,"I knew when this aquisition took place that cuts were going to be made. They are interested in gaining as much knowledge from the counterpart and then eliminating you to save the bottom line. They are not advanced with current technology or trends and exploit the employee for their skill and toss you to the side. They preach culture and work life balance, but will restructure their business to eliminate your position."
bad,"This company is full of a bunch of young best friends. The office manager looks over agents with multitudes of potential to make sure that her friends are always accomodating. this company is like the modern day Days of our Lives. If it wasnt for the fact that i need a job, i definetly would not be here."
bad,"high turnover for a reason, poor management and a bully cycle if you did not hit your required targets in the organisation. avoid as all costs unless you want 2 weeks wage in training."
bad,"Horrible environment, from the management to the vending machines robbing your money!!"
bad,"this was a position where you took a lot of abuse from not only the customers as it was a save desk job, but you also took abuse and threats from the management on a daily basis"
bad,At your own risk work for these unorganized and lying people with no job security. They lied about pay and job availability. Never allowed us to use the PTO we earned
bad,"Would not recommend.  Nepotism is rife in Belfast..no training or career advancement.  Sales team in London self serving and disconnected from the rest of the team "
bad,"i talked to people over chat to provide technical assistance with their Apple devices, like the iPhone, iPad, apple watch, and ever so often the apple TV."
bad,No pay raises in 5 years. They will lie to you about everything and never follow thru in what they promise. Turnover is high due to the way they treat employees.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Proper cons conning staff and most of all there clients they allowed people with no experience onto campaigns where client had requested 2 years sales experience.  Just because they get paid per seat filled and give the staff filling the seat 20% of what the client pays thus they make money for babysitting staff even if they dont perform. They have a few who have stuck at it and do perform. Iv worked 8 call centres of manchesters 150 this being the 9th and worst one of all. Pci breaches regularly ignored. Amateurs.  I got an A* in business aged 15 and opened a successful business at 18 i still run ten years later i thought theyd be a call centre atmosphere nights out with the staff fun stuff etc i was wrong a gap year in my career to go meet new mates and do something different for a year, i was clearly the best on my team and managed out because they found this out i ran my shop from the same premesis. They were lucky to have such an experienced sales agent on hands top performer with plenty of previous roles and gave me up. I was over qualified. No education, a company furnoture and chattels, and very compliant on calls so would habe had to pay me comms sack my type off get less experienced "
bad,"They lead you to believe one thing and they do another. You can call a recruiter multiple times and forget about getting a callback. They could care less. One of the most unprofessional company alive. "
bad,"Did not enjoy working with Concentrix. They are not fair, pay is poor and scheduling is a terrible "
bad,"There are too many chiefs and not enough Indians. No one has any idea of what’s going on and to get help is a struggle. "
bad,This job is not good and just being honest.If you want to work somewhere to start somewhere then find but as far as growth this job is not is.The staff is not the great as well.
bad,The worst place to work. They don’t have a corporate site so they can fire you however you want. They make changes everyday. Just not a good company. Highest turnover rate.
bad,"Rude staff, training is the best part about working for Concentrix. Working for the Navigation team is horrendous. You get yelled at on the daily, you're not appreciated and you only get $14 an hour."
bad,"When I first started working there it was ok, but after the second year there were a lot of cha ges in management and things were no longer good. The environment is bad"
bad,"Hiring process was about 3 weeks long. You start with 5 weeks of “training” which is actually just 3 weeks of slideshows and two weeks of actually being on the phone. Even in training, you can get marked down for not having enough knowledge to assist customers. No flexibility with scheduling. Also, my checks were never correct."
bad,"L'azienda (parlo di quella con sede a Cagliari, Loc. Sa Illetta) contatta personalmente i candidati, svolge i colloqui e decreta gli idonei, ma ciò che fino all'ultimo i candidati non sanno, è che al momento dell'assunzione il contratto non è a tempo determinato (come loro dichiarano nell'offerta) bensì un banale contratto in somministrazione, senza possibilità alcuna di progressione. E non venisse mai in mente a nessuno di esprimere educatamente perplessità al riguardo (o al riguardo di qualsivoglia argomento) verrete fatti fuori senza molte spiegazioni. Ovviamente prime due settimane a vostre spese, non retribuite.Professionalità inesistente."
bad,"This company is what I consider a “puppy mill” but for employees. The “management” (I use the term loosely) are like school teachers and we are the children. You have to ask to leave your desk to go to the bathroom. You have to ask to go get a drink of water. "
bad,"This company closed the Omaha office and moved jobs overseas. In the final few months, the company told all the employees that they would not be closing the Omaha office."
bad,Do not pay for short term or long term disability cause you wont get paid. Its like working at a daycare. Loud music playing by the suoervisor but were not suppose to have phones on the floor. You earn PTO and cant use it. Has to request almost 2 months in advance.
bad,"very high turn over rate, great with training, busy and entertaining depending on who you work with. silly procedures with not accepting people who have debts of any kind over a certain amount, people are trying to work to clear their debt and you make it difficult to even get a job."
bad,Management acts like they care about you then quick to backstab anyone so they look good. Even if you are on their team. Project manager lied too as did HR.
bad,Favoritism. Rude. Best part was the 5 wk class. Cold calling ppl that had already declined services. Cold calling ppl that already had services. Having to resign ppl up after the 1st time didn't go through.
bad,Concentrix bought convergys when they did they closed down every contract except for ours and one other they started to hire management from outside of the project unqualified managers did not know the project employees that have been for years were looked over no job security we dont know if we are renewing our contract
bad,"When I worked in Concentrix I was witness to work place bullying that a manager participated in. A manager sifted through the private belongings of a recent employee in order to humiliate her, and went out of her way with a clique to make her feel unwelcome. This manager showed a lack of interest in actually doing her job, huffed and puffed when asked simple questions by employees she did not know the answer to. Nothing happened to this manager when concerns were raised. There are no real advancement opportunities unless you're willing to stick around long enough to be a manager in which case the pay is not much better than a regular employee."
bad,Poor Managment always favoring the ones who should not be favored and can’t help out the people that actually want to work. This place is a joke and nobody takes in seriously. The scheduling sucks you get a new schedule every 3 months and you will never get a weekend off or feel like you have a life outside of work because you work either 9 or 11 hours a day. Place is dirty and disgusting and you will NEVER get a raise unless you move to a Managment position and at that point you only get a few dollars more which isn’t even worth the money for what you do.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"managers treat you like kids, or worse animals. "
bad,"ABSOLUTELY terrible place to work. They treat you terribly and expect you like it. You go to ask about your because it's not their the answer you will get is ""im not with scheduling"". The pay and benefits is a joke compared to other places in the area. Some of the supervisors know less thing that the actual employee's."
bad,I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE TO WORK FOR THESE PEOPLE. the management is a mess and they really don't give a care about their employees the management ie horrible.
bad,"Wouldnt recommend my dog for this job!!!!"
bad,"I can't believe the lack humanism.  They really need to ""get it together""  it's a joke how unorganized they are!  I really was disappointed in the chaos they made of my life."
bad,"Mever have a seen a company NOT fox computers, chairs, mouses and tables like concentrix."
bad,"DO NOT APPLY HERE! Team Leaders don’t care about their employees, it takes too long to advance, you would do entirely too much work for only 12.50$ an hour, and training is the best part of the job. Literally apply anywhere else and save yourself the stress sis"
bad,don't work here!!!!!!!!! management is horrible and they make you do overtime and they don't respect your schedule. worst place I've ever worked at.....
bad,"Terrible place to work, zero career prospects, uninterested HR department, management are unqualified, bully culture on the call floor, head of the building and high up management have been sacked on numerous occasions."
bad,"Overwork ,missing hours pay is decent they start you off at 12.50 but i been working there for just about 2 years got to there highest senor advisor was a manger on phones (witch pay 14.00 they add 10 cent's after working there a year) but regular employee off the phones. most people would quit first day on phones cause as time went by they train the classes less and less throw you on the phone the shell shock would have whole classes which are about 20, 30 people before the  first hour was done. non paper environment cause of clients rules. and they make it impossible to keep a record (they will not email or print it or anything) or request a record of when you punch in & out for break, lunch everything . you be found at fault for shotty hardware ,shotty time stamp sofware horrible client software that works worse then time stamp software. it alot of time nearly impossible to use paid time off even in far advance you get sick or bus makes you late or if a family member is dying or has just died forget about it stay away!"
bad,"The managnent is unorganized, self-centered and immature. They made multiple promises that were never kept. The pay is ok but, for the things you have to put up with inside the facilities, the pay is not enough."
bad,De las peores empresas en las que he tenido que trabajar. Las posibilidades de ser ascendido se resumen a qué tan amigo eres del OM.
bad,"Worse place I’ve ever worked managers lazy "
bad,"Absolutely horrible place to work! Unprofessional, low pay, high call volume with little workers to cover them, no consistent schedule or raises, management egos and issues. The list can go on and on and on, but you get the point. Save yourself now."
bad,"This job came at a perfect time in my life, but it is not the end all be all. There is no structure, its not consistent. The people change their mind, change policies, and procedures, based on them changing their drawers. "
bad,"I've been at this company since May 2017. Please don't work here, this was an at home position, but certainly not worth it. They recently raised our pay from 10.25 to 13 an hr... They give you mandatory overtime on your schedule without any proper notice and then flag you and send you resignation letters and warnings if you choose to not work it or can't because of scheduling conflicts due to school/childcare. "
bad,"Targets are set at an unacheivable line and the culture is not at all transparent. The alleged teams are more competitions that nobody knows they are competing in. There is no job security and hard workers are not retrospected or recognized. Their concern is their bottom line, not employees or even the services they provide. The actual job is great, but the management is absolutely venomous. Micromanaging tactics, lack of morale and terrible pay all add up to make it very disheartening to work there."
bad,Worse job I’ve ever had. Most people don’t last more than 3 months after training. Team Leaders hate their job and openly let their employees know. Don’t sit in the front aisle or management will throw items at you while you are getting yelled at by customers on the phone just for laughs!! Never seen so many people literally break down and cry. All for 14.00 per hour.
bad,"Very unorganized, none caring of employers, undercut management."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"The worst job I’ve ever had in my 15 years of experience in the working environment!! "
bad,"Answering two to possibly three calls minute and some, co workers treat each other absolutely terrible. Such a negative environment to put yourself in for only $14 an hour, forced long lunches unpaid, all breaks unpaid, just brutal"
bad,"I truly am sad to say I worked there in the past when it was convergys they were better now it's like a prison camp no reading materials no electronics nothing at all and if you did bring something it wouldn't be long before they had an issue, the trainers are great, but the beaters are not at all qualified to be nesters they will not help they just stand around talking so any new hires went prepared to go out onto the floor. There are excellent team leads but then there are really bad one ive never heardanagement brag about how happy they are to find out someon quit. Its embarrassing. Then they switched system just months after we finished class and they wanted us to learn the system and use it in one day. Poor management the upper staff are either racist or really messed up. Glad I left!"
bad,"The lack of communication and integrity with this company is alarming.  I did what I needed to do to be employed by them but because of a mistake on their end, I was unable to even complete training.  I am still owed money for training hours worked.  The job was not as advertised."
bad,"Worked here for 2 years and before Concentrix took over it was Convergys. This is a very poor managed company. They always say that they hire the most ratchet employees, and that if you are not one of the members close to someone you can guarantee you will be gone. They are always threatening to walk you out the door for anything. They talk about all the employees and they can not keep people there because of the unprofessionalism. All they need is a few statements from a cliche and then you are gone. Whether it is true or not it is grounds for termination. Wrongful termination. They make up their own rules depending on the agent."
bad,Nice to work if you are looking for a REAL permanent job. This job will get you through until you are able to find a REAL job. The PROMISE you E-gift cards for working overtime but NEVER get them to you. They tell you to watch your personal email for them and they never show. There IS ALWAYS an excuse on why you haven’t received them. They want you to work you butts off but don’t show any recognition for it. They tell you that a recruiter will be in touch with you for possible movement to different accounts and no one gets in contact with you. You are the one that has to breathe down managements neck to find answers. They have no respect for individuals and do not know how to talk to their employees through Direct messaging. These people talk to you as if you are their child or knowing that you could be older then they and could have more experience then they do.
bad,"I only worked there for 6 months in Luton and in that space of time the respect, support and morale in that building was non existent. Advertise the job to get 3k bonus making it £21000 per year as your salary and this was a lie!!"
bad,"It's better to work at mcdonald's managements shows favoritism, very unprofessional period!!! The supervisors and operation managers gossip all day and they will sabotage you if they don't like you ."
bad,"Management is poor, schedules poor, not a flexible job, either do what they want or write up and get terminated. The pay is to low for what they expect out of you. If you need a job bad go for it but if you can find better RUN for it!!"
bad,"Bad management, poor pay, no staff recognition, unaffordable healthcare, treat employees like children, management treats staff as if they were all in kindergarten. I think it management was better it could be a good place to work. They need to clean house!!"
bad,Didnt like working here....the pay rate is absolutely nonsense for the amount of work that is expected from you...no room for mistakes...they expect us to ask for help when needed but no one is ever available or interested in helping. When in training the management acts all nice and helpful but once you hit the floors these same people dont even recognize you and their true personalities come out.
bad,"Simply put the WFH (work from home) position was horrid. Lack of management,stability, and everything in between. I worked the intuit project and after 04/15/2019 they locked us out of our emails and schedules went blank. I can not speak for everyone but I do not know if I am employed or let go since my current schedule shows ""no data available"". This is my life my livelihood and finding another job is not that easy with working from home. No upper management, no communication. A company that treats employees like trash and just throw them out with no word will forever be a company that will never strive. Horrible get it together before you all are sured big time.."
bad,"If you want to work in a high school environment, this is your place. The team leads are extremely fake and rude, for no apparent reason. If you need help, you’ll need to find it through a fellow pca,  not a team lead. If you like to smoke pot on the job, this is your place. Overall “management” and “team leads” should assess their lives and figure out where they went wrong. Ghetto, do not bother unless you enjoy being surrounded by insanely undereducated people, that live in a high school mind frame."
bad,"(Opinion) This company is not worth the time for individuals of my caliber or one who has tons of formal and professional experience to offer. This is a very unorganized place of business that offers little to no employee benefits, and offers very high insurance plans. The pay is well below average even in supervisory roles. Wouldn’t recommend this place of business to skilled professionals seeking supervisory or management roles within this company, because they deserve so much better than what Concentrix has to offer."
bad,The Laredo branch sucks the cbs repair sucks I always have or  one or more programs down the upper management are a bunch of tools the agents aren’t paid enough they always say good things are coming but after waiting for changes it’s sad to see they didn’t hold up their side of the deal
bad,Youre assistning 75-100 calls a day. No one shows up to work and when they dont it's up to you to assist 1000 calls within your shift. The managemenet is very unporifessional. The place is very dirty and filled with old dusty computers. It's always cold and hard to type because of it.
bad,"I genuinely hated working at Concentrix (Convergys at the time). My manager actually trained in the same class as the rest of our team, joined late and was not present for all sessions. His style was to micromanage to the point of standing behind our desks, telling us to hurry up or actually pointing at our screens during calls and telling us what to do, when we were usually already taking required actions for the issue."
bad,800 +employees laid off after we became concentrix and that was the wrmorst news i could get because i actually like the people i work with but now we all e en Operation management. HR IS BEING LAID OFF. ITS BOUGOUS
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"It’s very ghetto, loud and toxic. I literally cried on some of my calls because I couldn’t stand the workplace the noise coming from team leads and agents- you can’t trust no one from here because they talk a lot about people even TL- poor management. People will smile and have a chat with you and disrespect you behind your back"
bad,"Very Boring You can sit for up to 30 mins with nothing to do"
bad,"There was an amazing advisor who worked there. She was wonderful at her job and was amazing to be around. As time went on, I watched her light vanish and she started having mental health issues. It was blatant, she lost weight and cried a lot. She was told by her manager that her demeanour was “miserable be around and had a chip on her shoulder” but she has clinical depression? "
bad,This company is a joke not worth your time or energy. From the time I was hired to the time I left the company. There was nothing but issues. It was a very stressful working environment.
bad,"The management are an absolute joke. They treat you like a statistic, the ops managers are even worse and put on a performance when the clients come in. You cant do anything right and half the computers do not work after over a year of being reported to IT. The recruitment lie to you about the shifts you do, you cant have anything at your desk apart from a water bottle but then ignore the fact that other advisors have loads on their desk. You have to be a favourite to progress and getting time off is near impossible. Stay clear of the place."
bad,They need to improve all of their work ethics aswell as pacing cameras within all of the office floors for all of the rumors that goes on in the office.
bad,Unless you have zero dollars in your pocket don’t work here. Easy hiring process but don’t do it. The building is infested with rats and bed bugs. A ton of people got bit up. The managers and tl said if we went home they would fire us. They keep it at the high 50s in the building. It’s freezing all the time regardless of the weather. They have a ton of favoritism. They will f you over quick. It’s slave work. Calls are back to back every day unless it’s sunday or Saturday night.
bad,Forced to sell and run customers credit without consent. Managers and leaders not willing to help reps while on the phones. Family life isn’t important your job doesn’t feel secure if you don’t sell.
bad,Not worth it they treat there employees like dirt they don’t help when there is a problem like they say they will in the training class they just throw you to the wolves and let you do it on ya own
bad,"Didn't have the tools to do our jobs. Constantly yelled at by patients because of this. Managment was again dependent on who you knew because the metrics where Impossible unless you hung up or transferred patients (and you could get written up for doing this unless you were friends of management). I knew somebody there who was rude, yelled at customers, and inappropriately transferred calls constantly and guess what...THEY GOT PROMOTED!!!"
bad,"Okay job for the time I spent working there,"
bad,"A typical day at Concentrix involves answering Customer phone calls. I learned a lot about computers and mobile phones here, and gained valuable Customer Service experience.  Training is paid, and benefits are offered. That's all the decent things I have to say about Concentrix.  Now for the bad. Management and human resources are awful and do not care about the workers. They do not care about your mental, or physical well being. You are expected to be at your desk, at stations, and/ or equipment that doesn't work, and chairs that are broken and sink down to the floor.  The call floor is dirty, and is not cleaned on a regular basis. You are trained to do the job, but not at a satisfactory level. If you are in need of help, you are on your own, and are expected to find the answer yourself. When new products or software is released, you are not given appropriate training time to learn about new stuff before handling phone calls. You are extremely under paid for the amount of stress and lack of training that this job requires. Extra hours are forced, and you are unable to say no to them. I do not recommend Concentrix at all. Find somewhere else to work, as I would rather be unemployed."
bad,"This place is like a high school. Poor management, extremely competitive, and the drama is never ending no matter how far you place yourself away from it. They communicate in a chat room and that leads to gossip and conversations unrelated to work, but never the less does not stop the noise from the room and space around you. You will be doing your best to fix a clients problem and get shot with nerf darts. You will be poorly trained and then thrown to the wolfs expected to know it all. Pay seems exciting, but it's enough to get by, not ahead and severely overvalued for the stress that comes from this position and place in general."
bad,"When I first began working for this company it all seemed pretty good but upon completing training and being placed with my manager it all began to fall apart. I began being contracted with Turbo Tax but was soon promoted to working for Apple. I started off working 1 PM- 10:15 everyday and was led to believe that after training we would automatically get better shifts. When I asked about the shifts I was told by my manager that I would have to shift bid and would still likely get  late shifts because we were ""new."" The manager was very unprofessional and disrespectful in many ways including sharing employees personal information. Our training class started with 22 people but only ended with 9 because the manager was so unprofessional. We were required to work mandatory overtime frequently  without getting paid for it. Pay was good but paychecks were inconsistent and always way shorter than supposed to be. Managers did not care to fix the issue and it was impossible to reach HR. I tried reaching out to multiple supervisors and managers for months about the many issues I had but never even got a response from any of them. The worst part of my experience was the fact that I was hospitalized for 2 weeks and during this period I WAS FIRED ON MY OFF DAY! I provided all doctors excuses and medical forms but was basically told it did not matter! I would only recommend this company to someone who really needs a job at the moment but I would not see this lasting long at all. The only good thing about this company was the Apple discount!"
bad,I have never worked here. Indeed is forcing me to complete this review based on it confusing this company with another company I have actually worked for!
bad,"Management and floor staff are very unprofessional. Hours are horrible, favoritism rules, no salary increases.  No sick leave.  Turn overs are so frequent that you never get to know anyone.  The good ones leave in droves.  Rules change every day.  No customer service.  Just sales."
bad,"NEVER EVER would I submit someone to that work environment!!!! Too much favoritism, they won't work with you in an emergency and you work on a point system"
bad,"To begin with ... I have loads to say..."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,I am discriminated against to the point of not even wanting to go in. it is Bias and advancement is based only on attendance not knowledge. I have been there over 2 years and have not been allowed to advance although I have extreme knowledge about my project and people love me. I do not even want to go in anymore.
bad,The management sucks. There is a lot of favoritism when it comes to an employee needing help. The customers are just downright rude. Do not apply here unless you would like to be mentally and verbally abused.
bad,Horrible place to work!! Management doesnt know anything about the account. You wont advance unless you are a favorite. I do not recommend this place to anyone.
bad,Bad job great job bad job not a good job hated it so much so so much no place for any human to work period  you guys really make ppl do reviews that sucks so much
bad,"The job itself is manageable, and the people I met on the floor and in my class were nice and honestly the only good part of the job."
bad,"I started there when it was still Convergys. Management was lacking but it was fine. Then Concentrix came in and shut down 4 of the 6 departments, laying off 900 agents. If you decide to accept employment there, just beware your job is never safe."
bad,If you are looking for a job with employment growth & consistency you may want to reconsider applying at Concentrix. This job goes by a 12 point system that does more damage than help employees.
bad,Third Party Customer Service for DIRECTV Satellite Tv Service. Customer Service Technical Support. Schedule Service Calls to New and Existing Customers. Proactive Sales quoting for equipment upgrades and Tv Program packages
bad,"Supervisor were inexperience and shady"
bad,"I worked there for a year. The customers are HORRIBLE, they are rude, disrespectful and entitled. They expect the world from you and yell at the same time. Management is AWFUL, they play favourites and are useless. I did nesting a lot for the new hires and the trainers did nothing but smack talk ALL the new employees. The politics and drama are just high schoolish."
bad,"When the company first came to Va I was one of the first employees. And it was something new and exciting, Then heads grew took on more than we could handle and the program has suffered ever since, mass firing and hiring of the same element will never improve anything. Multiple management changes never actually finding the right fit. Company morale is poor, those who are still there honestly it's just for the check because the only way change will come is if they start hiring qualified people instead of seat fillers. Signed a once dedicated employee."
bad,"Got an interview right away. Was told that it would be about an hour, to an hour and a half. It took over 2hrs.i also informed them I don't do technical support or sales,they assured me that the job I was being placed at would be only customer service question and billing issue. Then had to go back the following day and do more paperwork, background and drug screening paperwork. Was told customer service representative position and very little technical support and no sales. Looked forward to my first day of training. But when I got there they lost my complete drug screening paperwork and wanted me to retake at my cost for driving there and back. Then got into class and found out that I have upsales, major technical support and customer service support, with many different brand of service. 9 different systems to learn. No one on one help and there so called 4weeks of training. One week of class, one week of computer learning and then out on your own with little help. Concentric is really convergys. They just changed to a new name. Still lieing, misrepresenting company. PLEASE DON'T WORK THERE. BIGGEST WASTE OF TIME!!!!!"
bad,When I was hired I was promised set hours. I have children so I wouldn’t have accepted the position had I known that I would be scheduled different shifts every single day after training was over. Many of us couldn’t balance our home life with inconsistent schedules which resulted in us accumulating attendance points. Which then resulted in atleast 50 single mothers getting terminated along with myself around the holidays. Merry Christmas to us and our children right.
bad,This is the worst company to work for the training is a joke the management is horrible and they dont know if the contracted will be renewed or not one day we are told we will be closing and being moved to another department that will be also closing a month later then we are told the they extended the contract for 6 months and they dont know what will happen after that like i said this is a horrible unreliable company to work for....
bad,"I mean do or you're going to do if you really absolutely have to get your bills paid. I'm sure in other parts of the country it's not all that bad and maybe that home program might be good. However the specific location that I worked at was horrible. No professionalism, everyone was prejudiced they literally hire anyone off the street now mind you sometimes people are trying to get a fresh start. If you're a woman do not work there or do not work in the LG department quality analyst is a rap ist. Everyone's toxic and how to get one another do not waste your time or do not think that this is going to be a stable job because it's not I literally no and heard from managers they literally hire to fire. Everyone is high and I don't think that's appropriate."
bad,"I was constantly going on errands for the managers sent to the shops for cigarettes, lunches, errands for their personal life etc and every month I lost my bonus through this because I was regularly late from breaks  and was eventually fired for bad time keeping by the manager i was running around for the most I think this had a lot to do with I raised this issue up with more senior management who didn’t seem to care"
bad,3 pay periods messed my money up never referring no one else and management is very poor and need to do better at communicating with the employees. I had two different team leads worse job ever
bad,"People call in with issues and you have to sell them something, which only makes them more mad. The management only cares about sales and will force you do do illegal things in order to get sales. It felt like high school all over again. When ever management wasn't breathing down your neck about how you haven't had a sale since yesterday, they are talking with each other. Policy is always broken when it comes to escalations. A manager is supposed to take them but they will just tell you to send them to loyalty. And if you complain about anything such as being forced to process a sale even though the customer told you to cancel it, the person you complain to will tell your manager and then you are singled out. They will nit pick you until you quit or they find the pettiest reason to fire you. This place is by far the worst job I've ever had. If you are even THINKING of working here, DONT!"
bad,"Got hired full time,but ended up getting sent home 3 out of 5 days. Out of my training class of 25 only 2 still work there and we were hired on in November. They cant keep people, make big promises, and fail to deliver. They make you use break time to go the bathroom and ding you for over use. Management doesnt care, so you dont care."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"They treat the employees like dirt unless you well liked. Won’t do anything about management when they mess up. Allow mistreatment of the people who work for them. They allow chemicals into the building  that cause folks with asthma to have leave. "
bad,I would there quit it was horrible so horrible I quit and my kids mom took my kids away and started sleeping with the it guy haven’t seen my kids in months and uses concentrix as a place to hide out
bad,"Do your research and you'll find that this company is just like a temp agency, they have multiple contracts and they fail to tell you that the job is temporary assignment and once the contract is up then you basically bid for another one leaving you unemployed until the next contract is ready to roll out."
bad,"They didn’t care about you, didint train properly and gave zero feedback on how to improve. Convergys played favorites on who who they wanted to promote. If the person interviewing had a problem with you or didn’t like you you could say goodbye to any sort of promotions."
bad,"Ridiculous expectations, no room for advancement or pay increase. Job was stressful but great if you enjoy being cussed and yelled at by entitled people. Managers were not helpful, petty, and showed favoritism. I would NOT recommend working here even if you're desperate, you can work hard and keep up metrics they will still find fault, take your hours and then transfer you to another client or program without so much as a notice."
bad,"the  managers were not helpful, i changed supervisors and desk every month. no training at all .  i was employed there a very short time , it was a difficult place for me to work"
bad,"Want to feel like a chained up animal.  Work here.  "
bad,"After Concentrix acquired Convergys in October 2018 we were treated so poorly by our new management.  Within 2 months the lay-offs began.  We were bascially ignored for months, no direction, no communications, no team building, etc.  We were just left to question our day to day jobs until our jobs were no more.  Extremely unprofessional, no clear goals, and very little guidance from Senior Leadership.  They do not believe in following ITIL although the rest of the IT world does and they do not believe in delegating and trusting their employees to do a good job.  Way too much micro-managing!!!"
bad,"Don't waste you and your family's time working at this place.  if you do, you'll regret it!!!  There's not enough words to express how I feel about this place!!!!!"
bad,"Concentrix is a good company but UHC has poor attitude. You can do your role as a good agent and bring in as many 100s and satisfy your members. However they will take you for granted when it comes to decision making over your performance and the member behavior. I wouldn't work here in the future and neither will I recommend when your performance is not recognized. "
bad,just a very bad place to work caused me depression would not recommend managers dont care and dont help if you need it with a complaint just leave you to take the abuse.
bad,"What a bunch of clueless folks (agents, management, HR, recruiting, operations) Gezzz Christ, this place freaked out trying to pass audits LOL. As it is said, ""Garbage in, Garbage out"". Why is this site, hiring losers, drug users, alcoholics, ex cons and wonder why they cannot keep people or retain talent. 1 HR person manages the whole site and guess what "" She's not even a certified HR professional"", that should indicate how seriously this organization takes ""professionalism""."
bad,"Trabalhei no local como Analista e é simplesmente um desrespeito ao ser humano trabalhar naquele local, salário baixíssimo para uma carga horária tão puxada, vc simplesmente é condenada a viver na escravidão pois eles implantam em sua cabeça que ""Emprego está difícil"", a cultura que a empresa prega é linda mas os líderes e gerentes operacionais não seguem nada que a empresa prega, dificultando o trabalho das pessoas. Não existe relação de parceria na empresa nem empresabilidade. Se vc presa por sua saúde mental não entre na empresa."
bad,They company y doesn't appreciate their employeee company dosen't appear too care that you advance always takes almost months too get commission from what you sold
bad,Very stressful job. It's very lop sided and favoritism orientated. No real advancement with pay or management. Needs better structure and clarity with rules and authority
bad,"Not at all a good place to work. This place treats you like garbage. If the weather is bad, they EXPECT you to show up for work regardless of safety concerns. They act like this is the most important job in the world. As a matter of fact, they are very arrogant about the job. They don't pay well at all. Also forget about being sick, you are not allowed to be sick or they dock attendance points. If you book vacation out of town, you are expected to show up for work midway through your vacation time because it wasn't approved properly. They treat you like a number, not like a human being. The management act like children and you have to sign a contract stating that you are available 24/7 for poor wages. DO NOT WORK HERE. It will be a detriment to your health."
bad,in this job there were many different occasions which have proven that the management are out cover their own backs and make their own targets in order to receive commission bonus in this job i was not  treated as a colleague or a staff member but as a statistic although there are some lovely and friendly people that you will meet in this job
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Initially a fun place to work but not towards the end.  The leadership was poor and didn't to much to develop employees.  The culture wasn't supportive and wasn't family friendly.
bad,"Everything was a challenge except the one mentioned above. This company doesn't want you to handle your calls in your own. They had this pattern which you are required to follow like or else client will call you out. They don't give headsets. Headsets are attached to work stations which is very unhygienic given that you change stations every day. You even have to bring your own foam because headsets don't have. Using the bery old version of avaya. Oh and they also won't allow you to resign. They rather make you be AWOL, so it will reflect on you rather than them. I only work here for 4 mos because their UP technohub site is very stressful. Ugly management, ugly tools, ugly pay."
bad,"I have been working for Concentrix for almost a year now, and it has personally been the worst year of my life.  Management in this company is appalling, my manager was abusive and cruel and spoke to me with contempt like he was better than everyone else. When you want time off for a holiday? Best of luck! I had to work from 9:30am- 8:00pm on Christmas Day!! Your manager won’t even bother try and put holiday requests through for you but your gaurenteed managers will have they’re holidays off. The place is old and run down and cold. You get 1 half an hour lunch break and 2 15 minute breaks, that is what I had on my 10 hour shift. The vending machines are old and everything is overpriced. You can barely live on they’re terrible salary and advisors joke in work about how we are the worst paid call centre in Dublin!! Don’t forget all the HORRIBLE customers you have to deal with everyday from BT and if you need help in there, best of luck finding a manager or mentor who will help because they’re all lazy pricks. When I spoke to my manager about my mental Health issues nothing was done and in the end that’s why I left this job. My manager was a mean man that left the company and ended up coming back because they didn’t want him in Concentrix in Santry ( Al’s toy barn eh)?"
bad,"It’s not surprise that this company was bought out. It was probably the worst company I’ve ever worked for. They won’t let you take bathroom breaks without explanation, they doc points off your quality score for even the smallest of things, they are not understanding of other life commitments and priorities and make promises to their employees they can’t keep and no one is consistent you’ll be told one thing by one person and told a completely different thing by a different one."
bad,Managers wanted to micromanage and criticize employee time spent on each phone call with client regardless of what matter was at hand while they either listened to music or watched a mini portable TV throughout the entire shift. Unacceptable.
bad,I don't like selling people things they do not want. It was mandatory to basically harass the customer about services. I don't want to do that to anyone.
bad,"Worked here for little over a year. Management has zero transparency. They do not care AT ALL about work/life balance. They play favorites. Management will let their friends work whatever hours changing their schedules daily, but tell you that no accommodations can be made for anyone when you ask for a schedule change. There are no shift bids or anything like that. What you get assigned is that and that’s it. Also, the schedules change constantly and you will never get 2 days off in a row. Had sever instances where the schedule changed on my day off causing no shows and or late arrivals. They do not notify you of these changes and you cannot check your schedule unless you are on the clock at the facility "
bad,they could not get anything right i would not work for this plac ever again they do not care what happens to anyone but higher up person manger who did not know anything.
bad,"So many people work there. If you want to book a day off you have to make sure you do it as much ahead of time as possible because if too many people have it off they wont give it to you. Managers were inappropriate, and nothing was done about it when people came forward. They treated the agents like children compared to the managers."
bad,They are all about numbers they don’t care much about their employees it’s a numbers game with everyone and how they can make a bigger profit paying as little as posdobke
bad,"everyday at work it would always be something new. the office was very clean and comfortable place to work, but it was too unorganized. i felt like i was in high school all over again"
bad,"This was for comcast business and residential, technical support and upsales. "
bad,"Management was poor and lacked professionalism. Your hours will change so don’t be surprised. Big favoritism in the government account. You’re better off elsewhere. Oh and not to mention certain accounts will close leaving you jobless, so be mindful of that as well."
bad,"this is a great place to get experience in a call center if you have never worked one but other then that i could not make this a career "
bad,"Pay is so low for the abuse you put up with! You only have 2 weeks training and are chucked into the deep end knowing the bare minimum, there is no one around to help and you have to deal with the issues on your own. The hours they give you are rubbish. Like 4 9 hour days and one 4 hour day. The 9 hour days are the worst. They need to start training employees properly as no one has a clue and Vodafone customers can tell! They also need to increase the wage and then they wouldn’t have such a high turn over."
bad,"This company clearly showed favoritism. Schedule changes were not fair or consistent. I worked there for six months with only missing a few days and my metrics were high, yet I was never offered an earlier shift. Where as others of the same color who had eleven plus absences and low metrics were offered earlier shifts. The bathrooms and work areas were filthy. We didn't have assigned seating so I always had to sanitize and clean every station when I couldn't find the same spot. They took away the help desk for escalations, so when you had an escalation you had to put it in the chat and wait 15 to 25 minutes while keeping your customer on hold. Then a smead would come to your desk and wear your headphone while they took the call. Then I would have to sanitize everything again and my metrics for hold time were never adjusted for this change. The Smeads were complaining that that their surveys and metrics suffered due to taking escalation calls (which is their jobs). So now we suffer the consequences. Terrible management and training. I worked there for six months and never heard any of my phone calls or had a constructive coaching but I had to ""acknowledge"" that I had a coaching by the Team Leaders perspective of how the call went. There was very little encouragement, instead threats and write ups for petty things. There is a huge turnover due to lack of training and low pay."
bad,"This is not a place where you want to be for over 6 months. Sure the pay is good, the commission is nice, but management is really not where it should be."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Employees are just a number at Concentrix.  There are no real rewards for employees nor tools for their professional development.  Employees have to do their own development outside of work.
bad,"It was great when it started. The pay was low but the environment was fun. Since the original people left it has become a place for drug addicts and crooked managers who all seem to have an attitude of use you then lose you. "
bad,I worked early morning shift.I learned a lot about how important healthcare was to us.Management was horrible the couldn't keep up with time off days.Hardest part of this job was to keep if very professional when he supervisors are condescending I met great people theer.
bad,"Non-supportive and poor management, "
bad,"I've had many friends work for the company so I joined onto a new project..... everyday since training has finished the ""systems"" keep crashing and they send us home...... not once have I seen the 40 hours and they still have yet to resolve the system issues and will not allow you to switch programs even if their are spots open...... I've spoken to hr and everything never a change."
bad,You had the floor supports messing with the employees it was very unprofessional you didn't get overtime and when you did worked overtime they didn't  pay you for the over time and they fired you for nothing
bad,"this place is toxic and demoralizing.  so called TL & TSS are suppose to help with customers calls and issues - they are too busy on their cells and running around loudly talking.  "
bad,"the latest advertisement is false.  "
bad,"I applied for a Customer service but then again, during training, I and my batch mates found out that there's more job to do but the pay is not really reasonable so I quit."
bad,"They sent out bulk emails telling people that their jobs were over on December 1, 2018. My insurance started on November 6, 2018 and they continued to charge for it, my job was over on December 1, 2018."
bad,"i would not recommend you coming here for long if you do decide to work here do not plan on staying too long, unless call center is your thing you will have to suffer"
bad,"this is one of those typical places to get a job quickly n then move on as quickly as possible. they didn't teach me anything new when it came to my sales role position, management didn't up train or train at all. that is the hardest part about the job, to those who never held a sales job over the phone they get no training so there bond to fail or quiet."
bad,"Every two weeks my checks was messed up , missing hours , missing money it was ALWAYS something! And I wasn’t the only one with that issue."
bad,"This job has very little training, if you ask for more training they promise it but never follow through. "
bad,"Misleading recruitment  drive, asking for helpline staff, really cold-callers.    Ridiculous escalating targets, and a load of pumped up egos performing for their peers,   Management throwing up buzzwords at a rate of knots whilst chatting to mates, whilst colleagues struggle.  mate driven culture."
bad,"When I started this job I had just given birth and literally transitioned from a homeless shelter. For me I was a little desperate after having been laid off after 7yrs working for the state and losing everything I owned. So I will say Concentrix was great while I got back on my feet. However, the company itself was horrible. Unorganized, horrible management, terrible pay. The Team Leaders are usually less knowledgeable than you and from my understanding are so stressed from the pressure put on them to get results from their team that they lack skills or time for building morale for the people they manage. "
bad,Management Sucks and Company Is Unorganized Not Very Good benefits Too many changes and employees are unaware until the last moment THE ABSOLUT MOST WORST JOB i have ever had
bad,"Lavorato circa due mesi per HP Enterprise, gestita come un banale e cialtronissimo callcenter, si bada solo alla quantita dei casi lavorati (che non equivale a casi risolti) non si entra nel merito della complessita dei casi, non a caso si preferisce tenere operatori con competenze informatiche pressoche' nulle al posto di lavoratori con background IT piu che ventennale!"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"This is not the best place to work for, very political environment, co-works do not respect your space, the hr department is an absolute joke compared to other places"
bad,I worked at Convergy's for 6 months. It was very stressful. The equipment is substandard. It is a call center and some of the headsets were held together with tape. Management was not sympathetic to employees needs at all. Pay is definitely not worth what you put up with. Company overall is just a terrible place to work.  The only good thing about the job is the schedule. The hours are pretty flexible.
bad,Managments sucks sleeping employees changing times fruad cell phone floor brush under rug dress code were anything rollers house coats this i no been there long time  all eyes security sucks when new cliet comes visit the place get clean up chicken dinners on floor just do what u want do there trainning sucks bad i hate it there looking daily
bad,I was in bbwc tier 1 a top seller got fired because of poor training allowed me to make same mistake since day I started an got fired because of it the management terrible if u don’t sleep with no1 don’t expect to be treated fairly an the favoritism was at an all time high terrible place to work I always made bonus but they try to keep your bonus for ha if a customer rate u bad n u did nothing wrong they keep your money which is actually illegal wouldn’t recommend to no1
bad,"The company has a revolving door policy to where they hire more "
bad,They tells incomplete infro u can be on time and don't miss any days but you can't sell they terminate you n do give u a chance in A Bay !!! Don't work here
bad,"Terrible place to work. Don't be fooled by the full-time hours, unless you are VERY desperate don't work here. You WILL hate your life and question your existence."
bad,"It is ghetto fabulous place w/cut-throat tactics to fire people who don't conform to ""brown-nosing"" management. Number of  calls versus great service."
bad,I was working for the contractor At&t. It was one of the most STRESSFUL jobs I have EVER had. The policies are ridiculous and they fired me without proof or cause. Right to work state
bad,Revolving door. Policies are designed for high attrition rates. I believe this strategy is to keep employees from establishing stability and benefits because the company does not want to pay.
bad,not for me did not like enviroment no parking  dirty not clean loud people not enough pay to many ridiculous rules lunch to short to much playing aroung not pro
bad,"Concentrix is not a place anybody would want to work if they are looking for an employer that actually cares for their employees. The management staff is exceptionally poor. There is no leadership, no recognition of hard work. They do not care about the employees they have that make the company succeed. They are not willing to work with you if you have any exceptional circumstances, i.e. family or life outside of making them money. The management shows favoritism constantly. The building itself is riddled with bedbugs and though acknowledged by management there is a problem, do NOT do anything to fix the infestation issue. There is no consistency with management, procedures, company goals, or schedules. The schedule changes every 2 months, and though its said that its based off performance, it's much more based off what manager you are buddy buddy with. This is a terrible place to work."
bad,"Worked there as a so called fraud advisor for Action Fraud.  Would be a great role if they had competent people in charge.  They treat their staff like children.  They lose the staff that are actually good at their jobs due to bad management.  Met some great people there.   Management  couldn't run a bath never mind a campaign.  It's an easy job with interesting calls that is made unnecessarily stressful by the unqualified morons they have running the place , Laughable."
bad,"Convergys has fraud down to a T.  If done correctly, and you follow the wording exactly, you cannot be arrested.  However, you will quickly see that what you are told to do is very dishonest."
bad,"unprofessional environment. lack of job security. micro management is the worst . Everyday when I went to work I felt stress it felt like I was working in Prison. I was told when to have lunch. when to use the rest room, when to leave it was the worst experience."
bad,"It was the worst job of my life, we got minimum salary with litteraly no advantages, no bonus, no discount on microsoft products, and people ask us to do more and more for nothing, my manager didnt liked me so she just harassed me when people was doing litteraly nothing and it was normal because manager liked them"
bad,The company did not fallow their policies all together. They cut paychecks and accuse people of things they were not even associated with. This is a horrible company to be employed for.
bad,"Management is absolutely horrid. You don't get benefits until the 91st day of employment. Management treats you like you are a 5 year old. No one knows answers to anything. You try talking to HR and they refuse to talk to you about any situations going on. People do drugs out in the parking lot and actively admit to it in front of everyone and no one does anything. The job is so easy that a monkey can do it, but management makes it almost impossible. Rules contradict one another because they have systems that aren't updated. They still use JAVA! I would not recommend this job to anyone that has values and cares about their job. Breaks are pointless. They have vending machines that rarely ever work and everything except Burger King is too far away to go to for a 30 min lunch break. This job is not worth anything unless you are a bum that wants to do drugs and have a job."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Rather work at a landfill I'd put up with less garbage. Managers are stats driven know nothing about the job though they pretend they do after 5 months I knew more than all the managers combined and lead advisors just by checking the website and the intranet on policies. Customers always angry managers don't want to speak to them to busy complimenting each other and pretending they are busy. The final nail in the coffin is they arn't giving me a reference. Don't work here 50% of people are gone within 3 months you have been warned.
bad,"this was a good experience but had no future, opportunities for advancement were there but only for limited contract positions, nothing permanent was available in this setting"
bad,That place is SO unprofessional! It's filthy and everyone that works there knows that they have bed bugs! Wish they were harder on the employees about professionalism! They pretty much train you and let you do. Whatever you want to! The place has no real management!
bad,n/a too many pets and too many if I don't like you get a hard time. Blak Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah What else id\s there really to say. It is not what you think going in that is for sure
bad,Very poor company to work for!!!!!!  I would not recommend this company to anyone whatsoever because it was very unprofessional and the staff was rude and did not want to help in training!!
bad,"Company has no Ethics. Terrible place to work. Pay cuts if your contract leaves. This is not a career like they claim. I can bet all the good posts are by their recruiting department. "
bad,"This Company is so unorganized, the management is unprofessional, the computers neverwork, you can never login, Its just a ghetto call center. i would never recommend this place to anyone"
bad,This company did not care much about their employees. The hiring and firing was a revolving door. They constantly changed policies on you.  They didn't care much about the companies they were representing (in my opinion)
bad,"I don't know how this place could get any kind of good review. Really, is this for real guys? I've been working there now in the Cisco contract for Concentrix for over a year and I have been bullied, disrespected, and put up with some serious unprofessionalism. They don't reward good work or motivate you at all. They don't appreciate that you put in effort or go the extra mile, in fact you will basically go unnoticed like a factory slave until you make any kind of slip up then they will degrade and embarrass you on the floor in front of everyone (this is no exaggeration- go on see for yourself, they don't care)."
bad,"Call Center Customer Service Representative. "
bad,Horrible leadership ! This company doesn't care if you are in hospital dying. And do not acknowledge Dr. Note for absence. BEWARE!! don't be another victim of the poor leadership with this company.
bad,"So I signed a contract last week for a new job with this Fortune 500 company, commencing this Monday. "
bad,"I was hired as a work at home employee. We were contracted to eBay to reach out to members to let them know of any changes and updates to their policies. This included calling 300 people a day and we only spoke to around 15. We had to breaks and even if we met our quota their bonus was very minuscule. They also ran out of billable hours, so they would make people log off and be unpaid."
bad,There were fights between employees and managers a daily. the hours for the pay were not great. the benefits re not very good and people steal your food in the break room.
bad,"The company doesn't care about their workers.  Instead of paying the workers more and hire better people they hire a lot of people at lower wages.  The environment is terrible because of the type of people they hire.  "
bad,Convergys is a ok place to work. They do offer benifits but there systems are not up to date so half the time you are working on getting your computer and programs to work
bad,"PROS"
bad,"I worked in the recruiting department. They are basically people processors. High turn over all around. Not a try recruiting role, basically they hire anyone who is not a mess."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"It was very hard working here. There were no advancements. Very over crowded, everyone is in everyones ear you can hear the person or persons all around you conversations."
bad,"This job crushes your soul. working on the phones is bad enough, but the management and the support staff do not help, support, or lead you. Instead they back stab you, set you up for failure, and they wait for you to fail so they can cycle in new people like a revolving door. Stay away from this company."
bad,"Good for a homeless person warm, dry in winter your at work more than not so could be seen as suitable shelter with pay!!"
bad,"This is one of the worst jobs I've EVER had. The bathrooms were always disgusting, the workers were lazy and unprofessional, the systems ALWAYS crashed during training, we were thrown onto the call floor with little knowledge on what to do, the trainer didn't know how to train and was gone to meetings a lot, during training everyday we spent about 1 hour-2 hours fixing the computers and the systems. I was driving 30-45 minutes for 10.50 an hour. NOT WORTH IT!"
bad,The company is ran by too many people who don't know what they are doing..There is no room for growth and everyone is for themselves..The pay is horrible and no benefits...Very stressful place to work...
bad,It was a very fast paced environment. I was able to learn about trouble shooting cellphones and how to give credit to customers that were having issues with their accounts
bad,"place is a complete melt full of egotistical power hungry managers like a massive playground, would no recommend to anyone who is of good mental capacity"
bad,By far one of the worst jobs that I ever had. Labeling this place a sweatshop is an understatement. Long hours with low pay and no job security. You'll be better off in Fast food.
bad,"Overall not happy with the company and the unprofessionalism. There have been several operation managers, you have to remind the company to pay out your raises or you just wouldn't get any. The environment is horrible overall. It a big revolving door they will use you in every area and you will not be compensated for it."
bad,Not a good place to work.  No advancement.  Management is horrible.  Job is stressful.  No acknowledgement for people who do a good job. People who know people move up.
bad,Not the best experience lack of support u stable high school environment lack of leadership no room to advance but doesn’t not require to complex processing
bad,"On a daily basis we are required to manage teams performance, recruit new staff, conduct disciplinary/investigations, manage LTS staff, cover quality and much more"
bad,"The only good thing about this job is the hours and the fact you have the weekends off unless you want overtime on Saturdays which is good I guess.."
bad,"How they can get away with not paying you ur wages is illegal forget about bonuses aswell this happens to everyone there take a job st ur own risk, my only regret is not taking the company to a tribunal"
bad,"Payroll department never had my check right; then I would have to wait next paycheck to correct what they did wrong. Not to mention the paycheck right before Christmas was completely wrong. Ruined!! Then we were all laid off before the summer because we lost our contract. I would never ever dream of coming back here. GOOD RIDDENS. Oh and management was a disgrace. Oh, but we were offered positions in another department; which I later found out they laid everyone off over there too! This company is a joke."
bad,"Convergys is by far the worst place I have worked, they don't care about the staff and pressure you too much to hit your stats constantly. Disgusting management with no support whatsoever and treat you like children. Get giving points for being late or being off unwell and have no sympathy for people who suffer with anxiety. Can never ever get time off no matter how far in advance you request it and people who manage shifts have their favourites who are always put on early shifts and no weekends. The day I leave here will be the best day of my life"
bad,I would work fast food before ever returning to this place. I tried making this a career but it was a nightmare. From fights to stealing this place could never be ANYONES career..
bad,"Office lacks professionalism, doesn't care about employees, managers take away employee bonus and also take away client bonus."
bad,"Poor management, no room for career advancement. Management need training on peoples skills, no regard for your well-being. Working Help desk is challenging but salary very very low."
bad,"This job truly made me feel unappreciated as an employee. They treated me with little respect. My department was held to standards that were impossible to reach, no matter how hard we worked."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Working at convergys was really really stressful. The company doesn’t give you a helpful training. Once you are “trained” they throw you to the wolves to take phone calls and for the position they expected you to type and solve and issue while the customer is complaining at you and screaming and offering you. This company doesn’t value the employees. It’s all about the customers!!!!
bad,This was a temporary job. I did not stay very long. It is like most call center jobs where work is outsourced. Micromanaged and tiresome. I would recommend this job if you really need one.
bad,"can't post how I really feel"
bad,Ambiente de trabalho mau pessoal conas e não gostam de ser metidos no lugar..por mim não presta ambiente sujo 💩
bad,"No words to discribe how terrible this place is to work for. "
bad,"Call center classico"
bad,"Very disorganized, poor communication and management. Also did not know it was a contracted job! Didnt find out until one manager was fired and another came in and she did nothing more then the previous manager."
bad,Management is unprofessional om is unprofessional very bad environment to work in a lot of drama for a lot of yelling on the floor I'm very strict on your performance and sales not enough time teaching sales to agents who have never sold.
bad,Management had their favorites and only they would advance. If you ever had a complaint all the higher ups were friends so nothing ever happened be you’d have to live with the mistreatment.
bad,"This place is terrible! Management is terrible for Anthem side. Team Leaders are lazy and dont know answers when you ask for help. They want you to work overtime but dont show appreciation.  Oh and they give you rubber ducks when you do something positive! Why do adults need rubber ducks?! Dont work here they say they are ""family friendly"" however when you need time off for your children they throw a fit and make you feel guilty for taking the time off. Management and Team Leaders are what make this place terrible! Call volume is high so your always on calls but thats the point of a call center. They want you to have empathy with members however they dont show employees empathy! People who work there are nice and not really an issue however those who have worked there for a long time have those ""high school cliques"" so they tend to be snotty and rude! But for the most part all representatives are nice and understand how stressful the job is! They dont allow cell phones on the floor however if your in one of those ""cliques"" and a supervisor sees you they wont tell you anything. So if your cool with certain team leaders they allow you to get away with things that others cant. This place is full of drama! And you cant advance at this place, There is no room and if you are a good candidate for a better placement it comes down to who they like more. So to better say "" its not what you know, its who you know""! They will look for any excuse to let you go! Be careful with these people! There is usually no parking ever if you go in after 7am! Not to mention the bathrooms are always dirty"
bad,"Worst place to work at. Started off as a billing agent for Directv, up trained to special projects without a pay raise.  Trainers expected you to know everything after 1 month of training. No floor support."
bad,"this is by far the worst company i have ever worked for!! the hours are really bad! you sit in training for 2 weeks playing stop the bus! then when your brought up on to the main floor with no knowledge on how the systems work and expected to just do your job! Management are awful too, they get treated different to (standard) worker! dress code constantly changes, Hr are phonies they say theyll help but never do just lie to you! "
bad,"this is a calling center that is suppose to support at&t wireless.  after 5 minutes of training, you're expected to sound like an expert representative.  their moto is 'fake it until you make it"".  most customers wait in the calling que for long periods of time.  so by the time they reach you, they are not happy and tend to voice their disdain out on you. on top of that, you are pushing sales and more sales."
bad,"glued to your seat 24/7"
bad,"Thought this was a good place to work since they hired me for my bilingual Spanish skills, but it turned out to be a lousy place because of the lack of leadership."
bad,"When I interviewed with Concentrix, I was advised I would be working under General Motors ""golden standards"" rule and ""customer's for life"" motto.  It was always impossible to live up to this standard because Concentrix hires just anyone off the street that could care less about the customer.  I was so disappointed my colleagues didn't care about the customer.  Yes, there were rude customers occasionally, but most of the customers were great to work with.  I saw these people.  My colleagues saw the rude customers only.  Maven has great potential to grow.  Concentrix just needs to find employees that can get past the growing pains, and help the program to grow and succeed.  I'm disappointed because I'm a people person. I loved talking to the customers, even the rude ones.  Most of the rude customers just wanted to vent because they felt their voices were not being heard.  If you chose to work for Concentrix/Maven, give the customers a chance. HR, hire manages that LEAD, not sit behind a desk all day.  Management take calls from customers.  See what their needs are, and help them and Maven grow moving forward."
bad,"Para quem não tem vida pessoal, precisa de uns trocos ao fim do mês para pagar umas contas e ignore ser tratado como escravo, esta é a empresa ideal."
bad,"I would recommend this place to a stray dog or cat, unfortunately my original post couldn’t be posted, stay away $14.25 is not worth this type of stress"
bad,"Not a place I would ever want to work again.  Not my type of culture, especially in Florida.  Management needs to work on their people skills!  I'm used to working with adults and not with adults who act like children."
bad,The faster the hire you the faster they fire you as well you'll get a very little time to prove your potential some of the trainers are so evil if they don't like you they'll make sure you loose your job.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I hate this company, its not good, I didnt like it, impossible standards, bad contests, annoying boss, bosses that wouldnt help, bad schedule, little help"
bad,"Went there for a job as CSR in Social Media. As the work itself is pretty okay (take complaining customers for granted) there is no real way of advancing. It is very corrupt and promotions are based on the country you represent rather than your skills. If there are some people of one language in 1 job (like team managers) you can forget to advance into management if you happen to be one of the languages already represented. People even got promoted for a rolenas expert in a product this person was not even trained in! Only because this person’s country was no longer represented above agent status."
bad,"Co-workers are nice but management is not. They take forever to fix technical issues, do not respect their employees, filled with confusion and lies, long hours, management does not support, scheduling sucks and performance is based on customer surveys which is completely random. They say something but act in a completely different direction. Work if absolute necessary, Otherwise housekeeping is a much more better job than working here. FYI they post $16.70 an hour but pay $ 15 an hour."
bad,Was not a great place to work when I was there 10 years ago.  Management was inexperienced and showed favoritism.  Management may have changed since then so it has most likely improved.
bad,"Laughable Poor Salary for the work you complete."
bad,This has got to be the worse place I’ve ever worked for. Management is garbage and the pay sucks as well. Not only that but the scheduling system absolutely horrible they give you a schedule and tell you they’ll work with your school schedule and don’t follow through
bad,"If you like to work for free, go ahead. Otherwise, beware because they are not paying the full salary to the employees. Every payday is a new fight against the company."
bad,Depending on your program Concentrix is awful. If you need something figured out its best to go to human resources yourself. They say they have an open door policy but the management team doesn't really take your concerns into consideration. The desks are short and there is no mobility if you get uncomfortable. The computers you work with are constantly having issues.
bad,This is a bad company to work for and that is no lie. they have different agendas on how they operate. Good contract companies they have to work with.
bad,it was like try to go to the doctors office you did not want to go but you had to. The  bosses did not tell you a lot of what was going on or if there was any changed
bad,"Convergys is not a business ethic like place to work. The treatment towards staff and employees is less than acceptable. No work advancement in a timely manner, no recognition of employees who do well or exceed goals, and the building itself is unsanitary. I would not recommend working here."
bad,"I have worked in many different job lines and at several different call centers and I have to say this is by far THE worst place I have ever worked. "
bad,This place is not a workplace. They basically use you as a slave don’t pay you on time or correctly wrongfully terminated you when your on a leave of absence for medical reasons. Never answers there phones when you have an issue with pay or with anything to do with your pay. Does not fix your pay until six days later. Does not handle internal problems in a timely manner. Does not efficiently work with there employees to accommodate for anything. Doesn’t provide your schedule correctly either. Would never recommend working here in a million years.
bad,This company is like a revolving door. The turn over rate us extremely high. U have to be a tuff cookie if u plan on sticking around. One sec you're hitting your targets the nextyoure fired for not enuff sales.
bad,this place will treat you like another cog in the system. the pay is bad and the job is hard and stressful. the turn over is like 80% and you get fired at the drop of the hat. I was not one of the people that was fired but my mother was wrongly terminated from convergys and I was forced to keep working there for 2 years to support her after they terminated her
bad,"There is good reason for the high turnover rate.  No accountability for management who were very eager to throw their teams under the bus. This company has ZERO regard for its employees - they are not humans, but warm bodies to throw in a filthy call center.  I have a disability and all of my formal paperwork for reasonable accommodations were magically lost, and they attempted to fire me over my legally protected disability.  The benefits are a joke and you can never use your paid time off, so there is no point.  Don't buy anything they tell you about upward mobility.  Also, bedbug and lice infestations are common, and arbitrary procedures are invented every single hour.  You would be better off working for a pimp, because at least you expect what you get.  Pretty much all employees at some point are ""forced to quit.""  Save yourself the drama."
bad,They only look out for the favorites of the company no one else. Poor management styl s and people.  Worked there twice will never work there again. 😡
bad,"Very unprofessional, supervisor verbally abused employee and nothing was done about it. Everyone smells like drugs, even the managers. No one is professional, but expect the training employees to be."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

bad,"Convergys was trash , the management was very unprofessional in every aspect of the company , they didnt have benefit , none of the projects that came stayed long because of the management"
bad,"Three weeks of training, where you learn nothing about the job. They just throw you into live calls, and except you to know what you're doing. Break area is small and has little variety. You can sleep through the three weeks of training and do just as good at taking calls."
bad,This is like every other contract work with the exception of being an employee of a company who receives contracts.  You are held to a higher standard than the employees of the contract company and paid a fraction of what they make.  Employee morale is low because this salary schism is very well known.
bad,This is one of the worst jobs I have ever had. Supervisors were like children; we had to depend solely on our coworkers for advice and help with customer interactions.
bad,"Unless you are a part of the ""clique"", don't  even think you will move up or move on. The bonuses they promised never happened, and the so called discounts were bogus. They did NOT report all of the employee's earnings to the State."
bad,Ik voelde me niet gewaardeerd en moest zelfs betalen voor de koffie. Je bent gewoon een nummer dat geld voor ze verdient meer niet.
bad,"The job was mentally grueling. The site manager created an extremely toxic culture that was reminiscent of high school popularity that unfortunately pervaded every rank and title beginning with him. The other employees from the actual client were on the other hand very helpful & respectful, and didn’t demean or belittle you. Save yourself the time and effort. Find a job that who’ll at least have supervisors that will treat you with respect"
bad,The manager keeps an attitude and avoids helping you. The TL's are very pushy all they care about is the agents making the sales rate each day. Never do they acknowledge your work
bad,Convergys is either closing down or has since closed. The employees were always under pressure to sell sell sell. Management waited long periods of time before coaching you. So fixing issues was not feasible.
bad,"A lot of favouritism and gossiping. Overloaded with work with pathetic pay. Management was horrendous. IT systems were horrendous. The IT team were awful, they never solved any of my IT issues that I raised. In my current job the IT team are like a breath of fresh air. I would not recommend to anybody to work for this company. Beyond disgraceful. So glad I left and I'm so happy where I work now. Concentrix HR team are miserable and not approachable."
bad,"They train you quite well.  The environment is very fast paced and stressful.  You have inbound and outbound calls depending on what department you are in.  The managers couldn't really care if something of an emergency is going on with you,  unless you collapse and aren't breathing, even then it seems they can't be bothered."
bad,One of the worst places to work for.  Raises are non existent after being there for a year.  Next to impossible to get promoted unless your good friends with management.
bad,"Ghetto,Dull full of theives. when i worked there in 2015 people were leaving work while still on the clock not coming back for hours.Would log you out of your station and steal your headphones and seat smh just a travesty"
bad,This job was ratchet and unprofessional wouldn’t recommend this company to anyone. I really hated the job. It was full of drama. Not in a million of years.
bad,"It's super unprofessional. the workers aren't there to work, they are there to gossip. They are strict but don't even try to help, they don't work with you when you need days off. its a horrible company"
bad,they made sure i had 3 write ups before my probation period was up because i was about to have a baby even though i was one of the top salespeople on the team. they have such a high turnover rate that they dont care who they fire.
bad,It was good until it wasnt. When I started I started on the phones then quickly transfered to Chat. I was in Chat for a year and then they made the bone head choice to gice the contract to another company without really doing their homework.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,they cheated employees out of the paychecks with resulted in a lawsuit. Ghetto and super unprofessional. Management didn't know what to do. no room  for  growth
bad,Personally I felt that it was a joke to work there. Many employees would steal and be rude to others. It was hard to make customers happy when having to lie about a product and tell them they were getting more when they were getting less. I had to help with people skills and improvement with customer relations.
bad,"No room for advancement, based on favoritism and who you know. Constant changing of schedule without notification. Management is bad, they come from other contracts untrained, unable or  unwilling to help. Blame you for issues with call stats, threaten your job based on the class of people you are in. Unfair treatment. Do not work here. You are better off working in fast food or in a chain store."
bad,"the environment is not a good environment to work in."
bad,"Working at a company that got worse instead of better, sums up Concentrix. Wanna get passed over for promotions because of extreme favoritism? Work here! Wanna max out after 2 pay raises? Work here!"
bad,I do not recommend working for this company. Upper management is not structured nor competent to provide adequet resources for their managers and employees.
bad,"strssful enviroment,low pay, very little pay increases,poor benefits,very poor work enviroment,facilities are poor and outdated,company does not spend money on facilities."
bad,The training was very good and our trainer was a good trainer and the group I was in class was good. My manger was very rude and others rachet. and bad place.
bad,"dont work there ever they do not pay you your worth they expect you to do 10 thousands job plus yours and expect the results, no training not managment mentoring sorry place to work... printers dont work, you have to have your own paper for your deparment, no toliet paper or cleaning supplies its a dump.."
bad,"Concentrix is a 3rd party vendor that only looked at the numbers.  No room for promotion, even though it was promised at interview.  Company quickly looked to outsource"
bad,Be flexible to work different hours and have lunch set up later each day. Make sure you laugh and agree with Site Director and Supervisors stale jokes help you get special shifts and longer breaks
bad,I was a recent Grad probably the only grad that worked there. Place is filled with HS drop outs drama fights it’s highschool the hours are done different to where you never have the same schedule just sucks
bad,to me I didn't like working here because they have no control over what happens on the phones and they let you go for the worst reasons and the people their has no respect for others
bad,This company is complete trash.  Don't ever get a job here unless you have some job making minimum wage and you have no other options.  Terrible benefits and terrible pay
bad,Convergys Middleton is absolutely rubbish. Great two weeks training programme but once your our on the floor they treat you like dirt. Your just a machine. Only get treated properly if you know somebody high up in there. Team leaders think they’re royalty when they all get paid the same as the advisors. Wouldn’t recommend the job at all. Failure of a company. Worked for many big names but Convergys was just a disgrace.
bad,"They don't care about their employees, only the bottom line on paper. They lose contracts left and right due to poor leadership and job security doesn't exist."
bad,"Hands down the worst company I have ever worked for due to the total negligence of the management here. My mental health went from bad to worse as a result of this job based on the poor pay (and not being paid correctly/on time), the customers verbally abusing you and being told by management to 'not take it personally' and having to just take it and most of all for being put under circumstances causing you having to take time off and being made to feel like an inconvenience to the company and being penalised for it rather than them taking the time to think of how they put someone in that position or trying to change the way they treat their staff. Repetitive job dealing with queries and completing processes you've mostly learned yourself or from other agents because of the abysmal and almost non-existent training. Being told you have to follow specific procedures and then being pulled up on not showing enough empathy towards customers when you follow them and promised progression routes that are less foreseeable than the rapture. Bonuses based on stats including customer reviews that affect you as an agent negatively when they review you amazingly and the company poorly. Very short breaks amongst 8 and a half hours of staring at a computer screen and systems that barely work and being penalised again for having the audacity to need to to go to the toilet or have any other break away from a screen for any longer than 2 seconds. Favouritism towards certain agents by Team Leaders who allow some people to get away with murder while punishing others for clocking on a minute late."
bad,I used to love my job and would love going to work! I have been here for 5 years and the #1 thing about this company that keeps me going is the people! My direct reports and peers!! Upper management (Director and above) could careless about its centers staff. It was not always this way and I miss the way it was. Training does nothing to support the main production staff and we are constantly having to retrain the staff after they come to the floor.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Convergys is constantly being sued by ex employees and the department of labor. This place is pre-designed burnout. Only the very worst can manage to find a career here. 99% of the management is inept.
bad,"mcdonalds is better to work at than here"
bad,Save yourself the bother don’t work here it’s an agency and they don’t care about the staff and management is a joke there is a revolving door for staff
bad,"They pay you when they want to with any amont they want to"
bad,"If you are looking for a company big on culture, moral vales and work-life balance, this is not the place. Lots of family members working together and if you are not apart of the crew - you will not last."
bad,"It’s like high school. Management have no idea what they are doing. They aren’t helpful. They clique up and make fun of co workers. No one seems to be on the same page. I have no idea how this call center is still open. No one dresses like they are at work, the environment makes you not want to be there."
bad,"Would not want any of my family members working there, pay is very low with what we go through. 9.00 an hour isn't enough to pay bills and the PTO builds up very very very slow. they don't want anyone taking PTO because its such a high turn over rate. on that note last to go in transition and if they do the company is luck enough if anyone stays even after Training. So In all Its a really sucky place to work."
bad,"I took on this low paid, menial, repetitive job 6 months ago despite having two university degrees due to the lack of opportunities in my area. I was told during the interview that there is ample opportunity for promotion within the company but I have since found this to be a lie. I have applied for several internal promotions the second they are announced and management don't even have the decency to reply to emails. Staff morale is abysmal. Commission is non existent if you're not working in pay as you go, yet you're constantly being pushed to pitch sales while never being paid for it (the job application states in bold capitals 'THIS IS NOT A SALES ROLE', which I have also found to be another lie). The pay as you go department are making 500-700 a month in commission despite taking half the number of calls we take in service. There's no job security what so ever and you're constantly threatened with HR meetings if you don't meet your stats or if you happen to take a day off sick. You're never praised for meeting your stats but you're berated on the days you don't. The system for calculating your stats is heavily weighted against you. One poor customer review can completely ruin your stats for the whole week even if you have 10 good ones. My training team have been dropping like flies since I started, people are walking out or getting sacked on the daily. Everyone is depressed and the management, HR department and most (not all) of the TL's don't care/provide very little support. Some TL's refuse to take managers calls. The canteen closes at 3:30 despite the building being"
bad,"Very bad policies for selling and support.  Produce offerings included 10 year technology , inproper maintenance, hardball customer handling, and lack of responsibility of management."
bad,"In the interview they tell you, you get 2 weeks training haha if you count playing childish games such as stop the bus and wolf for 2 whole weeks by a guy who couldnt handle being a call advisor,if you consider this  training well this maybe the job for you, no help or support constantly bullied by team leaders and advisors alike, they do not pay you correctly and when you leave you will not be paid correctly."
bad,"Where should I start. Firstly, only one paid break and that's the 15 minute break. You're not allowed to go for bathroom breaks only if you have a special arrangement with the HR. They scheduling is supposed to be monthly, however the constantly change during the month whenever they feel. They don't have room for advancement even though they say they do. They promise hire pay after a few months and they don't deliver with he promise. You get written up for being a minute late. You get written up for EVERYTHING. One of the managers is a ex convict  and they don't even care."
bad,"The site I worked at was not optimal. My manager often took personal days off. Employees under her would be written up if they took any personal time. Don't worry, that site is closing."
bad,"Método explorador, e não tenho mais nada a declarar sobre isso."
bad,I hated working here and this was before they really starting pushing sales. Most people I work with now came from converged and they said they push sales so hard that it's extremely stressful.
bad,No management structure. Very high chance of being disciplined. No secure. Mundane work. No sense of administration. Feels like it was setup yestaday. Only fellow colleagues make it worth it and the miney you get
bad,This job was very stressful. I have anxiety disorder and had a very difficult time working there. The pressure they put on me was unreal. Even though I left on good terms I will never go back.
bad,They had a lack to where they would put that they were flexible. this was not true. They had strict hours and were not willing to work around hard working people doing their best.
bad,"Concentrix just doesn’t know how to be a better company at all especially the healthcare department. You give someone a position as being an OM and they don’t know how to treat people, don’t know how to talk to people, are unfair rude and unprofessional. When most of the production floor leaves within a matter of months it’s a problem. Very unorganized, like a high school environment. Trainers don’t know how to train and I can at least say the supervisors know their jobs and are good at it but still some are unfair and have their favorites. Don’t think about ever going to HR because your business and what you discussed with them will get back on the floor so there is no open door policy. The morale on the floor is the pits there are no pot lucks, fun days, barely any prizes for hard work just pitiful. I don’t recommend this place and plus their call center competitors knock them out the box and with pay and bonuses."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"management are clueless and do not care a single bit about the employees, they'll do whatever they want but shout at employees for doing the same thing. No advancement opportunities even though they'll tell you in an interview theres always ways of moving up. Ask management for help whilst your on a call and you might as well ask a rock you're more likely to get an answer. Other agents are lovely but good luck finding even one person who likes their job. Here i learnt to stand up for myself as otherwise you'll get trampled on at every opportunity. Hours are garbage as it swaps between 8-4 and 12-8 so you'll either battle traffic in the morning and be knackered all day or not have any form of life outside of work. Pay is rubbish and commission is always wrong and low."
bad,"I have worked here for two months and don't know where to begin. The training is awful! there is no hands on training its  all theory , than thrown into the fire with out proper training than scored on calls . trainers and assistance on floor are miserable they get upset and frustrated with you for not knowing a job your were not trained on.  the place is  unclean  and disgusting! hotel seating , you need to arrive a hour early to find a desk and seat.  the chairs are all broken, the computers ,desks and carpets are gross. the washrooms make a gas station washroom look good.  the employees are all miserable and hate their jobs. the job is so repetitive lying to customers. the supervisors are all socially awkward giving you a stone face when you ask them a question. under paid and not worth the stress you are faced with between staff and customers. they have  incentives however you need to be there for years to get them.  you can  not go to the washroom for more than a minute, prison type atmosphere.  high turnover.  I got sick and anxiety knowing I had to wake up to go to this job. depressing !!!! Avoid at all costs!"
bad,"I worked here for 6 months, and hated it. training was fun but once you were out on the floor they didn't care about you. I had to miss some work for medical and they were not cooperative at all."
bad,Honestly the people is what keep you working there. No in the sense of working atmosphere but just people that you meet and the common ground you share with them. Some management understands if you are having personal problems and work with you so that you can keep working while others just don't care. They would be able to lower their attrition rate if they were to treat their employees better or even raising their pay. At least that would give them incentive to stay longer.
bad,I hated the work environment and how they pushed us to sell no matter what the customer was going through. All the company cares about is selling AT&T products
bad,will accomodate to school schedules /very stressful enviornment I do not recommend. However it is a good entry level job not something I would consider long term
bad,The culture seemed like it needed a huge professional uplifting.  Dress code is terrible and pay is terrible.  It was too ghetto for me. The people that work there are more interested in trying to drag you down than in doing their own jobs anyway.  Not worth it.  Go find a job that you really love and honors who you are.
bad,"worked there for 6 months they pushs the sales so hard, you have to offer on EVER call even if someone died or there canceling or the soldiers calling in because they are being sent over seas, the managers are bulls, i would advised to not work at this job"
bad,"Very Stressful not only because of the calls but the management as well. The purpose was to sell, sell, sell. It was never about the customer and assisting the customers, it was just about money. The building was always dirty"
bad,"Not paid lunches "
bad,"Hours are all up and down, management likes  to 'snip' if you ask questions. Not a place to work for. Hard to believe anyone has stayed for more than a month. Job itself is not bad, but it's everything else that makes it an undesirable place to work."
bad,Not an ideal place for anyone looking for a career or to be paid on time. If upstairs would solve issues instead of creating them it might work out in their favor
bad,For the period and time that I was employed at Convergys. I felt that building the staffs knowledge came secondary to just getting them on the call. Much of the work you were doing was learn on the fly.
bad,"Convergys  was  a stepping stone to help me get toa better place of success.  A typical day was good and bad some days but overall is was well.  The hardest part of the job was training but  I made it. The most enjoyable part was able to assist the members/customers. "
bad,"Getting paid the hours you work each pay period doesn't always happen. The management is the worst,the company has no organization. The building in which I worked has had bed bugs and not to mention the filthiest carpet ever seen. When the client comes to tell company,management puts on a great show! This is a modern day slave camp."
bad,"This place screams unprofessionalism. There is a lack of communication throughout the entire facility. You are treated as a number and are nothing more than a warm body in the chair. While in the interview/hiring process, I was offered a job and was not given any idea what I would be doing, just a start date. I have extensive experience in a financial setting and ended up thrown into a position where I was filling prescriptions because they clearly could care less about any background experience or even take a moment to glance at your resume to see what would be the best fit. All of which proves my point about the “warm bodies” in the chairs. I previously sat next to a woman that has worked for the company for 10 years and when one project ended they simply told her take a new position and have her pay cut drastically or get out. Right, because that’s the way to treat an employee loyal to your company for 10 years. They require their employees to provide a “Perfect Experience” but don’t provide them with the neccesary tools to do so. When asked if there is something that can be done to fix any certain issue, you are simply remind that you are nothing in the company and told to get used to it. Since it is a call center, you are required to use a headset, theirs are far outdated and hardly work along with the phones in general. You are required to pass an “extensive” background check and then they don’t allow you to have your cellular device of any kind on the floor, yet anyone in a leadership position is allowed to which makes absolutely no sense what so ever if the “client doesn’t"
bad,"I used to promote Convergys whenever I could because I was proud of the place I worked for. I gave so much to this company in the several years that I worked there. I was turned down continually for promotion and when I finally did get promotions, I was set up for failure. I appreciate the work experience that I did get, but other than experience, I intensely regret the time I gave to a thankless company."
bad,At the time I was working here we were doing enrollments for health insurance benefits. The pay was low and the training was short as well as I was older in the class with younger people.
bad,"Concentrix, or Minacs as it was known when I was there, was a place where you're treated like just another butt in the seat. The management is seeing a high turnover rate and is clueless about what to do to fix it, even though the answer is right in front of them. They promise advancement and high pay, and fail to deliver unless you're willing to work their always fluctuating schedules and late work hours. Only the tenured enjoy it, as they are the ones that get the best shifts."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"if you are home base you do not have any support from team members or supervisors you are left on your own, when applying for a job with them they leave you waiting for over 20 days days before they give you an answer of whether you are hired or not"
bad,not a freiendly place to work management is poor and no room for advancement. not a career that i want for my future. need something with stability and room for improvement
bad,"ghetto, lack of respect from employees. highschool-ish.people were always trying to pull each other down.aways rumors about others. Managers were pretty ok."
bad,Don’t work here this place will make you go crazy and if your looking to work with kids this is the job everyone acts like a child here even management
bad,"Atrocious atmosphere. Little to no helpful training. Continual disrespect and hostile work environment from management. No opportunity for advancement,"
bad,They don’t like to pay. No communication at all. Upper management very rude they need to learn how to treat their employees. They work you like a dog for low pay if they decide to pay you then when you decide not to come to work because you don’t work for free they want to fire you
bad,"Low pay. Because the pay is low, the expectations for professionalism is low. It got to the point where management feared physical retaliation. Managers were attacked my employees or had their property vandalized. It’s a BPO, so your job is to do the same quality of work for WAY less cost. It’s a contradiction."
bad,They made the job seem very easy and laid back during training weeks. I did not like the way they push you to sale. Yes selling is part of the job but being rude to your employee and having them lie to a person just to get a sale isn’t for me. I am Way to good of a person to lie to someone just to make ends meet.
bad,they hire you for temporary positions and don't even tell you they are temporary. then when the job is over only the top people stay or move to other projects. They don't communicate with you. they offer incentives by games such as gift cards and if you earn then they take forever to get them to you then they cheat you on how much you were suppose to get.
bad,This company claims they have fixed things when they took over Minacs. After getting a job interview and having them state they will call back in 24-48 hours they never bothered. Upon emailing the HR team as a follow up still no response. Don't bother with people like this as the pay is atrocious for the work you are expected to do.
bad,I would not recommend this place for employment . There is absolutely no room for growth unless you party with the management team. The comments that are made by management about the employees disgusted me
bad,From the training to the management they are all a joke! So unorganized and hard to get a definite awnser from anyone about future projects. Terrible terrible place will never recommend this to anyone! If your offered a job decline it.
bad,"Lots of temporary personnel or seasonal personnel.  Depending on whom you spoke with, upward mobility was available.  Job assignments were dependent upon incoming work which could be seasonal.  Hours were not flexible - you either worked shifts assigned but you were asked which shift you wanted to work."
bad,"This job can definitely help you get back on your feet if you have just recently lost your job. you shouldn't stay over a year, so keep looking for something new."
bad,"It was concerning to work here. Bugs, fights, armed guards... I wouldn’t recommend this as a place to work. It was laughable when the only people being appreciated at an organizational level was high up management that was rarely seen."
bad,"I worked here for 9 months and it was terrible."
bad,"nothing really good to say, working with customers on that level was challenging but i would get repramanded for taking my time talking to the customers to resolve the issue. they wanted your phone calls to last about 6 minutes and to me thats not enough time to really listen to the customer to find out what the issue was or what you can do to help"
bad,I wouldn’t work for this company they had very poor training the supervisors and the top people of the company was very unprofessional. I had to leave because I was handled in a very unprofessional manner
bad,"This company insisted on making copies of my SIN card and driver's license prior to interview or job offer."
bad,They never stoped lying to us from day one in recruiting to the last day of our contract where they let everyone go without notice. Do not trust the lies.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"strict , cut throat . does not have a consistent schedule, lack of training . needs a longer training program . needs better management . no structure"
bad,This place has health hazards such as bed bugs and is generally a negative environment to work in. The management hovers over you and you can't get anything done. They are not flexible with hours and threaten to terminate you if you have a life event.
bad,"Convergys was the worst company I have worked for in many years, they did not care about the people that were trying to do their job to the best of there abilities and did not support us."
bad,"Not really much to say expect it was very stressful for a job that had to proper direction. AT&T is a great provided with exceptional products. Convergys, the contractors on the other hand, was horrible and offered a lot of promises and underachievements."
bad,"late hours. not hard work. technical. equal opportunity employer. the hire within which made it easy to move up in the company, great supervisors. clean work environment"
bad,"Management and work environment is very poor. Promotions are based on individual subjective interview ""points"" rather than experience and accomplishments."
bad,"You take 300 calls a day and you have to have 98% adherence. I really hope those metrics have changed because if not Im pretty sure they are responsible for most people seeing therapist in Charlotte, NC"
bad,Not much room for advancement after becoming a team leader. Not the most professional environment. Pretty easy to master the daily task required at the entry-level position.
bad,"No communication. Always wanting something for nothing. Did not care for the employees only the mighty dollar. ""Clicks"" everywhere.  If you did not fit in you were SOL."
bad,As a whole not impressive for scheduling. Spent 3 months chasing a possible shift swap. Answered the same 6 questions 5 times in that period. They are unwilling to work with anyone to make accommodations for daycare or other reasons.
bad,"When there is nothing good to say about something best keep "
bad,this customer service job is not a job you can take anything way from. No one is encouraging no one is uplifting. The work environment is cold. There are no windows so everything is grey and dark on the inside.
bad,"Um dos lemas da gerência é criar problemas e atritos entre os funcionários para ver se sabem lidar com isso. Naturalmente isso é altamente contra-produtivo além de criar um ambiente tóxico. "
bad,"Hardest part of the job is dealing with all the politics in the building."
bad,I would not recommend this company to anyone. Its poorly ran and employees are paid on time. The turn over rate is very high with impossible room for advancement.
bad,Convergys of Hazelwood is an employer that I would not recommend to any of my friends.  The unprofessional staff makes it a stressful working environment.
bad,"I worked for this company as long as possible as I knew they were fairly new to the Milwaukee area. The company was bought out, rules changing by the day, job details as well. Shift changes without notice, and no contact with employee."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Do not waste your precious time applying or attending any job fair or career fair. They do not know the definition of career or job fair. All they do is take your resume. No discussion about the company or opportunities,  you won""t get an interview and their recruiters are completely unresponsive. Horrible experience"
bad,I honestly don't care for this company. I should've listened to what other people had stated for this company. I have FMLA from November and it is still valid until May and they are trying to fire me while I have it.
bad,Concentrix can be a good place to work but the supervisors base raises and advancement off of others personal opinions. The company is very unprofessional. If the management that has the power to change things knew what was going on and made changes the company would be great.
bad,work environment was that great was a very stressful place to work .managers do not work with you at all on anything. . a typical day at work was tiring stressful and not professional at all .
bad,"Was given minimal training on a new assignment with the company."
bad,"I was an employee at the Columbus, Georgia location for over an year. The leadership from the Team leaders all the way up to the site director are a joke and uneducated.  There is no professionalism displayed there. The center itself is on the bad side of town. The center is filthy. I left the company for a local Fortune 500 company.  I would not recommend this company to anyone! Once that site 5 year contract is up with the client, I do not see convergys moving forward in the Columbus, ga location!"
bad,"This place is so unorganized it's ridiculous. The management doesn't care about the employees and it shows. Paychecks are incorrect and no one takes responsibility for their job. Management places so much stress on the workers to get good customer surveys while always telling the customer no and not providing good customer service."
bad,"Cannot Not believe Managers, No room for growth or advancement, Very stressful, Low pay, High turn over rate, unprofessional environment , Employees not heard on proactive issues"
bad,This was a place to just get paid and leave when you get bored.  It is a dead end position.  If you are complacent then this is the job for you.  Good luck.
bad,I would not recommend Convergys to someone looking to build a career or who is mature. Convergys is a place to go temporarily between jobs if necessary.
bad,"The manager I had, had a problem with the truth. She lied a great deal to advance her own family. She showed a great amount of favoritism to certain employees and dislike to others. It was a very unfriendly work environment where the upper staff were considered. One member of management was found embezzling from the company which cut into employee money and incentives that would make the pay barable."
bad,You guys in upper management should be sued. Any day now. To the owner and ceo of this company fire every tl every manager ever coach and trainer ever worked here. Everyone of you are horrible you should never treat other unfairly but equally as one. Failure was set up from the beginning. A bunch of liars. Lawsuit is coming your way just be patient
bad,"Honestly the absolute worst job, training was a joke. No support. Just go beg for change on a corner before working here save yourself the trouble. They make false promises upon getting hired. Company in itself is just shady. There’s a reason they have such a high turn over rate."
bad,"Was ist hier nicht erlaubt? Diskriminierende, beleidigende, rufschädigende, rassistische und vulgäre Aussagen sind verboten!"
bad,"Convergys is horrible, the environment is horrible and the workers are ratchet and the managers are not fit for the company, it smells really bad and the bathrooms are terrible"
bad,The job is very stressful and they made you lie to the customer and they lied to the staff. The supervisors give no positive feedback. It seems that the employee cannot do anything right.
bad,This place is a black hole to which you send the poor tributes of each of the 12 districts. There the two tributes from each district face off in a battle to the death.
bad,This job was the worse job that I have ever had. The career advancement was non-existent. I got paid the same amount as my agents even after I got promoted. The agents made more than me actually because they could bonus. For over 8 months I was making the same rate with no opportunity to become salary and be paid reasonably.
bad,"This was a Bank of America project, no space to sit you would have to wait for desk to become available, no management motivation, no trainings or coaching, lack of care towards employees."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"If I could give this place 0 stars it still wouldn’t be enough "
bad,This company has been closed for years and rightfully so it was chaotic working there. Most people had no experience at all working there. This was one of my first jobs I had. I resigned shortly after working here.
bad,I love working for nike.com but converges with a very messy company. Convergys probably would be better if they never showed favoritism and actually base promotions off productivity.
bad,worked there many years low pay no raise. then they took all their senior people put us on a sup line and then made all kinds of excuses to fire us all. It was shameful.
bad,So convergys is a telecommunications center. They work for AT&T what they don't tell you is that this job forces you to juggle infuriated off customers while trying to sell them direct TV. And god forbid you don't sell them something on the phone the managers will jump on you so fast. Not only is talking to customers about how their bill is missed up but you have the managers breathing down your neck. the turn over rate for this place must be in the 90% because it is an awful place to work for. and sure you will receive training but what you get has will not prepare you for the awful place you are about to jump into.
bad,"Worked here for about 6 months and I have absolutely no words for the job, the company and the people who work there. The way myself and other colleagues were treated was borderline emotional abuse! They suck you into the job by advertising it as the dogs bollocks, and then have you work 9-5 shifts for 2 weeks whilst training, not to mention telling you lies after lies about the job itself. No wonder this job has such a turn over of staff as when you actually get on the phone, you’re basically customer service who work until 9pm! And work every weekend! I hadn’t had any weekends off for 3 months straight!!! Absolutely everyone in that place is on a power trip and will do anything to take you down. Commission is nothing but a myth but will make you believe you can earn thousands! I witnessed someone lose her commission by 1 second off her AHT, and she had to fight for weeks to actually get it! The management will not lift a finger to help you out in any way. It all resulted in me clocking out half way through a shift and walk out crying! Would not have any positive feedback about this company, if you’re reading this do not work there!"
bad,Convergies was not a good company to work for. They did not always follow the clients needs and requests. They would often approve your vacation time and then take it away at the last minute.
bad,"call after call"
bad,This place is very stressful and puts a strain on your body!The company frequently messes up pay checks and pay toll and all they are always chnging policy.
bad,I worked there for almost 2 years and was promised several times that I would become a part of management or given a trainer position and it never happened the only good thing I found was they were very understanding about family emergencies other than that they like to use small little things to make there agents feel good and give empty promises I watched several people move into some kind of lead positions when they were fresh out of training and never having been on the phones with those of us who were tenured and new policy and products like the back of our hands were stuck on the phones still the only way I would ever work for this company again is if I had no other choice the pay also is not competitive making well under what you would make hourly working for any other call center
bad,I can't stand this place. Such a huge overturn of employees. I was not allowed to use the washroom on my schedual. HR is awful at this location in Dartmouth.
bad,They will hire anyone and the managers are racist if you don't have a problem sucking up to certain managers they allow managers to padding employees numbers so they can get ahead
bad,Not a friendly environment to work at all. They are sexiest and racist. They don't care about the employees at all. Poor training to begin with. They also have clicks that are somewhat like gangs there as well.
bad,"The worst place in the world to work for!  I have never, and will never be treated this way again by any company.  If it is either work for Convergys, or anything else, do the anything else!"
bad,in my opinion this place is not accommodating to those employees whom are pregnant. i recieved a lot of back lash due to my pregnancy and sickness and their for lost my job
bad,"Their training departmant Is a joke and they have a bunch of kids in management possitions playing adult while smoking pot in the parking lot and gossiping about everybody even each other. If you're looking for a career, look some place else."
bad,Pay rate ok could have better management and a better way of how they do PTO friendly work place and relaxed at times good always be ready for change.
bad,"Very stressful. You are required to forcefully try and sell customers products and services even when they can not pay or are behind on their bill. If you  do not try to sell you are disciplined. When customers call with a problem with their AT&T service, It was hard enough to solve the problem amd they would grow angry when you try to sell them something. Worst job I ever had."
bad,"Pay is horrible, staff is horrible, management is non existent but hours are fair because you have actual set schedules with set days off ongoing. They give OT which they should considering the high lack of pay and the lack of actually paying people on time. This company is being sued as we speak for lack of payment to their employees."
bad,"During my interview I was told that I would have holidays off and wouldn't have to work overtime-both turned out to be lies. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,If you don't mind taking calls everyday all day and working with angry people that call in as well as stress of meeting quota this is the job for you. If you bore easy I would recommend steering clear.
bad,Te preguntan cuanta es tu aspiración salarial pero te van a ofrecer mucho menos . El call center bilingue con mas bajo pago
bad,"Convergys laid off thousands of people from the US and sent jobs over to the Philippines, after having the US representatives train them. I was given paid training because of the laws related to outsourcing."
bad,"pire compagnie  ou j'ai travaillé pendant toute ma carrier professionnel, salaire minable avec aucune opportunité d'avancement, car l'avancement se fait entre amis et familles au sein de cette minable entreprise"
bad,It was good for entry level. I came from fast food but honestly it was a very unprofessional environment and that led to the entire AT&T project being shut down.
bad,"they do not value their employees. they expect you to follow the chain of command and yet when you do, they don't listen to any issues you are having."
bad,"I suggest that if you have a chance of getting a better job go somewhere else, here it is a job but I dont see any chance of advancement and they dont really see you as a employee you are just a number there."
bad,"Worst place to work at, they lie to from the beginning. People on the phones are just rude and makes your day horrible !!! And you have to bid for your schedule, and it changes all the time. Not only that, they give you a vacation whenever they want, and you can't even switch it to another time.  "
bad,"Truly the most awful place I’ve ever worked. Pay is always wrong, bonus is absolute rubbish, management are terrible and the systems are a complete and utter joke. Such a negative environment and anyone who is slightly higher up than you is constantly on a power trip. The attitude of some of the agents and management alike is disgusting. From what I’ve seen  very recently, progression is pretty much non existent unless you’re a favourite of management. The breaks are tough, not enough time for lunch at all in my opinion (30 mins). Shifts are rubbish as well, I’ve worked three weekends in a row with another two on the way. Booking time off is pretty much impossible unless you do it months in advance. Has been nothing but a shambles from the start. People from my training group are dropping like flies! Can’t say I blame them."
bad,"Great team to work with, help each other get through the day always so help full an supportive of each other, makes you have fun at work and always laughing"
bad,"If you're looking for a reliable set schedule that fit your needs, then don't work for this company! You hours change daily, you're placed her and there daily never a set environment. Staff is very rude. Your commission payout is never right. So I would advise you to not waste your time applying to this company."
bad,they could not stand up to what the said they where and the training was a joke and left much they focus to much on sales than actually helping when your not in sales its all about the bottle cash line for them even at your own exspenc
bad,never work here please if you ever get hired think about getting a other job call centers is bad and are very quick to replace you if you don't get along with management and others on staff they only care about them self's.
bad,"answered phones for AT & T, typing, selling product, asking customers if they would like to up grade, add long distance or upgrade on the universe channels"
bad,Terrible work environment. A lot of ratchetness everywhere. VERY INCONSISTENT. Very unprofessional. No organization at all. No good benefits. Very very high turnover rate. And will definitely NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO WORK HERE!
bad,"My experience working here wasn’t the best, my Management was not great. Constantly felt inadequate, customer service requirements were unrealistic and not in line with customer needs and constantly changing. You must stick to a script no matter how much a customer is yelling otherwise you will be sent home without pay, I absolutely despised working here."
bad,I would not recommend any of my friends to work at Converges. The communication between co workers is the worst I've ever experienced. Walkie talkies are not the way.
bad,"This, job is good for young adults who are seeking employment that pays better than your average fast food joint. But it's not the most organized company, at times it feels like you're in high school all over again. I will never work for them ever again."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,job sucked big time. stay away if you can due anything with your life. I would recommend searching your inner chi. Also stay away from any call centers that contract. Youre welcome .
bad,"Learned the basic fundamentals on assisting individuals with navigating specific areas. Pretty simple, in depth training. Typical call center environment."
bad,"Modern day slavery. Management doesn't care about you, your life, concerns, or anything other than you making the company money. Favoritism is obvious and there's a complete lack of professionalism. it's not worth the headache or incompetence."
bad,Management only cares about the acount and does not care about employees. They motivate us to work hard to get pur incentives but our money ends up to the managers pockets
bad,"worst place ever to work, never again, poor leadership, poor management, poor everything, I would never recommend anyone I know to work there unless the really need the money"
bad,"This company is an absolute joke! my partner worked for them and unfortunately had been assaulted badly!! Due to circumstances, he had to take time off work for hospital! But the company thought this was unacceptable! My partner was demanded to come in for a meeting, regardless that he could not see out of his eye, could hardly walk and was in excruciating pain!!! They said 'it's not our fault, you still need to come in'. My partner had to take holidays to go to hospital appointments which they then said was ' not allowed' and dismissed him!!! His Team Leader did nothing but speak to him like rubbish over the phone on numerous occasions, which I have recorded! And it has been over 4 months and they are refusing to send him a P45!! Absolutel diabolical! I've phoned my partner and heard staff members in background  bad mouthing customers calling them all sorts of names!! "
bad,A lot of restrictions and being treated like a child to perform your duties. Mandatory overtime and the pay sucks for the work that was required. Management wasn't good either.
bad,"worked here for tech support for 6 months, back pain everyday due to an accident, no accommodation. Lied about PTO, was let go due to not getting FMLA approved.  "
bad,"this job as all call centers was horrible, not willing to pay yet wanting the employees to bend over backwards for the job! the managers were very nasty and quit impersonal, not a job to build a career in!"
bad,very stressful environment. Now the business  is closed down. the day consisted of taking calls from irate customers about billing issues pertaining the their phone.
bad,"Horrible place to work. Nothing is stable. They will mess over your check and your money will be short if you don't monitor it closely. They operate on a point system. You are only a body used to keep the machine of business flowing. They will replace you when, or if necessary. They don't pay enough for the task they want completed and for the demographics."
bad,one of the worst jobs i've ever had. they make you lie to callers and tell them you're a pharmacy technician even though they don't give you any sort of training in that field. very little you can do to help callers and you end up transferring most calls to their local pharmacy. supervisors are terrible and lazy. most work stations have damaged or missing equipment. i worked there full time for six months and wasn't offered healthcare at any point.
bad,"This is a terrible and unprofessional place to work.   Their management team is untrained and anybody who is promoted that did not move from another site is soon after fired.  There is no job security and management lies about EVERYTHING!!!!  They expect you to be proficient in multiple areas of knowledge (member calls, provider calls, policy benefits, claims and billing) however there is a $10 pay rate that is non negotiable and there are no raises at all."
bad,"It is not a job for advancement despite being told it is. In addition, recruiting tells you one salary which is falsified. Very strict with some people and others are favored and can break the rules. Management does not support the employees. I work here currently and leads are playing games on their phones or talking. Getting assistance is near impossible. Very little respect for employees."
bad,"This place is terrible. It is completely filled with favoritism with all the managers. We get points for leaving early or being late, not a big deal. HOWEVER, when an entire team is scheduled for mandatory overtime and only 3 people out of 15 work it. The other 12 employees are in good with managers so they get points waived. So they miss all this time but don't get in trouble. But some of us ask to use PTO & they make you come in on your day off to make it up instead of letting you use YOUR EARNED PTO. But some people just don't show up and then get pto put in for them. The managers are so rude. They do not care about you needed help if you are confused they will let you stay lost and then get angry when you have a long call. This place needs a whole new management and then MAYBE I would give 1 star for real. 1 star is too much for this place."
bad,bomb threats coworkers fighting on the floors and smoking pot in the restrooms - this place was a zoo! it was no wonder that most of the companies pulled out and the management is so worried about the call times instead of whats going on with the employees.
bad,"I only worked at Concentrix (previously Minacs) as a co-op student but I did notice many of the staff were stressed, not paid enough, and very unhappy in the roles."
bad,Convergys is terrible at best. They fire people on maternity leave. They never give raises there is no opportunity to advancement. You are just a number and easily replaceable
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,This is not a company I would recommend to anyone. They were very unorganized and the staff there was very lazy and didn't want to help out when needed.
bad,"I took customer calls and got their internet working again or let them know if there was an outage."
bad,The training sucks and leaves you feeling dumb. When you ask for guidance about something you don't know they tell you to use Google and once you do and it is wrong they try to speak up then.
bad,i have nothing to say i will never work for this company again there is nothing i have to say but this is not a good company to work for. no advancement opportunities and the pay is too low
bad,Their is a lack of communication with managers to employees. Incentive pay outs are not always on time. It's also not a fun environment to work in because of the managers.
bad,I did not like this job at all. I felt like I was in high school all over again. Just a lot of drama. Was not an adult inviorment at all. One of the worst jobs I'd ever have.
bad,I hate this job ! I wanna die everytime I walk  into work like JESUS take me now . it's stressful and miserable for the most part. I'm starting to think that i'm really annoyed .
bad,"Horrible, spent several years there and they only promote people that smoke with them outside, or are friends with.  They do not under any circumstance take constructive  criticism from underlings ever, if you have opinions on how the company could do better keep them to your self they do not wish to hear how they could do better and only wished to be praised by their employees, if you find your self ever critiquing them they will blacklist you from any type of promotion and look to terminate you for small errors that they will go out of their way to find, just to justify your termination.  when you do get terminated from this job,  they will deny your unemployment  benefits under the guise of  the errors risking their business relations with their clients ( they will lose in court but the fact they challenge it to delay your unemployment benefits in hopes of you getting a new job and not wishing to proceed with your benefits) If you are considering this take advantage of their paid training to find a new job. (two weeks)"
bad,You will do the same job as anthem but the pay is like a staffing agency.... you'll peak out at 10 dollars. .. they hold job fairs monthly and take a wild guess why... very tall manager sleeps with agents then holds it over thier head... be ready to witness a fight every payday.... oh yeah they messed my check up repeatedly over the course of a year and they will fire you for thier wrong doing  job I left before it can happen
bad,"Do not trust these mugs they profit from your wages!  How do you think they secure third party contracts from companies such as HSBC and O2?  Simple they pay you less and profit from your sweat and misery.  I mean Convergys makes itself out to be some specialist call centre company lovl, call centres are the new century equivalent of cotton mills and can be found two to a penny!  Also watch out at converges team leaders make most decisions from hiring to firing so is very subjective to their own narrowness and there is no meaningful management structure to make objective progress. "
bad,"slave labor, didn't care about the employees, just wanted to fill seats. we werent properly trained and when we asked for help we rarely get it or they had an attitude."
bad,team leads where not qualified to do their jobs the HR staff was into bullying and they would lower your salary at will to get back at you they are not recommended as only friends of the team leads will not get off boarded
bad,a place where unless you are friends with management you get bullied . The team leaders are all un qualified and they let the atmosphere become toxic with no one to run too
bad,"Very Stressful, very fast paced, forced to learn fast and still do not know everything to get the job done. Computer systems very horrible. No time to mentally relax from all the stress of the job itself."
bad,"poor wages"
bad,"Company sounds great to work for. Went through the hiring process for a position, got to the last step only to find they do not hire from the state of California."
bad,Very poor management Quick turn over employee. Call center are not routing correct needs to customer. Make the call more complicated to trouble shoot as needed.
bad,"This place is managed by how popular you are. They do not care how long you have been there. You could be there 5 to 10 years and the new hires will make the same as you and get the better hours. They tell you that you can move up very quick in the company to supervisor position, what they don't tell you is that after that you won't last very long. Considering how high the turnover rate is they could careless how long you stay."
bad,"I have over 20 years in Call Center experience and have worked from home for nearly ten years. In that time, this had to be the worst company I have ever worked with. The trainer I had was NOT professional at all; TL and QA were rude and very self-righteous. I had to have replacement equipment sent to me from the Company as the original crashed and it took a little over three weeks (with no pay) while waiting. There is a real lack of communication between departments. The workplace culture leaves a lot to be desired: very cut throat. Also the training was not the best. For example, I worked on a contract and they provided the training. After I quit, I got hired by the actual Brand. I found that the previous training was not always accurate."
bad,Supervisors are rude they don't care about you not enough hours  unprofessional the pharmacist pharmacist technician members are rude to you and hang up in your face that cuss you out
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"This company is Completely unprofessional, uninspired, corrupt, lacking diversity, with substandard training and equipment. And to add insult to injury, the building has a bed bug infestation."
bad,"They care more about the rules than they do about the employees. For example, they make you keep the call time to a certain amount no matter how much help a customer might need."
bad,"Not happy, not consisting, no raise, management don't know what their doing, definitely need training, not knowledgeable about what their job duties require to run the nature of the businesses."
bad,"never got benefits pay was always late never got paid on time lots of technical issues on there end that was faulty no one knew anything or could explain anything to you. you were constantly left in the dark."
bad,"You make nothing. Management thinks there better then you (HA!). Mediocre training at best. To top it off, you get yelled at by 75% of incoming calls. Only good thing is the chill coworkers that have your back. You're worth more than this place. Get paid for the training and look for another job in the meantime, straight up."
bad,"The job was the worst and I stopped working during just the training. It’s so unprofessional, dirty, no REAL rules and nobody cares."
bad,"There was large potential for a successful company. Sadly the company was poorly ran by an emotional, immature management staff. The higher ups had no connection with lower level staff therefore treating them like numbers on a board and not like the people working for them to provide an actual service."
bad,Would never recommend this place to anyone. The management is the worst I have ever seen. They do not pay you enough for all of the requirements they have monthly.
bad,"This place literally landed me in the hospital with a lovely stress induced health scare. I can not in any sense of the word tell you how much HATE I have for this company, and its poor management."
bad,When I started as a QA they trained us 2 days prior to Thanksgiving. None of the cubicles were built properly and very poor management. We were never calibrated enough on each level of management to make sure that everyone was on the same page to analyse the agents.
bad,"Horrible place to work, very unprofessional. I'm actively seeking a new job due to poor management. Management does not take care of issues properly and are the ones who are involved in the issues as well."
bad,They promise there workers things and never deliver...they get paid for us to work and it seems like it's a modern day slavery without the leg bracelets....they get one thing and we get paid another....the morale is in the dump and people quit left and right....the people we have they work them like dogs and get mad if they call in....I know there is something better out there for me.....they offer us health coverage but it's so high you can pay and if u do that person only working for rent or insurance. That is no way to live but I will make until something else come a long...
bad,"The customer experience is what the management says is the most important think, but agents arg given little or no case management time to take care of the customers. Often times they are given no time to call customers, or even look over the notes to resolve complicated issues."
bad,Answering and being on the phone all day and having to deal with angry customers was stressful. Taking an emergency call was scary and having to calm the person down was stressful and overwhelming. I would have weekly meetings with my manager about call times and what I could do better. There was so many people that worked there it was hard to get to know anyone. I didn't like being on the phone all day or staring at a computer screen all day.
bad,I was only there for a couple of months and the job I applied for initially was a full time position and then we where told that we had no jobs by the 23rd December and for people who had families coming up to Christmas this wouldn't have been ideal. It wasn't a nice environment and the staff aren't great.
bad,"Convergys is where school bullies go to work when they're done with school. Sales management and trainers preach the 'Wolf of Wall Street' mentality towards selling, their idea of 'Customer Care' is putting too many bums in not enough seats and then penalising the ones who can't get logged into a phone from their owed wages. What they are doing to their staff should be illegal and is completely wrong. I scrubbed toilets in CastleCourt for two months and it was easily better than Convergys."
bad,my program ending due to poor managment there is no reason they should have hired that late in the year if they were going to close the program not fair and not nice.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"The company location itself had been a tossup for years. They blamed their agents for their own lousy management, and each subsequent site head was there to take as much money as they could before they wound up leaving too. Guidelines often didn;t make sense and it was closer to a junior high environment than a professional one. The pay was inadequate as well, for the same technical support other areas offered anywhere from 4-5 bucks an hour higher without the head games. Morale was terrible, and it was always someone else to blame. It finally closed down, and good riddance."
bad,Good company to work for if you are between jobs or need a second job to make extra money. Not a career oath kind of place. Management has no idea what they are doing.
bad,"This is by far the worst job I've ever had. Convergy's isn't necessarily a bad company to work for but they just contract space to bigger accounts. I worked for AT&T and it was awful. The training is a total joke and once they force you out onto the sales floor there's nobody around to help you with your 500,000 questions. All of the problems and complaints you receive are mostly internal problems created by other employees who also weren't trained properly and when you ask for help correcting mistakes permanently you are either brushed off like it's not a legitimate problem or told to credit their account and they'll just call back again next month (but at least you didn't mess with your stats)."
bad,Sit down job. inbound calling center. Different campaigns with different opportunities. Work hours are based off the campaign you are hired for. Great location.
bad,"Take this with a grain of salt it has been a few years since I worked at the company,  But the call center and how it was run was not a good fit for me and it caused a lot of stress anger for me."
bad,It's an okay job if you just want to sit down all day. I did learn a lot of skills from Apple about iPhones and that literally anybody can get hired there. The management is my biggest issue. They still cannot get my schedule right and I have been working there for 4 months. The hardest part of the job is when customers yell at you for helping them with there problems and act like your dumb and don't know what your talking about. The best part is the hour lunches.
bad,Concentrix was a very stressful place to work and have to go home feeling all out of place. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone. I had to force myself to get up and go to work and try to deal with the unprofessional environment that concentrix gave.
bad,"The job was stressful. Very underpaid for the expectations. Poor management. Very bias and partial to certain employees. A lot of inappropriate behaviors that were made known to upper management and were overlooked. Each employee got UTO, PTO and yet were rarely able to use the time due to the micro-management of time off. Breaks and lunches are very micromanaged as well, to the point you cannot leave company property unless on your 30 minute lunch or hour lunch."
bad,"lack of management, a company who doesn't \really value their employees. Only good thing was that there was not a strict dress code policy. The management team should make more effort"
bad,"convergys is an entry level job that has a lot of drama and poor managment , it is a stressful job but still easy in a way it mainly depends on which project you are working on comcast is the worst project to work for"
bad,"This job comes with a headache! Team Leaders are not Team Leaders. Coming onto the floor from training, don't look for help from your TL, your co-workers will be the ones to assist you. You'll be fooled into thinking your check is supposed to be 80 hours-WRONG! No room for advancement and the pay is trash"
bad,"The work atmosphere is very unorganized and they do not care about their employees. No room for growth within, the pay is still not increased even with promotion."
bad,"Ich kann leider gar nichts positives über diese Firma sagen und fand das Klima dort und auch manche Vorgesetzte geradezu unmenschlich. Ich bin jetzt nicht jemand, der gern beim Telefonieren mit anderen Kollegen quatscht oder sich mit anderen Dingen beschäftigt. Ich habe stets mein Bestes gegeben und so konzentriert wie möglich gearbeitet. Trotzdem kam es schon mehrmals vor, dass mir etwas unklar war und die Vorgesetzten hysterisch herumbrüllten, dass ich statt Fragen zu stellen arbeiten solle. Zudem wurden in Sammelmails an alle Arbeitskräfte regelmäßig Drohungen ausgestoßen, weil wieder etwas nicht so gelaufen war, wie die Vorgesetzten sich das wünschten und wir wie kleine Kinder mit Pausenentzug, einem persönlichen Gespräch oder Entlassung bestraft werden würden, wenn sich da etwas nicht ändert. Das Klima war sehr bedrückend und hatte etwas von einem äußerlich gut gestrichenen Arbeitslager an sich. Man wurde für einen Hungerlohn wie eine Zitrone ausgequetscht, zudem versagte ständig die Technik."
bad,"Poorly managed, favouritism, unfair treatment of employees, unorganized, poor computer system, employees are given bad ratings because of the poor computer systems, where we are not even allowed to clock system issues when it is clearly not our fault."
bad,This place is a revolving door. There is no structure. Under trained and over worked. The job is based on customer surveys. Caotic place to work. Culture is very poor. Workers who arEunhappy. No professionalism.
bad,"There's no growth, They pay very little for what you have to deal with, in regards to both customers and management. Management is terrible about supporting their employees. Would honestly not recommend for anyone."
bad,"For a company that handles millions of dollars a year, they pay is terrible. The management is scatterbrained. They change policy on a daily basis and per manager. Complete lack of consistency at all levels... terrible"
bad,No good management. A lot of favoritism. No room for advancement. Inconsistent. Everyday a new set of rules. You constantly walking in egg shells. Not a good company to work for.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I have witnessed the cut throat environment of this job. The site lead and operation managers suck and don’t really care about the business or the employees. They are barely in the building before 9 am and is sure to be gone by 4pm. How can you run a company when you are never there? "
bad,I HATED THIS JOB!!! All you did was get yelled at and disrespected and half the bosses there didn't care about you or anything. Its a tough job some people can handle it some can't.
bad,This job was a learning experience for me of how a call center operates and how to succeed under excessive pressure. There was few kudos given for hard work and the overall cleanliness of the place was below expectations. The moral is super low amongst team members due to the disrespect given from management and authority figures.
bad,"I have never felt so alone and on an island so quick into a job. Thi place has nothing but tenured people in managerial roles and will do anything they can to protect their ""status"". I was recruited to be in management here, but was shown the nothing but a cold shoulder once I started."
bad,The work environment is unprofessional also to much work for so little pay. I also believe that they show favoritism between employees and staff members.
bad,They took a lot of benefits away from us. they wanted us to sell yet the people that called didn't have any cable or promtions available in there area. this place needs a lot improvement.
bad,It started out great then they found themselves under poor management. They were not good to the employees in Rochester with over micro management along with shoddy compensation. The people were great on the other hand.
bad,"Von diesem Arbeitgeber ist nur abzuraten."
bad,I would not recommend working here. The mangers are selfish and they do not help. The upper management makes it impossible to earn money from sells. Nobody will address your concerns. UNSAFE working environment
bad,I worked as a work at home manager and was laid off due to the project closing. They didn't even try to find me another job. I quit and got another job. They truly do not care.
bad,the company sounds amazing but very unorganized. started later then expected underpaid than the actual jobs at the business you work for. I guess that's what makes it third party. management is very unprofessional never verify things or follow up. transfers are very hard to do. felt like I had no assistances and no one wanted to help because it wasn't their job on the line.
bad,"job is absolutely horrible you dont have time to go to the bathroom, you have 2 10 min breaks and thats it. On the phones the entire time and forced to make sales pitch every call or lose your job and people get tired of you trying to sell them something constantly"
bad,"Just not a great place to work, support was lacking and promotions were only if you already knew someone in management. Also they seemed to reward lazy people or people who were never there."
bad,"constantly having calls come in always on the phone, when the contract with AT&T went through it was just a wing it kind of attitude with no communication with upper management about how things should be done, the constant NEED to up sale everything was the most annoying part and that was all AT&T wanted was us to up sale products, customers called in about wrong bill amount or broken equipment, and you would have to up sale, the hardest part was the customers calling in already in a bad mood, and not having enough training to handel alot of the situations, the best part of the job was going home for the day."
bad,Dont do it to yourself. I know that times are hard but this is not the place for you to consider. The job is very easy but the team leaders don't care.
bad,"Very Poor management. No health card no Free lunch. Very poor teamwork and lack of staff that leads to multi-tasking. Checking in passengers, safety precautions and to make sure all dangerous goods are propely handled by our team until tgey arrive on their destination. Arrival department and pre departures agents."
bad,"I don't enjoy working there, The hours are horibble, always have to work holidays, no flexibility if you have a secondary job, there is no work/home balance"
bad,"At first the job seemed not bad, I believe in the service they offer members, however, the environment is the worst place you can work in. Need time off? Good luck, not happening. Not feeling good? They do not care, you have to take those phone calls. HR is terrible. Once you go to a different department they DO NOT allow you to go back, which feels illegal to me, because you do not sign anything that states you are permanently stuck in a department you choose to join. The scheduling is THE WORST. They do not give rotation at all, you have to bid for the schedule you want. But the good shifts go to the people that are above you and are top sellers. They do not care about you as a worker. We provide phenomenal customer service, but they do not want you to answer customer questions in detail because the Average Handle Time will go up which is WRONG. Customers are paying monthly or even annually for our services, the least we can do for them is answer all the questions they may have. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,No pay raises ever. They grant the required sick time for legalities but if you take even a single day your manager is at your throat. Even when I had a dead in the immediate family. No understanding whatsoever for any reason. You are just a body in a chair
bad,I'll never work there again. Most unstable unprofessional place I've ever worked. Management was unpredictable... It was called Club Comcast. A bunch of heathens.
bad,"like any other call center, they work you to death. the schedule runs into or around your family life and expect management to always be on your back about sales"
bad,this place was honestly really terrible. they make you bs people instead of easily fixing problems that are easily vable to fixed its kind of annoying
bad,I was taken on at there brand new office in Newcastle as a customer service advisor for Vodafone broadband. Training was a total shambles spent two weeks in class room and left with no idea of what I was doing didn't even get to look at the systems before hitting the call floor. Team leader was a much use as a chocolate fire guard and genuinely couldn't give a monkeys about any concerns I raised. Finally hit the call floor and couldn't help a single customer as had no idea what I was doing. Floor walker's spent there entire day playing with fidget spinners. I spent two days taking calls and couldn't handle it any longer. Avoid at all costs!!!!!
bad,"job was terrible "
bad,lack of management starting with the main OMs wont care about you and growing to better your self not a stable job. I was one of the best agent on the floor and never got to use my paid time off because we were always low on staffing. When I gave my two week notice they took two months to pay me my last check very inconvenient. Had to talk to CORP to get paid unbelievable
bad,I didn't really enjoy working here because I didn't learn what I needed to learn before getting put on the phones to speak to customers I wasn't helped when I needed help. Everyone was rude. The environment is like a playground everyone is trying to have fun which is great but when I was doing my job no one would help.
bad,It's not a job for a person who doesn't like to sit still and talking to rude customers. I would not recommend this job to anyone who can't handle stress. The Training is not that great.
bad,"Work environment very unsatisfactory and people are not nice and underhanded. They will take your hour lunch and make it 30 minutes if they have alot of call outs. The team leaders dont do nothing, if you need help they act like they dont see you and keep up unnecessary mess with the other employees. And ny it being so easy to move up in those positions, its people in those positions that dont know what they talking about when ask questions. Basically dont know no more then the person on the phone. Management dont care to know the workers side of things at all."
bad,A very backwards company that only progresses those whose faces fit. The company change their rules to suit themselves and don't care about staff in general.
bad,Most employees quiet or are fired within their first year. Their attendance policy is unfair. They talk about how there are a lot of chances to move up ion the company but that's not even close to true. I wouldn't recommend.
bad,"good benefits "
bad,This company does not care about its employees and the system is designed to stress you out and see you fail. They are unfair to good employees and reward laziness and unhelpfulness.
bad,This job requires very hard work and you are never recognized for your dedication. if you don't meet the goals you will be fired without hesitation. No additional training.
bad,This company would rather keep employees that don't do their job and call avoid or hang up on customers. Than keep employees that did their job. they was not understanding to life situation that may make you late or have to leave early. Lord forbid your house/apartment have major issues to have to call off they don't understand these type things if you are going through them.
bad,From site level management to supervisors the company was filled with very unprofessional individuals.  When management was asked questions their response was to try and shift blame and not to try and find a solution.
bad,I advise no one to work for this company. I recently had medical condtion going on in which lead to emergency surgery. They did not take that into consideration and demanded me back at work 1 week after my release from the hospital. Managers are rude. Horrible pay.
bad,It is one of the worst jobs out there since they make us work 10 hour shifts illegally since we did not sign off on it. They should have been 8 hours.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Terrible place to work , managers only care about their own positions and not about the actual job! No one cares about being a team or being co workers"
bad,Its all about numbers to management. Employees are treated like they are a statistic versus a real person.  Management always micromanaged employees. Employees never feel appreciated for the work they do.
bad,To much drama . Everything was no secret there people stayed fighting there . Even pregnant girls . I was never treated wrong bwcuase I wouldnt have that but other girls were
bad,the absolute worst place to work ever. they put you in a training class where they intentionally teach you nothing then send on the production floor with no knowledge. Hate it
bad,"This is a fast pace call center.  The training they provide you is very poor & they do not inform you that you have sales quotas to meet until you've completed training.  If your really desperate for money then apply here, there will accept anyone but be prepared to be treated like dirt."
bad,"First off, you need to be fully aware that this is unstable job. Starting from day one, team leads and mangers will be too nice to you. Couple weeks or so, things will be way too different, expect unfair treatment, you will be threaten to be terminated every once in a while. You will be treated as a tool they own and use however and whenever they want. Expect to be working weekends, and night shift, you are just a tool to them. They don’t care if you do 99% good job, they will only focus on the 1% that you missed and punch you for it."
bad,this was the worst job i ever had. they do not pay well and they treat their employees like garbage. there was no pay raises. they dont care about people and therefore i had to leave asap
bad,Bad don't work here worst company terrible management worked for 6 months and never got an opportunity for advancement even when there were positions open they would outside hire to fill those positions
bad,"No comments at all , no Job Work/Life Balance , Salary/Benefits it all for the company not for the employee seems, all advanced services are for name sake , employee don't have any rights to use them as their own even for rating our superiors will have demands ."
bad,i wouldn't recommend the most dreaded person i know to work here. this place is truly unreasonable and unfair. The management doesnt care about the people and expect you to rearrange everything in your life for the job without notice
bad,It was okay but the pay was not enough for all they wanted you to do. You had to go through a long training and then were put on the floor to take live calls and had to know multiple screens and how to navigate on them.
bad,this is a very cut throat company. they worked you like a horse and dangled a carrot in front of you for bonus but that changed every month so was ni impossible to obtain.
bad,"Not a great place if you are looking to be promoted based on your experience, promotion is based on whether or not management likes you. Leaders walking around in see through tights, speaking about inappropriate conversations and adult toys, wearing dirty filthy bras, and refusal to help others."
bad,"Great people to work with but the company was the worst. Pay wasn't good for someone with a family only school kids. Benefits were ok. Management was not good, only a select few were ok."
bad,At the time this company seemed to be thrown together with a lot of good intentions but unfortunately no actual supervision & productivity. The facility later closed.
bad,"The worst company I have ever worked for. Horrible unorganized work environment, lack of accountability, lack of supervision, lack of professionalism. Fake incentives; they don't pay you for all hours worked or pay out the incentives they offer."
bad,I personally did not like working at a call center. There was little training and help when speaking to customers. after training you were on your own. Not very good pay for what was being handled on calls.
bad,"Convergys was poorly managed from top to bottom. You could tell early on it was never about the people working there, it was just about keeping as much money for themselves as they could. Extremely stressful place to work."
bad,I worked for this company for 6 months. They messed up every check except my last one. They made several changes to my schedule and moved me back and forth between departments with less than 2 days notice. I missed my open enrollment period to sign up for benefits because the person in HR quit without notice. The pay is very low and the incentive pay out is laughable.
bad,"management only cared about making money off there employees, very stressful, customers yelling an cussing at you over the phone and there was nothing you can do about it but take it"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Convergys is very unorganized and out of control. It is a very unfair work environment that doesn't allow you to request days off to handle personal business such as doctor's appointments they don't provide you with enough time to even enjoy your off days without changing the schedule and forcing you to work on days you have off.
bad,"The training at Convergys is minimal and in no way prepares you for the work you will really be doing once you reach the production floor. Management is IMPOSSIBLE to get ahold of, and when you need a manager, you will be told to ""figure it out"" and be left waiting for upwards of 3 minutes while Customers yell at you on the phone. The hardest part of this job is the stress level. Even as a good sales person that was getting sales everyday, your managers and team leaders will be on you to sell even more and more, regardless of customer satisfaction. The enjoyable parts of the job include having 2 breaks and a lunch well spaced throughout your shift and you do make some friends while there. Would not recommend to anyone that has other job opportunities. Human resources will NOT return phone calls or emails and was NO help when they messed up my Insurance. I was pregnant the entire time I worked for Convergys, and as I became closer to term, several rude comments were made to me from MANAGEMENT to ""possibly look for another job"" because I made some of the managers uncomfortable by being so close to by due date and still working."
bad,"This is by far the worse place I have ever worked and I have worked in a lot of different industries across Canada. The pay is really low; they mistreat people really bad. Long hours which kills your throat as its call after call non stop for 9-11 hours per day. Management/leadership are running it into the ground. Morale is terrible with so many upset/grumpy workers because of how they are treated. I am not sure how they stay in business as in my training class 24 started and only 5 remained when they were into production. This company wastes so much money. If you go over your time on calls or after call work they will be yelling. I am not sure who is more mean; the clients or the managers. If you want to hate your life work here.  They are constantly changing their scheduling even without notice. They will flip you back and forth between programs with out your knowledge. Tell you to stay on script scripts and when you do get mad because your targets are low. They grade your calls and if you make a slight mistake you will fail that call leading to stern warnings etc. It is perhaps the nost unreasonable job that i have had. You often dont even have time for a drink of water as calls are right after each other. I would not recommend this job for anyone, any retail job is far better. Good luck trying to get important days off and if you get one good luck trying to afford anything especially if you have a family. I have never worked for an employer that completely disrespects their employees as  much as this company does. Do not buy into their manipulations, as they will try to"
bad,i didnt like my experience there. too much stress and way to far from where i lived. the pay was good and overtime was great but just wasnt a job for me.
bad,"Not family friendly, doesn't care for their employees, not paying good but they want you to be on phone constantly that taking a sip of water you cant do.  Supervisors are rude and degrading the team."
bad,"First off, its not at all a professional place to work. I have been working there for little over 3 mths, and have seen 2 physical fights including a team lead about to jump on one of her employees. Dress code; they say causal but most look a mess, coming to working with mini skirts, bonnets on their heads etc. Training is almost 2mths long which is poorly done, they think you can learn off a computer. If you have kids they will not work with your schedule and change it anytime they feel like it.  Mangers have no idea whats going on half the time, no one helps you when you need it. The only thing good I can say about this job is that its for kids, meaning high school kids with no kids and no bills. Pay is 10 a hour, not enough at all when you have to navigate 20 systems a day just to provide info to customers."
bad,Favorites get promoted. Personal issues not addressed and appointments with doctor's note or a medical emergency with a doctor's note is NEVER excused. The building is disgusting and the air is constantly on 60 degrees. Have been sick over four times in less than a year and I never got sick before working here. Stats are important and issues with the system or the clients system can lead to bad stats.
bad,"I was very disappointed with Concentrix. They were late getting equipment to me, the first paycheck was late and when it came it was wrong, and they still did not have our schedules available the week we were going live."
bad,This job was the most unprofessional job that I've ever had. They hire anyone who applies and they don't follow any rules. One good thing is that they approve overtime.
bad,This place says they are there for customer care but it is all about trying to sale something to people who are calling in for help with other problems. Including people who are having a hardship already.
bad,whilst I was there it was a nightmare to be paid your normal wage on time let alone bonus. managers are willing to throw you under a bus to get themselves out of trouble. You are penalised for everything possible and this results in them docking your wages. You are told about a wage increase each year but if your manager doesn't like you then they have the power to stop the rise!
bad,I assisted customers with making sure accounting was correct on their accounts. I also made sure customers had the correct services on their accounts. I had to deal with upset customers and try to sell them more products.
bad,"It was very unprofessional, I did not like working for them and they do not properly train their employees. If you ask for help the managers can't even help you."
bad,Some of the team leads where happy to work with there employees and helping them become the best employees and some where just there for the job......
bad,Trying to get help switching shifts and no one will help. Been on close shifts since i got the job. No matter how well you do on your stats you will still get close shifts cause you won't have enough tenure ever
bad,"Not great hours, managers that did not know very much about anything about what you supported. Managers did not want to deal with upset customers and wanted agents to pretend they were managers."
bad,"I didn't like the way staff members treated each other. Most of the time everyone was in a horrible mood which put others in bad mood. I left this job after they wouldn't let me take a personal day when my grandmother past way,"
bad,"its ok , job is very bad at payroll. I would not recommend this company to any of my colleagues. Its ok to start as a first job but nowhere near a career"
bad,"The entire company is poorly run. People have not received checks, the managers speak to the teams as if to belittle them. Very little job security and there was far too much drama in the work environment."
bad,"It was one of the worst jobs/experiences I have ever been through. So unorganized, a lot of favoritism. No one is professional. Had seen many offensive behaviors that had been reported but resulted in the employee loosing his/her job instead of the management."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Management rarely gives raises even if you take on more responsibility.  "
bad,"Honestly, this is the worst company I've ever worked for. It's about who you know not what you know and favorites get moved up. They end contracts with short notice and doesn't assist with moving you around in the company. I'm glad my time with them is over and I would NEVER recommend them to anyone... ever!"
bad,They mirco manage and they only allow certain employees to post out to job openings. The pay isn't great for the amount of work that they expect you to do. What is taught in training is different from expericences that you encounter on the phone. The have a bedbug problem and won't properly clean the faulty.
bad,Management showed some people favoritism. I wouldn't recommend someone to work there. I enjoyed the coworkers but not the environment.  Upper management treated people like they were in elementary school.  Didn't receive a raise in over 4 years.  Schedules were horrible. You had to care more about the customer service. When upper management never cared about the employees
bad,"My experience at Convergys was that they do not care about their employees. Paid time off could be canceled last minute, even if you had it approved months in advance. Managers had inappropriate relationships with associates."
bad,"I worked for the company that concentrix bought out, and while the way the company was not great. Concentrix came in and not only fixed what issues and complains that the employee's had. They changed and made things worse than they were."
bad,"The atmosphere is terrible. There is no talking at all, and if you do they will move you to a different area. They make promises they won't keep, and they like to not tell the whole truth about things. There are no pay increases, and they have ""mandatory"" overtime. So you think you are getting a Monday-Friday job, when really you work every Saturday all day. You also do not get the holidays you are promised when you are hired. They also have bed bugs and refuse to do anything about it because ""everywhere has them"". I'm trying to get out of there as fast as I can, along with a lot of other people."
bad,"I was working in the retention department, alot of upset costumers wanting to cancel services. I also helped costumers upgrade to another phone, and make changes on their count."
bad,Promises things that will never deliver on. Plays with when you will get your bonus and atmosphere is like highschool. Will not be looking to convergys for employment again.
bad,"Overall the people who are in management are incompetent, they never know what each hand is doing and its usually masturbatory. Its unfortunate because there are so many great agents there."
bad,this job is very unorganized and unprofessional i would never work at this job site ever again  they  office smell like weed and they never work with your schedule or anything and they will lay you off in a heart beat
bad,"its high school, nothing but drama!! no room to grow with company. so unorganized. making changes everyday. worst company ever! No sick days, vacation days. You get a write up if u have an emergency and call in and use your PTO!!! Its not getting ran right not to mention they have bed bugs"
bad,"I did not like this company one bit. The program that I had worked for was very unfriendly for customers and the staff did not correct it. While in training, I sat with multiple current employees, that while speaking with customer's treated them very poorly."
bad,They don't have the same pay today. The customers is ok. The managers suck. I would not want my worst enemy to work there. School is not important to them but they pretend it is in the beginning.
bad,"No active HR for 2+ years."
bad,"remote agent, this place is horrible. You barely can breathe in between calls about 100 calls a day. always training you for something new however, you never get a raise, or any other incentive other than work, work,work. No bonus."
bad,"Good training and strong culture but low salary and the shift doesn't help your life balance."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I prefer not to say what my opinion is about Converges. While I worked for Converges, customers called in about their Direct TV bill. Most of the customers were dissatisfied. There were many elderly people calling in complaining and crying that they were on a budget and did not want the charges applied to their bills. They just could not afford the cost."
bad,"This was not my favorite place of employment. I was tech support but I really don't feel like i was supporting anyone. You had to follow scripts which ultimately led to the same ending, schedule an appointment and charge the customer for something that isn't even their fault."
bad,"This job isn't a good place to work . They don't pay you the amount you should be getting , TL's , TM's are lazy , unprofessional and some disrespectful ! This job isn't the place for nobody. They grade your calls , they will have you working long hours & they do not care if you have children or not !"
bad,Hi is very helpful place and his my first job in bpo my experiences 2 year and I am working in aegis in Jamshedpur 1 year and I am very enjoying this place
bad,"Convergys will hire anyone, so it's nice if you need work asap. It's also an okay resume builder, if you have enough patience. Pay is barely above minimum wage. Manager positions are barely making any more. I figured I would need 2 promotions to make at least $50k. Obtaining those two promotions would take about 6 years, at minimum. My coworkers and I bonded over misery."
bad,"I started working at Convergys in Welland last year. I was told sales was a component of the job but there were no quotas or pressure. Once you're through training and on the floor, you quickly learn that sales is the only thing that matters to this company. Many, many reps were physically ill  due to being hounded by the coaches and some operations managers. This  place is a pressure  cooker  that affected my health and the health of many others. I would not recommend Convergys as a  place to work. Just about any other call center would be better. The coaches were nice, but they were pressured by the ops managers to pressure  reps for sales. The only good thing was,  you could get every other weekend off.  The  people you worked with were also excellent."
bad,"Met some great people whilst working here, that is about the only positive to take. HR are awful, recruitment sell a totally different job to you, all management care about is NPS (witch is pretty much impossible to get). The training is diabolical. Told you are going to be working 37.5 hours a week then they change it to 40 hours and lower your wage. Crack company, would not refer anyone into this job totally disgusting the way they treat there staff. Canteen is disgusting and over priced also."
bad,I hated this place soooo much! The supervisors provided you with NO support and were more than willing to let you take the fall. So glad it's gone!!!!
bad,Ok company to work for the management team can use some help the points system could change to better help the people with kids and family. parking could be better
bad,"Following training, was thrust into the deep end with no support on systems or product knowledge and a very sub-standard management team. Also still waiting for pay from February - we are now in May - due to ""issues with the payroll provider"", but really down to management/HR just failing to do their jobs."
bad,convergys make you feel like you are rushing a customer off the phone and not taking the time to listen and give great customer service. would not recommend. Training is also not good and information sometimes not always clear.
bad,Terminated for computer failure. Never wanted to look into the issue. Treated very unfairly here. Managers never show up to work so when you are a new employee they throw you to the dogs.
bad,"Management at the chattanooga location is terrible, thiis place does not make for a comfortable work environment and I it is a very dishonest company to work for,"
bad,This place really took the life out of living.  Call center mentality never got a raise in one year.  ask for time off and always got denied.  advancement was who you knew not how you did.
bad,"biggest regret in life to be part of convergys north edsa."
bad,The worst place I have ever worked... the management are so inexperienced and are very rude and unhelpful. There is no support unit what so ever. The HR is non-existent. Even if you are desperate I would advise you to keep well away from this place!!!
bad,"This is the worst company on the planet. If you don't keep track of your work they short your pay. They constantly promise you raises, more money  and better benefits but it never ever happens. Most people HATE working here!"
bad,this place is full of drama and management is horrible. the job is fun and easy but the atmosphere is horrible its a lot of petty high school drama they worry more about others than they job.
bad,"I didn't pretty much like working in here. Salary is very low and workload is huge. Culture is not so good as well. Overall, it was okay but I did not enjoy working here."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Only made it to the nesting period here.  Management was not very helpful and made you feel stressed.  Coaches actually threatened associates at a standing morning meeting.
bad,"The worst job I have ever had. To this company you are replaceable, just another robot for them. If you do not meet your targets there is pressure put on you, salary isn't good, very good commission if you reach it. "
bad,they didn't care about their employees at all. they were horrible people. you were just a person to fill a chair for them. they always acted like they can replace you so what does it matter. worst place ever. just horrible
bad,"if you enjoy being micro managed, apart of gossip, called out of your name, getting corrective actions for bogus reasons all while trying to maintain a mortgage or an apartment and car payments be my guest"
bad,"The location in Peterborough has management that doesn't know how to make decisions and they do not care about their employees at all. They do not currently even have an HR department and don't follow basic human rights."
bad,Do not work for this company. Call centers are not ideal but if you need another job take care of health if you choose this one. The managers are not nice and they don't pay enough for anyone to survive.
bad,"typical call center, no incentives. "
bad,under payed complete waste of time. force to change quick then expected right out of train. advised to falsely document reviews and support infastructure
bad,"I loved my job and would strive to be the best, and was promoted to team manager. I felt grossly underappreciated in this position and overworked. I never had job security even as a manager."
bad,All you do is sit and talk to people who complain about everything and on top of everything you have your TLs coaching you about everything as well telling you that you need to do this and that even though you do.
bad,"The experience was good to change directions for my career. The client that they had at the time was a in a different field than I had worked in, it was in technology."
bad,"Place with no advancement opportunities, bad management, changing bonus schemes, bad corporate culture. I started in a new projects, was promised many things, and over the course of a year, none of them were fulfilled."
bad,Concentrix is the worst place to ever work.  The compensation does not even come close to matching the job requirements.  The manager would make promises that would never come through.  This is the worst job I have ever had.
bad,"you are not prepared to work here if you are happy or wish to have a better life. do not apply for a career, apply for a set amount of money or time. This job will make you miserable and the pay is not worth it in the long run."
bad,"Extremely stressful job. People need to have alot of patience to deal with customers and having call after call for 8 hours +. And also deal with certain ""team leaders"" who like to get into employees personal lives and ask inappropriate questions. The whole ""12 points"" rule is not really fair. You could be dying in the hospital and they still give you the point for being absent. They treat employees like high school students."
bad,really stressful and management only cares about stats and not actually paying you what you deserve. training is like going back to high school and everyone is in cliqes
bad,"I have 5 different supervisors in as many months, no communication and terrible employee feedback!!!! I was also mislead about compensation and advancement opportunities"
bad,"This job is absolutely horrid. Training teaches you absolutely nothing, the managers are all rude (especially the head supervisor in the AT&T department), and the demands are horrible. They constantly berate you to make sales, and its horrible handling angry customers who are already screaming at you about the problem they called about. The managers will reprimand you if you are on the call longer than 6 minutes, and you will be yelled at every single day if you don't make good sales. They don't care about their employees, they care about numbers. This job is extremely stressful. The paycheck is nice, but the money is not worth the stress you'll endure. You also won't have much time to do anything after work because you need to be awake very early in the morning. The only good things I experienced from this job is meeting some nice coworkers. If you are considering working here, don't unless you are extremely proficient in a high stress work environment."
bad,all I have to say is that I loved the project BUT not the company convergys. Straight high schooler mentality... watch out for any kind of supervisors = set up.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Those in charge would play favorites, sometimes based on looks. The training was not up to par. Once we were trained, we often found that what we learned had nothing to do with what we were to be doing. Worst 9 months ever."
bad,"The Job Description title lies"
bad,"The Systems never work. The only way to advance is to brown nose. They mess your check and can't keep a contract. They just lost the biggest contract they had and are about to loose the other. I know, I work at the company that took both contracts."
bad,I would not recommend Convergy's to anyone.  The company pays their agents very low salary for a very high stress job. There is no in house IT department and all technical work is taken care of by overseas technicians.  Managers are difficult to reach and training is too fast.
bad,"Work on the Ford RAV account and have not had a raise since starting in 2014. Was told how much money they have made, but we never saw any compensation. Some people have not had raise since 2008. Looking for new job."
bad,rentention rate is too high and the work place is too cold. makes u fall asleep while trying to work. not enough pay or advancement in the company. it takes too long to make the big bucks.
bad,typical call center environment that has no consideration for family. You are treated as a number not a person while working there. They have a lack  in the flexibility of hours
bad,"A typical day at work as a team leader was avoiding the operations manager at all costs. Being sure to NEVER BE CAUGHT at my computer but still somehow get ALL COMPUTER WORK DONE. Then go to the morning meeting where you will never be a part of the club...boy howdy... they will let you know then berate and embarrass you publicly and personally EVERY DAY. Then go back to your desk to not be at your desk but complete all work and wait for the operations manager to step on the floor... I'm not even kidding... it made a call centers floor go silent. EVERY SINGLE EMPLOYEE knew someone was about to be yelled at by the OM in front of everyone on the phones until they cried, yelled back, and no matter what it would end in termination. HR, and the site manager are in on it too and lead you to believe someone cares. Which no one does. FLAT OUT MOST HOSTILE WORK ENVIRONMENT I HAVE EVER WORKED FOR IN 30 YEARS!!!"
bad,"They say all of the time that they promote within which is true they do do that however when an employee goes to interview after interview and just because your not living with someone in management or best friends with management you get passed up everytime. when you ask for feedback as to why they keep passing you up and they say well its not you, you are doing everything fine, then really what is it because to me its discrimination They have a good fun enviornment but they need new management that is not afraid to take a step in the right direction with on going issues of  current management."
bad,"Previously called ""Minacs"", now Concentrix, the company is essentially staffed by the same abysmal management team and army of dejected cubical drones hovering above minimum wage in a job where a technician in India has to approve bathroom breaks."
bad,"had an revolving door, constantly hiring but people were never there long. they never really wanted to work with your schedule. you basically had to fight for a particular schedule"
bad,no care factor high exceptations for low compensation.      lack of communication between management and front line agents regarding changes that will impact them.
bad,"this job is more focused on the client than the employee happiness"
bad,Very unorganized and unprofessional. The managers expect you to remain professional yet discuss out in open their party adventures and what they did the previous weekend.
bad,"This job has a turnover rate of 2 months.  Employees were either terminated or just simply didn't show up for work.  The pressure in this job was intense.  I'm glad to say that I wasn't one that got fired, I was one of the few they kept."
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone unless you like being paid to get yelled at by the management and by the customers. you are only allowed to use the rest room 30 mines a month. the worst job I have ever had.
bad,"This is a terrible place to work, impossible targets to hit and people don't show up for their shift so the people that do show up get slammed with calls. Nobody respects the company so they just do whatever they want, the building in Dartmouth has bed bugs too. They're to cheap to clean and people are at risk of taking them home. It's gross!!"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Shifts and breaks changed on a daily basis. I worked four weekends in a row, followed by 10 straight shifts in a row. "
bad,"This place is not a good environment. It seems like middle school and high school all over again. Anybody can get hired here. If you have depression, and/or panic and anxiety attacks, this is not the place for you,"
bad,"it was a good job but not interested the product"
bad,"It's a nightmare working there. They hire mostly ghetto people. It's always loud because the employees talking about their personal life/drama. The ""supervisors"" have no control over anything. No music. You can't go a single shift without aleast 5 people  evaluating your performance. Every single day its something new. Everytime I was there I felt like I was in high school all over again."
bad,"I would not recommend this place to anyone!!"
bad,"I remember I asked for a day-off a month before the date was going to take place....and one week before, my own Supervisor took it for him. Not a good place to work, typical call center."
bad,"It started off good but when I didn't meet the metrics one month, I got on a pip and micromanagement ensued. The average lifespan of an agent is 3 months."
bad,"The people on the floor were absolutely awful. Every day there would be at some point new drama to make the workplace even more toxic. "
bad,Not my best experience working at a call center. Training program didnt prepare for calls with customers. The team leaders didnt help much and I felt set up to fail.
bad,Customer service agent enjoy the challenge of solving customers problems. Bringing them from a very unhappy level to a more than satisfied level. Fast past multi screen environment
bad,"no apoyan el crecimiento de todos sus empleados, los ascensos se seleccionan entre un pequeño grupo de personas no calificadas, etc."
bad,This would only be a job for students that recently graduated. The managers are horrible and the pay isn't worth  unless your doing something other humana
bad,"Convergys is unorganized. 250 people are unemployed due to company not getting us our pharmacy techician licenses we need to take calls. I am still employed with the company but we are not getting paid, so I need to find a more reliable job."
bad,"You are just a number there and can be replace at any moment. "
bad,"Every single awful thing you've heard about call centers happens at Convergys.  The only time you will ever receive is a raise is if you get a promotion.  Mandatory overtime during holidays.  Only benefits you can receive are for a 401k with very low matches percentages.  Two 15 minute breaks per day, that you have to punch in/out for.  Unless you smoke, in which case you are allowed several more 5 minute breaks.  The managers are rarely more competent than the lower level employees.  Will be 'written up' for taking a bathroom break outside of the two 15 minute required breaks."
bad,The culture at Convergys was very cut-throat. Management never had the employee's backs when on a call. Upper management did not have concern or compassion for employees.
bad,Worst company I have ever worked for you have a problem HR will not help at all what a day off for personal reasons you have no hope the company has no respect for any of there workers and all together I would not tell anyone to go for this job
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,everyone has there own opinions and experiences working for convergys as time went on the company changed convergys has a high turn over rate thank you
bad,"Worked here for 6 months and the place is a joke! Long hours, schedule updates last minute with no notice, no weekends off, impossible to use your annual leave. If you don't use annual leave you loose it but the days you want never get approved! Salary always wrong. They deducted a 'cash loan' one month and have never advised what this was for! Bonuses are impossible to get. They constantly change targets so that you can't earn anything extra. I earned a bonus for most selling and this was never paid! "
bad,"On star Associate                                                                            Nov 2009-Nov 2011"
bad,"The worse place you could ever work for, horrid pay, clearly HR don't care about your health and mental state, your pressured into laying to customers, you do not receive holidays you are legally entitled to."
bad,"Not really applicable because they laid off the whole orem site, so not only did the pay suck but, now i have to find another job. What a wonderful place to get paid to do nothing"
bad,Very unorganized. Lack of proper training. Terrible pay. To many mistakes occurred while employed there with pay checks. Very high school experience. Very unprofessional.
bad,Providing members with information with their insurance and billing questions. There is not good job security and management really don't show concern for their workers and things that happen in a every day life.
bad,This is not a great place to work. They are not understanding of family issues and will fire you if you have to many doctor appointments. Best thing to do is not work here for a long time.
bad,The stress of this job almost killed me. You have management breathing down your neck. No matter what you have to make sales. They have a point system if you miss so many points you are you let go.I never understood what was going on with attendance. It is the stress of the job. It will make anyone crack.
bad,Don't keep up on their word on what they will promise you. Environment itself was horrible to work in. The managers did not seem to care or willing to help.
bad,worst place Ive ever worked. there was always payroll issues. seems as if no one ever knew what was going on. they don't care if your dying they want you there to serve the client.
bad,"daily call taking routine"
bad,"Working at concentrix was the worse experience ever,beat working at a grocery store being a courtesy clerk. Management has no idea what they are doing what so ever. No one helps there. Quick to fire,but never to help. The system there is a joke. A lot of harassment there,but nothing is done about it.."
bad,"This place is like high school only worse"
bad,"Seriously just don't bother!"
bad,Terrible training and terrible leaders.Bangladash does your sched and when u ask for certain hours forget it u get what they give you. worst place i ever worked.
bad,"It's a swell place to work if you enjoy high school drama and being micromanaged.  This is not a place to work if you have even the mildest form of anxiety.  Tons of pressure, very little support from the unprofessional, lazy management.  Management never gets their overweight booty up to help, never take escalated calls until the customer is beyond irate.  None of the managers are qualified to do their jobs, not one of them.  At Convergy's, there are losers at the top of the chain who promote unqualified losers to the leadership positions because God forbid have someone with some solid experience running the show.  Training was a joke here.  No pens or paper on the floor and that's a firm policy.  Personally,  I'm unable to retain information the way that they trained me.  Don't believe the positive hype that you're reading.      This place is a complete joke."
bad,"Did not really enjoy the environment. The management was decent. I've learned to be more open with others. The hardest part was dealing with angry customers, but became easier."
bad,Worst job I ever Had! Poor Training program. Unlawful treatment of Employees.Several HR issues. Did not treat Employees with Respect. A lot of  harassment in the work place.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,I started the company with Minacs. I had pay issues since training the company is so nonchalant about your missing money. They won't give you your check till the next 5 paychecks. The management is not structured. The rules are backwards. The company is not organized.
bad,Worse Company Ever will never go back I hated every day it made me depressed to work for them would never suggest this job to anyone. Don't waste your time they will run you into the ground.
bad,"You answer calls from customers, dealing with sales, technical, disconnects, or simple billing. The environment is not stable you do not have a set desk so be sure to sanitize everything. They will not work with your schedule for home life, no matter who you talk to. You can hardly use your own PTO you have obtained unless you are a team leader or higher. The only plus side is you do get roughly 12 absences before they fire you."
bad,This is a very depressing place to work. They hire management who have no clue what they are doing and its a lot of kids that work here. its all fun and games and no one takes anything serious.
bad,the workplace is filthy and it needs to get cleaned with a steamed power cleaner also the stench is extremely pungent it also is a soul sucking environment and is not worth the time working there. There also needs to a new change in management
bad,"it was not a good place to work, always being yelled at by customers and this place only gave there friends promotions and never gave"
bad,i just don't like the attitude of those who do the power trip in a newbie in the industry of call center. the experience forced me to find other bpo company.
bad,"Management was not very helpful. You were punished if you didn't get your mandatory upgrades or too many downgrades. Mandatory overtime was pushed on everyone even when you already worked a 40 hour week so it was hard to have a balanced home and work life. It was a stressful job as well because customers yell a lot, which you expect, but there was never a manager to take calls when needed."
bad,"No good. Bad management. depressing workplace. bad benefits. lame perks. "
bad,Wouldn't work here again if my life depended on it. I wouldn't recommend my dog working here. One of the worst low paying companies in Richmond Virginia.
bad,you sit around all day infront of a computer while you take calls from customers who majority of the time are beyond rude. lunch breaks are short. team leaders worry about themselves and agents positions are dispensable. With emphasis on making sales when  being told during training that sales are not the priority of the position applied for.
bad,During training certain people could get away with certain stuff. Management is so unorganized and unprofessional. Went in for an interview recently and they said I did good but did not bother telling me a reason why I was not a fit they are sketchy. And fake there is no reason why I should not have passed but they love to mess with people and are heartless so do not work for them its not worth the headache. They once again are a hire to fire place will only hire to fill the seats when corporate comes but do not care how hard you work and will over look you.
bad,Concentrix is one of the worst places that I've ever worked and I used to wade through chicken feces. The management doesn't care about the people that work there. They also don't give promotions to people that deserve them. They don't pay people what they are worth. So like I stated they are the worst.
bad,There is no respect for individuals nor advancement due to boy club atmosphere.  The management is invasive and intrude on employee rights.
bad,"Convergys strives to provide clients with the ability to consistently deliver exceptional customer service. Through customer management solutions, clients are able to reduce operational costs and increase customer satisfaction through technical support, outbound services, analytics and many other features. No matter the industry a company operates in, it is possible to boost customer management practices through Convergys industry-specific solutions. Many clients taking advantage of these solutions include those operating in"
bad,"The business is shocking from the ground level right up to senior management facilities are a joke management are horrendus salary is laughable fpr the work you have to do you never get your bonus when its earned they find ways of taking it off u your treated like  a nobody."
bad,Worst management I have ever worked under. Widespread incompetence and embezzlement which eventually lead to senior vice president appearing before a commons select committee.
bad,"New to town and was hired at Minacs. Lots of people, great group of people to train with but once out on the floor... Not a happy experience. Cut off from people, penalized for even the slightest social interactions."
bad,"Not very good training.  Not very supportive.  Sometimes you didn't know who your supervisor was. Basically, you were left out on your own after minimal training."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,I will say that the pharmacy information that is taught is priceless and will be great knowledge to take with you to achieve better
bad,"A typical day at work depending on what project that you work on at Convergys, you would begin taking calls. From this job I have learned patience through assisting customers with the problems/questions, dealing with the project that I was working on. Management here is horrible, at first the management is good, but after awhile the treatment of employees goes down hill very quickly, there is A LOT of favoritism at this job. The workplace culture is horrible, because of the favoritism, the work ethic of the place is outrageous because how the management treats issues that arise within the company."
bad,"They never fully paid me my commission and I was top seller by a large number.  there was no room to grow, when there was finally room and I became a sales coach, ATT left them and they fired 400 people...no severance packages"
bad,"Cant maintain any stability within company and its next to impossible to promote within company, always an issue going on within company and teams of company"
bad,"Everyday was a new experience, and something new to learn. They train you on everything you need to know, and they have multiple ways for you to ask. They have a very relaxing break room. The company is very secure, and they take safety seriously."
bad,"there were bed bugs, management never communicated with staff directly. money discrepancies in checks. the chance of getting terminated very likely..."
bad,"Working at Convergys isn't for everyone. It definitely wasn't for me. You sit in a little cubical all day speaking on the telephone to angry guests and rather than solving their problem, you sell them things that they don't need and can't afford"
bad,DO NOT go here looking for anything more than a paycheck. The company is a Joke. They spend money on all the wrong things and then wonder why they are failing.
bad,"After the training has completed you realise just how many lies have been told. management don't want to help their staff and want to do as little work as possible, they are also more inclined to talk down to their staff and do very little to help their teams achieve the bonus that you are told is so easy to get. No chance of progression unless you're best friends with a manager. Very likely to get fired once they need to get fresh blood in the doors unless you leave before hand of course."
bad,This company is a joke.  I worked for them for over 4 years.  No type of andvancement. Maybe saw one bonus since I worked there.  Had to Resign because my husband received a kidney transplant and they didn't want to give me fmla or emergency leave of absence.   Then when I came back to get my job back.  I have to wait another year while other former employees with more points then me were getting rehired.  My stats were always excellent but that didn't matter.  Manager sucks and they don't care about their employees.  I would not recommend this job to anyone.  They will screws you.
bad,"They will force you to work overtime without any consent or notice and do not work around someone's schedule. I was a student and they would schedule me to work while I was supposed to be in school and when the issue was brought to a supervisor, they said they would address it, however, nothing would ever get done."
bad,Convergys is a call center for DirecTV they have a lot of employees however they do not care about the health of their employees all they care about is their customers and the money that they can pull in which is wrong because without the employees they would not be pulling any money
bad,"This company makes you feel like you can be replaced in a heartbeat, the pay is horrible, the management is one of the worse I have ever worked with.I would rather be homeless than ever work for this company again."
bad,"I though this company had good compensation  for the applications that you take, but not that you had to lose it if you had an error on a phone call or something, but most everyone there was friendly and what not."
bad,"The management of Convergys is absolutly not worth working for.Even after dedicating 4 years of my career being a support of the team, haven' t got anything out of it.Just a waste of time and energy.They don't even pay well as compared to the work they make an employee do.There is no recognition for hard work..#CareerSpoiler"
bad,"The management is horrible, not willing to work with college schedules especially with online courses. The jobs not hard just extremely boring and the most enjoyable part of it is not working and leaving."
bad,it sucked very much I will never work for them again worst company I have every worked for will never go back and don't recommend anyone else to work there
bad,"Pretty fun at first getting to know so many new people and all that. Management seemed very positive and upbeat but it quickly becomes clear that this is all staged and nobody really cares. You'll start off in a class of 20 people and within a few months 90% of them will be gone. Those are the lucky ones. The remaining classmates still there will be dedicating their entire free time (what is left of it after the never ending ""extended hours"") to finding another job."
bad,They do not know how to treat their workers you are always replaceable. I would not recommend working at this job they are quick to throw you under the bus.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,The management hired is inexperienced and untrained to handle the type of atmosphere. It's not call center environment but regulated as one. rules and policies are not clearly stated or available for employee's. Hours and schedules are unfairly mandated and decreased due to unforeseen/notifiable management actions.
bad,Horrible company to work for. Very unorganized and the management is very unprofessional. Job duties that need to be performed or not conveyed to you until you are in your position instead of in training. Work Life is stressful always in jeopardy of losing their contract it was just a mess.
bad,I worked this job for extra money as I was a stay at home mom and wanted more to do. I did not feel like a valued employee but like a cell mate.
bad,horrible place to work. It is a job but nothing more. Management was awful not very helpful. you had to know people in order to get anywhere. Co- workers was very unprofessional.
bad,"Not worth the time. Low pay, little or no regard for employees, very low morale. It's better than not working, but that's about it."
bad,"At first Convergys seemed like a good working inviroment but I came to find the company is very disorganized didn't pay the employees comission pay on time, matter of fact they were months behind, schedules weren't out on time or hours were changed without being informed, HR wasn't professional they were never there and was useless when it came to asking them questions. I wouldn't recommend anyone to work for this company. Management is a joke they don't care for the employees."
bad,"Awful company to work for, very ""militant"" had to explain every toilet break. Fellow staff member was asked to bring in proof of his friends death when had day off for funeral. Middle management absolute bunch of clowns, Simon in particular on the o2 campaign. Absolute cretin. 5 staff members let go for not following script to the letter. High staff turnover. No wonder."
bad,"Garbage trash. hates the environment and the people. If you like to work for a third party and be treated like Trash, work here!!!"
bad,I worked at the location in lake mary Florida and it was terrible. I was on the apple care account and the managers and the people who work there was just terrible. They was always messing with your hours and pay. The training was for a month where they rush to push everything in you and when you hit the floor the managers never make time to help you at all and when you ask they get mad. It's a very very terrible place to work so run don't walk far far away from this company
bad,worst place ever don't work here even if you're desperate ever ever ever ever again never will go back sucks so much  hard job long hours very little pay
bad,Low management effort they also give you to much pressure on you. also they do not give enough training and the breaks are not well managed
bad,"low pay, no room for growth. they do not work with you regarding svchedules.. hard to get time off. they have favorites that get all the perks, and they work you to death. They dont pay as much as they should and you have to go through 8 weeks of training."
bad,"very unprofessional environment, not clean, too much work for too less of pay, a typical day of work was answering calls trouble shooting internet, phone , home security and cable"
bad,I worked in convergys and i ended up getting sacked for somthing i was not trained in as training was only for two weeks and while getting trained our tl had to go between two classes so keep leaving us to go to another calls and leaving work for everyone to do but no instructions on how to complete it. The pay is good if you get payed as wages were always wrong and when you asked about it the hr manager would just dismiss it
bad,Worked here for a while and a few years ago and the management is awful... customers constantly cursing at you and managers are complete a**hats and they never help you.
bad,The company itself sounds appealing. Once you work for the company you find out quickly how you are just a number. Micro managing is huge and is a hostel work environment.
bad,"The managers are a little bit up tight. The demands and restrictions seam a little bit extreme. Our class had a lot of broken promises, could have been because we switched training mentors. I wouldn't work here again."
bad,"This place is a joke. Constantly swapping desks, everyone was always getting sick. Management doesn't take efficient action when other employees lives are threatened. They hire any one. Very high turn over rate. You will lose sales because you need a managers approval and sometimes wait 45 minutes just so they can finish their conversation. People walk in there looking like they rolled out of bed. Terrible pay for the types of calls you have to deal with."
bad,The job was very unorganized. There was little room for advancement and it was very unprofessional. I would not recommend this job.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Convergys has a lot of problems. Some of the higher ups are amazing but most do try to get you fired. They ask to much of their customer care crew and will fire quicker than they can hire people.
bad,"So I worked for AppleCare chat, and while I loved my job (if it was just me, and the people I was friends with), the management did everything they could to make me hate coming to work. My specific team leader would call people out in front of everyone to mock them, and let them know just how bad he thinks they suck. The pay was great until you realize how much you have to do then you realize they're not paying you enough."
bad,Have worked in convergys Middleton for many years people are great but commission structures always changed to avoid paying commission basic is no where near enough to the amount of work you do they want you to be like zombies on phone and when commission or pay is not correctly paid you have to run around to get it sorted could take up to 3 months on average. Place is mostly run by women higher up in management all close friends and regularly in a mood bad attitude and take take there personal issues out on employees.
bad,"If you are considered a ""go for"" then you would not be allowed to better yourself within the company. You will be blacklisted by any OM or TL that hold a grudge against you. I have personally experienced this,"
bad,"They lure you in with promising incentives and benefits only for you to find out that you are not eligible. Lack of leadership and clear defined goals. Lack of resources and support leave employees confused and frustrated. Employees regularly take the fall for the failure of management and are often treated poorly or unfair. Training does very little to prepare for job duties. Often management ignore or overlook employees. Employees are often verbally abused over the phone but again the lack of resources, management and support basically leave you on your own. Management practices public reprimanding regularly often leaving employees feeling attacked personally. Employees who take advantage of the ""open door policy"" to speak with HR or upper management usually do not find a resolution."
bad,Mean managers. Will not work with you if need a day off. Tells you to come in even if you're getting sick. Managers think they are better than you. The only person I liked here was my GM who even quit after I left.
bad,"This company is very unprofessional and do not pay their employees. They currently owe plenty employees money for missing hours on checks. They do not communicate as a whole so if you do your part by communicating with the proper party and they do not communicate against each other, you will be at fault. They promise advancement but that is also a lie. The training there is horrible. They do not provide enough training to make you feel comfortable on the phones to service the client's customer. There is alot of empty promises at that place from pay being fixed, advancement, professionalism, etc. Whatever u want to call it concentrix or minacs, this is a horrible place to work for."
bad,For the work that is being done the financial compensation is not conducive to manifesting a stable home life. Unprofessional hostile work environment.
bad,False information provided to employees. Very unorganized. We have good employees and bad ones . management is unprofessional
bad,There is no support for you within the company. Their system is difficult to navigate. The pay is poor....................................................
bad,"There is no other way to describe the job, but as a call center position.  The training was very limited.  You are put on the phones with little knowledge of how Quick Books actually operates.  You are expected to retain customers that are already upset about the product.  If your calls are rated poorly you get ""coached"".  You can be at the top of the list for customer satisfaction one day and at the bottom of the list the next.  You get calls from customers that could have been put on hold forever or the last time they called they spoke to someone that did not speak English well.  The hours were promised as one thing and then I was expected to work 12 hour days with non consecutive days off the rest of the week.  They said no weekends when hired and then we started working Saturdays.  You are expected to time out even when you go to the restroom.  The call center is a big room with hundreds of people from all different departments on one floor.  We were working next to lawn care customer service employees and cable company employees.  The atmosphere is dark and dingy.  I really cannot think of one positive thing to say.  There is a huge turnover rate.  I would look elsewhere."
bad,My first job in Colorado. The company was great however the call center was like a high school environment. I switched jobs because of better opportunity
bad,"I will not refer anyone to join this company, There is no job opportunity and stability, no scope to learn and grow, work like donkey and be treated like a slave."
bad,The company is very unappreciative and backwards. The higher ups have no regard for what it is to work hourly and demand so much from people that is not their responsibility.
bad,"It's the last step to choose from as a "" job"". I just wondering if those companies hire Convergy as the vendor knows how this company run this business. They are horrible treat employees and customers."
bad,"Fortunately, I had a good supervisor. Unfortunately, he wasn't usually at work the same time I was. But most of the floor supervisors had an attitude, refused to take calls when the customer wanted a supervisor, and were lazy. NO ONE helps you with anything once you finish training and are on the floor. $9.00 per hour."
bad,"The work wasnt what made me irritated with this company , it was the people who was running it. it was so unoragnzied that i was doin more work than what i was paid for and it became a problem when i asked about it. i loved making the donuts."
bad,"answering calls on a multi line phone system to help customers with troubleshooting, account and billing maintenance, product information, customer service, data entry, payments"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,The team member didn't help at all . they were all rude. And AT&T period screws over there customers . good pay and that's about it for that comolany ..
bad,Hours were intense. Virtually no support and bonuses were nearly impossible to achieve. Floor staff came across rude. Center closed.
bad,"Covergys is a very fast paced environment, which i do enjoy.They give you the opportunity to learn new things. The customer's for the department I worked in were awesome & I was allowed to use the customer service skills i acquired over the years. My co-worked (immediate) were some of the best group of people I ever worked with. They were very helpful.The hardest part of the job, was learning how not to bring my work home with me. I am always thinking of new ways to better my  self and performance. The most enjoyable part for me, were my customers. There were times when my day started out rough and customers always brighten my day up. I never really had bad customers even when i am having a bad day. I love customer service. It is my opportunity to help someone to either be happy or to feel a whole lot better. That is the most enjoyable part of the  job to me."
bad,"Don't get me wrong, I love my job. But that's it. I love MY job. Minacs is an awful company to work for,which is why the Detroit branch shut down. They sent the supers from the Detroit branch to our branch in Richmond, Virginia, fired EVERY efficient mgmt employee, and the place has been a shambles every since. The team leads are extremely disrespectful, they have no sympathy, and they dock your pay for restroom breaks. They've hired every non junkie in the Richmond area, then fired them because they didn't train them correctly. They rarely do rehires, and you have to do some over the top act such as sneaking into the ""secure"" building to run management down and bark on them while they're on the production floor, in order to even get considered. ""Appropriate"" sops are not enforced, the employees dress like they're headed to a strip club to clock in, or in their pajamas like they're preparing to turn in for the night. They beg people to work overtime but won't offer them more pay as they did in the past before the management overhaul. They spend the company funds to throw brunch parties on Sundays and parade the food through the production floor(which by the way has big rats), then brag about how they don't feed phone agents. The team lead was caught smoking marijuana and was not terminated. The only time they spruce up is when they know an express scripts representative is doing a walk through. If you aren't desperate, continue your job search, you'll waste about 3 weeks of your time deciding that you should have. Oh, and half of every check will be taken out for their shoddy"
bad,Converg'ys est une entreprise ou il faut rien dire( surtout si on vient de chez Orange) si on à des compétences que d'autres à pas on est vite catalogué de plus j'ai eu un formateur qui m'as fait de l'harcèlement morale et sexuelle et quand on veut porter plainte on se fait suivre par les employés...c'est illégal
bad,"I worked in the Derry ~ Londonderry site and it was the worst work environment I've ever been involved with. TLs were awful, never would take a 'manager call', never cared about how you were getting on all they care about is STATS!!!! Have never felt so small and embarrassed in a work place as some of those TLs and even Ops managers made me feel, they mess up your pay, don't care about you as you're just a number to them, only want good stats and mess you about constantly being switched between teams! Horrible place to be in with horrible people in charge."
bad,"Avoid working for this company at any cost. They make all kinds of promises, but mistreat you and lie to you constantly."
bad,Not a good well trained environment. Not a clean environment. Better management. Not a good environment to continue to be positive.Very stressful no employment appreciation and  no enthusiasm
bad,I do not recommend this company to anyone.  The management is horrible.  The company is horrible.  No wonder the turnover rate is so bad. I hate waking up everyday just knowing I had to be at this place.
bad,i did not like this job and would not recommend it to anyone who is trying to find a career.  Company has no empathy for employees an they micro manage which makes it difficult for you to believe anything any manager says.
bad,"this place is ran more like a prison."
bad,"This company lies. They care nothing about employees. The benefits are expensive. The pay is low and I have not recieved a raise in 8 years. They now will dock your break if you have to go to the bathroom. And they set your breaks about 4 hours apart. So if you have to go to the bathroom within that time you loose part of your break. The job is extremely stressful so breaks are badly needed to regroup. But this company could care less. Always criticizing your work as to them you can never do a good enough job. People please do not work for this company. If you are Canadian and I am they try to make you work according to American labor laws. "
bad,Unorganized company but need lots of diverse and new people was able to expand in the company with a lot of dedication and hard work
bad,"subjective and inconsistent reviews. Cut-short, incorrect, and time-wasteing training. Dirty and unsafe work and break areas. No product updates provided.  Poor communication."
bad,"Seriously wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy. No scope for advancement, failing on promises on a regular basis, constantly and i mean constantly having management on your back demanding updates on your stats throughout the day, just pressure thats not needed, job is stressful enough."
bad,"Company has zero regard for your personal well being. They are a third party site, meaning they take on contracts to pay you less than what the actual company they are representing would pay you. They collect the profits and keep workers on welfare and foodstamps. Run away as fast as you can. If you work in the sales department be prepared to work on a draw. 9 dollars an hour but when you receive enough commission that goes away."
bad,convergys  is a great place if you want to expand your experience  in customer service. but it is not for people if you have a hard time of getting yelled at I deal technical support and with that you will have a lot of outrage costumers. management is okay but they can be litter bit better. some days are hard and some days are real easy.
bad,I did not work here long enough to have a long review for job. At the beginning it was a good place until favoritism was showed. When that was diplayed i packed my things and left.
bad,"Ga hier nooit maar dan ook nooit in je leven werken, zij zullen je op elke manier proberen te manipuleren, onderdrukken en te verstikken."
bad,"They pay peanuts as Salary. They wont give you hike as well."
bad,"Waste of time working here place is full of idiots "
bad,"I was originally hired on as a seasonal employee and was soon hired on as full time. I was able to move departments quickly and while it was a great experience, the company outsourced and I found out that it is no longer active."
bad,"They have a lot of turnover and there is a reason for that. They don't care about their employees. They have unrealistic expectations. My training class wasn't even taught how to sell at all. We were given the impression that we wouldn't have to sell because we were in the billing department. We had to sell once we hit the floor and we were criticized and written up for not making sales. The small amount of training that we were given to help us with sales, it was very confusing, we were told different things by different people."
bad,Run from this place all they do is lie and put you down long hours and bad pay also bad benefits so if you are looking for a really bad job then this is your place
bad,I cannot give a fair opinion of my experience with the company. It has been many years since I have been employed there and I was employed with the startup in my location. The lack of communication and understanding of day to day activity needed improvement.
bad,"This place is terrible they lie about everything in the interview."
bad,"I grew to dislike the job, the culture change and the merger happen and the workload increased with no help in site from management"
bad,"Working here was soul draining and very mentally exhausting. First off, majority of the customers are very unpleasant. The rudeness from customers can be bearable if minacs had a good support system but THEY DON'T!!! It's all about kissing butt. Everyone walks around like they have a chip on their shoulder and the atmosphere is very tense. They are going to lie to yo and say it is a fun place to work, don't believe them please run. The money is not worth it"
bad,"Corporate downsizing lead to a sudden loss of employment. The environment was great while it lasted however. I learned a lot, and miss the AOL days."
bad,"I started working in Concentrix in 2007. The place was named GEM. GEM was a call centre, a company I wouldn't recommend anybody to work for, but definitely not discourage anyone to work for. It was a job, a chance to gain some work experience in the customer service industry. No more, no less..."
bad,"No Support , Lies by the TL, No support and expect to perform well."
bad,"a good introduction, but very low salary and training lacks materials, techniques to educate agents and no more comment."
bad,its h*ll on earth dont wok there even though im out of work right now i still wouldnt go back to them unless you are a management favorite dont try an advance
bad,"This place is pathetic, the scum of the earth. A bunch of lyer unprofessional lazy people. Very unprofessional, unorganized, no one knows what they are doing. The operational manager is a crook. The work floor is filled with a bunch of miserable unhappy people. These people tell so many lies it's pathetic. Checks not right, these people have some many complaints with the labor board it's sad! The pay is laughable. You looking for a career your not going to get it, it's a job! Don't do it you will be highly disappointed. Oh yeah and HR is going to side with upper management."
bad,This is honestly not a good opportunity. Pure negativity in the entire company. Don't apply here unless you are interview pain! Extreme Pain!
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"It looks like the company is leaving their own reviews on here so I will be as honest as I can do you and tell you the truth... From the very start the training is not much they expect you to teach yourself about their systems. After you get moved from department to department you'll find that most managers are literally kids with no life experiences or people skills on how to treat or speak to staff. you will also find that they have only been there a few months and practically know nothing about the business which is why they treat you like your back at school. Wages are never right and almost impossible to make bonus as they change the targets mid month to ensure not that many will reach bonus. you will most likely always be on a late shift which is roughly 12-8 every week including 9 /10 hours shifts and you will only get 1 weekend off a month as the rota department can't even do their jobs right in here either. Most of my dealings with the HR department here have also not been good they never do anything you ever ask them to do and also like to make things up as they go along and cover for the managers and the things that goes on here. And make you feel like you are invading their space when you go into the HR office."
bad,the hardest part of this job was dealing with the customers on the phone and there was too many ppl working there were many days when I would come in and there wouldn't be a place to sit or park they hired to many people for the building space they have.
bad,a typical day at work is very non structured and chaotic. management is very clueless and disconnected with agents. the most enjoyable part of working would probably be knowing you have a paycheck coming.
bad,"Let's start with a very clear example of how Concentrix deals with their employees."
bad,"This company has a huge turnover due to mismanagement, unpleasant work environment, unpredictability of each level of what is expected from you day to day, and poor pay compared to similar jobs."
bad,this is a great company to work for. i enjoyed working there. great supervisor work culture. they help me a lot. i highly suggest you check out this company
bad,There is no work life balance. Management often times REQUIRE that you work weekends in addition to the sometimes 10-12 hour workdays. It is also the custom to work during your approved time off/vacation.
bad,"If you like to get paid on time without having to constantly ask if the next paycheck will be correct and on time then this is not the job for you!!"
bad,This is the worst company I have ever worked for. The turn over rate is awful and let me tell you why. They threaten to fire you daily. The managers scream at you and you are verbally assaulted and harassed daily by customers over the phone. The company does not care for their customers or employees whatsoever. I watched so many coworkers forced to leave work early in tears because of how either a manager was treating them or a customer.
bad,"you will not get paid so do not waste your time. I am not the first and I know I am not the last. They say you will get paid on Friday but you will not, Its more like 4 or 5 days later. I wasted my time with this company. The trainer I had was not a good trainer he will tell you to ask questions but when you do he will fuss about how behind the class is and start to ignore questions."
bad,"Okay so we know that call centre work is monotonous, boring and can be demoralising but that is not Convergy's Derry's fault."
bad,"The best thing about this place is the break room. They make mandatory over time hours and constantly lose track of hours worked for employees during those times. Place is dirty and it is very hard to stay in good health due to many sicknesses floating through building with no real cleaning done to vents, etc..."
bad,"I worked at this company for almost 8 months. During the time of training I started with about 25 people. When I began taking calls only 10 people remained from the training. When I left the company it was only me and one other person from my training. Thats how fast people were quitting this company. The hourly pay and  commission is terrible, you will barely get commission (less than $50) because MAJORITY of the customers are calling to cancel there accounts because AT&T is over priced or a store rep messed up someone account. The management does not give good support they only complain about making numbers. They hire young kids out of high school and there is no dress code, so you will see people dressed any kind of way (unprofessional). Do NOT waste your time applying if your looking for a REAL job that you can get paid good money and advance in the company."
bad,"My time here was LIMITED! It's so ghetto and unorganized. They throw you on the floor to take calls with limited training. The pay is horrible for the job that you have to do. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone, it's definitely not for a adult with responsibility!"
bad,"Although my time wasn't best, I did meet some great people through this company. They are a 3rd party agency who could use a serious upgrade in the management department. For weeks I was pulled into meetings and told to tell how wonderful everything was going until one day I walked in and was informed to gather everyone on the floor. At that very moment unannounced to any lead or manager with the exception of the OM, we were informed that the contract had been pulled and the packaged for unemployment were on the desk as you exit the building. I was not let go at this time, but many were, and those who did not make it in that day were not informed that they didn't have a job."
bad,"Great customer service training but everything else sucked."
bad,Worst place ever. They mess up your check andpromise you bonuses for overtime. The management is very unprofessional. They don't do their job and just hang out in the hallway.
bad,"This place was a HOT MESS. I got paid late every pay period. I worked a month with no access cause for whatever reason. I got paid for nothing, so that was cool. People there are ghetto, smoke weed, do other drugs at the job. The morale is low cause the people that have good work ethics are stuck dealing with kids who don't respect themselves, let alone anyone else."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I have worked for Convergys 4 months now, and I can honestly say the job is great for someone with zero ambition or life goals. The low pay ensures a steady supply of ""hungry"" and obedient workers. The carrot on a stick is a lead position making more money,which are far and few between. Team Leads spend their days trying to motivate 300 pound losers into sounding happier on the phone while the 400 pound American yells at you because their ""internets"" are not working."
bad,terrbile company terrible management terrible standards and unprofessionialism everywhere its hard to work there unless you are in need of a job and a job that pretty much hires anyone.
bad,"The workplace is a loud environment with terrible team leads for support. Poorly kept, and dirty building. I was there for 7 months, and found myself less then thought of when it came to personal loss. Had to make multiple reports to the labor board for their illegal acts of discipline and lack of documentation they use for reports."
bad,"Makes for a long day when you're new. The hardest part was trying to decipher accents over the phone, as well as what the problem was."
bad,They don't even look at your resume. Your over qualified? To bad you get the same pay... Wich is 9.50 btw. With working weekends. The call center itself is ghetto. Don't even bother!
bad,Convergys was just like any other call center. Under paid and over worked its advisers inconsistent in policies and procedures.
bad,"Management is a joke how the business makes any money "
bad,believe the reviews you see it is not a joke this is the most unprofessional company i ever worked for. they dont pay you on time they lie to you about benefits you will receive if you work overtime and still dont pay you. they mess with your hours for personal agendas and it doesnt have to be your agenda it could be your superior but your on that team you get knocked as well. Wish i would of denied the job after reading the reviews like the my mind told me to but i warn you
bad,"Horrible place to work! really really really really horrible place to work! Maybe if you enjoy walking the incompetent through mundane tasks, or being consistently yelled at for something you can't control - or being treated like garbage by ""supervisors"" and ""Team Leads"" who power trip at every chance they get, or act as if if you should praise them like they are a god - you might...MIGHT like to work for Minacs"
bad,"Stay away from this company if you have a family and other things in life then to dedicate your life to Minacs. They will fire you for anything and there is no proper channel or protocol when terming someone. They pay is horrible, no good management and hr is a joke. Stay away from this place."
bad,"No one knows anything at this company.  One hand doesn't know what the other is doing.  PTO time has never been calculated correctly and no one knows how to fix it.  Management rarely speaks to the employees, just not personable at all.  They also has no earthly clue what the agents or Coaches do.  They allow the Team Leads who are clueless to make suggestions about how the floor should be ran when they do nothing but time & attendance and take smoke breaks.  I have never known a call center that has supervisors that don't take supervisor calls.  Isn't that what you get paid for?  Don't go to HR to complain because they will always side with management, whether they are right or wrong.  Jobs are created for individuals suck up to management.  If you disagree with anything that management says they send you home.  Yet they can't come on the floor and do the job. "
bad,"I usually don't write reviews but i had to with this one. I recently relocated when Concentrix offered me a position, first of all, no where in the offer letter did it state that this was a temporary position. Basically after working there for less than a month, i was let go. Had to interview for a whole other position that didn't start in 3 wks! So i was out of work for 3 long weeks. Got hired for the new position. they send out an email that said first come, first serve near the start date so basically some people who got hired and offered the position would not have a position because unfortunatly there wasn't enough seats! this place is very unprofessional. Did not get all my pay either so I worked OT for nothing. "
bad,"its GHETTO they higher anybody that goes on an interview. people fight there all the time. everyone that works there do drugs, lots of other people there sell them.. and im not talking about for express scrips. every building they work in the other companies in the building do not want them there.... people has been caught having s3x in the stairwells and the parking lot, they smoke everywhere other than the smoking area.. they are soo rude DONT WORK THERE,  correction use them for the one month training for that free check than leave."
bad,Shadiest call center I've ever been apart of .The payroll is screwed up constantly most my reps were missing pay every pay period and it took months to get resolved. Upper management lies often will not tell employees if there contracts will be renewed. They closed the Atlanta branch and Colorado branch Without given reps even a two week notice .employees showed up to work and doors were locked .I personally know 5 people who have won lawsuits through EEOC and a few others who have filed discrimination lawsuits against the company.
bad,Learn a lot from this job as technical wise. A learning experience that I won't forget. Wish they pay more for the work they have us do.
bad,They change your schedule the day before you are supposed to work and tell you you have to work it or else.  Management is awful. They don't care if you are getting paid properly or not.  I was cheated out of $5 an hour for the month of April and nobody seemed to care.  Coworkers were great  and taking care of the customers was ok too it was just the so called management that needs to learn a thing or two about running a business.  And they wonder why they can't fill even 1/3 of the building.  Treat your employees better and maybe you could.
bad,"This place was like a Sweat Shop and Some of the Management should have never been put in place."
bad,"This is a company I wouldn't recommend to anyone.  The pay is pathetic.  "
bad,I can honestly say all around the worst experience of my life and that is in all aspects. They steal your time worked by saying u took long lunches or breaks when u didn't.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"If you want to feel like a slave then this is the job for you. Unfair policies, unfair supervisors, incomplete rules that only apply temporarily. Family Medical Leave will not be guaranteed and you will be prosecuted for your supervisors mistakes."
bad,This is the worst company I have ever worked for. Human Resources  Marcia Frost to be exact was by far the most unorganized and unreliable I have ever seen or heard of. My second pay check from concentrix was a week late and they tried to place fault on me. Short term disability benefits were not paid to me and there was no assistance with receiving them. They will lie to you to eliminate any fault of their own and they just do not care about their employees at all!
bad,"There are days where your left crying and don't have time to pick yourself up as there are less than 12 hours before next shift and you've to try and spend most of that time sleeping , shifts always given out a few days before so if you made plans a week ago you've to scrap them.. Have to book years in advance to get holidays approved, get in bother for the stupidest of reasons.. Management is awful, they do not care, trust me. Favouritism is what they are about, someone close with the managers would get promoted with no good stats to back in up before a well qualified guy with good stats has a chance to apply. Really awful business."
bad,"I worked for this company for a few yrs it is a pay cheque .That is all it is. Management sucks, they work you like a dog and do nothing for you.Once you sign on  you pretty much never leave and it is rare you work 40 hours .They always want you there and never allow you to have time off."
bad,"This is by far the worst place I've ever worked for.  No notice on mandatory overtime, they lengthen and shorten lunch breaks as they see fit for call volume without any notice.  They refuse to accommodate to any work/life balance needs.  They underpay everyone, and wonder why they have such a huge turnover rate.   They tell their customer (Intuit in this case) that everything is fine and everything is going as planned, when there's chaos and problems on the call center floor.  HR lies about the position expectations.  They hire in saying that the call center hours are M-F 8-8, when they make you work Saturdays as well.  When you take a ""paid"" break, they make you clock out, and they do not pay you for that either."
bad,Keep the typical day far far away if you work in Concentrix. You will only Galiya(Slang words from here). Here the management is pain here.There is nothing to enjoy here. No one heard for employee's convenience.
bad,"In my short stint with this company, I have to admit that there Communications Skills as well as their Product and Specifics Trainings were one of the best if not the best in the BPO industry."
bad,"The list is to long to discuss at this time, if you have other job offers I would take them before working there. That is all I have to say."
bad,"I applied to the position of Email Support Advisor, which entailed assisting customers via email. During day 2 of training, we were asked to sign a form stating that we would become Phone Advisors if required. The only options were to sign the form, or quit. My training class signed the forms under the reassurance that this ""most likely would never happen."" Fast forward a few months and we are told we need to be trained on phones as well, but that it won't be permanent. Another month later and we are converted to Phone Advisors without a choice (other than to quit.) Job is high stress and confrontational at times, and your schedule, bonus opportunities, job performance, and job security are based mostly on the outcome of customer surveys. Even if you did your job, or went above and beyond for the customer, it doesn't matter as long as they give you a negative survey. Not to mention, every day you come into work, it's hard to find a station without a missing or non-working mouse and/or keyboard, forcing most people to use their own money to buy these tools in order to do their job. Scheduling is based on your stats (again, based on your customer feedback) and seniority, making it difficult to work shifts that allow for any social or family time. For example, I was stuck working 3pm-11:30pm every shift during the 9 months I was there. If customers are causing you stress or being abusive, there is no emotional support from management. Unless you have a doctor's note, they don't care. Holidays never allow for an extra day off. If you take a Stat holiday off, you have to work one"
bad,"This is the worst place in Welland to work. They want top notch employees but only pay a little above minimum wage. They advertise that you can make up to $15 per hour with performance bonuses, but their system is set up so that they find a reason not to give you the bonus. If you get a commission for selling something, they make sure they take 2 months before it shows up on your pay. I guess they hope you quit before they have to pay it. Very shoddy practices. Greedy greedy greedy team leaders that want to make money off you for doing nothing. "
bad,"very long tiring working hours without any break."
bad,"From top to bottom, Concentrix lacks organization. They have ZERO structure and have no employees are held accountable, coached, developed, etc. The only time you will meet with your boss is when they are releasing you."
bad,"I worked there for a little over 3 months, and i hated it. You get paid 11 dollars an hour which attracts a ton of people but its not worth the headache. The management there is awful and hard to work with. I also needed HR to sign some papers for me and they NEVER got it done. They are just awful to work for."
bad,"terrible company to work for, very unorganized, pay roll issues, and the list goes on and on. Management does not care about their employees, there is a lot of favoritism going on there and also co-workers sleeping with one antoher and so on."
bad,"this was the worst place to work. At first it was okay, but then management changed, people were being let go for no reason.Then they would hire very unprofessional people tht didn't care about there job. The only thing I loved about working there was working in the training department. That was a good position."
bad,Temp position that was not suitable to my future goals. Unable to progress in a way that would benefit my job and future so once offered employment had to decline.
bad,Not recommended Minacs. The company doesn't pay for what they request. The most enjoyable part of the job is the co-workers.
bad,"These people need shutting down, they are operating illegally."
bad,"Minacs Group"
bad,"This is not the company to attach your career goals too, this company is ran like a mom and pop store. they're constantly changing rules and HR is awful. you can never get a clear understanding of what is asked of you and the training they offer isn't suitable for the task your expected too do. no one respect the dress code that's in place or the supposedly drug free work place"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"It's simple, really. They didn't pay me for 2 days' wages and there was no process available to handle it. Contacted all available managers (total 5 people, including the Site Manager), and 2 pay periods and a letter of resignation later, I still haven't been paid."
bad,"This place will hire anybody, so the job is not very good. Neither is the pay or benefits or culture or workplace environment. The job was difficult and required a college semester's worth of learning."
bad,Looking for a change. Not a place to work to further your status in life. Poor management. Poor systems. Lack of professionalism. Inconsistent.
bad,"I find it very interesting that they are still hiring people for the Norcross location when the doors close PERMENANTLY May 7th. And the Boulder site has already closed. Seriously Concentrix?? Promising people a job when they have bills and sometimes kids, knowing wholeheartedly, there is NO logevity with this rapidly failing company. Please everyone...DO NOT APPLY @ CONCENTRIX."
bad,was awful the job itself was not good and would never recommend it to anyonelllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
bad,"Work was horrible"
bad,"This is more of a job for a senior in high school or a freshman in  college with not children or spouse. The pay is very low for the hours they require you to work. Also, it is difficult to constantly have to work alternating schedules if you have children. One more thing, no one has their own desk..."
bad,You get yelled at by angry customer complaining that they don't have any money and you get blame that it's our own fault that their credit is too small then you try to fix the problem in the calmest way possible and then customer still are unhappy with your service. No job security if ever your were sick or deeply hurt in any medical or personal way you had to go in to work if not you had to go in and bring a doctors's note but they could still make you work. One of the hardest thing is taking a calll while co-workers are laughing and talking too loud behind you
bad,this is the worse company I have ever come in contact with nothing they told stood true they took 4 months to pay me for hours worked was told a lot of lies and mislead
bad,This job put me in the hospital 40 times in the space of less than a year with no paid leave and constant threats of termination.
bad,"I loved resolving customers issues with their phone bill. a great experience talking to other people across the world. I didn't like the sales, job was way to big on sales,and I'm not a sale person"
bad,"this is a horrible place to work. training is 5weeks of training yourself. no one wants to help, your paychecks are always wrong, you will NOT get your raise on time and the system is so horrible that there is a huge delay in your benefits. BEWARE of this company.. the team leads are disrespectful and talk to you like you are stupid.... I hated this place.."
bad,I feel like my training was terrible. we were not prepared for the work that was expected of us. When there were additions made to the company we wernt trained properly then either. Employees are under a lot of pressure. i always had a headache until i made it home.
bad,"wasn't the best place to work, didn't feel valued and was too much pressure on selling and not on standards."
bad,Don't even think about it. Im still waiting on back pay that was owed to me while I worked for the company. Training is horrible & you have to move up one a line of business without given an option.
bad,"Operations manager thinks he is better than everyone else. Supervisors have questionable relationships with Reps, the Marijuana smell is SO loud right in the parking lot. Management caters to the people who support their personal agenda which has nothing to do with work or the product. INTUIT must have just went with the lowest bid and did no vetting whatsoever on this one. The training was worthless and they must have recruited from crack dens or the local jails."
bad,"This is not convergys that I started working for 10 years ago. As the company expand and grow, the benefits, salary and management become bad and sad. Many are dissapointed how convergys has change for the worst. not a company i can be proud of and recommend."
bad,"I worked here for a few months... I had worked nights (which I did love) but I kept getting underpaid, never got my overtime hours or any of my bonus pays that I was suppose to get because of ""Miscommunication"".  Management was very disorganized and if they loose a contract your are out of luck.. This was down right the worst place I have EVER worked at. If you won something they would give you something used. I dreaded going into work every day, they did not care about their employees like they say they do. They screwed me over countless amount of times. Their is a lack of communication. They don't inform you of anything until the very last second. Not very satisfied with this job at all..."
bad,Takes advantage of their employee's and asks them to stretch their morals to sell erotic television to people. It was really troubling to me.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,this employer never has paid for overtime nor regular hours. This is the worst company I have ever worked for in my life. I will never recommend any to this company.
bad,"I do not want to have my name attached to why this place can be a nightmare for you and your family.... All you need to do is do an internet search and you will find just maybe 0,01% that is wrong with that company!"
bad,"Payroll was constantly messed up at this job. 3 or 4 consecutive training classes all got half checks on their first check at the job. "
bad,"Convergys is interested in one thing... sales... Do they tell you at the beginning that it is a sales job? Nope. They tell you it's customer service, yet they don't care about taking care of the customer, they just want the customer's money."
bad,So after working for this company for a year I can say that the environment and the way they run the business does absolutely nothing for the employees. I worked for the Dell Prosupport department when I used to be employed there. There was constant issues when it came to just doing your job. Example the tools being down to log calls sometimes for hours on end. Do they care no take more calls. There was no room to grow you get one pay raise and then you're stuck there are no promotions no more pay raises no bonuses nothing. They did nothing to keep the staff at the location I saw people left and right walking out because they couldn't deal with this company anymore. I eventually walked out as well due to overwhelming amount of stress and upper management only caring for themselves.
bad,"Simply the most evil place I have ever worked... Paychecks were never right, they never fixed them, bonuses were lies, They promise you paid time off and never let you take it and then disallowed all hours accumulated since they terminate 98% of their employees within 6 monthes of hiring.  The place is a hiring factory and there is no help from above.. I have never been treated so poorly in my entire life.. Wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy... Run if they try to hire you.....They should be indicted for unfair slave practice!"
bad,Their payroll department is awful! They are constantly messing up our checks!! No one ever give you the same information! You have to log out of your phone when you go to the rest room!  Training has NOTHING to do with the calls you receive!
bad,"After completing training, I realised I'd have to be on the phone while my husband was asleep or needing to eat. A wife cannot let a soldier get woke up by phone calls or go hungry! Not what I was promised!"
bad,"The greatest thing about working there is that you are truly accepted. Heck it's common to see a co-worker in their manly form on Monday and return on Tuesday as a full woman (and even use the women restroom). But if you're looking for a job that doesn't pay correct, staff is not properly trained and site leaders and operations team have no understanding of how things work then this is the job for you. Environment is not professional, not family oriented and basically everybody doesn't know if you ever need help."
bad,Worked with them only in training. Everyone that was in my class were very awesome. I still haven't received my last check from them. They won't tell me anything. I can't find a number to call them. All I have is a cell number to the recruiter.
bad,I was making thousand dollar commission checks and they started to complain I was taking too many calls!  At a call center!  Then I was informed my employment was terminated due to unrelated issues that made little sense for the level of punishment.  Didn't give me my verbal!or written and went straight to out the door.  If I could do zero stars I would
bad,"Spent 2 weeks training then into the call centre, The place is full of college kids who constantly swear, put callers on hold because they cannot be bothered speaking to them, Management no help at all, I was initially told it would be a monday to friday job and my first shift after training involved a saturday and sunday, Rubbish salary and almost impossible to get the commission,"
bad,"Don't apply here they take everybody and when you show that you're there all the time and always ready to work on time they do ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to show you they appreciate your time and commitment, don't ever think they'll change anything for you because they won't it's just an awful place to work."
bad,"I liked the schedule but very unprofessional and unorganized and hard to get help with anthing"
bad,"This job is horrible.  The minimum pay is not worth the long hours and huge stress.  It was so bad that it forced me into depression and i had to leave.  Impossible to hit commission and they  fire you if you don't hit targets.  "
bad,"Convergys is a 3rd party call center that is more worried about filling seats than they are about training the people correctly. They don't care about their employees. Anytime an issue would come up at work regarding my kids(i'm a single mom of 3 kids) their responses was not there problem i had to figure it out. they don't communicate anything with there employees. they run about 3 months behind on pay out on their bonuses. which was kind of useful since i was still getting paid for the next 3 months after they fired me for no call no show because my maternity leave was denied AFTER I came back to work for 30 day. they are a sneaky and shady company. they also do not believe in do raises. they will do the yearly evaluation to make sure your doing your job right but they won't give you a raise. so you can literarily still be making $10/hr after you have been there for 1,5 or 10 yrs... unless you get a promotion to supervisor."
bad,"This company hired me for specific hours and then due to their own inability to hire, they initiated ""required overtime"". As in ""not optional."" If you couldn't work the hours, you were penalized. I quit the job and not one of the three people I exit interviewed with mentioned that if I quit before the last payday in this month, that I was forfeiting my previous month's commission, which is paid out on the last pay period of the following month. So in essence, they stole my commission from me. If you think about this, every employee is robbed of their last month's commission because they have to stay another month to get last month's commission, all the while earning another commission that they won't be paid. "
bad,Forced to sale on every call for the Directv project and then they back gate the calls to you to remove movie channels which is deducted from your sales incentive. Have seen People on my team been there for years and get paid nothing for sales because of the downgrades . They made and exceeded the sales quota and  made literally nothing from the sales due to removing movie channels and sports package from customers account.
bad,Was not a pleasant work environment. everyone was not happy and was depressing every time i had to go there to complete my co-op hours for school.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Another large company that pretends to care ab out their associates but does not back it up. I had a health problem and they gave me no realistic chance to get back to work.
bad,"This place is the worst place to work for. They over work employees, don't pay you enough to work for multiple companies at once. The managers talk to you like a dog. It is just a bad work environment."
bad,By far the worst job I have ever had. They throw you into the fire and then write you up. Hard hours to work with few breaks. The last day I worked there was the best day of my life.
bad,"Job culture is horrible. This is a job that actually sets one up to fail. They set impossible standards that many can not meet. They call people liers and yell at people on the floor. Breaks are not always consistient but that is the nature of a call center when your on the phone same with lunches. If one can handle being called a lier, browbeaten and treated as a disposable worker then yep great place to work. Also one learns very quickly that their job is threatened every single day and one can be fired every single day. This is done in a pretty forthright manor as well."
bad,Would have been a good job if pay checks were right and on time.  It is frustrating to work for a company that wants the best but messes up your check consistently and is always sorry.
bad,Loud environment/non-professional/commissions offset by customer downgrades/training is only a general overview and does not meet technical standards for what it takes to do the job.
bad,"Convergys, is the worst company I have ever worked for.   They  and ATT steal commission ."
bad,"It was all over the place here.  The training was ridiculous, and once you got on the floor the job it's self was horrible!  This was a job in between jobs for me."
bad,not a fun place to work. management are incompetent. avoid if you value your sole dont work here. you are just a number them
bad,"Never get bored with your job because the turnover rate is so high there's a constant stream of new positions opening! "
bad,"The wages are not competitive enough for the amount of stress that goes into the job. You will be offered incentives that are never actually given to you and management could care less about you! To Convergys, you are a number, not a person!"
bad,"This place expects a lot of hours."
bad,It is a call center. Rules seemed to change overnight. Morale is not a concern to higher ups. You would get blind-sided by announcements effecting your employment.
bad,"in training we were promised :"
bad,"Not a company I would recommend unless left with no other options to pay bills. I have never seen such a large company struggle with such basic items as payroll, HR support, IT and technology as well as leadership guidance and development. Too many managers and no leaders. It all starts with the senior executive team being out of touch with the company culture no matter how many posters they put up. This translates to poor direction and overall disorganized group in the US. There are better options to take."
bad,"They do not train you on everything that they want you to do on the job. They have unrealistic expectations. They want you to do lots and lots of things while you are on each phone call but they want you to do it in less time than is possible to do it all. They do not offer sick leave and it's extremely difficult to use paid time off that you earn. Most of the time when you take voluntary go home because they have too many people scheduled, then you are able to change that to paid time off. But actually requesting to have a day off and get paid for it with paid time off is nearly impossible!!! If you quit or get fired, you do not get paid for the paid time off you have accumulated. And you don't get paid for maternity leave. A co-worker is having to go 6 weeks without pay until her baby is 6 weeks old and she's able to stay at a day care.  Most supervisor's have huge egos and that's always very annoying!!!! They lie to you in training, telling you that everyone really cares about you but they really don't. There's a reason they are always hiring. They intentionally have huge turnover there because they get paid more for it. So they set you up to fail so that either you quit or they fire you. They have a point system and if you get 12 points, they will fire you. They claim there are lots of chances to earn points back but I've been working there for 6 months now and we only had 1 day where we earned a point back. If you have to go to the doctor, you will get a partial point, depending on how long you are gone. They claim they will give you that partial point back if you bring"
bad,poor training customers yelling you all day do to you have to lie to the customer. this is what AT&T customer service is so poor there employees don't care do to low pay and poor MGT stay on food stamps not this place it sucks.
bad,"Worst place to work, they do not care about employees. They care more about the business then their own employees needs. If you're sick, well that sucks. They try and fire you with a doctors note."
bad,The trainers are not helpful people and the overall course does not prepare you for production. Very fast paced and must be able to multi task.
bad,"Wouldn't recommend this employer to my enemies.  The only good thing about working there was it was a paycheque."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Well let's see here where do I start? Training is a joke, how can you have ""trainers"" that have never actually did the actual work. Management a joke, you go to them for something your better off talking to a brick wall. Too many systems not enough pay just an unorganized place to work for. Run for the hills!"
bad,This was a hard company to work for you had to give customer inquiries on mail delivery if there mail was lost. which was hard to when on the phone because we was not at the post office were the mail was lost. So are customers was unhappy most of the time and if   you could not resolved there issues convergys held it against the customer service representative.
bad,"Underpaid, under appreciated, constantly changing instructions on how to do something; and they consider KMS to help inform you on what to do; but you have to know what you are asking for or otherwise you get nothing."
bad,"I did learn about timeshares. Other than that, I didn't take away any new information. The worst management I've ever dealt with. Just one big mess."
bad,I cant begin to tell you how horrible this place is. Get your check plus experience and get out. No real room for growth or advancement.
bad,"The company does not care about their people. The company needs to go under review . They hold our commission, the managers do not set good examples at all and they use to care about our agents, they no longer care to keep them around."
bad,Work atmosphere is poor management care more about there stats than employee unsociable hours poor pay.poor incentives scheme
bad,very sloppy in many practices. they go back and forth on their word. Lots of turnover due to bad work conditions. felt like i was back in high school.
bad,"I only worked there because they offered me the night shift, so I could provide support for a family member. Having said that, this was the worst job I've ever worked at. Like buying a boat, the 2 happiest days were the day I was hired, and the day I quit. They treat you like a number, the pay was atrocious, the hours were brutal, the management was clueless. All in all, if you are desperate for a job, and have nothing else to do, you can do this for a little while, but you will be burned out."
bad,"Don't make jokes if other people are around because they might get offended and run to HR. "
bad,"They made it very hard to work there. They made sure everyday we knew that we could be fired. The bonus incentives they provided were near impossible to achieve unless you gave every customer what they wanted. The staff and managers when asked for help by the CSRs would make it hard to leave the call good. "
bad,No one in management is on the same page. Managers  are always changing. They don't know their job just the right person to get the job. The turn over rate is very high.
bad,"A typical day at work I would answer customer calls, explain bills, take bill payments and trouble shoot and get cell phones working for the customer."
bad,"Hard to work there.  Not because of the customers but the people you work with."
bad,"not enough training, to rushed more time spent on role play than learning the operating systems no support system, to scattered ,no  organization, sell products and up grades,  end of your shift"
bad,"there are very few people that ever ""make it"" here. Tons of turnover. Poor compensation. Overall bad company to work for."
bad,Management was not always qualified.  The leadership didn't do a good job of selecting talent for promotions.  Overall it was a great place to work if you need some income but not a long term position as one may be in the same role for years waiting for promotion.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I have worked for Stream/Convergys for more then two years. In that time I have worked hard, been dependable, and have adapted to many changes."
bad,This company is a wreck. They do not pay their employees well. And they hire any and everybody. They are very unprofessional.
bad,Supervisor don't really care too  much about you. This is by far the worst place to work at. I don't recommend this place to anyone to work here.
bad,"the company is structured but exciting place to work, convergy's offers a great deal of incentives such as free lunch, gift cards etc the hardest part of the job is the constant change in the schedules your schedule can change with company needs, the best part of the job is helping others"
bad,"A typical day at this place starts out logging into system, then taking your first call of the day. Trying to please the customer and management is very difficult. Management is not organized. Some have been late for overtime hrs, leaving rookies on there own to fend for them selves to find needed information concerning a certain phone call. After answering calls and taking these training exercises, then you go on a break, that flies by. Then you get back on the phones to receive more phone calls. You deal with them as the come, until it is time to go to lunch, then you rush to get lunch, spend a lot of time waiting for what you ordered because you were only given a half an hour to drive to a place to get a bite to eat, only to find out that you need to hurry back and wait to eat your lunch after you get off of work. If and only if, someone doesn't take your lunch, while you are on the phones for the rest of the day."
bad,"the company does not care about there employees, they always mess  up on our checks they have there group of fav. people and Dave White and Tony are very rude and disrespectful i wouldnt tell my enemy to work for Cincentrix"
bad,"I've been with this company for a few months now and can not understand how unstable this company is. I wonder is it just the Norcross location. With the pay issues, broken promises, and the unwill to be concerned. Why is it no one cares when our checks are incorrect at the fault of management (Tl's,pay roll, etc). We are expected to wait for our dividends? Did you have to wait for me to do the job? I did my requirements, why didn't I get paid? It's inconsistent! The company may be worth trying but I've given up dude to the lack of management and the consistency of being inconsistent! Continue to move past this job opportunity! I am looking for a better place of employment! Take heed!"
bad,"I used to love working at convergys. Until maybe a few months in. Everything changed, people were getting fired left and right because of the changes the company made itself. They are constantly writing people up for doing things they were trained to do. And they promise you incentives and benefits and bonuses but you never receive them."
bad,"Worst job ever"
bad,"the job didn't live up to expectations as it was avertised, they didn't do the rotas equally as they advised at the job inetrview ."
bad,The job itself was a waste of time. You had to fix someones issues over the phone and half of them dont even speak proper english. The management never helped you and you couldnt have any you time. It was 8 hours of non stop phone ringing.
bad,Please don't apply. You'll regret it. Shift bids wont be to you liking. Management is very condescending to the employees.
bad,"Typical day there, is you take phone calls all day and get yelled at, if not on the phone by customers, then by the supervisors. most enjoyable part of this job is odi's and power hours."
bad,Nothing more to say about this call center. If you end up here don't expect to stay long. Revolving door. management has no relevant experience.
bad,"They fire you right after training!!! They dont give you the proper training and mess up your pay checks, this place really SUCKS to work for!"
bad,"Not worth talking about, there is nothing else to say, If something must be said It might be better to work for a fast food company"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I have learned to understand that this company is providing quality workforce. Since l have learned something very useful skills in the school, it could be used as a powerful tools to take lead to work along the organizational goals to be accomplished"
bad,There are never raises. Checks are often shorted on bonuses but they never truly explain them. Inappropriate harrassment and favoritism are big problems. Honest helpful employees aren't rewarded they only pay out for volume of calls not quality. There is no opportunity for advancement.
bad,"I work on the Directv project.  A typical day at work is getting back to back to back calls.  You never ever really get a break in between.  When you are first hired, you are totally lied to by the recruiters.  We started out with about 25 people in our training class, and by the 2nd month, we were down to less than 10 people.  That's all because it was discovered that we were all were lied to by the recruiters.  "
bad,"customer service for ATT win back deptartment, Trying to convince customers not to leave ATT, making special arrangements and offering special deals on service."
bad,The worse place ever to work unless you are absolutely desperate.  The managers and supervisors are a joke as well as the HR staff.  They could care less about their employees.
bad,My typical day working as a csr is mainly helping customers with accounts and going over bills if they don't understand them also taking payments and reversing them as well.
bad,The staff was friendly and the training course was very comprehensive in the two weeks it covered. I was unhappy about the lack of schedule flexibility.
bad,terrible company to work for....low pay and a bunch of kids from highschool working here and not caring.....and you dont get raises
bad,"attendance policy is ridiculous, you get points for system outages that are not your fault, they over-work by offering overtime and starting you at $9/hr, knowing full well that $9/hr is not any type of monetary compensation that you can live on, they promise monthly incentives but you never see it,  management is incompetent,  you have a new team leader every other month, so you never really get to know anyone, you're nothing but a number,  you have to have perfect attendance for 6months to get a decent raise, how can anyone have perfect attendance for six months, i got separated from Convergys after i came back from hospital with a doctors note to cover my absence.  Just ridiculous, Highly Stressful place to work"
bad,There are managers that work their and that do drugs and that the managers do not care for their employees. There is no leadership skills and that there is no appreciation for employees. There is not enough coaching and productivity.
bad,The management sucked alot none of them seem to know what they was doing every manger told you something diffrent to do while there people where dirty there never offered any kind of raise or anything the year i was there
bad,"This is a great company that has afforded me with fine experience."
bad,"This is the worst place ever to work. After training, you are thrown to the wolves. You learn as you go. There is favouritism with those on the phones as well as management. There are people that constantly get away with not being on the phones and you are left to pick up the slack. Its noisy,smells and the equipment is dreadful. Broken chairs,headsets,desks and computers. You are also on a job bid. This means that you bid on the hours you would like to work and the days off..good luck getting what you want because they do not show you how to do it and its one of the rare opportunities where your senority counts. Its depressing and dark in there and if you are in the subscriber department then your calls will be from rude Americans who cant find their way out of a parking lot. They are impatient and dont care that you are trying to help them. Also be prepared for taking up to 2000 calls a week and receive no thanks. management does not support you and when you have questions you have to put your caller on hold and hunt down someone to answer that question for you. it is very stressful and they constantly threaten you with the loss of your job. Unless you are on valium you wont last. Also, the buses do not run after 7pm so be prepared to cab it or go for a long walk to Simcoe St. Minacs has a high turnover rate because they cant keep the good people there with the current working conditions."
bad,"dirty and depressing"
bad,"It was a terrible experience from the beginning. The trainer was completely rude and mean just to say it simply. The environment is harsh, there are preferences and this job culture is not at all recommendable to those who strive to live in a loving and peaceful environment. Hopefully they close down soon. they are all about working people as if they were slaves taking away their dignity. People who end up there usually screwed up there life so bad that they have no other choice but to stay there. Would  not recommend to my worst enemy. They don't care about human dignity and will put you down just so they can feel good about themselves. They have to do everything in a timely manner because they get paid by the  minute so this makes the management extremely cranky,, rude, disrespectful. Most people end up smoking even if they had never smoked in their life. Please do yourself a favor, spread the word, don't work there!"
bad,Its is a typical  third party call centre.  No room for advancement.It is a good place for new immigrants in the country.Excellent co-workers.Hardest part of the job is the shift can change any time without notice.
bad,This is just a place to get your foot in the door to customer service. The benefits are not that great and the management does not know any more than a brand new employee.
bad,"Consistent and enjoyable"
bad,"Working at Minacs was a pleasure, we had a spacious place to work a good atmosphere surround us and wonderful team leaders that give us a special coach, I learned to be more attentive for my goals that was designated for me and achieve it with a good reward by being three consecutive months awarded as the Brazilian Top Performance Quality."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"working at the convergys call center was difficult because employees and trainees were not properly trained to assist the customers with the possible issues that a customer would call about. the only thing that was pressed in training class was to sell product, but not to assist existing customers with the products they have already purchased"
bad,"Managment is very messy"
bad,That is the most horrible job i ever had in my life. Only good thing is the $9.00/hr plus a lot of overtime is offered because no one never stay longer than 6 months.
bad,This is not a good place to work. They are very rude and nasty people. No one truly knows their job and everything is last minute
bad,"This place traumatized me.. I worked there for a year."
bad,This type of work environment was not conducive to what I wanted in a job. They allowed individuals to come to work dressed unruly and the customer service that was supposed to be given to the customers was the last thing on there mind.
bad,I would not recommend this place of work for anyone the job is very stressful and the management are very unfriendly and do not help you in any way. Convergy's are always looking for staff members but if they got treated the way I did I wonder why?
bad,"this place is horrible to work for, high turnover rate and lousy management - no one knows what is going on there. if you want a reliable job don't work here, they treat people like trash and every management person think they are the best thing that has happened to the company which is not true for any of them"
bad,"pay sucks, management sucks, at least 5 companies have left since i have started a year ago. no job security at all! the company does not reward its employees, no raises"
bad,"horrible experience, when first started the position they said that we will be directing the calls to departments.After training it was different we had goals to sell which was horrible because i did not sign up to be a sells associate."
bad,"not for me at all, every thing about it is awful they make it sound amazing but im just not a fan of taking calls and that's it."
bad,"I never said anything great about this job. Most of the time I spoke about this job, other people knew this job was terrible. Management was horrible and disrespectful towards their employees. I can say that I am very happy that this place was closed down and bulldozed to a shopping center. Nothing great about this job at all"
bad,"Every day requires hours of sitting all day with only virtual interaction with coworkers such as chat, limited restroom breaks, calls back to back and very high demand of meeting metrics.  What I have learned is the required skills to perform my duties for Amazon and DTV.  Again management is limited to chat/email only.  Coworker seems to be very nice but again this is a virtual atmosphere, so you are only able to chat.  The hardest part of the job is the inconsistency of hours, not being able to use PTO and if there is system issues you lose time and money.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the customers"
bad,people dont respect you there or treat you like human beins this company sounds great and all but the managers and supervisors never want to help or get mad when you ask for help
bad,I do not like directv/It is very boring/the people there have no class/they are rude/they are demeaning/and they don't pay enough for the work we do
bad,Everything they said was a lie and the excuse was that policies change.
bad,"I worked ATT Android Support Arnold location.  When in training our first trainer threatened the class and would get nasty. The trainer never returned extending our training a few weeks out. I met all different personalities. One had a State Prison jacket on, I was uncomfortable bringing my wallet into work.  When I went on the floor The Lead was rude from start, no support.  They never acknowledged any compliments from the customers, only focused on the negative.  I became a number.  No matter how good you did if they didn't like you, you were going to fail.  Being older I was not a gamer, I never chatted in chat room online about games.  It was evident I was a fish out of water. I was quiet, did my job but the lead had this unprofessional horrible attitude from day one. When I lost my job there were no reasons except my numbers which could be alter at ones choice, and the comment that I was putting on weight was unacceptable.  There were people twice my size.  I am glad to be away from a stressful, unpleasant atmosphere and will be appreciated somewhere where people are professional and treat their employee's with fairness and consideration."
bad,"Convergys is the worst place that I have ever worked, leadership was terrible, benefits were way to expensive, pay was extremely low"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,They never pay you what they owe you. Depending on which management you get most of them if they don't like you or you are not a top seller they will get rid of you
bad,"The particular part of the company I am employed by is horribly ran. I have worked there for almost 2 years and I really have nothing to show for it but experience in a call center. The management is horribly ran, along with their superiors. Majority of them are clueless to your questions and depend on people from under their hierarchy to provide you with the answers, if they even have it themselves to provide. A lot of the time the managers are not even in a state to work properly, let alone be accountable for their teams mistakes, or to see that there is even a problem to begin with. They make it hard for you to prosper and grow in the environment they provide. The working conditions in the building are tremendously unhealthy. The climate is never appropriate to the corresponding weather conditions, there are insects and rodents, and there has also been a time where they made us work in very close vaccinates where there was a sewage line break. I've tried to stick it out with the company with hopes of things changing for the better, but I see things will not change anytime soon. The only good thing I can think you can gain from working here is the opportunity for overtime, if they don't force it on you without your consent or concern of trying to remotely have a life outside of them. Everything is for the needs of the business, nothing more, nothing less. You are nothing more than a worker ant lost in their company of non appreciative staffing and candy-coated lies, all to complete their mirage of a great company to work for."
bad,"depends on the day, one day youll be fine; next day youll be getting into fights lol"
bad,Just Wasn't A Fan Of The Company. Pay Wasn't Great. The Job Itself Wasn't Great Either.
bad,"This company is shut down, this was a very unprofessional. Convergy's taught me the difference between bad management and good management."
bad,They treat you as if you are a trained robot. Breaks are very short and monitored extremely by supervisors. Seems as if their are a lot of preferences  of who becomes lead. Their are pressures if you don't make a certain percent across the line on monthly reviews.
bad,"Horrible company. HR is horrendous. Only their favourites get promoted. Some TLs are great but others get by because they kiss their supervisor's butt. Training for departments other than CAC was severely lacking. I wasted three years of my life working for this company and they wouldn't even provide a competitive wage to other call centres. Once you reach 12/hr you're capped. Only reason I stayed was because of the other agents I worked with. There's little to no opportunity for advancement. The available shifts to ""cover business need"" are ridiculous too. Especially on specialty teams. The facility is a dive as well."
bad,management wasn't helpful. rules constantly changed & caused you to get repermanded for things you had no idea about.
bad,This company was the worst.  The schedule changes frequently. The pay sucked. Management was horrible.  I was happy when they let me go.
bad,"Extremely grateful for the experience. Picked up a lot of tools along the way. Favoritism is very strong, not my favorite trait."
bad,"Enjoyed being close to home. Learned about Customer Service,"
bad,"Ok place to work, plenty of overtime and great job culture. Great for freshmen college students"
bad,"I got hire at the Call Center in Olathe KS, I only stayed 1 day and never went back.  I reported at the Convergys that morning for my Training, when I got there all was good until I went to the Training Room.  Dirty Computers and the Desk which the Computer sit on was Dirty as well.  When I ask the person who was the Trainer, could he give me 2 thing he like about Convergys, it took him 30 seconds to respond and when he did, it told me the true story about Convergys.  My problem was the cleanness in the Training Room was disgusting!  "
bad,The job is easy and our customers are also easy to deal with the office politics are overwhelming and the turn over is ridiculously high I am shocked that the have not been investigated for there practices
bad,did not want to pay for bonuses so they changed the way you get bonuses and if they don't like you they will rather pay you unemployment then keep you as an employee.
bad,"This had many other names and continues to be bought over and over. Ex: Stream Global, Etelecare, Phase 1. You are nothing more than a dollar sign. You health, life, family, kids, etc not important to this company. Anyone who advances get fired or demoted. Managers all ways in meetings or in their manager office doing nothing. Bonus structures always changing to prevent you from getting one. Pay never changes 11.00 a hour FOREVER. Shifts never the same to benefit a life outside of work. Managers don't know nothing. There is no real advancement opportunities. Most people catch on before their first year and leave."
bad,They break corporate rules. No cleaning crew. Dirty people.
bad,"This is the worse job I have ever had. Where do I begin? If you like being told one thing but observe quite the opposite, this is the job for you. This I was told is more of a job for young kids getting their feet wet in the job force. It's not. The rules explained to employees in training is just a puff of air. Waste of time to have to listen to. It touts itself as a ""Professional"" work place with a code of conduct and dress code. People come in strapless dresses with no bras, with jackets over them thinking they are presentable. Are you going to a club or a street walker? No one knows what a slip is. Guys, and some girls, underpants sticking out. Breast overflowing everywhere. People wearing pj, slippers, using blankets, wearing coats, hoodies, ball caps. It's gross!! People sleeping throughout their shifts and supervisors not saying a word."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Convergys was a good experience, however I feel there was a rush to get employees ready for handling customer concerns and not enough training was provided to effectively assist customers and meet company metrics required to keep the position. I would not recommend this company to anyone looking for employment"
bad,"Awful "
bad,This was the most broing job I had ever had. Expecially when no calls came in
bad,RUNNN FOORRRR YYYOOOUUURRR LLIIIVVVEEESSS!!!! Horrible place to work. They are a make it up as you go company. Hiring people who are not qualified to do a job and favoritism is at an all time high.
bad,"Not enough product and company policy knowledge, poor communication put on phones after 3 months of training to find out we were not trained on what we would be handling on calls"
bad,I was part wave 2. The second class trained for the new facility in Hickory NC.  We were told lies about raises and this wouldn't be a commission site. That quickly changed which was ok but the expectations are set too high for the amount of sales required monthly. It's just not a good place to work and the management is awful.
bad,sucks really really bad. like so bad it is physically painful to come to work everyday.
bad,"I currently work at Convergys and I am very stressed out all the time. If you like sitting this is the job for you, my back is in so much pain at the end of the day due to prolonged sitting. Management is ok, not much help when you really need it. The hardest part of the job is the customers who are always angry. The most enjoyable part of the job is going home"
bad,This comapny was not what I though tit would be. The culture was bad. Management wasnt very professiona. Growth was null to none.
bad,"Amazing coworkers, pays really low for the amount of work one had to do. The staff is amazing."
bad,"Extremely stressful, managers and supervisors are not efficient"
bad,"I worked there for 11 months with only 1 verbal warning. I got fired because I pressed the transfer button instead of the conference button. I should have got my written warning, but instead of getting fired."
bad,"It's like any other call center job during training, they have all the managers and trainers come in and tell you there success story. How you can make it to the top in this company and we promote 79 % within the business. The Trainers believe there the best but honestly most of what you learn from this 10 week training class is how much B.S. they taught you that has no relevance to whats going on in the production floor. "
bad,"This is the worst place to work. A "
bad,this company is bad and out of business im glad i do not recommend  to work here
bad,"I like the people that i worked with but they started to do the 12 hour shifts on the weekends and it didn't really fit in my schedule. They expected way to much from you,"
bad,"Blah blah blah, Was not a great place to work, Not organized. Management and employees made it hard to come in everyday. The worst company to work for."
bad,"I worked there for almost a year. The management staff is completely clueless and incompetent. They were never willing to help you if you had a problem or a question. They make you take your things with you when you go to lunch and quite often, I came back from lunch with no place to sit. I had to sit in a room until a desk opened up. They lie about how much you will make on your bonuses and more than once, there were mistakes on how much everyone should've received and they were never compensated for the amount they should've gotten. They refuse to work around anyone's schedule, so if you are going to school, they will not give you hours to fit your schedule. It will also change often, sometimes overnight without your knowledge. I will never work here again and do not recommend it for anyone."
bad,"The only thing I can say about this company is that they need new management their. Their managers play favorites with the workers there. The company really needs to make sure that everyone from customer reps to OM know how to take a call before they are promoted to a higher position there. There are some many upper management that dont know how to take a call for their life its really sad , than they took away when managers had to get on calls when the que was at its most highest call volume and leave it for all the reps to handle not right. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"call center for DirecTV (lost the contract) AT&T, WellMed & now others"
bad,"I worked with Minacs for a little less than 3 years during their transition period to Aditya Birla Minacs. The culture and management approach quickly took a turn for the worse once the company was bought out. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the people I worked with, the environment was much to hostile to stay."
bad,"Dealing with customers that are being screwed over by paypal"
bad,It was slow some of the agents are rude with other agents and can careless about the other agents they talk about others behind there back..
bad,"this job is not for everyone you will have to be able to have flex schedule you will go in and get off at different time every day your off days will be switched every week, they scam their customers.it is a true scam never sign up for directv ever, they do not treat their customers and employees well at all, everyone is in it for the money not true customer service. the money is good and the bonus money is even better but it is totally not worth all the stress that comes with the job. they have a very high turn over rate and they will get rid of you as fast as they hire you, never will i work there again,  oh yeah lets not forget they dont work around school schedules or anything so if your in school or if you have children this job may not be for you,."
bad,"Aweful Company to work for the management sucked.  You get very little training and are supposed to know what your doing and all the company is about sale, sale, sale!"
bad,"MOT on a constant , if i wanted to work in a sweat shop id move to china"
bad,"This company thinks they are better than the companies they do work for, their TL (managers) don't actually do anything, if you have an escalation they refuse to take them, they make you use a chat that you can wait over an hour for someone to even get to you then you have to wait another 10 to 20 minutes for them to take the call. This company also punishes their employees for going to the bathroom which is unlawful. They don't care to fire you and tell you what you did but not let you listen to the call to prove that you actually did it. A worthless company. If you are thinking about working for them, think again, go straight to the companies that they work for and I guaranty you more money and better support. They pay only $9/hr when you can work for the companies they do work for and make around $12/hr or more and not get punished for using the bathroom and get support from your managers when you need it"
bad,THe management is AWFUL and they lie to you to get you to do what they want.
bad,Horrible place to work for. upper management does not care for their employees.
bad,"answering out bound call and in bound call, to talk with the clients in a nice way and give the suggestion to their problems. more likely a typical management in a corporate setting. i don't have any issues with my coworker, the hardest part is to be awake in the night and the pressure of the management to hit the target. the enjoyable part of the job is to knew other people."
bad,"This company does not care about their employees.  After working for them for a year, you reach the salary cap and can not progress past it, which is not far off of minimum wage.  Management does not care about their employees.  Extended hours are added to your schedule with only one day's notice and there is no way for you to have them removed, even if you have appointments lined up.  The customers are the same as almost any call center - they're angry their product is broken and you become the one they scream at.  This place is very disorganized and they constantly lose information that their employees have provided to them.  They're also constantly cutting items from their benefits package.  You can apply for other jobs within the company however the chances of you getting the position over someone off the street are slim.  You end up just being a body to fill a seat to this company."
bad,"29 people in my class, 9 graduated. A lot of systems and knowledge to learn on line, no printed material available. It is not worth the $9 an hour.  All customer contacts are listened to and critiqued Managers tear you apart and refuse to take over calls. Work from home answered 611 AT&T Mobility calls. Managers write reviews on you that destroy your customer survey scores."
bad,"Customer Service Rep. American Express - Convergys – Answer inbound calls for application department and customer service on the American Express Credit Card Account. Assist customers with credit card applications and answer"
bad,"After my first day I already wanted to quit, worst place to work, ever. Salary is ridiculous, you have to bag for everything, even for an answer from your manager, management is completely incompetent. If you make the smallest mistake, you are treated like a mass murderer. If you are doing your job right, you are ignored and treated as a child. No rewards, no recognition, no nothing. Only good for those who just arrived to Belfast, and need to make the living as long as they are searching for a new job."
bad,"typical call center atmosphere"
bad,"Responsibilities that I was assigned when hired were troubleshoot basic billing issues and any technical issues with android phones, this soon was overshadowed by the sheer amount of side responsibilities, they had us doing the work of 15 different departments and made it in such a way that we had to handle any call we got, I was cussed out and told by a customer that he would harm my whole family due to his insufferable unintelligence because I wasn't the right department for him to talk to. He had printer issues and I worked on phones. So needless to say I got a bad survey from him which lowers your pay and can get you fired. honestly whoever reads this review DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY, they have committed two different acts of tax fraud on me personally. Also the ""management"" does not have any personal involvement in your life. Ie they don't care about their employees they have an extremely high turnover rate (for a reason) I had pneumonia for six days and they refused to give me time off due to the fact i couldn't get a doctors note. I couldn't do so becAuse their insurance rates were so high I couldn't afford them yet another employee came into work hung over/drunk and puked in the operation managers trashcan after smelling alcohol wipes. Because she was buddy with her the employee got to go home with no incursion to her paid days off. I put my two weeks in and they sent out someone to watch and wait for me to slip up. I whispered something in the ear of a fellow employee and I was told I can terminate myself or face legal action for harassment. They have very construed"
bad,The company was just unprofessional and unorganized. This was my first call center experience and it was not a good one..
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"always looked for reason to give you bad info , not good management , everything always changes so you never know what to do in your job , always reasons not to give raises left this job after 2 years . stressful not sanitary chairs where not good and computer pay was ok but not for the stress you had to endure everyday .."
bad,"negative environment."
bad,"Unprofessionalism was epic within this company. Every man for themselves, no respect at all."
bad,it was a very horrible place to work. always underpaid always having to look over your shoulder. no respect for loyalty and just all around disaster of a company. avoid at all possible
bad,"This is not a job that I would encourage anyone to do. The management is sneaky, They don't care about their employees all."
bad,"This is a terrible company to work for. They harass their employees. You need permission to use the restroom. Managers give employees bad reviews to keep their positions. You don't always get paid. You can be fired at any moment of any day for no reason. Managers yell and degrade you. I put up with this for three months, I'm out!"
bad,Listen attentively to customer needs and concerns; demonstrate empathy. Clarify customer requirements; probe for and confirm understanding of requirements or problem. Meet customer requirements through first contact resolution. Confirm customer understanding of the solution and provide additional customer education as needed. 	Prepare complete and accurate work and update customer file. 	Communicate effectively with individuals/teams in the program to ensure high quality and timely expedition of customer requests. 	Effectively transfer misdirected customer requests to an appropriate party.
bad,"I hated this job, the hours, the pay to put up with customers cursing you and calling you names because their bill came in and it was $400.00 (not my fault) trying to ""save"" customers so they would not disconnect because of their bill. All at the same time trying to offer upgrades for Movies channels...would you wanna add to your bill?"
bad,Highly stressful. Pay is terrible for what you have to put up with. Most of upper management is very disorganized. One down fall is the place is too large for organization thus causing major turn over rate. Worst place I've ever worked.
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for; hostile and unprofessional work environment, dishonest training/job details/compensation plans. VERY high turnover with employees, basically a revolving door of people being hired/fired/quitting. High stress and horrible outdated user interface for taking calls/viewing customer accounts. Openly encouraged to lie to customers at my location."
bad,"This job is not organized at all"
bad,Cannot give a review on this place. Was not a good experience for me
bad,I hated this job. call center for AT & T. Hated being tied down to a desk. I like to move around
bad,After first week into training we found out that IBM purchased the company and did away with the center I was hired at.
bad,"company no longer exists"
bad,"a typical day at work is answering about 50 inbound  calls a day , taught my self how to achieve excellent customer service and resolve calls on a daily basis , hardest part of the job is selling uverse internet because the customer was not always interested in hearing about uverse"
bad,Working at Convergys in hickory is not good for the mind body and soul. Those who want to do well and try to succeed are the ones who get treated horrible. I have been in management in other locations and I have never worked for a company that is so backwards and corrupt in my life. There is something wrong if you can Google a company and 95% of the comments are negative. Makes you wonder.
bad,"Nicely situated in Belfast city centre. Lots of great international people to work with."
bad,so much favoritism and no way to move up unless you happen to get in good with one person.
bad,"PLEASE READ****"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I really felt that this Company doesn't have its employees best interest and I do understand its the business, but it's not as compassionate as I thought."
bad,"This company was a big let down Convergys is not at all what they drill in you it will be like. Not my cup of tea , convince of working home was the only positive thing but their system have many issues and greatly affect your system and computer."
bad,"Minacs is a ""fill in job"". When there's nothing else out there you go to Minacs. They give you hopes of work advancement but the only way to do that is to change your whole way of thinking and giving up your ethics.  There is no appreciation for their employees and they'll fire you without even giving you a reason. There is no work life balance and you're lucky if you can take a day off for a doctors appointment. You can be on your death bed and they'd still expect you to come to work. Terrible place to work"
bad,Not a good place to work... nor would I recommend it. Not enough pay for the work that has to be done.
bad,No life balance working an up and down schedule and split days off
bad,"closed for change and high rates of micromanagement. sales expectations too high, scheduling unreasonable"
bad,"Not a good job if you're not fond of being stuck sitting on your butt all day and you left behind high school cliques. Plus, breaks are only 10 minutes long instead of 15. Extremely high stress."
bad,"I must say, the co workers I worked with were awesome to work with. They were only a few managers that I actually trusted. The management needed to be severely upgraded. No job security. Projects shut down. The turn over rate is not good. The low pay is not worth dealing with the company that will let you go even if you have good stats, on time to work every day, and work well."
bad,Not a good place to work Provide customer service to at&t customers. Handel all account issues and also troubleshoot basic device issues and self-service options. Up sale u-verse products and add a lines
bad,No management skills at all. No help 100% on your own. Loved working with my co-workers but the atmosphere was real uptight.
bad,"This company has no compassion or remorse for their employees. When systems mess up they blame the employee and show no compassion when the employee is hurt. They grade attendance on a point system which is crazy. You miss work for a power/internet outage or even from a house fire, you receive a point which then leads to a write up!!! They approve vacation time and then if the system glitches and gives you points, they do NOTHING about it! Management has a lack of communication and doesn't respond to inquiries in a timely manner!!!!"
bad,They don't appreciate their employees. I don't like working for this company
bad,"Unfortunately this is not the best place to work. there where bed bugs. horrible management, and job security is doesn't exsist."
bad,"The training was ok, had a terrible trainer who was not aware of much about our client (Amazon) Convergys often said ""we dont have record of you working"" (my time slip was somehow lost in the system, late paycheck, not corrected until I had to get on them) constantly changing policy."
bad,"not a good job,at the hazelwood location very unorganized,lack of training, ghetto"
bad,Minacs is a different enviroment not a good job to start at for call center experience.
bad,"Where do I begin about this place. Horrible rate of pay and not to mention it's a dead end job. Members of management get paid to use the washroom while the phone agents do not. The members of HR and some of the management team think they are better then everybody else and DO NOT care about the people that work there. Not to mention I have been gone from there for approx 2 years and recently just got a BILL saying that I owe 70$ for the pointless program they enroll everybody in. "
bad,This Job was very unstable and unprofessional as well the team leads didnt know what they were doing at all it was an over all eye opening experiance
bad,"A typical day at work was answering calls from customers and trouble shooting their issue. I have learned time management skills. Management was not present, either on smoke breaks or no where to be found.  Co workers were okay. The hardest part was going into a job where you didnt know if you were going to be fired or not on a daily basis. Just because a manager didnt like you. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Hours, randomly changed at last minute with no notification, company only cares about selling upgrades not about what the customer called in for. terrible!!!!!"
bad,"cant stand the atmosphere, no type of help from management very unorganized"
bad,never again will work there unless on a different account besides At&t
bad,learned how to multitask better. it had really nice people. learned even more about computers. and about people.
bad,"not made out to what it seems to be, dont get your hopes up, but grateful to have a job"
bad,"Answered billing questions for customers and took payments. "
bad,"Worked there for a almost a year. Some of the ""Team Leaders"" were not helpful at all. Most of their time was spent with other Team Leads talking and joking around. Pay was not what I was promised and was I was fired because a family member passed away and I had to travel to go to the funeral. I was told they needed people on the floor and that my traveling was unnecessary."
bad,This place you feel that you not appreciate they don't listen to what you have to said they are not there for the employee.
bad,"I worked for minacs for 3 yrs this company scams you out of money you work for and tell lies regarding why you don`t get it.Give raises, then drop your pay on the sly minacs works the hell out of you for peanuts! Company has no regard for the employees. Trust me, apply anywhere before taking a job at minacs. Worst place I have ever worked"
bad,"i hated it, long hours. regardless no matter if you were there on time one slip up and you were out of there."
bad,"The job was not like expected, in training the adults were fighting and it felt like high school all over again. Once that was over on the production floor, everything you learned in training went out the door, if you are professional and do your job, do not consider this company. The turn around rate is extremely high and they will do everything possible to make sure that any one who worked for them do not get any unemployment while trying to seek new opportunities."
bad,not a good place to work. Theres is not real support.  Nothing to look forward to.  The blind leading the blind.
bad,I placed orders for satellites. I also told them when the technicians where going to arrive at their place. I placed technicians onsite.
bad,"I have worked for convergys now  for a year and a half, they only thing I like about working there are the people but other then that I don't like working for convergys. there are plenty of reasons why u shouldn't work here first the company doesn't value there staff what I mean by that is everything is broken the seats, the tables, and computers. second is that the pay is 10 an hour for a family that I am attempting to build I cant live off that salary and last is the dirtiness that is all over the buildings and yes they have more then one building there are bed bugs every where roaches and other disgusting bugs the maintenance staff does there best to the place clean but theres so much they can do until staff members make it dirty all over again"
bad,"if you have a life, you won't if you work for this company.  don't do it."
bad,"Customer Service skills are excellent so to enter an environment with no organization was not comfortable for a troubleshooting environment. Some days a  CSR would wait an hour to be seated for beginning or work sharing a desk, headphones and a seat. Your boss may call a meeting with no purpose just to discover what they did over the weekend and she would work under the influence of alcohol coming back from lunch. A lot of young college kids were boss's no ambition but DRAMA. The job was easy but the environment was a mess"
bad,I learned how to do a lot with cell phones and learned a lot about customer service the right way.
bad,"No sick time"
bad,"Horrible, never ending calls no sanitary standards for employees or the facility. Shared headphones that with germ so virulent they could out compete the Spanish Flu. Moral was so low the only job that had higher turnover than the CSR's were the managers. I once worked for two months without any supervisor because my manager quit, his manager quit, and so did the entire HR department. I had to convince the site manager that I was employed at the call center in order to get my paychecks. the schedule you were working would change while you were working it. I once was late because an hour from the end of my shift, the start time of that shift was changed to and hour before I showed up."
bad,"terrible, intoxicated work environment , did not even let us use the washrooms, so abusive, do not recommend to my worst enemy"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Convergys is a horrible place to work They do not value their employees, there are no pay raises. Management has their favorite people,  managers sit in front of their computers all day and shop online or track their spouse. Employee stats are based on how the customer perceives AT&T, if they do not like AT&T the agent who answered the call gets hit with this negative response."
bad,unable to have my family time nor advance or raises management was great pay was great coworkers to young for me
bad,"Typical day at work is pretty much slow. I sometime take a lot of calls, while other days its not that many."
bad,"Overall quick to hire; however, needs work on work ethic, professionalism, compensation, and management"
bad,"the convergys way conflicts with the Apple way"
bad,"is not a good place to work"
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone. They don't train you to do your job and then point out your challenges and mistakes. There was never a positive word said about any of my work, or my colleagues. I did receive positive feedback from customers but my Team Leader said 'I never heard about them' when I did pass the customer on to TL to compliment my work and customer satisfaction."
bad,"•	I work in an outbound call center as a third party contact customer service agent for Verizon Wireless. "
bad,This place will use you and abuse you and if you do not do everything they ask of you than they make your job a nightmare
bad,"- Degraded on a daily basis"
bad,Call center bad hours/ no room for growth/ no commissions on sales / too much turn over on management and staff.
bad,To me this organization does not value their employees. I was told if I signed up for short term disability I would receive pay during my maturity leave. When complication arose that caused me to be on bed rest. I was told my pregnancy was a preexisting condition.
bad,"not a good place to work at all. they train you but, they don't tell you everything you need to know to do the job effectively. When they put you on the phones after training, alot of things come up that they don't teach you and when you ask for help they say you should know the answer and leave you with no help to further help the customers"
bad,Come in log on to my computer check the board for any annoucnments and chek for the daily goals each team wass to reach.
bad,"Convergys is an ok place to work but ... management at the Coastal Jacksonville, NC location sucks. I work for the Fedex side. They never have UTO or PTO if you really need it. For an example, I work at straight 930-6pm shift now ( Warning: you will not get this shift as an new hire, must be a senior tenured agent) Doctors are not open after 6p. Which means, I must leave and take a point for my health. Speaking of points, If you are a minute late you occur 0.25 keep in mind you are only allowed 12 points before you are reviewed/fired. Constant flow of new people. Once your in you will quickly realize why! Oh, like a lot of jobs, they play hard on favoritism. Must be an a suckup to be promoted. My advice skip over it if you don't like drama. They only reason I am still here is because the economy sucks and the starting pay is $9.50. Happy Hunting!"
bad,Too much stress. The managers are not very friendly or helpful and it is a high stress job to start with dealing with angry customers. Not only do they expect you to calm the customer but to sell them something else.
bad,"The management has no sympathy about what's going on in your personal life. What you learn in training has nothing to do with that happens on the floor, at the end of training they just put on the floor the next day."
bad,"The rules/management sucked. You cannot storage your lunch in the fridges in fear that your food may be stolen. There are no enjoyable parts about working at this place. People get into fights, its very unprofessional"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"If you are applying for the ""Email Rep"" position at Niagara Falls, beware. They will hire you as Email and then once your training is done, they will convert you to phone advisers without your consent. Also, they say it's straight afternoon shifts (3:30-11:30) but once they make you phone advisers,again, they will change everything and make you something different like 1pm - 9pm. Oh by the way, I have had no idea what my schedule would be the next week for almost a month now as they change it all the time. "
bad,unprofessional environment..no room for advancement ..no job security
bad,It was a high paced volume call system. Trained other customer service reps. Loved working from home.
bad,Management is difficult to work with;  Put extraordinary pressure on middle management and do not take accountability.  Low morale among the low level employees.  Company does not develop deep relationships with clients and is very reactive instead of proactive and providing thought leadership.
bad,"When you start working for Netflix, You go through a week in a classroom for training. They give you a lot of useful information, they also leave out a LOT of important information. While in training, The trainers tell you how easy it is to move up in the company, and how fun it is to work there. Well that WAS the case, about a year ago."
bad,not great..no manager at the time..not in that depratment..other depts are better
bad,"This company is one of the worst I've ever worked for. While there, I was performing the job of 3 people and paid very little considering the work required. Management has no or little concern for employees, which shows by the turnover rate. I was a team leader, and one of the first things they tell new team leaders is that about 90% of new hires are gone by 6 months. That right there tells you something..."
bad,The pay is bearly enough to make it by and if you get trained on more things dont expect a rasie because you will not get it. I go married when I was working there it took them over 3 months to get my name changed and then they lost paper work with personal info on it. Managemet treats people lower then them like dirt you are just a mindless number to them.
bad,Even though I recieved 100's on all my secret shopper/type reviews all the managers were always negative and always about numbers not people.
bad,"It starts with fraudulent hiring practices, lies about expectations of your job description. Than the delay's about your start time, I'm talking months and the deceits kept coming!"
bad,"The Las Cruces location has a lot of radio advertisements about how great this job is, but in all honesty, this was one of my worst work experiences. The promised incentives for maintaining high statistics did not show up on any of my checks until after I quit, and I only got $40, when I should have got at least $100 per month in incentives. The leadership team is inconsistent at best and management has no idea which way is up. Schedules change multiple times daily, and applying for any sort of advancement in the company is a total joke."
bad,I have never worked for a company who made Employees work during the Employee appreciation day.  During this time we had food & games for the entire day. But we  could only participate in the games during a 15 min break or on a 30 in LUNCH.!!  Thats our personal time. Not company time.... That was NO FUN AT ALL!!   Some Employee's were also penalized for being late coming from a break or Lunch while engaging in games.
bad,"This place was such a joke. The training was horrible, not organized at all. Then when you get on the floor, your ""manager"" doesn't even know what to do or how to get things done for you. They have ridiculous scripts that you have to read. If you mess up on one word you get in trouble. Crazy stats that they expect you to make everyday, and pay is only $10/hr. Not to mention your schedule changes literally DAILY, nobody can plan anything when you don't know when you will be working. Not worth it at all."
bad,"Company does not pay for maternity  leave. Schedule is not steady,ALWAYS REQUEST FOR YOU TO Voluntarily GO HOME WHICH MEAN NO PAY, AND NO POINTS AGAINST YOU. POINT SYSTEM ONCE YOU ARE AT 12 you ARE FIRED, IF YOU are 30SEC OR 1MIN. Late you are given points. Pay is lousy , Management is horrible, you are treated like a number.  HR DEPARTMENT TELL YOU ANYTHING TO GET YOU THERE."
bad,"No moral for the workers, no support system and very lax on the flexiblility of roating hours"
bad,"Training was a joke. Unless you like to get paid at 630 am to 3pm  listening to a  teacher talk about his life stories and you learn nothing. Get thrown out to the floor with barely any knowledge of what is going on. People screaming at you cussing cause your taking long on the phone. & when you leave for lunch you have to leave your Unassigned desk. So you can sit at another desk where someone could have the flu and clock in late. To have your boss yelling at you. Big unorganized mess. I honestly cant believe Directv still does business with them. Its a embarrassment to them."
bad,The worst place I have ever worked poor staff and management they don't follow provincial labor laws 
bad,"There is nothing I can good about this company, or at least the branch I worked at in Killeen, TX.  The management was very unprofessional, so were all the workers.  "
bad,This job has you sitting non-stop answering non-stop phone calls dont even have enough time to catch your breath. I learned a lot but in training its fun and makes you feel like the job will be but when you get out on the floor you feel expendable and that if you dont get your sales everyday they will just replace you. Guy that sat next to me go fired for not having enough sales balled his eyes out and 20 min later they just put a new guy in his seat. Nothing is enjoyable about this job 
bad,"I worked at home taking calls for AT&T U-verse. You had to ask in chat if you needed a restroom break outside of your normal breaks. If you are not taking calls you get logged out. They offer no opportunity for raises. I was tier I and they added tier II responsibilities with no pay raise. They say you can ""bonus"" for increased pay, but the goals are almost impossible. It is a no mercy environment."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Supervisors were extremely rude and they sit on their butt and look at you like they do not want to help you at all. It was already a hard job but its not ok when people mistreat you and saying stuff you should not say in a workplace. Very unprofessional as I have ever seen in my life..........
bad,"I worked at this job for TWO weeks. The interview process was good and I thought I had a stable job until.....I got inside. People are SO unprofessional and the work place is unstable. There is no dress code what so ever. People were dressing as if they were going to the club. Not to mention the "" Managers"" dressing a hot mess. I mean professionalism is key AT all times. The trainer had only been there for 2 months so he didn't know what he was doing. When I was on the floor training there were people cussing, eating rib tips and food at their desk AND talking on their cell phone. WORST JOB EVER...not even worth putting on my resume. And they only pay $10 an hour and say you can earn more money. BS....I know someone who has worked there for 6 years and he just NOW became manage and making $13 an hour. This place of business is not professional, it's a ZOO. People do what they want. I'm sorry I'm not accepting a job where I'm not respected or working in a terrible environment. There women's bathroom IS a hot mess. They barely clean it. I learned a lot working there though, to never settle for less. For those that need the money THAT bad...i'll be praying for you. I would never work for that company again. "
bad,"awful management mostly, a few gems. they regularly promote people that arent qualified. care absolutely NOTHING about employees. treated as wage slaves."
bad,"Went on maternity leave only to get called at my almost return date to go back and get told it was never submitted when my lead had told me they had it taken care of and I was ""good to go"". Also when sales were made I never got paid my ""commission"". Management was shady team leads and OM's had they're favorites. Too many fakes.. You never get what they promise to give you when it comes to earning your money. Not worth the stress and stupid point system. If they don't want u to work they look for EVERY excuse to fire you, computers are super slow which made signing in on time difficult no matter how early you got there. No support when it came to wanting to learn more, never kept you up to date or let you know what to tell the customers during their outages or when Mother Natur struck. Over all if I didn't need the money I wouldn't bother."
bad,"Worked for ATT Small Business Mobility"
bad,"typlical day at work was choas.no seats, bad pay, bad hours, not an enjoyable place to work at in anyway. "
bad,I didn't like how they ran the company. I didn't like how a customer was calling about their bill and and then try to sell them a product. They company is more about selling then helping customers
bad,"its the worst job decision youll EVER make! im still employed here out of simple desperation ....in other words just for a paycheck nothing more. this place is ran like a prison and the managers act like as such as well. they dont care how sick you might be, if your having issues in your life whatever you can actually be puking and they will tell you to stay ont he phones....and make more sales. ALL the managers want you to do your best not for your benefit mind you but for theres so they look good and make more money while they couldnt care less what you go through long as your making them money. the managers are VERY selfish,cocky,arrogant. if you ever need or want help they basically look at you laugh give you both middle fingers and walk off. if they see something on your desk they dont like they will take it and throw it away no mater what it might be theyve also been know to just take your cell phone from you like its back high school and no they dont give it back. they dont scehedule correctly and like to change your scedhelue whike your off the clock and not at work then when you come in the next work day your scheduled you have a missed day on your record which they refuse to fix. they do give pto(paid time off) but good luck getting it unless fo course your a college kid then you can get it anytime you want it but the normal employee it takes MONTHS sometimes to get any of the time you have for vacation even if its a emergency. they could care less if your comfortable working there they keep the ac literally about 40 degrees all the time summer and winter if you ask"
bad,"The whole company is run like a high school clique.  Management plays favorites, the pay is below average, advancement is impossible unless you're the type to kiss up.  They don't like people to stand up for themselves. "
bad,"A typical day here involves most calls coming in being transfers and customers calling in to complain about our customer service. The management here seems to treat us a little unfairly, we are in a very limited space environment and have been dis-allowed to wear jackets on the floor for reasons we do not know and they don't bother to turn up the heat to compensate. As well, changes are made to our schedules on a regular basis without any informing. We receive two 15 minute breaks and one half-hour lunch. As i have been informed, both of those 15 minute breaks are legally supposed to be paid breaks but we only get paid for one of them. The hardest part of the job is the sales incentive they have applied to us agents. Most calls the customers already have, do not want, or cannot receive our services and so we are not able to sufficiently meet their goals for us but yet they continue to raise the mark. "
bad,I worked on the PayPal project at the Ogden convergys the job pay hours were great most co workers were down to earth out of management one of the team leads would fight for the employees try to make it fun others were the type to  have their favorites. Hr very shady lady allowed a guy who sexually assulted and harrassed married women. 
bad,"Worst company i have ever worked for in my life, yes i did get Credits for school out of it but otherwise when you first begin they place you on the night shift, most depressing shift of anyone's life and from there you have to wait 6 months before you can even attempt to get a morning shift, the people there are fake and do not meet YOUR personal needs. I did not have a good time with this company, the people i trained with were grreat otherwise i would never go back to this call center, it was sad and they do not promote a healthy lifestyle, do not bother to listen to anyones complaints and show no empathy for you as an individual. if you enjoy sitting on your butt all day (night) and take bullfrom people then this job is for you!"
bad,Hardest part of job is not being able to reach out to managers as they were always in meetings
bad,"Run fast very fast.  This place will suck the life out of you. You and your family mean nothing to them.  No raises.  Nothing but lies.  You will be hired to do one job, but soon it will be two then three and you will not get a raise.  They keep you from using your vacation time.  Stating we have two people off that day.  Do the math if you have 30 agents that get two weeks off a year  30x2= 60 weeks.Seems that there will be some overlapping of 3 people.  They don't care about you!!  Lying and manipulation is how this place manages.  This is an India own company.  Stay away  Horrible place to work."
bad,"Due to the company not accomodating schedules for students, parents, care takers, etc., it was a very hard place to work because a lot of the employees were either over worked or miserable."
bad,"Trust me when I say this, well let me explain the specifics if you're interviewing for the AMEX position. This is the worst job one could have. Convergys is filled with a lot of broken promises that $600 thing trust me is a load of ..... Anyways they do not promote within, the potential to earning bonuses is slim to none. I've seen them fire someone who was with the company for 26.4 years all because they did not want to pay her. Convergys is designed to set you up for failure. I'm only speaking on the Omaha Site(American Express). A typical work day is filled with lies you have to read between the lines with these people make sure everything is writing. Especially with the TLs(Team Leads). Do not trust anyone, watch out for the Operation Managers as well. *Bonus is hard to with IBCS.*"
bad,"This is the worst place to work for. Managers always run their team based on favoritism. I’ve never seen such ancient computers, chairs, and equipment. I’ve worked in the CNH department, and a majority of the people (90%) are all narcissists, rude, passive aggressive, and the team leaders (save one) are the same. "
bad,"I just work for one month, so i did not had that much experience"
bad,"Clock in, take smart, fast and friendly calls. Meet the customer needs and expectation for the call."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Worst call center in the Valley to work at. The pay is the lowest, management is the worst because they don't care about the employees they only care about fraternizing and dating employees. Training is just free time & game time so that's good because you get paid but you learn nothing about the job. Only benefit is that you can use it as experience to go work at T-Mobile or Maximus."
bad,"Unorganized, scheduling changes daily staff pushed to sell sell sell and management not consistant."
bad,"The job entices you with promises of climbing up the corporate ladder with ease within 3 or 4 months, and while this could be true, a majority of people will either a) Quit because they hate the place so much or b) Get fired. While the skills and content knowledge needed to do the job aren't much, the way your performance is evaluated is a total joke. They tell you EVERY caller must be sent to a phone survey, where the question asked is ""How did you enjoy your Netflix experience?"" Notice it does NOT ask ANYTHING about their experience with customer service-- it's ""Netflix"", which means that even if you did your job 100% right and even resolved their issue, the customer can (and probably will) say ""No"", and that negatively affects your job for no good reason. If you're in training and you do not perform well in this evaluation system that feels like it's designed to see you fail, they will fire you... UNTIL they call you back. Yes, after telling you you're out of a job, they have the balls to invite you back, to which they could fire you for the same exact reason."
bad,"It was a busy, busy call center. We interacted with the customers on the phone. Co workers were fine because they were just as busy as I was. The teamwork was the most enjoyable part of the job. The hardest part of the job was meeting everchanging sales quotas."
bad,"I would NEVER recommend anyone to work here in my life. If you're poor as hell and cannot find a job, that would be the place to get quick cash. You can do everything by the books and yet you can never do anything right. The benefits are junk, so you might as well go without insurance. Enjoy the 10 days of PTO you get a year from that dump. No paid sick time, no room for advancement, and you will never get that bonus! If you do get it, it will be around $50-$75 and about 2 months late. Work at Mc Donald's, you will be happier!"
bad,"I worked for the company Netflix. This is the most stressful job. Hours are constantly changing. Management is not consistent. The worst part is they go by favoritism. You honestly have to suck up to get a position. One day a TL was reading a slide from power point to us, and she could not read. She even had troubles editing her side by side reviews that she typed out. She had a csr edit it for her. Obviously that position was picked over favoritism. But honestly I can care less about that, I am concerned about doing my job. But the worst part was the survey. Your job was based of off a question that customers did not know could jeopardize your job. Then management want to ask why is d sat high. That makes your job sooooo stressful."
bad,"Unfair, unethical, stressful enviornment. Management does not keep their word, nor do they own up to favoritism and personal agendas. Felt trapped to work for them because jobs are almost non-exsistent in and around the area. Extremely toxic. People mean nothing to them. People stay sick due to unsanitary work site. People also stay sick due to the anxiety brought about by the management. Hated to lose a paycheck but after leaving my health and peace of mind changed for the better."
bad,I learned a lot from this company. I developed as a customer service agent.
bad,did not look forward to going in
bad,This is the worst place I have ever worked they do not stand by their employees they are always messing up on your bonuses and then sometimes they say you did not even earn a bonus I do not recommend this place to anyone looking for work
bad,This is by far the worst place I have ever worked at.
bad,Constantly change the rules. The place is like high school. Favoritism runs like a raging river. They violate any law or rule they want to and think that people won't do anything about it. If you are the most desperate person in the world for a job.....DO NOT APPLY HERE.
bad,"Supervisors are rude. The company does not care about its employees. There is no security with this company,"
bad,"What an awful company to work for I have absolutely no good memories of it. The Mississauga location was managed by bunch of uneducated, incompetent and power hungry fools."
bad,Convergys is a third party call ceer that takes calls for AT&T and other companies. The Wichita Kansas location is the most unprofessional call center I have ever worked for.
bad,In a regular day you sit at a desk with a computer and phone. You aren't allowed to use books or cellphones. You take calls back to back with realistically 1-3 seconds between calls. You can expect to take around 250-300 calls per shift.
bad,"not a very good job , would not refer anyone I like to this job."
bad,This company isn't as good as T P. They have different short falls. Good experience if you can stick it out.
bad,"WORST place I have ever worked at BY FAR. This place doesnt even pay for washroom breaks. It's ridiculous. I've already reported them to the labour board. They also make you work on your days off if you DARE call in because you're sick. Seriously the absolute worst place I have ever worked. I literally lasted 2 months and that's only because I was so desperately trying to find another job to save me from that hellhole. Seriously, if you get called to work here, DO NOT GO IN. You will regret every second."
bad,"This place would be great if I were already an AT&T customer...but since I'm not ignorant and realize that Charter has far superior internet speed for a fraction of the price...well, it didn't work out for me. I was told - only after 2 months of training - that unless I had AT&T service at home, I wasn't allowed to work for the company. I looked into AT&T service and they wanted over $100 more per month for comparable speed, so, rather than waste $100 that the company wasn't going to reimburse me for every month, I was forced to quit."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I was promised stuff that ended up being all lies like we're post to have holidays off that ended up being false and when I started we were promised a certain kind of bonus per call, which ended up being switched around to where it only benefited them, got stiff out of money they owed me on my checks and they will fire you for coming in at your regular scheduled time. And they will schedule you overtime without you even knowing and they want to give you a point against for it because you did not know because you were off I do not recommend this job to anybody"
bad,"There is no work/life balance, they give you PTO but you are not allowed to use it when you need it, but only when they say, so difficult to plan any family or personal events. The place is filthy, many work stations do not work and reporting the problems fall on deaf ears. They take no responsibility for employees health, if an accident happens it is ""the facilities problem'. They don't own the bldg so if you fall on ice it isn't their problem. Took four days to report an injury as each TL passed it along to another. No raises and if you are able to keep your stats up then you may get a bonus. Weekend before this past christmas they didn't even provide wipes to sanitize work stations, TL on duty too lazy to get any for the employees and then points are given when you are sick from the germs passed thru the place. The Omaha center is ran by a woman from Canada, she is not available to employees and doesn't reply to messages. She and the OM for my product line both took the majority of December off so no one was in charge. The TL's couldn't agree on holiday schedules so I couldn't make any plans with my family. Signed up to work on holiday only to get there (30mile drive) to find I was removed by a different TL. This happened to several employees. The training is a joke as well, and there is no coaching. Coaching is signing your name to an evaluation. There is no suggestions given or encouragement. The only good part of the job is the people that I work with, they are just as frustrated and in the same boat. The TL's and OM treat employees poorly, berating, and bullying at times."
bad,Company has a poor view of emplyees and respect for them. There is favz that get special treatment and then those who get walked all over
bad,Do not work for this company. It's not future or benefits.
bad,Convergys is a mess to say the least. The YP department is dirty and poorly ran. It makes it hard for a hard working individual to excel in this enviroment.
bad,"will hire and fire you the next day. if there was a way for me to give them zero stars i would,"
bad,"An unethical company, through and through."
bad,Convergys is a very disorganized place the managemen is terrible. They are no helpful at all. They also have a point system and I was in the hospital and still got points for being off work. The other employees that work there are great. Very stressful place to work
bad,When I first got hired the job sounded like a great place to work. After working there I found out that it was highly unorganized and not as ideal as it sounded. Other than that the people I worked with were really nice.
bad,Answer calls about medical.
bad,Broken old equitment and chairs. Unorganized company. If you need help on account tls supervisors whatever you want to call lazy people who give you no help gave you the third degree. Comcast there account at the time lied and over charged people. And there services never worked. Training did absoluteley nothing you will still be lost when you get on the floor and no one is willing to help you. I did not know how to do simple things when I got on the floor. I was on call for 15 min to process a credit card payment. And pressure to sell products that you could not process with out asking five people for help before it was done. Pressure and major stress for some lousy 10 per hr See Ya
bad,Everyone hates being there. Only a few honest souls in the company
bad,This customer service position was asking too much work for the amount paid.
bad,This company is the worst. Company does not know nor care about work life balance. You have to share headsets.Just gross.Company wants you to come in 15 mins before shift but you only get paid 5 mins before starting shift. Have to look for your own chair and desk before taken calls. Once you think you have your seat for the entire shift nope you go and take your lunch break which is 30 min. You have to log out of phone and computer so which means you most likely will not get the same seat that you started your shift. So really don't get a 30 min lunch because you have to go back early from your lunch and find a seat againg to finish your shift.Best advice I can give you is don't apply to this company.
bad,"Not telling employees about their pass/fail tests and what I think about it is not very HR related. Then writing someone up for the weirdest things like not being able to log on to COMPUTER is stupid. Co-workers were awsome made some good friends. Training people not very good, they assume that you do nothing and think that you don't care about your job. They say that this is what they observe and they assume just because you are quiet that means that you don't care about your job. There was nothing enjoyable about the job and all the training you have to go through they shove so much into your head the first day. Lets just say that I did not like my job and I would not recommend it to anyone. Because I could see why they can't keep anyone there."
bad,"Convergys is a place of employment for somone that has no responsibility..If you had to solely depend on this company it is not the right one especially when it comes down to paying you for the hours that you worked or the exspecting a bounus that was suppose to be giving to you, that you worked hard to earn..constantly getting lied to not on the same accored ect...."
bad,"So i worked at this place for a few months and hated it. I usually am pretty open minded about jobs and can suck it up but this was terrible. On a daily basis you get cussed out and spoken down to by customers and the management tells you to just deal with it and ignore it. It becomes very difficult after awhile. Also they set downgrade rates that no one can meet unless they cheat, they set you in a ""support bay"" and then do absolutely nothing to help you and then they write you up multiple times when your scores arent improving because you havent recieved the proper help you needed in the first place. Then to top it off when you leave there they let you know you will get your final check via direct deposit and what actually happens is that they send it to the employer and they dont call you to tell you its in two weeks before the actual pay day. Then when you call on payday to see why its not in your account they tell you they stuck it in the mail two weeks ago and they arent sure why you dont have it. All in all this is a horrible place to work but if you can get past everything being wrong its a paycheck i guess"
bad,"good luck working here. the sales are impossible and you will still be scolded multiple times for not making quota. the training does NOT prepare you for the actual calls you recieve at all. The hiring terms of hire were not met. the promises they make during the interview WILL NOT be kept. I strongly suggest to stay away from this company all together. all over bad management, ethics, and lies"
bad,"Just don't, it's not worth the time or headache. There were some good managers there but turnover throughout the call center is crazy. You will get passed up for promotions for no good reason (seriously they will not tell you why they promoted someone else w/ less experience on the project than you)"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"not one item of positive energy can shape this poor representation of our current market,----- big business gain loss on employees."
bad,"I was grateful to have been there for as long as I was. They try to pump you with all of these notions that advancement comes quick... No sir. It wasn't completely a wreck, I mean I was there for nearly two years. I just didn't want to get stuck, i.e. stay in a position that I wasn't completely satisfied with for the rest of my life. I had some family issues, deaths, sickness, which required me to take off. I just found the management staff to be very inconsiderate. I wasn't asking for handouts, not even for it to be paid, it was just a cold reception as if I shouldn't have because that job is all that matters. Smh... Upon starting they stated something like you're required to put at least one year of service into the job, so if you're in school, they won't accommodate. Kind of unreasonable if you asked me... I still managed."
bad,i have no review about this job it was fast food and my very first job.
bad,Work hours are not feasable for single Mothers with Children in School. Training course properly taught.
bad,"This is a place where unless you are a favorite, you will not last beyond 3-6 months. The work is very high pressure, and the management is extremely disorganized. They do not have to keep people on staff because they are constantly hiring new people, therefore herding them in and out like cattle. Very competitive, and rarely recognized for your personal achievements. They will drop you like a hot potato without any investigation. People have been fired improperly for things that the team leader did not investigate due to bad organization. I was fired for a typo, and my name was not even on the dismissal letter. The letter had the person's name on it that was fired right before me. Talk about a typo!"
bad,employees are the least of their worries
bad,They do nothing but lie to you and policies and procedures change on a daily basis and the workplace is like a kindergarten class---Stay away
bad,The schedules vary from one week to another so everything was always up in the air.
bad,long training hours
bad,We were not given any particular place to sit and were not allowed to keep our instruction books at our desks but had to take them home every night and so our day did not start out smoothly. Sometimes there were not enough head sets to go around and we had to stay away from our desks while we tried to find a station where head sets were available.
bad,"Worst company/management I have ever seen. They don't believe in raises and moving up in the company is nearly impossible. They ensure you are miserable and stressed by not allowing you to do...well anything, but stare at your computer and not make a sound. They do a mass hiring then a few months later a mass firing."
bad,"I hated going to work so bad, I missed multiple day's due to illness and health issue's and they made it even worse for me to come in even on well days. I learned new stuff every week but noone knew all the details, managment was impossible to contact, my co-workers were the 1 reason why I stayed employeed with the company, the hardest part was going due to me not enjoying my job, the most enjoyable part of the job was clocking out."
bad,It was a ok job. Needed to be more professional. No one really followed the rules and it was alot of drama and arguing. People where hired that I wouldnt hire as a manager.
bad,"They teach you in training that you matter and they appreciate you, but its all bull...they don't care. The point system is ridiculous and they give you no leeway with personal issues. Maybe if they did away with the point system, then they wouldn't have a high turn over rate. NO RAISES....unless you've been there for 20 years then maybe they give you an extra .10 cents or something. For such a big company, that makes a ton of money, the pay isn't worth the effort. Team leaders are a waste of time, they get paid to do absolutely nothing. It really is a worthless job with nothing to work towards."
bad,It was too far and it was like one big high school full of grown people
bad,A typical day was hunting and searching for a desk with a working computer (employees did not have assigned desks). I did learn collection regulations. Managers screamed at employees from across the room. My co-workers were great. The hardest part of the job was trying to collect from people who were unemployed. There was nothing that I enjoyed about this job.
bad,Convergys does not value their employees. Ive learned great customer service and computer skills.
bad,"Answered phone on daily basis, assisted customers will billing and equpment upgrade orders"
bad,if you know working is the only thing that you have going on in your life and no other prorities then apply here but if not they dont work well with school or babysitting schedules at all
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I can't say anything positive, I was treated poorly, management was miserable. Only good thing I can think of is it was a job."
bad,"You'll never make it past the 3rd week. This place is pretty much a scam. They tell you last minute before you get on the floor that your DSAT has to be at an 10% (Dsat is the % from the responses that you get from the 1 question surveys.) Might i also Add that the question doesn't ask hour your customer service experience was today, they ask about your netflix experience. There has been customers who has called back and said, We Loved the person we spoke with, we didn't know that we were giving her a ""NO"". Which Proves that the Question is meant to throw the customer off and its meant to mess you over to.."
bad,"If you like working for liars and thieves, this is the place for you!"
bad,Terrible place bosses change things dailey most of them don't no what is going.
bad,It wasn't a very good place to work for! I would go in and set in a class for 8 hours a day with a poor trainer who didn't feel he needed to teach us anything!
bad,"Activation of new direct TV customers, collect payments, upgrade/download TV packages. I,ve learned that even celebrities have cable TV; I spoke to actor Richard Gere on the phone once. Management was very strict but made us aware of constant changes. the rules were the hardest part, you are fired after getting 3 red flags. the most enjoyable part of the job was the training process and all the updates occuring as time went by."
bad,Management treats you like a slave. You are scheduled in when to go to the bathroom. One 15 min break in AM and one in PM. You are timed and recorded on every call. ONE customer complaint on you and you are toast! Answering calls from customers on OnStar. Customers call in and difficult to understand what they say on car microphone. Brutal place to work with extremely low wages. Get 10 cents pay raise after ONE YEAR of Work!
bad,"You were stationed at a cubicle that you can not move from, except during scheduled breaks. Answered phones and followed a strict script."
bad,Company has lost focus on helping there customers and focuses on sales alone. even when it envolves manipulating the customer into buying.
bad,Training was a joke. All play and no work... And then you are put out on the floor with barely any help. Chat for help...really....
bad,"i was there for over a year, i tried my hardest to do good. I was in one department that they got rid of and went to a new one. I was stuck at $10 an hour for the entire time. No raises. They said based on scores you have the opportunity to get bonus, no matter HOW GOOD you were doing they found ways to knock you down so you didn't bonus! When filing for unemployment they lie and fake proof that you weren't what they were looking for so they didn't have to pay out! this is a TERRIBLE company! I was fired for ""call avoidance"" i was in the restroom the entire time i was supposedly hanging up on customers! If you're looking to make $10 and hour and never get more or move up in a company this is for you."
bad,Position was laid back team atmosphere. Not hard work. The company was not very organized. The people were great easy to work with and get along with.
bad,Worked for Netflix at the Farmington location. the only thing good about this position is the free Netflix membership that goes along with it.
bad,Convergys is a company that is growing at a fast rate and that has a lot of opportunities
bad,This is truly the worst company in America.
bad,The majority of the work is call center work. They pay very close attention to what you are suppose to do and evaluate you on a regular basis.Management however does not follow through on what they are suppose to do. They took away our regular and performance raises promising bonuses for performance but then did not make sure the system worked. The result was no one could get close to the top bonus and you couldn't tell why. Finally the employees figured out the problem and advised management but still tough to get the bonus promised.
bad,Have never worked at a much worse place. They will ding you for starting work late even though no working work station was available. Have awful shift timings. Good luck to anyone thinking of going that route.
bad,It's a good job if your 18 and have never had a job.If you have no experience and can type you can get a job.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Horrible place to work for they promise you one thing and then say another they take everything out from underneath you.
bad,"I have worked here and trust me they are not friendly, if you go to school and work do not do it here. They will mess up your schedule, management is unfair, training is a joke, incentives never come in or come in 4 months later than predicted, NOT A FUN PLACE TO WORK IN AT ALL."
bad,"the company convergys in my and many others opinion that have worked there is a very undesirable place to work. they do not train you enough, the trainers don't know their jobs, they have so called ""team leaders"" who don't do anything but watch over your shoulder and tell you what you're doing wrong, never any positive comes out of the ""TL's"" or the ""supervisors"". they do not hesitate to fire a person for no reason, don't give warnings to try to correct the problem. they love to fire people there, so if you are looking for a good stable company to work for, DO NOT PICK CONVERGYS, they are horribly unfair, not to mention being a terrible company to work for."
bad,"Worst company I have ever worked for in the life. Agents in most deparements are capped at 12$ per hr regardless on how long you have worked for the company. They dont pay you to go to the bathroom. Team leaders talk about agents behind their backs, very inconistant."
bad,Music playing alln over the building.Calls in qeue.MUSIC MUSIC MUSIC
bad,Assited angry customers with keeping accounts and lowering APR
bad,"Talk on the phone all day with customer via inbound. The hardest part of job was dealing with irate customers, other than that the job was not hard."
bad,I hated working here. I had a medical issue with my ears that they did not wrk with me on. they attempted to get me a Leave of absence but they endedfiring me before the fact that i was cleared. but after they fired me they called me back to offer my job back to be since it went through. but the thing is they only called me back not because they wanted me to come back but for the face that they had to for legal purposes.
bad,"Tooke position after being laid off, the culture and ethics of this call center did not meet my expectations."
bad,not structured or organized
bad,Assisted AT&T customers with troubleshooting phones and added applications to their phones and had to upsale there U-Verse package
bad,"Managers were so impersonal, the reps were rude to customers, the company would just send you home due to calls being slow call volume versus asking if you wanted to leave."
bad,"What they say about convergys is true, Its the north american sweatshop, stay clear or you'll get fired for somthing not your fault 2 years later and 30 pound heavier."
bad,"We determined if we could help someone with their windows installs for free. Most often we could not. Microsoft pulled this project soon after I started, and sent it to India or Malaysia or something like that."
bad,I have had many promises from this company and I have found that getting things in writing would be a good idea because you find in many circumstanstances that they do not hold up to what they have told you they would do. I was told I would only work one weekend a month and now I have found I will be off one weekend a month. I was told an amount for shift differential and raises and none of that is true. The job description says customer service and the essential part of the job is sales. I have found this to be a very high stress setting where people are constantly swarming around you listening to you to see what you are saying and essentially have you hold the customers resulution hostage until they agree to purchase other services.
bad,"this job was a headache, the calls are continusly back to back and the benefits are not that great with no real chance to move up within the company"
bad,"No benefits, pension was cancelled. In bound call center with back to back calls."
bad,"This place is a complete joke. They tell you one thing, yet do another. If I could travel back in time, i would have declined the job offer and seeked employment else where."
bad,I have never worked in a more chaotic environment that during my 3 years with Convergys.
bad,"This is probably the worst job I have ever had in my life. The location had too many employers, so most time when I arrived for my shift i'd have to wait 1-3 hours just to get a desk. This affected my metrics but it was how Workforce was overlapping too many schedules. I had to work every weekend and had no chance for a social life or even spend time with my family. Some weeks schedules would be inconsistent: may work 4p-1a then have to be back the next day at 7 or 8a for work. I lost a lot of sleep. They wouldn't properly pay me for my shift differentials. They micro_manage everything that you do. Management doesn't keep good record of attendance so there are always decrepancies."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Great job for getting customer service experience under your belt.
bad,Convergys is a very unprofessional place to work. Did not recieve the adequate training in order to do the job sufficiently. Management is ill mannered. There is no HR department.
bad,i believe this is the worst place to work......A place where no one knows whats going on and turn over rate is very high
bad,I worked as Customer Serice agent on the phone @ Convergys for a total of 3 years. The second year of my employment the call center I was located at became a Sales Center. And for the same amount of pay we became responsible for ten times the work that we were responsible when we first started.
bad,"The UHC side is inconsistent in training and in giving information. schedule is random and it gets changed at the last minute a lot. ugh! This place has a major turn around in employees, worse than walmart."
bad,"In 30 yrs of corporate experience, Convergys will always be remembered as the only place I have ever worked where employees go out the door faster than they come in! Applicants Beware...Apply At Your Own Risk!"
bad,Lots of lies you can not make any incentives working there .they dont appreciate you at all.
bad,They prefer 0 retension so that they do not have to compensate employees with raises.
bad,Terrible job do not work here they will stress you out all the time they treat you like your nonthing and bring you down all the time worst decision of my life was going there if this place was the last job on earth I would rather be job less
bad,Seriously one of the worst places I have ever worked. They do not care. They force you to do things you arent ready for. Your health doesnt matter. Just run the other way.
bad,"They offer little to no encouragement. If they do it's a tiny snack bar or bag of chips for sales. They are unforgiving about time off even with appropriate doctors notes. The only thing they cared about was sale, sales, sales"
bad,the only way to get on in there is to go with management. its terrible stressful. no proper backing for staff. you can't do right for doing wrong.Glad to be out of it now.
bad,"I hate this place. From mandatory 20 hrs overtime and screaming customers who belittle you, it's a terrible place. Management does nothing, there's no room for growth. Definitely not enough pay at 11 per hour for 12 hours a day of this."
bad,"Pathetic place to work with ! Whenever they are in need of resources, they keep moving you from one process to another however during appraisals, nobody is bothered to take the ownership and review your effort or give you a hike.. I'm here since 2 years without any learning or benefit only because it's a day shift"
bad,"They constantly demand flexibility from you, mess up on paychecks, change schedules and managers like crazy, yet if you need something they are unable to do it!  I’m sick of it and look for a new job everyday for the past year!"
bad,"If you decide to work for Concentrix, watch your back and be ready to kiss much booty "
bad,"This place is ran as if the highest education completed is High School. Very dysfunctional, disrespectful environment. Team leaders were a joke, childish or overbearing"
bad,"The only way you make bonus’s is sell Directv. And 99% of your customers do not want it. You have to push something on people that is lousy, and high!"
bad,"This company is like a circus show. They care about THEMSELVES and their company. There is no room for advancement, the coaches (who are also temps) show no support. Extremely low morale- trickle down affect from the poor management. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Work at home very stressful, and they always threaten with termination. It's a jail you don't even get to go to the bathroom if you have to. They charge you by the minute. Overtime is some times compulsory. They do not give you statuary holidays or holiday pay."
bad,"Very stressful place of employment management was constant breathing down your neck"
bad,"Worked my booty off for this company and was about to get a promotion only to be treated like i just started when it came time to move to our next client for ramping. Demoted when moved to next campaign and then run around and treated like i was new and knew nothing. They didn’t pay many of my co workers, cause several to get audited during tax time do to the company using a loop hole for their own tax benefit, HR is a complete joke, the list goes on. I resigned do to their scheduling being to Chaotic, random, and with no ability whatsoever to work with anyone’s scheduling for kids family or death. Just avoid this place unless you Absolutely need money"
bad,"The management is worst, they wouldn't give you opportunity to grow. Salary is below market level compared to the work and expectation company has. Partiality is the moto of this company you can say, your views and ideas doesn't matter for them. Management treats you like they are doing faver on you by giving job."
bad,Concentrix was an amazing place to work for at the beginning. As soon as I moved contract there was bullying from the managers and obvious favouritism. It was like being back in high school. Sadly I was let go due to my mental health in stead of getting the support I needed from my managers. If you’re not “one of them” you’re not cared about.
bad,"Hired on as temporary. Told about a 450 sign on bonus, but wont receive it until after 90 days. Then after 90 days you are moved from 12 dollars an hour to 10.50. The interviewers say it's due to sales, that you'll make it up. Then first day of training they advise only 2-3 percent of your calls will be actually sales, and you'll take 30 calls in a shift. On first day of training it's all about what you CANT do, they talk about how to handle escalations. Which going over that information on the first day, it doesn't sit right with me. They also preach that the customer should ask for a manger several times before they will get on the phone."
bad,"Treat you awfully once your training is through,  had a day off because of one little mistake and they sat me down in a room and made me feel tiny about 15 people telling me how one day was not acceptable even if I wouldve come in on my day off then said that was over for me, felt intimidated the whole time I was there!"
bad,"The management was horrible for the contract that I was hired on. The training was a joke. The stress level was insane. The pay was a joke. They made it look like I just stopped coming up to work and “stole” equipment when I had to move (even though I cleared it with my supervisor WELL in advance). Management was no help and completely unprofessional. They’ll hire anyone, so most of the employees are incompetent. Including the ones that are supposed to be “tier 2” and help when you cannot. Don’t do it."
bad,"I worked there for almost a year and there is nothing that would ever make me go back. HR laughs at your concerns, TLs and floor don't care, and you can never, never find help. Then, when you do finally received help, you're treated horribly for even asking. There's no accountability, no stability, and no reliability to be found anywhere."
bad,"Over all pay and management were not the greatest. Changed everything on everyone last moment, and god forbid you had anything bad to say about the company, they'll fire you. Of you're looking to work here, talk to some of the employees and get honest testimonies from them."
bad,"I started having seizures for the first time. I went to ER, emailed documents. Supervisor suggested I quit due seizures (violation of disability law)."
bad,"My experience they don't listen to employees concerns, terrible working equipment/environment, they will screw every way for vacation that Is owed to you even if you chose to bank vacation"
bad,I definitely wouldnt recommend it unless you enjoy stress! They dont care about employees at all. Youre expected to put up with very rude people via phone and chat.
bad,If you don't mind talking on the phone all the time and being cussed on a daily basis this is the job for you. Management sucks some are good but most don't care. Food gets stolen so don't bring a lunch best buy it at lunch time.
bad,I was the last person in my class to be fired. They terminate for points over 12 and you get a point for illness even with a doctor's note which forces sick people to come to work a nd get everyone sick. No win situation
bad,"Do not waste your time working for Concentrix. Management does not care about the employees, and does not fight for workplace improvements. Training was 3 weeks of sitting in a room while the 'trainer' leaves for hours at a time, and fires you if you don't do well enough on the first exam. Our entire contract was eliminated overnight, with little reason provided, and no opportunity to move to another contract without 'reapplying' and hoping for the best from a company that didn't have our best intention in mind in the first place."
bad,This is without a doubt the single worst place I’ve ever worked the 3 months I was there were the most horrific 3 months of my life.  Dreaded even thinking  about getting up to go there and counted the minutes by when I was there.  Unrealistic targets and pressure selling to people who couldn’t afford it.  MONTHLY BONUS 99% OF THE TIME YOU CANT HIT BECAUSE THEY CHNAGE THE GOAL POSTS FOR IT IN FINAL WEEK OF THE MONTH AND GIVE “COMPANY NEEDS” AS THE REASON.
bad,"This job is for those who just finished high school  this. This place is a joke. Training was half *****, no one knew what they were doing, people weren’t getting paid, dust, roaches, and RATS everywhere, hood music playing in the background while taking your calls, and just a flat out mess. Women come to work in practically nothing. Cells phones on the floor capturing customer’s information and nothing is done about it  stay clear of this place"
bad,Not a very professional working environment. Language used in casual conversation is not appropriate.  Job requirements are constantly changing.  You do not feel as though you are being set up to succeed.
bad,"Sent a Mac mini, headset, & camera. had to purchase hardwired keyboard, mouse, 21"" monitor, landline for calls. hired @$13/hr, but trained @$11/hr. training is full time, on camera & complete joke. If equipment doesn't work or login credentials they create for u don't work, ur SOL & noone cares or fixes- ever. time/pay is always wrong & work for free or be retaliated against to get fixed"
bad,"this job sucked, it involved a lot of de-escalation and dealing with upset customers while using a very non-user friendly website. Would not reccomend this job to my worst enemy"
bad,This company doesn't care about employees. There is no reward for loyalty they only value new people. Advisers are encouraged to miss sell and miss use systems and sacked when the client finds out. Higher management are disrespectful to staff and don't care about improving the work place or helping the staff. this is a very unprofessional place to work with no opportunity to progress further in the company they just give you false promises.
bad,Concentrix will let their clients burn out the employees because they know the next training class is already scheduled. I reported the client of Philips Lighting about harassment because she was screaming and swearing at employees doing their best everyday. Of course HR tried to cover my report by not getting back to me and not responding to my phone calls or countless e-mails.
bad,"I had worked for the company for almost a year. I had been diagnosed with a medical condition and needed time off. After keeping them up to date on my situation and when i can return to work they had put me on the schedule 3 weeks early. They then terminated my position with them without even reaching out to me. When i had called them back i got no help and no answers and brushed off. I then informed them I could easily come after them for wrongful termination and they simply shrugged me off again. It's a call centre job that has insanely high turnover as it is and they still dont treat you as if they need you, they treat you as if you are expendable. For a job that needs people to feel passionate about what they do they show little to no respect for the employees, it's a popularity contest. The HR department is a joke. They never take anything you say seriously and they never keep documentation properly. I have had to get 10-15 doctors notes for 2 things because they couldn't keep a piece of paper in a file. HR will also not call you back or keep in touch with you like they say they will. The supervisors/Team leaders that work with you there also are god awful at communication. If you have no other choice but to work here it's better than flipping burgers but just barely. If you have the chance to not work at this place i wouldn't even humor this company with your time. "
bad,"Long story short, this place was a joke. Comparison to high school would be doing the company a favor. Management of all levels was very unprofessional. Pay was nowhere near competitive for the industry. Benefit package was absolutely terrible and extremely overpriced. There is absolutely no flexibility with scheduling, so it’s literally a choice between home life or work. Advancement opportunities are far and few between except to backfill for those of us that were smart enough to leave. They couldn’t even keep HR personal staffed, every position was a revolving door. I could go on all day with horror stories but to make it easy, just stay far far away."
bad,"The work environment is unprofessional, the managers either don’t know what they’re doing or they are unnecessarily hostile towards you. They treat staff like children. The only good thing I can say is they do give you a lot of proper training and make sure you have all the information and resources you need to do your job right."
bad,"If you can buttering your manager then you will get salary hike as well as better posts, job title. But if your reporting manager don't like you then start looking  for other jobs."
bad,"If want to be at all work all hours of the night!! Never get to see ur family then this is the perfect job for u! They write u up for exhaling to hard! Very tedious, petty, things u learn in the 2 week at night training class.. will not be the same once u hit the call center floor!! My trainer sucked.. complained more about the job itself himself. Job sucks don’t it."
bad,"Constently on the phones don't have a minute to gather your thoughts. it just turned into me taking 30 minute  bathroom breaks to avoid the super fast call flow, harassment that came from customers daily. With the added stress from managment it was not fun. would not recomend!! honestly got super stressed out working here. you never get a minute to gather your thoughts your just thrown right back on to another call. plus the 8 1/2 hr days staring at a computer can be rough for your health. the hours are the only good thing about this job!"
bad,"Worked there for a year. Moved up to tier 2....huge mistake. Answering inbound calls and consults while having to follow up on existing cases at the same time. Micro-managed. Need a day off? Good Luck! Took bereavement leave when a family member died and got scheduled to work a day later. Came back to work day after funeral and asked to leave early only to be lectured on how many days I missed already. Started to have a mental breakdown and requested a change of job roles back to tier 1 - was denied the request since I had no family doctor and a note from a doctor at the hospital's ER was deemed unacceptable- ""An ER doctor could write you a note saying you have ebola"" was HR's response. Many times where pay was incorrect or they just didn't pay you. Got offered Visa gift cards (which they expected be repaid) in lieu of missing paycheck. Unattainable stats...Customer reviews would torpedo the small bonus you could earn. One review I got was a 0 because there were not enough Apple stores in a certain city!? Avoid at all costs!"
bad,"Could not support my family on the pay I was making. Management really sucked and their QA process was terrible. "
bad,"I would not recommend working at a call centre ver in my life again, the customers can be extremely hostile and oblivious, the dealer reps are not on your side and make you out to seem bad, management didn’t do anything but ruin sales opportunity for you"
bad,"This company is not newbie friendly. Definitely not for the faint of heart. They did not provide proper onboarding when I worked there. From the get go, they will expect that you'll learn the ins and outs of the job in a short amount of time without proper training. I also cannot stand the feeling that the employees are not welcoming. They need to work on communication with peers and teamwork. Also, there is a huge room for improvement in terms of Recruitment Process Management."
bad,The company shows favtorism to an extreme. I had to leave if you do not have a “personal relationship” or flirt you’ll be considerd replaceable!!!!!!!
bad,"I'm a first time mom and as soon as I came back from maternity leave, I was treated different. The expected me to work even if I had no money for daycare or anyone to watch my son."
bad,"Your contract makes a bit of a difference when you work here as to how content you are, however you quickly see that favourites are played.  Only those favourited are ever respected, and they are going to suck every drop of hard work, energy, and ambition out of you.  "
bad,Change hours every 2 weeks you try to ask them about it and they tell u to ask to switch with someone. It was veey inconvenient for me at the time and i explained that to them.
bad,It is a very difficult place to work. The targets are very high and managers push very hard to achieve. The senior leaders are all from Daksh days and they gang up against any new comer. The culture is very negative and supervisors threaten to fire you every other day.
bad,"This place has the worst atmosphere to work...you either have to party or be a swinger to make it in this site...management kicks you down and lies...no loyalty, I’ve seen ppl with over 15 years experience walk out...shame on concentrix/ mini acts/ Avalon / whatever the name of the week is! This company should be shut down, if APPLE knew the way this company treats their technical advisors they would think twice about being partners with them"
bad,"Just stay away! It is a very bad company, the team leaders are not professional at all, the management doesn’t do anything to make it better. Horrible people, horrible workplace. There is no progression at all. They employ everyone and rough people seem to be favoured!"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Ultimately, Concentrix sells people's time. The only way for them to become more profitable is for them to squeeze every ounce of productivity out of every single employee. This results in management ultimately caring way more about the numbers you produce than you as a person."
bad,"If you want a job that makes you dread going to work, this one's for you!  Badly managed, no consistency as to what is expected, rules are subject to change based on the individual, which manager is there, and what time of day it is.  "
bad,"By far the worst people I've ever worked with in my life, and I have worked in many call centers. Honestly, I would say more than half of the agents suffered from some sort of mental illness. They will hire anyone with a pulse, and refuse to fire the ancient agents that have been there for 15 or 20 years that any other company would have fired long ago. The training is complicity in sufficient, the turnover is extremely high. Most of the agents are fresh out of high school, their first job, and don't care about anyting other than a paycheck. Customer service is horrible, management is awful, supervisors are constantly quitting. Every other call is a supervisor call, ghetto customers constantly complaining and yelling at the ghetto agents. Was a miserable place to work. Can't believe I was there as long as I was, but needed a job. I would say don't ever  work there, but am sure the project will be shut down in the next few months anyway, so you won't have to worry about it."
bad,"Teamlead was pretty decent and tried her best to work with my needs"
bad,"Dirty, illness continually spreads around, no positive influence as all was negative.  Very stressful and constant complaints from employees.  Answering phones to try to help individuals with the problems that they were having with their Apple products."
bad,"Nothing works, the managers do not help when you need them. No sick pay. Almost modern slavery. Flithy toilets and canteen {also very small and uncomfortable}. HR is the worst. They lie about good shifts when you have no say in that, work weekends and Bank Holidays without extra pay."
bad,"When company was Convergys it was a horrid place to work. No progression at all unless you were friendly with managers. Managers had no understanding on mental health, no support from management and wage is appalling."
bad,"Needs to revise management ASAP"
bad,Concentrix does not pay employees their correct amount of hours. They told the Labor Relations Board that I was terminated for not working my shifts.  There was proof I worked because the calls are monitored and recorded.  I really wanted to stay there but I do not think their payroll system would get corrected.
bad,Lied about shifts and hours plus lied about commission. You’ll be forced to work every weekend and the team is Full of BS! Managers are OK but it’s all Sale Sale Sale treated like robots. And they say you get your Rotas 4 week LIARS ITS 2!
bad,"One of the trashiest call centers in the valley, just slightly above 24/7 in touch and Alorica. I quite because they refused to pay me adequately to my peers, and because upper management literally thinks of employees as cattle."
bad,"Lengthy interview process and what sounded like an amazing opportunity ended up being a low paid nightmare. So many promises that seemed to make the low salary just a little better, but none were followed through with. Endless hours, unattainable targets, tiny breaks and no support for very intense contracts. Employees are treated as dispensable and it shows the the high turnover rate. Wouldn’t recommend even if desperate for work."
bad,"Stipendi altalenanti di mese in mese senza motivazione. Straordinari non pagati, ferie inaccessibili. Contratto non stabile e meritocrazia inesistente. Il management crea un ambiente inutilmente stressante e negativo. È difficile andare in pausa come previsto per legge. Gli ambienti di lavoro sono molto sporchi e le attrezzature per lavorare danneggiate e inadeguate. Unica nota positiva: alcuni colleghi in aerea sono davvero disponibili ad aiutarti, soprattutto all'inizio in quanto il corso di formazione non ti prepara adeguatamente al lavoro da svolgere."
bad,"Just because you changed the name doesn’t mean anything , maybe change the people to ones that will actually work . They have mandatory overtime and expect you to be at work the next day sometimes an hour or 30 minutes earlier"
bad,"They cut the pay and froze raises. Culture was for managers and not the people who did the actual work "
bad,"I worked with the sprint project that was originally with convergys. Convergys was already a circus. With the turn over rate and lack of intelligent management. Half the time the managers didnt know what they were doing and the operations manager changed 4 times in the 14 months I worked there.  The escalation process was trash. No one knew what they were doing. The environment was terrible. Like high school. All gossip. There was no structure. Around Feb all the convergys agents moved to the Tempe concentrix and a whole different disaster began. Prettier building, but the same pretty nonsense, withe people quitting and getting fired. Barely anyone to answer the phones. Them basically just pushing people who weren't ready out of training/lab. I quit. Only thing that kept me there as long as I was, was the unlimited over time, the bonus structure, and the paychecks. Pretty decent money if you dont care about your stress levels and well being."
bad,"One had doesn't know what the other is doing, small groups of people have large amounts of influence and do not bother to listen to other peoples opinions which creates a lot of waste and decreased performance."
bad,"I worked in a large insurance call center. I enjoyed it at first. However, I was treated unfairly in evaluations. The customers became very rude as I increased in level of expertise. The daily floor management was inexperienced and poor. The culture was negative because most employees didn't want to be there. The hardest part of the job was maintaining self-control while talking to customers that were cursing at you for no reason. The most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,i Worked with concentrix for a year. Experience was quite bad. management do not know how to treat a female employee during maternity.i Was asked to extend my work timing. Though joined as a contractual employee i was being promised to take on company pay role. Hence did not look out for option. When they came to know that i was carrying asked me to leave within three days.
bad,"Better than some call centers but that's not saying much. Every day while driving to work, you will be asking yourself, ""Why am I still doing this to myself?"""
bad,"There are no advancement opportunities, the pay is appalling and often late, and short. Trying to arrange holidays is very difficult. The performance related pay is calculated by a method that changes several times a year. The management show little concern for the well-being of the employees."
bad,"Call times were artificially small due to employees cheating the system."
bad,"Not good if your face doesn't fit. Not compassionate regarding cases of mental health. Training was awful and we learned on the fly."
bad,I would not recommend Concentrix to anyone whom I have respect for! A workplace that subjects employees to constant intimidation and lack of realistic expectations. An extremely high turn-over rate due to lack of incentive to want to stay with the company. Training is poor and performance expectations are beyond what would be considered fair and reasonable. One walks out at the end of their shift both emotionally and physically drained.
bad,"Training was too short. I had a tough start, but I learned fast what I needed to do to be successful. I quickly resolved customer issues & my customers loved me for it. However, despite that I kept getting new managers every one or two. My manager suddenly called me & said I was fired because of my performance with metrics without prior warning. I investigated & discovered my metrics were the best ever. I had let them know about a medical issue, I believe I was singled out for this so I am suing the company  for wrongful termination & discrimination.  Management with this company is a joke. So if are considering applying don’t, run the other way!"
bad,"That place is a joke to work for, a lot of the management got there training out of a badly run r rated film where they were as fake as the world.. Some of my co Workers were horrible beyond words this I’ll let me post. The training was horrible and could of been put together better overall. Over all the pay was the equivalency of a sweat shop for the amount of garbage we had to deal with. You go there to have your soul and heart die for pennies. Favoritism is the norm at convergys aka the trash can, where people are promoted because of there popularity, looks and problbly who they sleep with not skill aka a certain girl in my training class who was nasty and yelled at everyone even customers and got reworded for it even made coworkers cry you know who you are. Over all you go in normal and leave a outpatient program. This is the worst company to work for a lot of them deserve to be in the unemployment line if this place closes will be the best thing to happen to it."
bad,"- The stations are over worked unsanitary. "
bad,"They do not value their employees. There is too much favoritism. Management will snap on you for the smallest of things, and you are not allowed to take any time off, and if you have a family...goodluck seeing them with the stupid mandatory hours they make you work over the busy season, you get ONE day off to spend with family...you have to ask permission to use the washroom, you get spoken too like you are stupid and like you're nothing, and have to walk on egg shells everyday just incase you breathed wrong and you don't get written up."
bad,"This building has such unsanitary conditions that it is unbelievable. Shared stations including headsets, phones, desks and computers. Applications frequently have issues to perform job effectively. This is paper free environment where food is accessible in designated areas only. Bugs are rampant in the lockers so I am afraid to bring anything into the building that I cannot keep with my person at all times and only in sealed containers. Concerns about food getting bugs so I cannot bring food for snack or lunch. The pay is not a true livable wage for a family. Many managers still live at home with parents because they cannot afford to live on their own. Some managers are helpful. Most managers are hostile toward team members. Some upper management are hostile, judgmental, prejudiced, label employees within a few seconds of interaction and marginalize employees that are not ""deemed"" equal."
bad,"Training was great, met some amazing people and had a great time learning new skills. But after the 3 week mark you are forced to go on calls, even if you have no prior experience, week 4 more of the same and once you get to week 6, let's hope you know what you are doing because their's virtually no help. We had no TL in site the very first day. Makes you feel like you are in a sinking ship right out of training."
bad,"Avoid Doint waste your time.If you only go in as a English speaking onstar customer service agent management will fail you for sure.t.Only bilingual staff passed in my group only one multilingual member of staff (passed ).They only keep the company happy to show they are advertising for english staff,but none of the English speaking staff according to the assessor one in particular ever passes past first bass."
bad,"Come to find out that you are hired as ""seasonal"" employees, subject to lay-off or transfer to another vendor without much notice at their discretion as a ""weeding out"" process."
bad,"Working for the British Gas ASV campaign. The only positive about working here is that the job itself is simple to grasp and, for the most part, not very demanding. Customers will often complain and there is no training or support to deal with the emotional and mental strain of listening to 15-30 minute rants day after day. The client provides very little options to satisfy the customer and you will be explaining to many of them why they should accept being placed in a completely unreasonable situation. The quality assessment team will fail you for making a mistake in a call on an issue that you were never trained in. The knowledge on the floor about the campaign and the client is laughable and often you will find yourself dealing with queries that nobody can seem to answer. There is a clear lack of communication between the company and the client and the information provided by managers will usually be contradicted by another department. Forget about the bonuses as you will likely never see anything close to the full amount, whereas people who hardly make a call will earn double. The managers are next to no help when dealing with complaints and will often direct you to other advisors for guidance, if there is even a manager available on the floor. Most know better than to bother asking the their actual team leader and go straight to another agent. It is quite clear that the last thing they want is to actually take over a complaint from you and will reprimand you for following the procedure correctly, simply because it makes more work for them. They will pull you up and ask"
bad,There is no job security. He did not gives info about completed t&c and after doing any thing wrong no one can have time to discuss about that. seniour is not supportive.
bad,"We  were almost 50 agents that had been forced to resigned, and some had chosen  to be terminated. Most of us had been working for 4-5 months after we had been kicked off on the program. They said that we did not pass the training. The training that we signed on was only for 5 weeks in total, and we passed the certification before we hit on the floor.  But as advised by our supervisor it’s  the client call to trim down  the agent on the floor.  Sadly we had been swept on the corner before they trashed us out.  They were not even bothered to wait for 6 months to decide whether we can be regularized or not. They have policy manual, but they don't follow the process. We have our labour code, but they don't mind to do things without due process. It's really a terrible experience."
bad,Didn't really like the job but the people were okay. skjnad;nval;kvndanvl;sknvdjfnbdk;ljnbocxlkznbop\idjmvpworegmposdmvxkcmv \xlkgmaorigj0waerjtoifsbvp\oxcjv-\spocjbvs3\v
bad,"Get ready for the ride of your life in customer service as you deal with the same issues day in day out with nothing to do in between. Bad habits will start to become the norm just to get the day done with lovely madatory voluntold hours you -must- work. Training puts a nice little facade that the workplace is life manageable but that's laughable at best, issues will go unchanged, pay differences will takes months to fix, and management that have ego/power issues with the mentality of 20 year olds.  "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"worked as a DirecTV retention agent. team leads were no more skilled than your average call center agent picked at random. resolving customer problems in a tailored way was less important than spewing out a script that, about half the time, just angered the customer off even more. Was promised unlimited over time, was never able to get any approved. Was promised shift preference if in the top 10% of employees, made it to the top 10%, never got to pick a preference."
bad,Wouldn't waste my time writing about them if this wasn't required. I wouldn't suggest anyone to work there if they want to keep their sanity. So not worth it
bad,Worst place to work. Unorganized unprofessional loud playground. They are sexist. The male trainers will harass you. So much drama on the floor. Messy. They irked my nerves. My team lead did not come in work periodt !! I got out of training and had no manager for 2 weeks. They never put your time in. Someone stole $400 out of my friend's locker. They are ridiculous
bad,"A evitar a todo o custo."
bad,"Nasty building, amateur managers, no experience in the place, upper management is a joke, no hr department, no chance for ,advancement or raise, you only fit in if you don't shower or if you brown nose someone in upper management, good luck getting any scheduled time off because communication does not exist here, no one knows how to train the new people so it was up to about 10 of us who actually know what we are doing to train appropriately. this is the worst company i have ever worked for"
bad,"convergys is een typisch amerikaans bedrijf, als targets en gedram over ""sales""maken je ding is dan zit je op het het eisplatform goed."
bad,This company is all about cutting costs. Their management is primarily concerned with keeping calls short. Doing a good job does not improve your chances of promotion.
bad,There was no room for advancement.  The training was good.  I really do not have a lot to say about Convergys as I am not a big fan. I would not recommend working there.
bad,you get there log into computer and phone and take calls for client ( you do get at least a 3 week training) the client I was with was a great client and we were trained how to help their customers but other clients were a joke
bad,At first everything was goo. Was suppose to be on a set schedule. On last week of training they changed our contract to fix their mistake. Got sexually harassed from my trainer. My daughter got hurt in daycare and they fired me while on personal leave. A bunch of promises that never happen.
bad,"So pros first - worked in upgrades for 4 months did achieve bonus every month hour lunch has pro and Cons to it. Ready app was brilliant vouchers for selling certain devices. And fortunately won a grand prize "
bad,"The treatment at this location is very poor, and a lot of favoritism from the upper management. There is no kindness given to the employees, and treatment from other peers is very childish. It is as if, you are in high school all over again."
bad,"It is a crazy place to work.  Lots of fun but very little organization.  Not proactive in the least.  You will encounter some very nice people but you will also encounter some people who are out of control.  The company let's too many things slide with people who are out of control.  You might be sitting right next to someone who is high as a kite, drunk as a skunk or just normal."
bad,"DRAMA!!! God help you if you have a problem with any management. They are all friends even with HR. Sucks! Over worked under paid, craziness every day"
bad,Never work at the southfield location of this company. This company has so many wrongful terms its not funny.Everyone in management is friends and no will will advance unless your doing something that will benefit them. Never will work for this company again.
bad,"I started working for the British Gas side, and was quickly fast tracked on to the SDSA course, when an opportunity came up for HSBC, more money closer to home, better house etc, so i applied and was approved, upon moving they basically lied and said i failed a credit check, so i checked my credit report and found a perfect credit rating and no checks on my account, then found that British Gas had extended there contract and heads needed retaining, so basically i was told i hadn't passed the check when really all they wanted to do was keep me where i was on as little as possible, needless to say I WALKED.............and would never walk back again, for any amount of money."
bad,It would be a good place to work if the supervisors were willing to assist the advisers more often. The hours are inconsistent and you acquire only 2 hours of paid time off (PTO) every pay period.  It is very hard to be get approved for your PTO. When the company feels that you aren't adhering to the timetable they will shorten your hours without informing you or they will change your hours without notice. Example: If you are scheduled to come to work at 12pm and you show up at 12pm but overnight they changed your time to 10am. You will be reprimanded. That's their way of getting rid of you.
bad,"You work on behalf of GM, FCA, etc., and can provide World-class servicing to every customer; have excellent Quality scores and show up for work on time, as scheduled. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Its a call center - thats it."
bad,this is a company that offers a job if you are desperate. I did not care to work for this company at all. High turn over and schedule changes EVERY month!
bad,"Poor training, management, constantly changing environment, very high fluctuation rate, favorism and bullying, slow computer systems. It is an experience...."
bad,As tech support agents it felt like our systems often had more issues that the customers did. Most management redirects you for any issues. Negative customers and work environment.
bad,"At Convergys, you are only a number.  You are only a metric.  You're either red, yellow, or green.  Many of the teammates worked hard to go against that corporate direction, but the culture is in place.  You're red, you're out.  No value in you as an individual."
bad,"Regardless of how desperate you are, do not work for this company."
bad,"Managers have no idea what`s going on. They are Extremely unresponsive towards to you except when they ask sale. But the upper management runs endless meetings about what`s going on in the company why workers are so unhappy. No one wants to accept that they are giving low salary and filled up with lack of information management people. They first trick the people about the commission and salary. No one got that salary and I have seen many people were extremely sad and some of them seriously lost their mental health."
bad,"you are treated like you are nothing "
bad,"They advertise a potential $100k earning, but the reality is that they're a call center for customer service and you'll never get a chance to earn more than basic subsistance. Racist managers, and they're continuously advertising for workers because they can't retain anyone for very long. That's their business model. So, expect to hate it there and look for another job while you're there. They have a horrible reputation in Pueblo for hiring anyone with a pulse, and even half dead employees hate it."
bad,Policies would change and the upper management would not tell employees and then employees would be punished for not complying to the new policies. This would frequently end in termination for the employee.
bad,"Management never knew what each other was doing. Getting questions answered was near impossible you just did what you could and hoped it worked. Sales team was always on your back even though reps got no credit for any sales made."
bad,"Job was easy as far as taking calls or what not, but the job culture is horrible, the supervisors do not really help you, and the schedules are trash."
bad,"very poor management and  not safe for girls. I dont wanna talk about working there. Everything is bad. Transport I would  say is good other than that, the worst place to work."
bad,They judge you based on surveys. There is no opportunity for advancement. It is hard to get time off. The insurance is terrible. You practically have to be a favorite to get promoted. The customers are terrible.
bad,"This is a terrible place to work. Unless you're willing to kiss a s s of the management.. don't plan to get treated like an actual human. Favoritism, childishness and gossip is all this place produces. They treat people like garbage and then wonder why their turn over rate is so high. Management should never be engaging in talking bad about other employees. This place is straight out of the trailer park, along with the 99% of trash that works the I would never recommend this place to anyone."
bad,"Convergys is a very stressful place to work.  More so because of job security than anything else.  They have a lot of lay-offs.  If you are apart of the ""in"" crowd your job is more secure."
bad,"Don't work here if you have kids, working 4pm-1am when you first start for at least 6 months. Good luck getting days off if you have appointments. You have to call 4 people if you are going to be sick."
bad,"Convergys was dishonest about the position to get over qualified people to take the job. They will tell you Microsoft will hire you from there. The benefits are minimal. There are no incentives for higher pay, bonuses, time off, moving up the ladder. Management makes decisions by who they like and not who has the higher education or more experience."
bad,"This is hands down the worst place I have ever worked. Hugely understaffed so the workload is unbearable 90% of the time.. the calls just keep coming in.. The management is to cry about, you will have to chase your holidays or any request that you have for weeks. You are not allowed to do anything at your desk can not send emails only receive it so communication is non existent if you want or need something. Be prepared to do shift such as starting at 04:00am for 2 days and be on something completely different on others.. forget your social life, cause you wont have that once you start here. People have come from various countries to work here and are actually on their own in a strange country but have no support from work.. you will see people breaking down sometimes. The only good thing that came from this place is the people that you meet and nothing else."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Only consider working here if it is your last option. Even then, there are better alternatives. Perhaps live in the woods and eat wild rabbits, or find shelter in the sewers under the city. Either would be more enjoyable than working at concentrix. During training you can expect half your class to drop out, and the other half to fall asleep at their desks. You will feel woefully under prepared when you begin the job and will most likely quit in a week or 2 if you have made it this far. There is a reason they have to train 20 new employees every month. Morale amongst the employees is very low, and most dont stay longer than absolutely necessary. This might be the job for you if you enjoy low salary, long hours and being timed while you take a poo."
bad,"I did not enjoy my job, they did not treat there employees fairly. If you had PTO, you could only use it when they said you could. If you were sick you acquired points"
bad,"Don't work here. This place is a joke. This place is like being in high school and their training let a lot to be desired. It has a very high turn over rate, and they try to get people who quit to come back to deal with the same .. Just DON'T!"
bad,the culture at the organisation is very targets based and the individual doesn't matter. its an environment that only cares about the sales. The commission structure is flawed and complicated even when you are hitting the unrealistic targets.
bad,"Always messing with payment, hr is useless and management they are horrible."
bad,Convergys in Longview started off like a good place to work. They have good training. While I was on the phone many thing the customer would ask if we were having a party. It is a very noisy place with music and yelling. Wouldnt tell anyone to go and work there.
bad,"Buen ambiente laboral, pero poco salario por hora y el.over time es muy barata la hora"
bad,"Cool and Good working environment "
bad,This company is not a competitive company as far as pay rates. There have been people working here for 16 years and never received a raise ever. Its all about who you know and what you can do for them here. There is hardly ever an option or opportunity for promotion in this company.  Most of the people here have either a 2 family income or a second job to make ends meet.
bad,"My time at Concentrix was a short one; the pay is $12.30 which isn't that great and the misery you must endure is not worth it."
bad,"Convergys is a 3rd party company for AT&T.  When I first started there I was very excited to become an employee with this company as the hourly pay for the position was very low however with the commission structure that was in place it was more than enough to make up for the low hourly pay.  After about 4 or 5 months of being employed here, the company was bought out by a new company that pretty much took almost the entire commission and bonus structure away.  There were no raises for any position period.  In my short time as an employee here I still was making more money than some people who had been there 5 and 10 years with no pay increase or room for advancement."
bad,"The call center was a disaster, they gave little training to the employees. They changed your hours, days off, etc without notice. The managers were never around anywhere when you needed them"
bad,I worked at Concentrix for over two months. In this two months I was told good luck on solving several issues or getting any assistance. No one seemed to know what team I was on and I never once met my manager. There were so many issues with the systems. There was no advancement opportunities. Becoming a trainer or manager would not gain you a raise as voices by several employees.
bad,"After working at this place during the training period, which is 6 weeks, the trainer was engaged and taught well. After leaving the training class, we are put on the production floor and their was plenty support by management. After a few days, the job begins to spiral downwards. Management would threaten employees that they will be fired if their statistics do not improve. Following another week, management decides changing hours of operation and never apologized to the employees once. The managers would not help the employee instead they would instruct us to use our tools after the employee has already done so. This job is unprofessional, the employees are not sanitary, the work desks are usually left with food residue and profanity was used every other word. Even leaving your belongings in the locker room, they were not safe because people would steal your items if they could. On a regular day when calls are fast, the management would struggle to help the employees because either they do not know the answer to your question or they don't ""feel like"" helping. The managers find it amusing to gossip about other employees and if they would favor you then you'll reap the benefits like getting into work late as if you were on time. Basically, this job was not meant to be this stressful if the management actually did what they were supposed to do."
bad,"Dehumanizing and arbitrary. Managers don't bother to get it right or to try to understand customer needs, and training is poor, erratic, and not well executed."
bad,"I was not a fan of this call center based on the training and the environment since I started. There was always confusion with who was in charge of my shift, not really open minded to employees and did not take ownership of lack of training"
bad,minimal breaks and no lunches.  It was not easy to receive help from management when a problem would arise.  This company did not have any type of support for their employees.  Often time we were not paid for time we were having technical issues even when it was proven that the company was at fault.
bad,"I worked there for 4 months and was fired for ""call avoidance"" aka transferring the customer to the right department that can help them. I worked in the customer service representative side and there was only so much we could do. We had numbers and were told if a customer can't be helped by us we transfer them to the department that can. I did as instructed and was fired. This job is a joke and so are the managers only the co-workers are worth staying at a place like that and to top it off HR doesn't even help it takes many calls and many constant trips to the office for anything to get done. 10/10 don't recommend."
bad,"I found working here to be an unfortunate experience, time and time again. I worked for 6 contracts and did not enjoy any of them, I did not enjoy the small paychecks, I did not enjoy getting denied personal time off that I once was approved for and getting denied after that on such short notice. I did not enjoy the management who always seemed bothered whenever we needed help on a supervisor call. I also did not enjoy working in a place where favoritism took precedence over hard work"
bad,"Training was horrible, computer issues every other day which prevented us from learning material. Lots of gossiping. Management doesn't communicate well and shows lots of favoritism. A typical day is taking 100 or more calls and setting up payment arrangements and placing holds on accounts. No raises. Better than not having a job."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,About to take them to court..enough said! This company has no leadership and or training.  They are run by a bunch of people who have no clue on what they are doing.
bad,"Wow,  when I read this job posting it disgusted me how they are putting down real people who work for fast food companies smelling like fries or having to wear a uniform! You say you can go out after work without having to get changed! What type of people are you attracting? No wonder there is a high turn over rate in that center!"
bad,"The worst place to work, Chrysler would be good, but you will be ruled by Convergys! trust all the negative reviews. They will make it sound like you will have fun there, this place is totally unprofessional in all meanings."
bad,"When I got the job at Convergys Corp. I had actually applied for a work at home position on the company's website. I was offered this position and thought ""it might be a good thing to work in an office that way there is support when I need it"". The previous statement could not be more wrong in fact after working there for 4 months I now believe it would have been so much better to have turned down the job and waited for a work at home position like I originally applied for. "
bad,"The management is ok, but the job sucks you take hundreds of calls a day you deal with customers that curse you out on a daily basis and they don't like to pay vacation"
bad,I work in the call center. When Areotech ran things it was great! Now you don't get paid correctly your always missing hours in your check. Currently looking for new job with a real company! They have a new training class every other week. Concentrix/Minacs is a huge joke.
bad,"miserable environment ,you will be tempted to leave nearly every second of your time here . Wages routinely dont get paid on time or correctly and when you try to chase this up you will be jumping through Olympic level hoops to get anything sorted ."
bad,"They will force you to work overtime with not even a days notice.  You won't get stat holidays off.  High stress job and supervisors don't help and don't care about employees.  They will force you into jobs without training you.  You will get yelled at all day on the phone, and they will only allow you 3 mins in between calls.  The only good things are the benefits, and the people you work with."
bad,Management doesn't make themselves available to the employees when needed. They make unreasonable demands of employees in order to fire them if they don't fit in with their clicks. Vindictive and scheming. Constant change in operations systems and unreliable equiptment. Not an environment conducive to a productive work environment. Nearly lost one of their largest clients due to poor management. Pay is more suitable to someone in High School.
bad,"Terrible company to work for!"
bad,Do you want to work in a place where the manager do not help and do not know how to help at all. This job would be for you then but I warn you it is not only managers that are the problem but the whole culture is the problem. People being promoted that can answer basic questions to employees. This job mandates overtime since last year and has no intention on stopping stating that it is a staffing issue. The issue is not the staff it is the culture and low pay and overworked employees that they can not keep anyone there.
bad,"It was an okay place to work, it was actually convenient in the way of location, and being a short distance from my residence. The only perks I can think of is that Convergys offered a great insurance package and 401K, aside from that, well..."
bad,Since I started working here in the beginning of the year things started out great as far as training. But beware in the second week of my training things not noticeably unprofessional. My trainer had a relationships with a person in my hiring class and things not uncomfortable. Most of us complained to HR but the situation was never dealt with. Seems like HR will protect his team leaders no matter the situation. As time progressed things constantly change which isn't bad but it got to a point where they wanted us to do double the job for half money. Human resources is probably the worse people you cam trust if you have an issue with management. I confronted them many times about my Mangers underpants coming off and showing her lower back side but felt more like I was a target after that. Mind me HR is very friendly but professional to say the lease. You see supersisors dancing talking about pills and partying I wouldn't advice anyone who's worked in a professional environment to work here. I was told that this company had a high turn over rate but I felt it didn't apply to me since I arrived early and mind my own. But just 1 complaint about a team leader and you target yourself. I would suggest don't ever go to human resources they are the first to not trust
bad,This company is HORIBLE towards anyone who has a life beyond computers and money. The company rules are strange as paper and pens are banned to the point that an employee can be fired if they are seen using these items anyway or the company grounds. security is paranoid. I Don't work here if you are a human or  an older worker over the age of 23. older workers are encouraged to quit as they are not valued for knowledge and experience.
bad,You are always wondering if you are going to work to be fired. Also always treated like you are five years old. Do not get a job here.
bad,"I was so happy to begin training with Convergys.  Although training seemed more like happy hour at a bar; I did manage to learn if I demanded the trainer take control of his class.  Once on the floor taking calls, it was so difficult to get any help from the team coach.  He was never there even when he was there. Once I started to realize the the company I was hired to take calls for was basically using me to sell things to people that they didnt need and I was earning them money for products I did not believe in, that was when I was done."
bad,"I didn't feel like I have the opportunity to grow with them, its a good company to start. They also, dont motivate you."
bad,"Convergys is a call center,  the floor supervisors frequently did not have answers to questions that were asked about processing calls & questions that were asked of them, we finally find our answer from co workers.  They would have childish rewards for having excellent customer service results, such as a candy bar or a little card with Thank You stamped on it."
bad,the co-workers were excellent but the company and staff were not good. Everyone that worked there left to find other jobs.
bad,"The work environment here was stressful and toxic. Employees were talked down to, berated, harassed and not provided with job security as the threat of being fired was always being thrown in your face. All in all, I would not suggest this company to anyone. The coworkers were anxious and snappy because of the lack of help and support from management when needed and management didn't get support from their superiors. There was no enjoyable part of this job"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"This job CAN be a lot of fun. Chill customers, (a few) relaxed managers, fairly straight forward work. But there's so many awful things about it that I couldn't recommend it to anyone."
bad,Easily one of the worst jobs I've ever had. Not sure if it's the job itself or the people who run the Derry branch (EE). I've seen reviews on here from people working at the same branch talking about favouritism and not what you know but who you know to climb the ladder & that is spot on! Everything is catered around the new teams starting to give the impression that it's a really fun & nice place to work but once your out of nesting things change for you fast. I was one of the lucky ones who came in nearly 2 years ago so had 3 weeks training & 3 weeks nesting but now the new starts have 4 days training & less than a week nesting then it's onto the phones you go and you have to hit the stats from day one or your getting flagged up on the live building chat and have to explain why your call work is 10 secs which is ridiculous. Getting holidays approved is unreal I've never seen anywhere like it in my life and I've had a few jobs throughout my life within big & small companies. I've had personal experience putting in a holiday request 4 weeks before the dates I wanted and then only finding out that one day was approved and one rejected the day before the days were actually due and this isn't an isolated incident as I know of multiple people who've experienced the same issue and you may forget about the date you wanted if a friend of the girl who does the holiday requests asks for the same date you've asked for cause they will get it everytime even if you've asked first. Also in there at the minute customer service agents are being constantly pushed & monitored to push sales on
bad,"This company is on a day to day basis very unorganized. There is no unity in the upper management. I am one to enjoy a competitive environment, but it seems like everyone is compared to one another, and there is no drive to improve. It's a perform, or else kind of enviroment."
bad,It was a total shock and a disappointment losing my 6 year employment because Concentrix could not kep the contract that we had with Sprint.
bad,"Responsible for answering phones and providing customer service. Worked independently and responsibly to ensure customer satisfaction"
bad,"Concentrix take credit, but rarely give credit to employees who on occasions go beyond their job to help people."
bad,"You won't get paid for the hours you work, even with proof you were taking calls.  Hours removed without your approval  Last minute notifications (in work email) for change of hours, shift or team.  Complete and total lack of respect for the employee, their personal life or needs.  You're just someone for them to use."
bad,"I really enjoyed working with my peers.  However, leadership tends to be neglectful, and uncaring. I learned a lot working in the call center, and very much enjoyed this.  Working from home there is little to no support from upper leadership."
bad,"This is a call center with not only a high turnover, but a rough work ethic which treats people as numbers not people."
bad,This is the worst place to work for. Management doesnt care after training they only care about themselves. Co-workers are good as long as you have a good group.
bad,"Here i am working as Sr. Practitioner and supporting for Blue Cross and Blue Shield for Texas, Illinois, Oklahoma, New Mexico and Montana Regions. "
bad,We never received compensation for our work. No raises after a year for any one. Too much mandatory overtime and supervisors that lie and throw you under the bus to save themselves. The discrimination in the work place was terrible.
bad,"I will NEVER EVER AGAIN work for this place EVER!!!! one of the most unorganized place I have ever worked, they are constantly down your back as if your in pre school, management only care about numbers not EMPLOYEES or CUSTOMERS!!! Its more like a compatition up there v.s a team, sooooo unprofessional and nobody knows what they are doing. I HATE THIS PLACE!!! I left there to go drive for uber!"
bad,"This is a tech Support position, if that's what you would like to call it."
bad,A typical day involved back to back calls and little to no support when in a difficult call. I learned that in some situations that you have to teach yourself instead of waiting to be taught. Team work was also a crucial part of the job when it came to getting any support at all. Management was very poor. My team leader did nothing but sit on her phone when most of us needed her assistance. By assistance I mean things that required her password and not something we could do. I loved my coworkers. My team was very supportive of each other. Any questions that any of us had would be answered in a group chat. The hardest part of the job was having not managerial support in matters that needed their involvement. They only seemed to show interest when you made a sale. The most enjoyable part of the job was the spirit week activities that the company would create.
bad,"Poor HR, Poor Training. High Turn-Over of Employees. Pay was acceptable, but management trys to find fault in everything you do.Not a good place to work"
bad,"Treat of job insecurity. Did not recognize that people had family and had doctor appts to attend"
bad,Pay is low. Management & other workers conduct themselves like they are in the streets. People were caught having relations in the parking lot. The site manager will never speak or introduce himself or give a welcome to the company. Overall just ghetto!!
bad,The training needs work. Politics will get you to the top. This place has a very high turn over rate. The work is repetitive
bad,"When first applying to Concentrix there seemed to be so many positive aspects to look forward to. Things like flexible schedules, bonuses, all the overtime you could want and advancement.  So eagerly and ready to learn the life of customer phone support i agreed to work for this promising company. I began, like all others, in a classroom filled with 23 other workers as hungry for work and to earn that bonus as i was. The first day we started, which was supposed to be a full day, was told to go home 5 hours early, a mistake that manifested in the form of a short check for the first pay period. The following day the classroom is packed again ready for what the day has to bring and as we go to log into our computers to begin the day we hit our first bump. Half the classroom is unable to log in resulting in nearly an hour of waiting for the company to get their record and accounts corrected so that we could begin. Upon finally being able to log in to the computer we found out that half the class is now unable to log in to the system required in order to access the training information. Needless to say it was a very long day. After all of this on day one i remained optimistic continually looking for the positive and forward to that first check. Each day had issue related to the company putting information into the systems. For instance, day 3 we were supposed to be able to access the sytem to file our w-4's which we were unable to do until closer to day 20 when we were getting our first check, without information on our taxes even though the paper copies had been filled out and submitted"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"When working for this company, the management was inexperienced and very insecure, about their jobs. I would never work for the company again. I was terminated, by a gentlemen, who did not work in my area. Too much favoritism and so on!"
bad,"It's was all round horrible job. Unreliable managers, worst hours ever, unsanitary, not guaranteed a desk, fellow co-workers will steal your lunch on a daily basis, list goes on. I've met some nice, civilized people while working there, however, the rest never follow the dress code, loud, obnoxious, and rude people (makes me question the hiring mangers and background check process). If you ever get hired there, make sure you bring portable sanitizing products, headphone cushions, buy lunch and leave your emotions at home."
bad,"absolutely terrible work environment "
bad,Red tape and politics and no room for advancement. GREAT TEAM MANAGERS. Upper management not easy to support employees. I had an enjoyable team with great incentives. Awesome team unity!!
bad,"I could write a 10,000 word essay on how appalling my experience with convergys has been."
bad,Convergys was a nice place in the beginning. After working at Convergys it became very negative work place. The staff was very touchy to the point I've cam very uncomfortably. The floor support was very rude. Overall i will not recommended convergy to a friend to work there.
bad,"I was on the Wall Street Journal/ Barrons Weekly account. This was my first job in a call center and I was MISERABLE. You never knew where you were going to sit from day to day, so you had to carry a backpack with you with all of the papers they gave you in training. There were a few nice order people there but the younger employees were mean and ""rough around the edges""!! My first manager was SO nice but he switched me to this other manager before they let me go. I was let go because I wasn't talking fast enough on the phone. They wanted you on all calls for under 2 minutes. How is that Customer Service?"
bad,"this is a bad company to work for, they do not have any type of permanent raise cycle, and advancement is only for their pet people. most equipment is broken, outdated, or useless to perform duties at any level. forced overtime, and lack of management hurts this company."
bad,"It's great for about 4 months than you have to start watching your checks, they will get smaller and smaller. I worked over 20 hours of overtime to earn attendance points back and my check was smaller than 400$. That's not even possible with a 10.50$ an hour job, then they didn't even give me back my points. I didn't receive a final check and I called them and they said I didn't work that month when I was terminated at the end of the months for points and I had a bonus of 30$ bucks but no check. How did I have a bonus that month if I didn't work?"
bad,"This is by far one of the worst jobs I have had. The job itself was easy, but the management is horrible and cares nothing about their employees. I would never work here again if I had to. The entire company is not bad, but just the project that I was working on."
bad,"Work your back off for people who yell at you, both the customers and the management are terribly angry %100 of the time. Managers do no help at all."
bad,Minacs is a horrible place to work great ppl behind the doors but the company as a whole is terrible great for staying until u find better
bad,This a very stressful place to work. The shifts are horrible and the leadership is bad. By the end of the day you feel like a liar while being lied too. I wouldn't dare recommend this job for anyone. Its not worth it
bad,I honestly hated working at Convergys and I would never recommend someone to work there. The management is entirely corrupt and they have an unrealistic ideal and expectation of what they want their employees to be.
bad,"Good place to get some experience for resume -- but get it and move on.  Convergys will exploit a solid work ethic.  Management tears you down without building you up, cultivating the idea that you are either slow or stupid.  Performance metrics must always be improving and it is all up to you to figure out.  Management does nothing to support how to do more and more and more work with less and less budget, leading you to do work on your own time when you should be with family and friends -- just so your metrics perpetually improve."
bad,"Management likes to not follow the rules to set the standard for agents, not able to accommodate work schedules when needed."
bad,"During my training, they told me I would be working every third Saturday.  Surprise, I worked every weekend."
bad,"I spent over a year here and nothing I ever did was good enough. Compensation was ok but if they needed overtime, they would try to guilt you into it! Standards for agents are not the same for everyone. It depends on who you know!"
bad,"Aditya Birla Minacs in Oshawa, ON. Lets start with the good. You will meet some great people. People that you can definitely call ""friend"". After this, there are only negatives. I had the great displeasure of working for Onstar, General Motors' in-vehicle navigation and assistance system. If you work in the Subscriber department, get ready to spend 9 1/2 hours talking to idiotic drivers on refurbished headsets, broken chairs, and filthy workstations. Forget about sitting with people you know or even your team leader. There are no assigned desks so you could be across the room from anyone you may know. If you happen to work for the sales team setting up the Onstar service for new and returning customers, get ready to be sabotaged on a daily basis by dealer sales reps looking to make themselves look better in front of the customers by revealing company sales scripting. The result: the dealer rep looks good by revealing inside information to the customer and you miss out on sales, commission, and your stats suffer as a whole. Then there's the management. Consider yourself lucky if you are assigned to a team leader that genuinely wants you to do better and will help you to accomplish your service and sales goals. These good team leaders are few and far between. You will see first hand favoritism towards some agents and laziness from team leaders as they pass the buck to team leaders that actually do the work. You will see first  hand agents that barely spend time on the phone and are walking around and never get in trouble. Only because they have high sales numbers. If you are thinking"
bad,"The company have a high turn overrate, so job security is very low. I would suggest that this is not the place to work if you are in school. the pay rate is good, Management does not take care of their employees."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Management cared more about peoples personal life then the actual job itself. They didnt give out raises when suppose to. Its just a overall bad plac to work.
bad,"Terrible hours, managers who weren't properly trained and unfair working conditions. How are we supposed to do our jobs well when the people who are supposed to be showing us how to do our job don't have a clue what their doing."
bad,"If you can breath they will hire you, subsequently they have a vast majority of the phone reps who are under qualified and are fired.  The pay is only $10.00 an hour and the work very demanding, so they cannot recruit better people who will stay.  There are ALWAYS training classes going on from 7:00 in the morning till midnight to replace the masses that get fired-then the new trainees get fired.  A lot quite because they are told their schedule is flexible but the 1st six months is always 4:30 to midnight - weekends included.  my schedule was did not flex in ""times"" for 10 months.  There system is geared to punishment and not reward for performance.   If the company does get a bonus from AT@T it stays at the top, it never goes down to those that do the ""grunt work"".  "
bad,"I went in to this job knowing it would be stressful and that the turnover rate is really high.  I thought I would be able to stick it out for at least a year or so.. I was wrong.  The training for the job was great and very thorough but nothing can really prepare you for once you hit the floor.  It was so difficult at first because it was often very tough to find a supervisor/TL for questions or assistance.  I felt like I was guessing most of the time.  "
bad,I should've quit much sooner. The management constantly undermined it's employees by glad handing clients and over promising on results. They pressured the workers dumb enough to show initiative to produced until they burned out.
bad,"We are micromanaged to the extreme, even when out numbers are right, they still find flaws on us and ""improvement areas."""
bad,"Not very happy with the company no professionalism. Work for different accounts business and consumer the expectation very high however not enough support to assist with the delivery of the message to the customer.,"
bad,"I worked for this company when I first came out of school. From the internet it seemed very upscale and a great place to make a career. Maybe it was the Convergys I worked for but they were so unprofessional, the management gossiped just as much as the employees, and you never had a secure position. If you are looking for fast money and call center experience, this is the place for you. Please remember to have a second job as back up because they are always offering VGH."
bad,I already rated and provided comments about working at Convergys
bad,"When i first started working here i thought that it was the most professional place ever...that was during the training process..Once i made it to production floor i realized i was soooo wrong the way the place is ran speaks for itself now i see why they hire so much its because they cant keep workers. Its because of te agents that the project continues were the ones that answer the calls and assist the customers but we are so unappreciated there! For one the pay is $9.00/hr no raises or anything this is the project called "" COMCAST"" if a customer requestes a SUPERVISOR its like they avoid you (managers) or run from the call no one is helpful there OVERALL ITS GHETTOO HOT MESS PERIOD"
bad,"enjoy the work I did--"
bad,"The first part of training was good with Vicki. The trainer could not keep one disruptive trainee under control. I just couldn't understand why they allowed individuals to continue, when they did not have the equipment required from the beginning. Also, the trainer shared a private chat with everyone and only made herself look bad. The disruptive trainee had no clue what was going on. I really wanted this job, but seriously felt like they just kept or hired anyone out of filling positions. Also the trainers need to be in charge and not the loud trainees. This company is losing good trainees for unproductive trainees. Convergys needs to hire and train serious qualified applicants and just cut their losses early on with disruptive,unorganized, computer illiterate ones"
bad,"High stress working environment, you will grow to loathe the sight of this building with every fiber of your being."
bad,the job training will make you feel like they care and you will have a promising job but keep in mind if they consider a person with 2 months under their belt a tenured agent it tells you a lot about the company. they have a horrible turn over rate and if you do have any issues outside of work they expect you to be open about it to have time off mind you the site will know your business. A lot of what they do is fueled by favoritism so if you make sales you can expect everything but dont fall off because one month will have you without a job. honestly the place should be closed down and or have new management there.
bad,"it pays the bills but at the same time the Team leaders do not listen to the agents that help them keep their position, plus at the rate they pay us we don't deserve to get treated the way the customers treat us when they call in, not only that but the hiring advertisement says 13/hr+ based on performance, they haven't done that in 3 years, false advertisement, and the only way to advance into a higher position is all about who you know and are friends with higher up."
bad,"The pay from this company is decent, but not enough to take the abuse from customers or harassment from managers. In training they make sure you learn the basics while touching base on sales. Once you are out of training the main focus is sales. If you do not meet your daily quota or make an offer on every call your job is in danger.  Sales in itself is easy, but when 90% of the customers are angry, yelling and swearing at you, the calls go from bad to worse. Managers get away with inappropriate comments and language which is heard by customers on the phone. Trying to get help while on a call is impossible. While you are waiting for help, you get bombarded by IM's and pop ups saying you have been on the call too long and need to ask for help. Heaven forbid you have to use the bathroom outside of your schedule, because you will be pulled into a coaching and even given points for it. They change your schedule without notice on a monthly basis, and say that you rotate Saturday's but you never do. They don't care about their employees, and are losing many every week. This creates mandatory overtime which further stresses out the remaining employees. I would never recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"Big let down!! This is a temp type of job only. This place is staffed with an inexperience HR Dept. & poor management. Very low pay with off the wall hours, including holidays (not a family friendly environment-no set schedules). This company does not value it's employees and has a huge turnover rate (there is literally a PAD LOCK on the coffee machine). If you're young & looking for something to do, this is the place for you but don't expect much. If you are a professional, KEEP MOVING!!!"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"typical day was productive "
bad,"As you would imagine for this field they have a high turnover rate. Quality of employees hired was poor and showed that keeping seats filled was only priority. Place is dirty and unsanitary. If one person gets sick, it spreads like wildfire. After working there for a year, they lost a couple major accounts including CA (computer associates). Base pay for the program I am in is terrible. The commission bonus almost makes working there worth it but that is, and has been subject to change every month to avoid paying employees what they are owed. They will change the criteria for commission bonus after the period's stats have been recorded, without warning, reducing your estimated payout anywhere from $200 - $1000 per employee."
bad,"Working for ""PoorVergy""s, The company culture is about as miserable as you’d imagine. the upper management occasionally tossed out a couple  bucks for happy hours to keep everyone complacent. Otherwise, everyone sat glued to their phones and computers and rarely interacted.  Do not expect a raise"
bad,The typical days are spent on dialers for outbound accounts with no certainty for longevity. The commissions are handled in a poorly communicated fashion by post-its for notifying sales reps. Rampant favoritism surrounds the workplace. The HR staff also assist management in deceiving new hires with inflated claims about Concentrix's opportunities for advancement.
bad,"The work environment is hectic.  When you first start you have 5 weeks of training in which nothing you learn in the classroom helps you once you are on the floor. No matter what your issue is they tell you to look in their program AAC which in itself is a maze of gobble dee goop.  Incoming calls of people trying to lower their TV bill but you are to try to sell them more things that they do not want!  If you do not sell then you are in trouble.  Team leaders only want you to sell because they get a % plus a pat on the back.   The CSR gets nothing but a headache. I would not recommend this employer.  You are no one in the company and there are a million other no bodies waiting for your seat.  Did i mention that this is all done in a cube connected to a head set in front of a computer, and that you better get there early so you can try to find one that works?  Also there is a point system and it is easier to get termed than it is to keep your job."
bad,"Did not enjoy working here.  Employees are undervalued and company does not care for their own.  Management culture is catty, underhanded and lacking integrity."
bad,The pay is horrific  -  the employees are not valued.  The general feel is:  there are 5 people waiting in line to take your place.  No incentive to keep employees.  Overworked and under appreciated!
bad,"If you have any family life, forget them.  According to convergys you must be able to work 7days/7nights and forget about holidays, they demand your work schedule to be available at all times"
bad,"In my experience, this corporation is completely focused on the bottom dollar and has no concern for it's employees or their well being. I strongly encourage anyone seeking employment with this organization to look in ANY other direction."
bad,No work/life balance. Worst management and most stressful prison like atmosphere.
bad,"The position did not turn out to be what was described when hired. The rules and policies change constantly, whether by Convergys, or by the client. The management is a joke, you are told different things by different people. They do try and make up for it by doing some fun things, but they just cannot make up for the poor management."
bad,"Service level is God, so that TLs get that bonus. People are disposable, and totally replaceable, nothing more than a ""widget"". When I was let go, I asked HR how I was supposed to feed my children. She looked up at me, never said a word, and just GRINNED at me. Need I say more?"
bad,"Daily I would take customer calls for a client company's products and services. I would assist the callers by identifying and resolving equipment issues the customers were having, and/or I placed orders for new equipment/upgrades. I would also make requested programming additions or removals. I was required to offer internet and/or phone services provided by partner companies to my callers. For the most part, management was friendly, supportive and encouraging. Worst part of management was their seemingly indifference to the inferiority of the products our partner companies passed on to us to market to our customers. The hardest part of the job was getting out the words to offer those terrible products in response to customer's requests for such services. I guess every cloud does have a silver lining. I worked with amazing groups of people. They were friendly, inquisitive, amiable, and very knowledgable in many areas. I really miss the daily interactions with them. A portion of my entire working life has been in support of a user community. That is the part I enjoy most."
bad,"Typical Call Center. Boring and monotonous. Management was not very friendly. Co-workers were nice. Hardest part of job was dealing with angry customers and not receiving the help from the next step of the ladder that you needed. Not enough people to take ""escalation calls"". Lunch was the most enjoyable part of the job."
bad,"There needs to be more opportunity for advancement and development of employees. "
bad,My day at work is enjoyable and productive. I look forward to teaching and encouraging agents to be the best they can be and treat customers the way they should be treated and leave our phones with a smile of satisfaction. I learned within this company what true management is and what should or should not be done when it comes to our Agents and our customers. I worked well with my co-workers just as well as with my employers. The hardest part of the job or the most challenging is when there are agents that don't understand their entire expectations of their job which makes it hard to represent the customers correctly and they loose their job.
bad,The management is a joke for one. They would allow multiple people have horrible attendance and when I was going through a crisis they wouldn't help me at all. I have multiple team leaders who didn't know anything about the job. The pay was good but other than that everything else was horrible. I will never go back to convergys
bad,"after remodeling the work environment was very distracting and to close to other employees. I learned a lot about the policies and procedures of the company's customer guidelines. The company treats employees like they have no value and management was very rude and disrespectful. A lot of managers would give false information, would not like to assist customers and employees, management just likes to do coaching's and nothing else. The job was not hard at all the most enjoyable part of the job was helping a customers because if I were dealing with the company as a customer I would really know what it feels like to be cheated."
bad,"Firstly once out of training I was promised a raise being that I met all requirements, but needless to say I never got it and I never received my shift differential pay. I reported this issue to human resources and nothing was done to correct my pay. In addition to this problem,  I was promised certain hours but once training was over these hours changed significantly, the recruiters and call center team are not coordinated at all. Also this is the lowest paying job in the area resulting in an extremely high turnover rate which management seems not to care about."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Job had a 90% turnover rate. The training was completely irrelevant and lasted for over a month. I learned absolutely nothing from the training and very little from the job besides getting a better grasp of speaking or understanding over the phone. "
bad,"While in training they promise you so much like performance bonuses, commission, attendance bonuses etc but they never pay out on them. You are lucky if you get your bonus 2 months after you work there, They will give you attendance points that you do not have and take forever to correct the situation, I did work with some great people but management truly sucks"
bad,Convergys is a company that cares about its money and not its workers. Also they stopped all pay increases and abilities to move on up in the company.
bad,The thing about working here is you can't rely on management to help you help a customer. I constantly sold things but never learned how to take credit. The management is very unorganized but the good thing about working here was that you got 100 percent tuition reimbursement and there was always over time available for those who wanted it.
bad,convergys was a dull and boring place and they treat there agents like they didnt care about us.
bad,"Trained with 25 people to be DirecTV CSR. All but 5 classmates were gone within a year and most long before that. One of the top execs told me the average stay for new hires is only 56 days. It is a set up for failure. In the months following my termination my team leader who had 15 years with Convergys was fired as well as other TL's and CSR's. They always have 25 to 100 people in training and need to make room for when those trainees are finished. DirecTV doesn't want people to last in the job. They want people who are inept or unsure of what they are doing. It also doesn't take a rocket scientist nor does it take long to catch on DirecTV is unscrupulous. Why do so many new customers call saying the service was only supposed to be $39/mo yet their first bill came to $72? Managers will tell CSR's not to divulge DTV service is not for low income people... well then, why do they have people selling the service in Walmart? I told a manager I was on a call with an elderly couple who were long time subscribers and had declined a service upgrade when they got a sales call. They were upgraded anyway and wanted their old service back because the new billing was a $30 increase. Not only was I told that couldn't happened but the manager advised me not to believe they declined the upgrade because the elderly are the first to lie about stuff like that. Unbelievable! Convergys has ridiculous ""metrics"" to adhere to that are measured in ways that are intangible. i.e. a good way to lie about a CSR's performance. Once, at a meeting, the site leader encouraged everyone to use the suggestion"
bad,"A typical day at work is usually hectic as well as unorganized with this company."
bad,Wes trained on how to solve customer issues but not told that it was also sales based and if didn't meet sales was wrote up. Hated it. Management was lacking turn over was HIGH!
bad,Not a good experience. The only good thing good thing I learned was how the phone and internet system works.
bad,Management was not helpful & condoned cheating on orders with no repercussions.
bad,The location in las cruces NM is the worst call center I have ever worked for they r unfair and find any little thing to fire you the managers r rude and dont care about their employees I would not recomend this job to my worst enemy. 
bad,"Absolutely no management and the work environment is awful and draining. If you complain, the HR department tells those you complained on that you complained, so nothing is left confidential. It's depressing and unenjoyable. Onstar, the client, is great though! I enjoy what I do, just not the company, Convergys, that I work for.  "
bad,When being a single parent and having family needs an a company who wont work with you and would rather let you go over a family emergency isnt a good career choice to me. Very childish company 
bad,I liked the job i have a medical condition at the time and I was out some and I always have documentation on my illness which is a birth defect. I always did a good job and always got excellent evaulations once a week. I was let go because of my illness and they said I left early one day after 10 months of being there and I didnt and I proved it and was awarded employment because I kept all of my records and paperwork. I would have stayed and it had came to my attention that another employee that was let go was rehired and I even put in a new application and I was not given my job back.
bad,They need new team leads in management. The Team leads are awful.  I would not rate convergys a great company to anyone.
bad,Management was not consistent with their values and the way they treated employees.
bad,"Unorganized, unprofessional, and very unhelpful "
bad,"Responsibilities included handling heavy call volumes, 100-150 calls per day, multi-tasking, up-selling, multi line operator, data entry, troubleshoot wireless, hardwire, cable, internet and alarm systems, billing, payment collections, scheduling, mail outs of newspapers(different account)"
bad,"Extremely stressful job. Expectations are set so high,that failure is inevitable. Treated like school kids. If a low survey comes through for something you can't fix for the customer, then you are taken into the principles office. You are never given positive feedback. Schedules are not family friendly and change constantly. If you are in the ""clique"" you might be protected however many jobs being let go to save money and cut down because of overhiring at holiday time. Also no descretion by higher-ups. When an employee is let go, it is talked about freely by TLs and managers which is an ethical issue. Systems never work properly and reporting an issue is a joke. Many co-workers are bonded together due to all going through the same thing with no respect given to them. Also using the so called chain of command when you are trying to report work issues can get you fired. Especially when the complaints ARE about the managements unethical and discriminatory ways. Employees are not valued, they'll just get someone else."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I was hired by Convergys to work on the AT&T Technical Chat project in January. I have no complaints about the AT&T aspect of the job. They sent a highly-knowledgeable trainer and we learned most of what we were supposed to learn. BUT, our ENTIRE training class was lied to when we accepted the job. We had all voiced our concerns about scheduling since most of us have night classes and/or other jobs. We were told we would do training from 7am-3pm. We were then told after training our schedules would be similar and that we would have flexibility and that they would work with us."
bad,"The job is not as bad. its management. they bs you about everything. They make sure that u never get a schedule that you want, and will write u up over any and everything. They mess up payroll at-least twice a year. It is an easy job, they just make everything else harder. I've learned nothing but how to bs customers there. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to interact with some cool people. I wouldnt recommend this job to anyone. You might not make it out of the first week. Do not even waste your time. you know the job is bad when the 2 top people in management has been fired."
bad,"If you want a job where you get $10 an hour for being a warm body, this is it. The management will take every chance to screw you over, so be warned. It is mind numbing customer service on the phone, and the training they provide you with is inadequate. Your co-workers are loud and obnoxious fast food worker types. But if you can zone out and put up with helping old people who have no sense of technology, it's not bad for $10/hr."
bad,Very difficult place to work; contantly being told they were going to fire us. No wonder the turnover is 300%
bad,I enjoyed the job!!!! The Managers need customer service training.
bad,Convergys would be a great company to work for if they had a strong management team.
bad,Overall the moral here was pretty low but they had a lot of fun giveaways for employees.
bad,Daily time audits and payroll has to be complete. Along with monitoring KPI's and assisting with everyday issues with the product and also reaching out to the agent's that I manage.
bad,If you are looking for your first job this is a good place.
bad,"At Minacs your day will be very similar day to day. You are expected to produce at all costs. You are a work unit, not a person which makes the atmosphere unpleasant and not conducive to a pleasant day's work."
bad,"Hires anybody thats knows up from down. Management operates in cliques, the TL's dont care about you at all. It is a very dismal place to work"
bad,"The job wouldn't be so stressful if the point system didn't exist! You have to earn a chance to have a decent schedule, based off your score. An average day begins at 11am and will end at 8pm, you will answer calls that you do not control from the time you punch in to the time you punch out. The one thing I disliked most is if your on a call with a customer and you punch out a couple minutes late, you will get a ""couching"" from your TL (team leader). Many of the employees don't like their job and are rather bitter individuals. Management can care less about you, for crying out loud I was scheduled to train for bilingual/international and I heard through others that training got pushed back a few weeks, not by the managers! The pay is decent however I feel the stress from both managers and customers becomes too much and not worth it!"
bad,A horrible place to work for because you get no respect from anyone especially supervisors and team leader even ops managers. Everyone is just rude and they do whatever they want there.
bad,"It's not Apple as a company. It's Convergys. The company outsources their HR Department. So lets say they drop your insurance (like they just so happened to do to me), they make you call HR Direct and you must talk to someone in India about your benefits and your money. You have to argue with them before they actually do their job. I also had an issue with my PTO not accumulating so I had to call them each time i got a paycheck for them to fix it. Once again having to argue with the person about what i was supposed to receive and who they have to talk to before even believing me. They have all of our records in front of them, yet they don't believe what you have to say and you have to get your TL to call in. It's absolutely ridiculous."
bad,Standard call center
bad,"Poor supervision, management, low expectations and bonus structure is unattainable."
bad,"Not a very good company to work for. Bad pay, refuse to give out proper raises, unorganized company. Bad health benefits program."
bad,"Unless you like working in a call center environment and having your every moved monitored, save yourself the time and energy and look elsewhere. The pay here is also inadequate."
bad,I dont believe in slander so to sum it up in a nut shell I am not satisfied with the work environment the management or the compensation for the workload.
bad,"the job that i have trying to save customers from cancelling directv is extremely stressful. convergys was very difficult to get pregnancy leave and when you call hr, they are in India so its hard to understand them. They also kept denying me over little things in my application. lots of incentives to do better at your job, but it is just super stressful listening to people cuss you out all day. and you can hardly ever speak with an OM or manager."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Convergy's was by far the worst company I ever worked for. The compensation was horrible and often left me going hungry for days after paying bills. There is no Work and Life Balance. I was going through a divorce and would give them a month in advance notice that I was going to need the day off, and they would still schedule me on those days. I would avoid this company as much as possible."
bad,My co-workers are wonderful but team leads and mangement in a whole is bad. not company agreement. everyone tells your something different.
bad,"Extremely pushed by management to produce more. The attrition was horrible. They invest so much in training, etc. and then push, push, push all their employees, that even great agents were leaving daily."
bad,The pay is way below the Tallahassee market - benefits are okay but the management had an attitude of us against them.
bad,Convergys was one of the worst placed that I haveever worked. YOu work too hard with no recongnition or raises. I was there for a year and never got a raise. The management is lazy and the rules are crazy. The stats thatyou have to meet are unrealistic.
bad,"The worst company you could work for. They treat their employees like slaves. Literally. They allow customers to scream, yell, curse and even threaten employees. They mention goals during the little training I had.....2 sales/upgrades per week but called a quota. Especially since the position was billing and technical support. After training, the only thing ever mentioned is making a sell..............I would recommend pan handling over working for this company."
bad,just not a overall good company to work for when you have kids.
bad,"I have worked at other Convergys locations they were great but Logan Convergys is like working in a dumpster. they cant even vacuum the carpets.I have been there over a year and after one year they just shampooed the carpets. No raises here, you can get to be management only if you are friends or go to church with them. other wise you will be on the phones forever. no values, advancement or job security here. High turnover, I wonder why?? spend more $$ on getting new employees instead of taking care of the ones they already have. As you can tell brillant management. I never worked with so many idiots!! Nothing and I mean NOTHING to look forward too."
bad,This company is not bad but they expect you too go beyond what you are required to do to let the customers curse you out an dtake it. This is terrible.
bad,"this place is good to work at for about a year and then they look for excuses to get rid of their tenured agents, no job stability you alway feel that day may be your last. team leads are over worked and underpaid, operations managers are defeated and submit to clients and re-word terms to help them cope with the position they hold. any management position basically means no life outside of work, you dont get a raise, they start you at hourly wage plus commision but you have to score high on your qaulity and incintives which depend on quality as well. must be related to someone or good friends with other managers to get ahead. bad business ethics"
bad,Convergys has a very poor work atmosphere. The noise from unruly employees makes it very hard to do your job on the phone. Customers even asked if we were having a party. I also experienced fights on the work floor and violence on the parking lot.
bad,"The company that hired concentrix to take calls from their customers has all these rules that change constantly And you have to just memorize all this because you cant get anything for tou to keep  in writing  to study on your own time or just to have printed and posted in your office area as a reminder to help you not get written up for committing a mistake . I don’t likethe fact that during training they ate  hey listen in on your calls obviously but they start to count against you as well in training and nesting which i think is ridiculous because again most if not all of the content that was presented to us in training stays in that training classroom because again the company contracted with concentrix will have you fired if you take notes! I don't think this is fair for anyone because mind you , you’re new have no idea how to properly navigate the system because of course they dont even allow a training module to be used or a replica of the system , so you have no idea  how to use it ubtil you actually start to take calls .  So to be written up and judged on calls you have no experience or thorough proper training on is just plain awful , it’s setting most up to fail. How could someone know how to go about a call properly with oyt error when it is the first call they are taking regarding that specific issue?"
bad,"HR is incompetent, they will even lie to you they are solving a problem but actually doing nothing, payroll is in India and if you have your wage miscalculated you will get in a maze for rats to get things right. If you are older then 25 and have family so don’t want to go in the pub on Fridays with team leaders you will be completely isolated. Very toxic atmosphere."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"Recruiters and management will tell you that high dollar incentives are easy to make and if you don't, you're not trying hard enough, which is not true. Very few people make incentives at all, let alone high dollar incentives, and not many of those are doing it honestly. The rest are committing fraud, which management knows about and will even acknowledge to other employees. "
bad,It management has no idea what they are doing. And the company will just randomly pick up and move laying off hundreds of employees just to save money.
bad,"Lies from day one. No consistency. Horrible training - no prep for when you actually go on the phones. Scheduling is not conducive to a family life. Tell you one thing expect another. Write ups for anything and everything, even if you've been misinformed. Dr notes don't mean anything, can still be disciplined for attendence. No real commission or incentives for sales. Lying to customers is encouraged."
bad,"This job has to have been the absolute worst job I have had, and the only job I have and ever will walk out on and quit. The workplace was filthy all the time, which caused myself and my coworkers to get sick multiple times. They intentionally hid information on sick days and the penalties involved with taking them, leaving you with the sense that you could be fired immediately for calling in. In addition, hiding all information in regards to vacation days. Forget asking a manager about it, because they either won't tell you, or don't know themselves. Most of the equipment did not work throughout the floor, so good luck trying to find a place to sit and work when you first get there, and prepare to be yelled at for clocking in late because of it. Management rarely knows how to actually do the job, and will often teach you how to get out of helping the customer rather than actually providing the service promised. If you work here, prepare to be a nameless unknown person in a sea of people who really just don't care. Mandatory overtime is present, but is poorly managed, as that mandatory overtime could result in you sitting there for multiple hours after close finishing the call load on your own. If you are absolutely desperate for a job, they will ensure you feel like you are just the person they are looking for, as you walk into the commons area hearing several people arguing about who has more felonies. They don't need you, and you will quickly realize this. Steer clear of this place."
bad,"Verkaufsdruck ist groß, Urlaub gibt es nur, wenn es dem Unternehmen paßt."
bad,Not a place to fully provide for your family or if you’re looking to progress. It works while I’m still in school but not somewhere I’d retire. You aren’t paid fairly or even what the national average is for this type of work. You’re just a number to this company and fairly cheap to replace.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"There is alot of favoritism at this work place. It's like paid high school. There is alot of drama with management involved. If you're not a suck up, you wont get promoted. They do not place you based off of your previous work experience. Depending on the project youre in, they pay does not add up to the amount of work allotted. It has potential to be a great company, and other sites may be better...but the savannah site is horrible. There are fights all the time, people constantly spreading rumors and they'll hire pretty much anybody to desperately fill positions. I dont feel as if the company cares about most employees, no matter how dedicated a worker you are. I would only recommend this job as a transition, not something permanent unless you dont like having a life or family. I was also told this by a manager who transferred."
bad,"I am 67 and the trainer made a discriminatory comment about older customers....saying they were slow and didnt know their computer so we would have to have patience with them and not get upset....that was just bad....say one thing, do  another....took 3 days to get everyone into programs.  Trainer was always saying we were behind and recommended  working  on our own to get caught up, however, he would waste at least a half our talking about his cooking in the morning and other personal things.  They are famous for shorting your pay.  They owe me about 600 dollars in pay....I emailed both payroll and recruiter twice Friday and was ignored.  Good luck getting paid correctly...its common to be shorted a lot of hours.  I would not work for them again no matter what."
bad,"This job is all fine and dandy once starting out, the hours are nice as you go through training. Then you get up on the floor and have to do a shift bid which is based on attendance and reviews you get which most of the time, customers leave them on your name but were meant for another department they talked to. So you get bad surveys that aren’t even related to you yet the company does not take that into consideration and you can end up with a terrible shift. The company then refused to give me PTO hours that I had earned after their system messed up, and this lead me to quit."
bad,The only advancement that takes place if you are buddy buddy with team managers. I worked there for over seven yrs and was treated like dirt by my TL so I walked out. Would not refer my worst enemy to work there
bad,"Managers are rude and horrible, poor communication and will terminate after they ask you what schedule you want. Poor training classes. Supervisors nice nasty in emails. I wouldn’t recommend unless you’re desperate for a place of employment. Unprofessional work environment in every sense. They’re always hiring and posting on job boards every week for a reason!! Take Heed"
bad,the policies made work environment stressful. payroll consistently had issues with paying hourly employees on time. the never ending mandatory overtime made it so that employees that worked the afternoon shift had no life outside of work. training labs were not adequately setup to provide advisers with materials to help callers.
bad,"Every year it gets worse and worse to work there due to the heavy workload and constant threat of corrective action from upper management. Helping people to succeed is the best part of this job but with the amount of work they continue to add on you, the best part of the job falls into oblivion very fast."
bad,"It could have been an awesome place to work but upper management ruins it with their favoritism and unethical behaviors. You are just a number there, they just want to fill spots for the clients which is why they are hiring “anyone” the same day. There is a reason they are always hiring. People are always quitting because of how low morale is and how hostile and unwelcoming upper management makes this place. The agents, the TLs, the Trainers are not appreciated. The agents got it the worst though, especially single parents. The level of incompetency and unprofessionalism in upper management is frustrating. Get a job there to build a resume and get out when an “actual” opportunity presents itself seriously. Not a place for professional and ethical people."
bad,"When I first got hired it was an amazing place to work. But as time went on they showed their true colors. They do not care about their employees at all. The attendance policy gives NO room for illness or family emergencies. They will be quick to fire you if you do not get good scores, which you have NO control of. It's all customer surveys. If you need spare bathroom breaks, forget about it. Worse place to work. Will never recommend to anyone."
bad,They talk a good talk but once you get there it is a totally different story. My anxiety and depression had never been so bad until i worked for this company. I do not suggest anyone work for them.
bad,"Good luck having a social life. Mandatory extra hours during peak time. Pay is not up to par for the cost of living. Hours suck and are non-negotiable. Also, half the managers in that place are micro-managers. Good luck having a good time working here, they fired all the good managers."
bad,All of the staff are good friends including HR. The team leaders make up their own rules and all different from each other. If they don't like you they will pick and choose the calls they score. Their is a lot of discrimination! They have a bad turn over rate be cause they don't take the time to train the employees they have!!
bad,"Worked for their QBO contract when the vendor was called ""Convergys"". Metrics were based on aggregated customer surveys on how the call went, if the customer was helped, and if the agent ""cared""."
bad,"It's a super good job if you're used to performing hard labor and physical work. Fixed hours for training which is paid and you'll get to pick day or night shift. As far as once training is over, I wouldn't reccomend staying past that. Production floor is nothing like training, not all systems you'll use on the production floor every day  are used or even taught in training so you'll basically have to learn them as you go.. rules and policies are changed and twisted for convenience. The job is very stressful, calls come in back to back and you aren't allowed to log off your phone other than breaks or lunches. Employees and teams are super cliquey, much like in a high school and management has their favorites and you're not one of them don't expect to enjoy your time here. Sales incentives and bonuses are promised but it takes months for them to apply to your check and you're not fully guaranteed to get paid for a sale unless unless certain criteria is met. Drama here goes way past common office gossip so I wouldn't reccomend talking to anyone about your personal life or it will be known to everyone in the building. Turnover rate is so high I wouldn't expect this place to be open in another two years."
bad,Een hele slechte omgeving om te werken mensen zijn altijd negatief. Als je wil doorgroeien moet je echt slijmen bij ze. Geen serieuse collega’s en af en toe heel laat pauze houden omdat het niet mogelijk is om te gaan.
bad,"Working for a company that truly does not care about people was one of the worst decisions ever. Maybe it's because they can't keep a contract for long?"
bad,"When I started this job, we were provided three weeks of training before we were let loose on the phones.  Yes, it was scary at first, not being particularly comfortable with the products we were supporting.  Over time, that comfort level increased.  During my tenure here, I've had a couple of really good managers... the kind who inspire you to come to work every day and to go the extra mile.  They treated their teams as adults and with respect.  In return, they got stellar results from their people."
bad,"the place smells like excrement. The desks and keyboards are crawling."
bad,No job security at all. 95% of employees are sacked within 6 months. Company is obsessed with calls. They expect you to do various admin tasks but then cancel the time set aside to do this and then moan when it isn't done. Unrealistic targets are set making it hard to even meet the most basic of targets- so forget about hitting your bonus. People whos job it is to help you are mostly unpleasant. If you're unlucky enough to be on the intuit campaign then I would avoid the female floor walker who's name begins with T like the plague
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,job was to provide tech support over the phone...not a great job but does pay the bills. stuck behind a computer more than 40 hours a week was not for me. they do not offer part time.
bad,"Hours incorrect, pay rate incorrect. Told lie upon lie i still have not received my back pay. I will leave once i am paid out. The instructor goes to fast and i feel like i am an inconvenience to him. Don’t do it!!!!"
bad,The company promised to pay a bonus and kept setting false expectations of when employees would receive them. There were so many other things that play into the bonus that isn't mentioned until you go questioning. Company keeps having issues with not paying employees the hours nor pay rate they were promised. They give you the run around about everything. It doesn't surprise me they are currently under a class action
bad,"It’s irritating but you have to constantly be on top of your pay which is like a second job seeing as though no one else will do it on your behalf. I’ve been waiting for a whole month to get back lost wages and nothing. They made us switch programs cause one company left, the new position paid more and they’re still paying us the incorrect wage. Overall job was a waste of time. But if volunteering is your thing give it a shot."
bad,"The job itself is not bad, however the way staff are treated is far less than acceptable. They grade you on a floored system that rates you based on opinions about things and other people that you have no control over. The benefits are as minimal as they can be, the pay is barely over minimum wage with no set increments or pay rises. Bonuses are based on the same floored system and management consistently hover over you and will hand out warnings like candy."
bad,very unprofessional. do not force me to go in to detail. From throwing candy pieces on the  desks by the ops manager  to changing inx on a daily basis everything was included
bad,"Management did not care, It was a very much a high school environment. Rotas for the following week would be given with two days notice. There was no work life balance."
bad,The managers are not very resourceful and they also have favorites within the office. There is really no structure and the atmosphere is always hostile. Pay is ok but the job is demanding.
bad,"The company used to be decent to work for, that was before they got greedy and changed the commission structure. Management only care about targets. They really don’t give a thought about you or what’s happening in your own life outside of the place . They changed all the TLs to interns which was a recipe for disaster from the start."
bad,"When I worked at concentrix I found that they would tell you what you wanted to hear to get you in the door but once they got you everything changed. Schedules changed from what they said they pick and choose who they give MANDATORY overtime to. The job is not worth 12/hr when you are literally doing benefits/claims/scheduling "
bad,They lie about being “equal”. They would approach anyone of color about their clothes but a white person in the same thing is left alone. They don’t consider the fact you have kids and emergencies happen.
bad,"All you have to do to land a job is show up, have a pulse, and act like you can hold a conversation. That's about it. I had the job before they even performed a background check, and there is no drug screening otherwise they'd never have any employees. Every other word you hear from a supervisor or trainer contradicts what you hear from another supervisor or trainer. And then the facility itself is a giant health code violation. I've seen truckstop toilets cleaner than this place."
bad,"Always boring at work,"
bad,"Little of no chance of promotion.  Promotions are based on favoritism,   not based on seniority, experience, job performance, nor attendance as professed by management.  Health benefits are way too expensive, especially considering the pay rate.  Twelve point adherence system assigned points for absences (No sick time provided), for being late for work, breaks and for calling out due to illness or family emergencies.    Very limited paid time off is available, even if you have accumulated the time.  ""Permanent"" positions do not exist as tasks are dependent on contract renewals.  Unprofessional supervisors & coworkers.  Thirty minute lunches.Low pay."
bad,"After training you are expected to get on the phone and handle a number of complaints and troubleshoot consumer electronics. Your criticized daily with little support from the team leads. The mentors are great but not available all the time and your penilized when you escalate calls just to ask questions. The turnover is high and there is a good reason for that. Also the recruiters will lie "
bad,"training is provided but they changed procedures so often that you never really knew what was going on. Even in training they tell you to take it all with a grain of salt, or use old training methods and then say “but we don’t do it this way any more”. The schedules are some of the worst schedules I’ve ever had with a job. They give you a break after an hour of working and then don’t give you a lunch until 5 hours after that (for example of break scheduling). I could go on and on but I won’t. This job is good because it’s accessible, they’re constantly hiring, but thats because of the HIGH TURNOVER of agents because this place is such a circus."
bad,"When you ask for help from Management/Team Leads you get the run-around, information is either lacking or out of date, work schedules change every 90 days and there is favoritism among co-workers."
bad,During training you are learning about the ropes of the job which seem ok until you get on the call center floor. The login id worked sometimes and the team leads acted as if they did not have time to help you lmao EVEN THOUGH ITS PART OF THEIR JOB. Also there are very immature and rude coworkers so be prepared for that. Most of my training class quit before getting to the floor. I think that says alot of this job. The pay is great but for the work you are doing it is not enough.
bad,It's an adult kindergarten management is an absolute joke aswell as HR  and many of us know how much of tax evasion goes on in this place and they always mess up with your pay
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"While you may learn a thing or two and meet maybe three decent ""leaders,"" overall this company absolutely, 112% does not care about you beyond attendance. Make no mistake, they need bodies in seats. If you are getting promoted, it is purely based off of popularity or a business need. Qualified personnel are frequently laid off in lieu of personalities. Avoid this place."
bad,The location is really bad. The management keeps on pushing employees and forcing us to reach the target but it's a new account. They provide insufficient training for employees to be familiar with everything and yet they expect employees to hit every single target. The salary also doesn't compensate all the hard work.
bad,"employees specially in our department are made to work on rest days, holidays, and are forced to work overtime even if we don't like it. forced overtime and rest day duty"
bad,"A few things from my experience in Concentrix. Just my views ok. The day long recruitment is that. The recruitment dept are always on your back for references. I was into my 2nd week taking calls after 5 weeks of training and still getting txts from recruitment for references. They called each reference many times and asked for 3 other numbers off them. Very persistent. Training was in a classroom. At times I had no pc to use so took paper notes. The training covered the account tools in great detail. We did not have access to the tools tho except on powerpoint. No hands on experience until we watched live agents on call (barging). When we began operations it was what we were trained for. It was hard as we were new. We struggled but became familiar with the job tho were very stressed due to high number of calls and being unfamiliar. This got easier. Some days there were no calls. So it was the opposite - boring. The management was weak but the SMEs and TLs were top quality. It was like us versus the management/admin side. The metrix was insane and always on your back. Obvious ones like no lates, no over breaks etc. Other less obvious like good cx reviews from calls. The headphones are made up of several wires and a sound box. Not a headphone and single wire. It all clicps together and can cause audio issues. Not so good. The salary is ok average but I should of asked for more. I was asked in recruitment what I want and named my price lol. I should of asked for more more more. I will leave the company and dial new accs with other BPOs. I learnt a lot work wise and made some good"
bad,I worked here for exactly a month and due too falling ill I lost my job sacked me on the spot even though I explained my situation they didn't take any of it into consideration and then when they explained why they made there decision it didn't even make sense as what they said and wrote on the form wasnt even true
bad,"Once you are hired for one company, you are told that you will be placed into another project. That did not happen. They did not inform me they were terminating me and never gave me a reason why I was terminated. I would never suggest this company to anyone. "
bad,"For starters, they tell you that working for their client in peak season is a ""foot in the door"", what they don't tell you is that as soon as they are done using you they slam that same door on your backside. Also, good luck trying to get in touch with anyone to figure out what's going on. There is no communication at all here, The supposed ""team lead/trainer"" that told us all we would be hired on to a new client once the program ended mysteriously went to another program as soon as nesting was over, without a word to her team, and then wouldn't answer any of our questions (nor would the person that supposedly took over for her). I have never seen this level of unprofessional behavior from a company and if you're considering working here, please make sure it's for extra cash and not to take care of any responsibilities."
bad,"Way to many chiefs and not many Indians. Management only does what's best for them. The dress code sucks. People come in a sleep wear. However management is supposed to make sure employee's are in dress code, and they do not. Pay doesn't change. It stays at a set amount."
bad,Too much to learn in a short period of time. Metrics unrealistic and horrible schedule 2:45-11:15 worked every weekend for 4 months straight. Stressful
bad,Was working in quality at Atlantic Point. Officially 2 sales calls per month per agent are supposed to be scored but this isn’t the case I’m sorry to announce that management make us score every call until we find sales calls that score the lowest for the purposes of cutting commissions I had to get out I couldn’t live with the guilt of doing this to agents
bad,Company was poor with management. Were not dollowimg policy and was just poor work place. Work was stressful and management was unprofessional. Would not work there again
bad,I do not recommend concentrix. They do not appreciate their employees in any way or take any real interest in investing in their overall future with the company. They will terminate you will little to no cause and justify it in any way they can.
bad,"I would NEVER recommend anyone to work there! I have had a manager yell at me! And also had an employee insult me and get away with it by the people aborve is just making us shake hands to get along with the other. Worst experience ever! From the time I walked in until the time I walked out, it was a disgrace! So Unprofessional !"
bad,"I wanted to work at home and I couldnt start the job because the people there are so stupid , had no clue what they were doing and all for $10 an hour!! I am befuddled at how stupid the people are!!"
bad,"The company does not care if you have any emergencies a death in the family or if your dying. If you are not in your seat at the time your shift starts it's a write up doctors note or not. They hate giving raising, sometimes will not pay for hours worked then have to wait a month before you see that money. My team leaders were nice just a bad company to work for."
bad,"This is the WORST place I have ever worked."
bad,"Concentrix--on our particular contract at any rate--is horrible. People constantly get sick due to the filthy conditions of the work floor and even the building (and then we had our allowed sick days per year cut down), one bathroom has severe water damage and mold, another part of the floor had a piece of the ceiling hanging down waiting to fall on someone's head, the air quality is horrendous, performance expectations vs. reward is vastly skewed, and folks are being let go for the most inane reasons/jumping ship left right and center as management tries to use fear mongering to motivate whoever's still left."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Business is so unprofessional managers think they are amazing walking up and down the call floor as if they run your lives , your just a number to them expected to hit kpis and never pay out bonus right , get paid just above minimum wage for a horrible title. Don’t get paid for lunch breaks , don’t get paid for being sick only SSP compared to other call centres that do."
bad,"the trainer did not bother to show up the whole time of training, and expected us to teach ourselves with learning modules to help people with their taxes, and I did not feel comfortable enough to do this"
bad,"Too much to write. but its all a fantasy they pull you in with the paid training which last about 4-5 weeks after you get on the production floor its completely different its more upbeat and its ALL ABOUT SALES. you have to OFFER IN EVERY ELIGABLE call despite that person may be poor, ill or doesnt want the service provided. you are coached on what you can do to SALE better . the air on the top floor is awful. it smells and is very suffocating. your coworkers are disgusting despite them having a policy for cleanliness they DO NOT ABIDE BY IT. ive had people walk out the bathroom not flush not wash their hands an get back on the computers. i HAVE a fairly good immune system and every bug that went around at work I GOT IT . and i only get sick at least twice a year. there's so much i could say but not enough time. i worked there for a year and only got 10.50 not a single pay raise .  you earn PTO its not given and i like that but its inconvenient. they also mess up your paycheck A LOT . Some people are really there to help you but when the environment is so toxic it just seems hopeless. they have a dress code in place but do not abide by it so you wil be seeing things you wish you could scatch your eyes out for"
bad,"Extremely easy to get a job there.  Training is rather a joke because the trainer was not skilled in training.  Too many new people in class were there to have fun, which isn't in itself a bad thing, except when they forget once they get out on the floor they have to act much differently.  Once out on the floor, you are pretty much left to yourself to figure it all out.  Pay for what you have to do is not great, and benefits could be much better.  You can dress as casual as you like or put on the fake eyelashes and dress like you are going out to the bars after work."
bad,"Die Arbeit am Standort Frankfurt sind die unnötigsten Monate meines Lebens gewesen."
bad,"They do not value their employees, things change a lot, management is not professional at all and there are no great benefits for working there. I got many kudos due to customers appreciation, I even broke and set records and no one has been able to even come close but I was never compensated for my efforts. I did not even feel appreciated for it and I helped the company so much"
bad,"Very cutthroat- no support from Management"
bad,"I would not recommend this company to anyone. Always had issues with payroll and no satisfaction from team leads. I gave 1 star because I had to fill in something, I originally never gave them any stars for ratings."
bad,"I worked there for 9 months. As soon I started my job I found out I was pregnant, so I talked to HR about leave and how long I would have off. I was told I dont get paid leave and only allowed 30 days off after my child was born. Then after working everyday up until my water broke, went in 6 weeks after my daughter was born and was told by HR that they might let me come back. 2 weeks later I got an email of termination in the mail. Moral of the story, you are just a number to these people and they dont mind replacing anyone at anytime."
bad,"The pay is horrible, and no yearly review or promotions are given. Overall moral is very poor. Management does not deliver on promises made. Poor selection of leadership and some employees are allowed to bully other employees with no consequences."
bad,They let go ppl and kept certain ppl. Now we are without a job with families to feed. They gave us a 2 week notice letting us know the job would end. Horrible!
bad,"I sent a resume to Concentrix, Wood-side, Dartmouth.  A while later I received a call for an interview!  The lady causation 60-65 who did the interview with me had already seen my resume and my experience within the Customer service industry.  The interview automatically seem disinterested and began yawning within the first 5 minutes of the interview? The interview lasted one hour and I was told they would be in touch."
bad,"Concentrix is a great first stepping stone into the job market, but it is not a place you want to stay. You will be treated more like a mechanical machine than a human being. Concentrix will disregard your requests despite having a doctors note and they will take half a year to implement ""resonable adjustment due to health requirements."" The only medical issues they take seriously are back pains, where ""resonable adjustments"" are implemented almost immediately. "
bad,From lying to employees about bonuses to the lack of computers for all employed Convergys was hands down the worst company I have ever worked for. Think twice before working for this company.
bad,"After working for Convergys (Now Concentrix) for over 3 years I found it incredibly hard to advance and develop within the company."
bad,This was not a good company to work. No flexibility in shifts and working hours can change at anytime. No benefits are available for any one except management.
bad,"I would rather allow my resume to explain this. I will say this though, I feel that the company could definitely pay much more than what they did then and currently do now."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"This was my first call center job. Management sucks. Never there to help. If you don't know the answer to a question they will just say ""use your tools."" They want you to rush customers off the phone. They say one thing to you and then turn around and do another. Don't trust them. Turn over rate is sky high. You don't get your own desk. The project I was on was always messy. Desk never cleaned, floors never vacuumed. We stayed pretty busy but during down time you couldnt read a book, play a game, nothing. Pretty much just sat there or talked to people around you. Training was horrible. Felt like I was rushed through and then when I got on the phones I didn't know what I was doing. Good thing is set schedules. Other then that it's sad. I had high hopes for this place but instead was left with disappointment. Don't waste your time."
bad,Unable to accomadate health conditions nor make allowances for health conditions. If u need to go to bathroom between breaks its not going to happen. Had to start wearing adult diapers just to be able to achieve production
bad,"I would not recommend convergys as a company to work for. They give you a hard time using PTO that you have earned, most times having ""system issues"" where you were not able to put time in. you were penalize for using the bathroom during your shift including write ups and making people including pregnant woman clock out if they have to use the bathroom. There is no room for advancement as you have to be a friend of or close to a manager. They only hire people already holding higher positions for openings on contracts regardless on if they have the knowledge or not ( at one point because the new Team lead didnt know ANYTHING about our contract a customer had to wait on hold over 10 min for a regular rep to come take a sup call) the team leads excuse was that convergys hires them from other contracts because they already know what they are doing and dont need to be retrained. its alot to deal with aside from your actual job and not enough pay to deal with it. theres alot more but i cant add it on here due to not being able to scroll down on this page."
bad,"I worked at Convergys for 5 months. The management style was terrible. One manager would give you specific instructions and then another leader would turn around and get mad at you for doing what you were told. It seems as though no one is on the same page there and you never know what rules to go by. "
bad,"Empresa especializada em serviços de terciarização. "
bad,PCI compliance it terrible if you have a child and they get sick at school NO ONE can get a hold of you. There are not pens paper or electronic devices allowed in the building. its just a terrible place to work.
bad,"The company can't organise anything right you end up some days not have a seat for 5 hours or being asked to take annual leave for there mistake, you'll get about 1 weekend off in 6 weeks and most of the time your working on a late shift! The customers are asking for unreasonable things i.e. iPhone x for 20 quid a month, the only thing I liked was I had a good tl for a while but then they changed me around and the place was all sales even though it was advertised as customer service, your timed for everything and asked why you are a minute over your break etc, the canteen is way over priced for the quality of food, if you read this avoid here! Unless you enjoy being spoke to like a child!"
bad,"Management are rude, are bullies and harss you if you don’t sell. They don’t acknowledge the good things you do they just focus on the negative. They put you down I wouldn’t recommend working there and threaten to fire you constantly. There is a high turn around for staff and barely any staff. It’s all about sells and not about helping the customer."
bad,"The company had a fun environment at first, and then it all changed when they lost the contract with a department.  Over 75 people were without a job."
bad,"this may be a bit biased based on the company project i was working under otherwise i have no real opinion on convergy's as a whole. so my time frame from working with them was some of the most boring times of my life imagine 8 hours a day with no real interactions other then 1 customer to the next over the phone you could spend like 1 min talking to someone else that was nearby but that was a problem if a they were talking to another customer or b your distracting them for too long. in this job line you can get in a lot of trouble almost nothing half the time for example i voluntarily agreed to working 10 hours a day for only 4 days a week compared to 5 days a week for 8 hours. so i can't really eat food on the floor i'm allowed to drink on the floor as long as it's in like a sports bottle any who so in order to survive i drink a lot of soda from the vending machines down stairs so on average i tend to have to use the bathroom alot that they actually had to tell me that it is unacceptable and that i'm going to need a doctors note if this continues,,,not only that but there was a lot of internal issues i was having that just never sat right with me day in and day out. as well as rude customers who i'm not allowed to just argue and yell back at. i'm just trying to do my job and help you with what resources i have. so maybe it was just the project i was working for but idk after that i just don't wanna be that stressed out over trying to help so many people day in and day out."
bad,"Beware of this place. It might seem like a nice place to work during training, but that facade will fade and you'll only be left with a dirty workplace, broken equipment, abusive customers and boredom."
bad,The calls were non stop and stressful. The cable and internet they sale NEVER works. They are always hiring because people are always quitting or getting fired. You have to do a ridiculous lottery to get a shift that you want. Absolutely the worst job I ever had. Only good thing was the pay and some of the people I met. If you can place on the internet side it would probably be better.
bad,Concentrix where do I begin? It's underpaid employees. No space. You pretty much train yourself. Short breaks. A lot of questions unanswered! A lot of the time no one wants to help you. You easily get fired quickly for family emergencies. It's NO consistency. Management does not care for anyone who has a family outside of work. Communication with management is poor! DO NOT waste your time!!!!!
bad,The Job is easy the customers are sometimes evil and the management doesnt take care of there people they allow the customers to speak nastily and dont have your back
bad,Hones to God working for Convergys Salford one of the most horrible jobs I’ve had in my life wouldn’t recommend it to my worst enemy and your never safe at that Job they get rid of you in seconds in my short time working there I seen over 10 people leave the environment is terrible the mangers are shocking and and the HR people are pathetic. THEY SELL YOU DREAMS AT THE INTERVIEW
bad,Didnt have a good experience the last while had been lied to about bonus and had to battle to get 40 hours over time money last year the managers pick there favorites to look after then take the Mick out off the rest of the team realatively easy work but your manger can make your life hard and have HR wrapped round there finger so can't expect help from them.
bad,At my specific location they had the worse management. They played favoritism and your advance is contingent on your sales.  They shut down in our area because it was so poorly ran.
bad,"A typical day at work is they expect agents to arrive 10 minutes before shift starts to log into all systems (however you are not allowed to clock in until you are 100% ready to take your first phone call).  So in a week you are volunteering almost 1 hr for a major company.  The environment is so full of pressure to sell on every call, and ignore the customers actual reason for calling.  Floor support and managers stand behind you insisting you sell when you are trying to fix the customers issue.  Unless you want to develop  a major anxiety disorder, stay clear of this place."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,I hated working at convergys i was a trouble shooting tech and had to walk the customer through several troubleshooting steps to see if we can resolve the issue over the phone and if not then I would schedule a appointment to have a technician come out to fix the issue in a timely manner
bad,"My team lead was not a people person. She often time was rude, and was not very friendly. during training things were terrible and the pay very low for the job title."
bad,"This is the worst place I have ever worked.   Favouritism, ageism, discrimination is rife.  They lie straight to your face.   If you complain, they hold this against you, even when they tell you they won’t and encourage you to air your grievances.   They then attack you, making up outrageous lies, and slander anyone who does complain. Many employees have resigned due to bullying, and because of bad management.   The pay is terrible, breaks few and short.  Management don’t respect your privacy,  they discuss or gossip about you to other staff members. They don’t appreciate good, hard working staff who exceed targets.  They have a very high turn over because of the above reasons.  Don’t apply to work here unless you are desperate.  Also be prepared for.religious preaching in the workplace.  Don’t object to this whatever you do,  you will be branded a racist.  Avoid Concentrix at all costs."
bad,I worked here and the only thing I can say was the fact I worked from home was the only benefit. The management and how you have no time as well as the abuse by the customers makes this job deplorable as well as te company.
bad,"Respeito é uma palavra que não condiz con a atitude de alguns superiores. "
bad,"Convergys is the worst place to work ever. "
bad,i worked here for 6 months it was the worst experience of my life. the management team were very immature and did not train agents properly. When a manager has a problem with someone even not work related they will do everything in there power to get rid of them and i seen it with my own eyes. they judge you on quality of calls but do not want to give you the desired training to properly allow you to do your job.
bad,"-They bring you in for an interview and hire for one campaign, by the time you finish your 2 weeks on the phone training they move you to a sales job, no warning. "
bad,Being laid off due to your service provider when at the time of hire there were no limitations on who to use is unfair. It was unexpected and the company wouldn't be flexible in anyway for transfers to a different department. Fairly unorganized and poor training.
bad,"Convergys is the most difficult place I ever worked. If you needed to use bathroom at other than break time, you were written up and instructed ""If you must use bathroom other than at break time, you must deduct that time from your breaks. I took the issue to human resources, and higher, but that is the policy. Add that to the call center background of angry customers, and the expectation to sell products they really don't need makes it a job suited only for a few."
bad,"Infested with bed bugs. Managers are rude and they hate their jobs so they take it out on lower employees. They don’t go to bat for their teams, it’s every man for themselves"
bad,At start the company looks quite attractive. However there is massive company politics. It doesn't matter how hard or how long you have worked for. If you are a pet of the upper management you will be nothing but an advisor. You will get shifts 3pm-11pm and yes you have to work on the weekend as well. After performing very well you may get an applause and yeah may be few lollies. But thats all you get. Once a promotion comes up you'll see a partner or a friend of management gets through to the position even without any good stats.
bad,"I have never worked for a company that gave little to no cares about their employees. They would add overtime on your schedule without consulting you. God forbid you have children to pick up. They do not care. They fired me on maternity leave because I asked for one more week. They pick and choose who's back they want to have. You can definitely pick up on the favoritism. The worst call center job I have ever had. Your best is never good enough. They always want more. You're not allowed to have a life outside of their job. And the troll your social media. If you post any thing remotely about work, you're getting pulled into an office it can be ""work was crazy today"". I would not recommend this place to any one."
bad,This one of the worst places I worked at in my life poor managements  not a enjoyable place to work I would not recommend anyone to work for this company at all
bad,"Convergys promise progression, training, a good bonus, being paid correctly every fortnight, good work/life balance among other promises. The fact is the vast majority of these are lies. They have a huge turnover due to the job and company being greedy and unsympathetic. The fact is they externally hire managers meaning no or very unlikely progression opportunities. They try their best to not pay you your bonus, they'll listen to as many calls as required in order to find the smallest of slip ups in order to not pay, as well as having unrealistic KPIs, which no sane human could keep up with every month due to the intensity of the job (taking call after call after call for 9 hours non stop). The managers aren't trained, they sit on their phones and gossip amongst themselves whilst their agents work tirelessly. Then they'll give you a hard time and threaten you with gross misconduct if you aren't hitting your targets. It's extremely difficult to take holidays unless you book well, well in advance. The basic pay isn't always correct, but you can't check your pay slip due to the ridiculous hoops you have to jump through just to see it (you're then made to feel like it's your own fault for not being able to view your pay slip.) The job itself is intense, constant calls dealing with all sorts (which is fair enough being that it's a call centre) but the frustrating part is the managers aren't trained and you don't get trained adequately as well(4 weeks looking at PowerPoint doesn't count), meaning you can't deal with a lot of enquiries resulting in a fair bit of abuse from customers"
bad,"One of the worst, if not the worst, job I've ever worked for. The company is a total bait and switch, they make it out in training like they actually care about their employees but truth be told they don't. They throw you under the bus as quickly as they can regardless of how you perform or what you do for the company. Rules are nonexistent for team lead favorites whereas everyone else gets a different set of rules. Answers to questions change depending on who you ask, there's no set consistency whatsoever. Team leads will talk down to you for simple questions, half of the time they're wrong but you better not ever question anything they say. Coachings were a joke, more centered on saying what the client wanted to hear rather than helping you understand the source material. All and all, do not work here, it's really not worth the rate of pay and I'm sure you could find something else that won't make you dread coming to work every single day."
bad,Very bad place to work for I remind no one work there. No promotions Poorly ran. Stressful they clean house when they hire to many people. Some hires ups are nice but most of them are not.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Take over your life and doesn't pay much. On top of that the target they ask you hit is way too high to hit. Best thing happen is not working there all. They better job out there with more support
bad,"Even though there are vacancies in other positions, Convergys doesn't value it's employees and would rather have a reduction in force than move employees over to projects that are hiring"
bad,Convergys was a faced paced working environment. Management didn't care about the workers or the stress that the job had on its employees. I have never worked for a place who did not care about their employees.
bad,not the best place to work iv had nothing but problams since I started there in may I have not once had a weekend off and even when I have requested a day off on the weekend it has been denied and there are a few supervisors there that don't do there job properly and that are very rude
bad,"They force you to work overtime (2-3hrs daily) and threaten to fire you if you don't work it.  They don't give extra breaks for longer shifts. They will not work around a schedule that you can work. Ex: You can work the evening shift 3-11 but not the early shift 6-3 for whatever reason (no ride, no daycare, etc.) but they will not work with you to get you a shift you are able to work. Schedule changes happen every so many months and it's a 'bid' you put in for and hope you get it.  If not, oh well. Work your assigned shift or be fired. Turnover is extreme, as you are just a number, not a person. They continuously have training classes to fill the voids of so many people that have quit.  "
bad,"I truly loved my job, however being placed in a hostile work environment by upper management changed it all. I chose to put in a two weeks notice when management was notified of hostile threats and made no moves to resolve it."
bad,"Your first year at Concentrix will be great. After that you become a number and not a person. You’ll be micromanaged into the ground until your soul hurts. I learned that high school cliches still apply to grown people, that it isn’t how hard you work, but who you know to get promotions. The workplace culture is less integrity and work based rather than who you’re rubbing elbows with. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the constant shifts in management and the lack of competent leadership. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you were clocking out at the end of the work week."
bad,"Working at this call center I was responsible for handling a large call volume (at least 10 ~6 min calls/hr) for trying to keep the current ""subscriber"" paying for the service. Management always made it seem like you weren't doing your job correctly.Worked 9 hour days 6 days a week.  It was one of the most stressful jobs I've had."
bad,A typical day of work is being on the phones assisting customers. I have learned how to relate to customers on a personal level. I have learned how to have a person's connection with the customer helps to resolve the issue better. If you get to know your customer it helps to get them the right resolution. The hardest part of this job is not getting enough training before you get on the phones.
bad,A horrible employer to work for. The team lead was very unorganized pay roll was always messed up. I never received all my pay since relocating to the Richmond site.
bad,Try to get lucky and get a team leader who will care about your value. You will get way more help from new employees than anyone there. Very stressful.
bad,"If you enjoy working 10-12 hours a day, when you're only scheduled for 8, working with:"
bad,"I worked here for almost 6 months, family life and co-workers are what kept me going. Free food once in a while, and decent co-workers are the only perks."
bad,This job sucks. I've never seen such a miserable place of employment. Their employees are unhappy and the wages are not fair for the work they do. I would never recommend working here to anyone unless you're looking for a stepping stone job
bad,"you work with nice people but nobody actually cares about you or your well being when it comes to this place, you show up and work thats fine. The only real problem I had with this job, is they told me that until my 90 days was up i wouldn't be billed nor would I have insurance, but Once they started taking insurance out i still had 40 days of my 90 Days left, became sick tried to use said insurance I was paying for, and was told I dont have access to it, that means I was paying over $400 into insurance before i could use it."
bad,"Concentrix was a great fast paced BPO that has grown over the past few years. Management was great and you are well compensated for what the work.  I learned how to deal with clients needs, and improve my analytical skills."
bad,Convergys was very competitive but also if you didn't know anyone already working there you were left out unless you made an extreme effort to be one of them. I had a few friends that I was able to meet there but unless you weren't extremely nice to everyone all the time you weren't included in many of the extra things that were offered to most but not all.
bad,"Worst company I have ever come across. Management Is a bunch of lying snakes waiting to stab your back For a little bit of a commission. Impossible to take any holiday's as it affects managers commission so they'll always say there is none available. Bonuses are not achievable and when you do hit a bonus It's always less than agreed as they will find any excuse not to pay. "
bad,"Not even going to waste too much more time talking about this awful place. Management was a joke and by far the worst I've ever seen in a call center. Had to leave after 2 months of working there due to the 3rd bedbug infestation. Horrible place to work, I'd rather be homeless."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I'm definitely not a bitter ex employee and I was absolutely thrilled when I got the job. Big incentives for percentages (which keep in mind..require approved overtime). Everything sounded amazing during training.. But then there's reality. Hours are based on company needs and bidding and mandatory overtime (10 hour shifts) So you won't get hours you'd hope for. If you're not a parent, this might be the job for you. Lunches are almost always cut, no matter how many hours you work. Team leads are mostly very young minded adults. Direction is poor. Dress code is a grey area... You'll see. Generally the coworkers are nice but almost all of mine had only been there a short time since the turnover is so high. I have prior sales and call center experience so it's safe to say that it'd be a good first job if you don't have experience or responsibilities"
bad,"I would avoid working here at all cost unless in a tight spot for money. Worked here for over a year got a small promotion to floor support/supervisor. Had enough of the verbal abuse from customer complaints that left me going home very stressed and sleepless every night. Upside is most of the people who work there are great but the place really hires just about anybody and should have a professionalism class with the training. With the training I took it was a pitiful two week course. Most of the learning you will do is on the first day on the phones when I did this I had no one to shadow with and had to wing it. It was absolutely terrible. They expect you to take calls back to back and constantly read scripts which is very tiring and exhausting with most managers seem to not care if you need a little break. Again working here is not worth it unless you need the money. Also half the managers don't bother looking at the paths, scripting, etc. Going on their floor or with their client seen many just browsing online shopping or youtube and not being helpful."
bad,"After working there for only 5 months im desperate to leave, stm’s are not helpful and all and roll their eyea when you ask for help! They make it out to be a really fun place to work when it fact it is not!"
bad,This place was by far the worst place I have every worked at.  I could not be paid enough to want to work for this company again.  The managers were the worst part of the job.
bad,"Management did not value employees, only concern with sales and were constantly yelling at employees to make sales. Once sales was made the employee was not compensate as promise during training and the orientation process."
bad,"The org is a typical BPO and so is the environment. they have lot of focus on client's requirement even if you work really hard they hardly recognize that. the culture is very tiring, mostly they have grave yard shifts. the company policies are not very employee friendly."
bad,"i was fooled into leaving my last job for this one.  There never any raises for any department, my first 2 checks were short over 15 hours, and at least once a month i have to question why my check is short"
bad,"At home environment is horrible due to glitchy, out of date software, badly trained team leaders, and no available tech support. I have been onboarded and training for 5 days and I had a mental breakdown as soon as I clocked out today. We are an entire day behind in training due to no tech to help the people having major tech issues. The trainer is flipping through and leaving out important parts of training since we are behind then we are required to take quizzes and required to make 80% which 100% of us failed due to her skipping important parts. While taking the quizzes we have the trainer in our ear steady telling us take your time and look in the knowledge base for your answers and back dooring that with y'all need to hurry up we are already a day behind y'all are taking forever and we are a day behind we are never going to catch up. Long story short Convergys trainers are horrible and suck at their jobs and they are the people that train you to fail."
bad,"FS is non-existance when informed to ask for assistance by your TL.  TL is not properly trained and just sit all day,  has his favors and quick to threaten you instead of backing you with support.  Not train properly for all situations that is encounter on a daily basis.  Schedule is changed on a weekly basis."
bad,"Don't count on anything to be reliable. Doing your best and getting perfect surveys from customers for over 6 months? ... Doesn't mean anything, don't get sick or they'll let you go!"
bad,"Way too many stupid rules that make for a very stressful environment, no writing implements allowed, no personal items of any kind.  Its almost like working in a tyrannical society"
bad,"I have been here less than a year and already my postion changed 3 times, my shift changed 3 times, they ALAWAYS messed up our checks someone was always getting in a fight. The higher up management was horrible. I was in a car accident and had a concussion and had to be written up for the time I missed even the it was medically related. Even during training no one seemed to know what they were doing. I would not recommend ANYONE work here EVER!!!!"
bad,"call flow was heavy most days and when it was slow there was nothing to keep us busy "
bad,"Accepting the position as a Marketing Consultant I was told there would many benefits. Traveling, commission, training, and a diverse environment. Although some of the benefits were true, I do not feel the training was adequate according to the expectations from the client and the company. "
bad,"Don't start your career with this company until you are in desperate need of Job not a good company to start your career."
bad,"This company is awful to work for! They constantly mess up your wages, and you have the fight for weeks for them to admit they were wrong in the first place but you won’t get any apology or nothing! They say you need to be flexible but if your selected or related to management you can get yourself some cushty fixed shifts! The rules change more than the weather and with things changing within the company you won’t hear this from management you’ll find out from a customer! On the plus side you won’t get sacked for anything! You can go awol for weeks and they’ll welcome you back with open arms! You can breach security checks and you won’t even be sacked for that! It’s amazing. The company is laughable do yourself a favour and avoid at all costs"
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of sitting in a cubicle for 8 hours answering incoming calls. I learned the importance of being punctual to work. Management needed some additional training. Everyone who has the title of manager, is not a real manager. The culture at Convergys was decent due primarily to the Call Center Manager at that time which was Melanie S. she was an awesome leader. The hardest part of the job was taking escalated calls and the most enjoyable aspect of the job was convincing consumers to purchase minutes for their vehicle."
bad,"It is a toxic place to work, management is unorganized and not in support of staff morale. Disorganization of upper management staff leads to constant miscommunication of facts and data. Time lines and deadlines are often not met which leads to client dissatisfaction in most cases. This is not a place I would recommend going to work for."
bad,Makes promises of bonuses yet no one gets them. Management is constantly yelling over you while you are attempting to do your job. They are more worried about the client then those working there. Less than 20% of the employees I started working with are still there.
bad,fast paced job its ok all good in the 1st year working there a lot of people are there..its ok wouldn't recommend to anyone with a family its somewhat helpful teamleaders
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,do not recommend as a good place to work unless you live within a couple miles and work part time.  That's all I have to say about this.  It's not the worst and by far not the best.
bad,Not very organized. If you work there you're most likely to get a 2-10:30 schedule. Employees were lied to in the training process and ended up with very bad schedules with no room to compromise or change them. No one owns up to their mistakes. Basically fighting for your job everyday. They fire people like crazy.
bad,"I do not recommend anyone to work for this company.  It is a trap and misleading from the time you  interview to the time you depart from the company.  You will interview for a developer position, then find out you are doing support only.  They push you to meet SLA for customers but the managers are not skilled enough to coach you into how to meet team goal to improve team performance. They have a hard time meeting SLA on paychecks, for 1 year, on every paycheck, a correction request had to be made for pay shortages. Seems they could never get it right.  Pay is the one thing and only thing a company owes an employee but they couldn't get that right either."
bad,"Pure dirt."
bad,"Wile I was there, I worked ""customer service"" for DirecTV."
bad,"You'll be lied to about pay, hours are calculated incorrectly and good luck actually getting a paycheck on time! This company is a mess. If you can avoid this job do so. It will only cause you more stress worrying about how you will feed your kids or pay bills."
bad,Working at Convergys is the most stressful job you could have. No one has loyalty there to the employees no matter how you perform or how long you have dedicated to the company.
bad,"My short time with Convergys was one of the most miserable times in my life. I trained and learned quickly, but the classes were redundant. I had severe social anxiety when dealing with the phones, which granted, was a personal problem that I dealt with. However, my managers never once supported me. In fact, I got talked down to a number of times, despite my high ratings as a customer service representative and my constant initiative to keep up with the always-changing company policies. During my transition training, I had a call that I could not understand, nor could my team leaders. I was on the phone with the customer for over four hours, two of which were past my designated work schedule, and the manager told me I had to handle it on my own. After all that time, we finally had to get higher management in to help handle the situation. Soon after, I quit due to transitioning from one poor manager to another."
bad,"Once the ownership of the company changed, many other unfavourable changes took place. Benefits were cut back, raises were stopped, contests and incentives were changes. There is the expectation that you must always modify your personal life to accommodate their schedules and demands. Very poor work/life balance."
bad,"I did not feel valued as an employee here unless I was out-selling my peers (even then I did not feel valued). "
bad,Was processing claims for Kentucky providers. I learned that it is very difficult way they determine how to process the medical claims for provider. Due to the laws on medical services. A lawyer writes the guidelines in determining the outcome of a claim. Those guidelines are interesting. The culture in the workplace was not to bad. The supervisors did not hound you. But they allowed quality employees to do so and was not there job. Hardest part was understanding the SAT guidelines in processing the claims. Most enjoyable was there was no hostile customer sometimes to speak to when you have phones involved.
bad,The employees were fighting on the job and the managers would talk about the staff as if the employees were not even there. Hopefully it has gotten better over the years
bad,"Convergys is a horrible place to work for. It's a revolving door, everday three people would quit during training at the end of training there was 10 people left. Alot of people did not get there money on time. No one is never on accord, the trainer lacks knowledge.  I wouldnt wish this job on my worst enemy."
bad,The company wasn't work environment. Management is very unprofessional . Worker are very disrespectful. Nobody has respect nor carry themselves professional.
bad,I am currently employed with convergys. Training was a great experience had an awesome trainer. Now that I am in transition I do not believe this is the place for me. I was told that my job should be my number one priority over my family. They refuse to work with my schedule which I am only asking to come in 30 minutes later than what I usually do. Due to daycare schedule and was told to perhaps consider switching daycares. I will not come back to this company after I acquire a new job.
bad,"Required overtime regardless of employees needs, unattainable requirements, quick to fire employees. Work environment is never clean and restrooms are never operational."
bad,I enjoyed myself working there learned a lot about different products environment was not the best. I think management needs coaching also the building was very secure at all times
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I enjoyed the people I worked with and my team leads were good (customer care dept). As a Customer Care Supervisor I felt like we could have been paid more money for all that work. I hated the mandatory overtime and 30 minute lunches. HR is very lazy and seldom respond to anything. They hire anybody off the streets. New office equipment is needed badly. Lots of the chairs have weird stains in them. They have mold in the ice machine and when I told HR, they brushed me off. So if you choose to work there, don't use it. You'll literally be there all day and they get upset if you request time off."
bad,Alot of children work there so they treat everyone like children. Dont needs a child's job. There are other avenues to choice in convergys I just took the wrong one.
bad,"Horrible atmosphere I worked for key bank they had a lack of communication and responsible leadership. One supervisor even hit on me on multiple occasions even after I reported him to higher management , shortly after that I was terminated."
bad,"traveling is the toughest part of the job, love to meet and greet new people and hires, I-4 traffic is terrible so a reliable car is a MUST. Food bar would be nice, have to order delivery or leave and get some food."
bad,"not a recommended job for the career minded as there arent many promotional opportunities, unless you brown nose the somebody already at managerial level or higher. I would on ly reccommend this job for the salary or the youngger crowd who are at quite young and eager to earn good monthly salary. poor jovb security too as they will more likely get rid of you before your probational period ends."
bad,"I worked for this company for 3 years. at the end of the three yearsGeneral Motors was offered a bailout package. this was supposed to keep us in business. instead anyone who had worked for a few years and gotten raises were falsely terminated. "
bad,"The Management needs work.  Also, staffing needs to be more skillfully acquired by offering better pay."
bad,"Investigating criminal discrepancy claims submitted by the customer."
bad,Its fine just requires way to much in the way of abusive customers and we were not allowed to do anything about it. I left because I couldnt take being threatened and them acting like it was nothing.
bad,"I didn't even make it through the first week of training. I was put in a class with a bunch of immature supposed to be 20 year old adults. The trainer never stayed in the class longer than 5 minutes, the Internet was out not allowing access to the training material. The trainer also spoke to the class as if we were children."
bad,"They protect their ""own."" Multiple situations of management using cruelty, lying and threats. Even when witnessed by other managers they will act like it hasn't happened and ""suggest"" you quit. "
bad,"If you are looking for a humain workplace steer clear from Concentrix."
bad,if you are young money hungry and don't have a family or any one you care for then this is a job for you. They do not accommodate for parents who have children the customers are rude and when you tell your manager they say you get paid to be degraded and belittled on the phone. I have been called the b word and porch monkey ive been told to go back to Africa cause all black people don't deserve to be here.. if this is something you can deal with then this is a job for you.
bad,"This place is horrible!!!!!! Period. Don't expect to get your raise on time if at all. The management is poorly structured. They really don't even care about their employees and just toss you right in for failure. Seriously, unless you need a job ASAP don't even both with this one. You'll regret it."
bad,"I have NEVER worked at a more unorganized and dysfunctional place in my life. From the recruiters to the horrendous team leaders. Just an all around awful place to work. The trouble is really in the subscriber advisor department. During your interview they'll give you an option between being a subscriber or in sales and they make the subscriber department sound way easier because in the aspect of having goals it's easy because you basically have none. What they don't tell you in you'll be taking a minimum of 400 calls a day! Don't think about asking your team leader for help because they won't be of any sort of assistance. I suggest make friends because you all will have to help each other! The schedule when you are first starting out is less than appealing! You will be working 3:30 until Midnight for at least the next 4-5 months. The turn around here is unreal but from what I have explained which isn't even the half you can see why! I would never suggest anyone work here but if you do try to avoid the Warren, MI location and if you have to avoid the Subscriber department. Oprah couldn't pay more to work here again. Apply at your own risk!!!!!!!!"
bad,"This company is terrible and treats professionals like high school dropouts. If you were looking for something corporate, go somewhere else. This is ridiculous."
bad,"When I did my first interview I had explained that there were only 3 dates out of the year other than major holidays and black Friday that I was not able to work due to long time family traditions well I was reassured that they would accommodate me on these dates and when the date came I was not only scheduled to work but also reprimanded after not making it in to work only those specific days."
bad,"Even if you're qualified, you will only move up in the company if you are a complete suck up. Favoritism is major part of Convergys culture. No one, even upper management, seems to have a clue or be qualified for the positions they are put in."
bad,"When ""Convergys"" was ""Stream International"", everyone seemed happy, and there appeared to be no issues.  After the ""Final roll-over"" according to the HR department, Convergys went months without paying its employees.  The more scary thought, is that after each time that the payroll was missed, the HR department was constantly scrambling to shred almost every paper document they had in their filing cabinet."
bad,"At Concentrix, the business isn't organized at all, they are always getting paychecks incorrect and they never have things organized for the employees. The training is awful and doesn't prepare you for what you're doing on the floor, and even if you're unsure about what you're doing, no one knows what they're doing to be able to help you, just a bad company to work for."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Everyday at convergys you feel replaceable. Its a constant rotating door. Its almost impossible to advance. So much drama, its like a high school. They give higher pay to new employees while the ones that have been there for years, are the same pay they started out as."
bad,A call center with AT&T as it's primary contractor - unable to show any care for it's employees or the quality of life.  Constant turn around and insufficient training.
bad,Technical issues did not allow me to really enjoy this job. The company would blame my internet provider for the tech issues although I had my provider at my home several times checking lines and everything else and my speed tests showed the problem was not with my internet. I would be directed to call Help Desk which would require leaving a message and waiting for them to call back and they might or might not actually call back. The people I met while working there were great and the job itself wasn't bad at all. It was just impossible to work with the tech issues that the company did not seem interested in helping work out so that I could work.
bad,This company was terrible and had always treated us as seats not people the management would state that they care but would do nothing to resolve any concerns an employee would have.
bad,Horrible. Company has no consideration for their employees. Company is not interested in long term employees. Company turn-over rate is directly due to daily office function.
bad,I didn't like the schedule and it could not be changed. The work environment was very tensed and was not a happy place to work. I enjoyed the experience of helping others.
bad,I had to hire to two baby sitters. while working at  Convergys.   I was a direct tv agent. I learned how to interact with customers on a daily basis. Management just cared about quotas.  Coworkers were ok.   Lack of support from management especially if you had a sick kid and had to go work that day.  The customers.
bad,"I worked for convergys for 9 months, been number one on my teams for months and no rewards were given no appreciation,company only cared for them self instead of great workers who were dedicated"
bad,only wanted a person in the seat to answer the phone - management had no connection with the people that worked there.  call centre environment but not at all interested in helping or growing staff
bad,This job is awful in that the company cares more about sales and profits than the overall satisfaction of its employees. Management cares more about meeting statistics than overall satisfaction of its customers. It does not matter how statistics are met as long as they are your shortcomings go unnoticed. This company also does not support advancement as they will demote you without warning because the only thing that matters are the needs of the business as the overall mantra said by management states
bad,"Convergys was a call center for Direct TV. You were basically on the phone all day with, no interaction with customers. The sales quota was impossible to meet, and the sales goals were unrealistic."
bad,At Convergys I was able to learn new skills in troubleshooting on a daily basis. Unfortunately the opportunities for growth as an employee in areas of pay and advancement were extremely limited. I did however find that the people I work with are extremely hard working intelligent individuals that directly influenced my growth as an employee.
bad,A company that was made so that other companies can not pay their own workers a living wage. Poor management poor computer systems little or no job culture or employee support. A really poor excuse for a company to work for.
bad,very esc calls always managers missing or to busy to assist no where to move up in the company. there aren't any incentives
bad,"This is not a job for the faint of heart. The job can be highly stressful since you are working with Sprint's most valued customers over a telephone. Customers will call in very upset about something wrong on their account, albeit not often, and will be extremely vocal about the issue if you cannot resolve it in the manner that the customer wants. With optimism, you can rely on enjoying the calls that simply require a price plan change, or upselling a new product to the customer."
bad,"If you just need a job it can be great. They hire just about anyone. Pay is ok, but not good enough for what you have to do and know."
bad,"The job was very stressful and the management didn't help matters any. They would set unreachable metrics to be met, they operate on what i consider a buddy system in order to advance."
bad,"Wouldn't recommend job to anyone that is seeking long term employment. Most of the management are only looking out for themselves and job security is at an all time low. If a company is always hiring and then firing that is an indication that the company is either not hiring the proper employees (which shouldn't be the blame) or feels that they have the ""power"" to replace someone without thought."
bad,"This job works around it's own schedule, they don't care about if you have kids or school they just want you to sit and get fat like most the older workers in there, they under pay you and I hope Att drop them and never look back"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Nice place to work while between jobs and trying to pay the bills but it is more for someone with less technical knowledge than me. And i say that with all the respect for everyone there working hard.
bad,"THe hiring process with Convergys was so fast, I was relieved to have employment. They did however mislead me with the job postings that this was a customer service position. After I got in however, I learned that the postion was mostly inside sales with comission goals we were required to hit. The training was a joke, I was frustrated and confused the entire 5 weeks of training and all of my questions were answered with the same general answer: Use My CSP. All of the articles on MY CSP are supposed to teach you how to do your job, but they are poorly put together and do not come up unless you type in specific words or phrases into the search bar. I am currently looking to go elsewhere. The pay is way below most call centers in Phoenix and the comisiion is basically peanuts. Not to mention you basically need to take all of the abuse AT&T customers dish out. Please pass on this opportunity unless you are extremely desperate, as I was."
bad,"•	Retain customer from disconnect DIRECTV account."
bad,"There was never anywhere to sit and the equipment was in poor working condition and the dust was about an inch thick.  Computer system was down more than it was up.  Training was inadequate at best.  The OJT was a joke.  There was never any Team Leaders available for help and when you did find someone they were curt and acted like you were bothering them.  The hardest part of the job was meeting all 7 metrics at the same time along with the unacceptable work environment.  The workplace was dirty and the air quality horrible.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers and the compliments they gave me."
bad,A job that pays thebills but no vacation  no sick leave nothing some managers care others dont seems like some are out to fire you
bad,"Stay far away! This is the worst job I've ever had by a country mile, and that's coming from someone who's spent years in fast food and retail as well. The management is a joke, you can never get straight answers on procedures because it varies from one manager to another, it's very difficult to advance unless you're sleeping with the right person, and HR is a sham. I've seen racist and overtly ""adult"" remarks get reported and the person who did the reporting get written up by the end of it, while the person doing the harassing got off without so much as a slap on the wrist. The job itself is miserable: you get screamed at and cussed out, and you're naturally expected to still bend over backwards, even if it means wrecking your own sales numbers (which you then get in trouble for!). It's a disaster trying to find a desk with a working computer and headset, and once you do, you can expect to be forced to move at some point during your shift so that a supervisor's favorite can have ""their"" spot. Micro-managed to the minute (literally). They also have no respect whatsoever for furthering education and refuse to give any flexibility AT ALL with your schedule - I needed one 3-hour time period on Friday mornings guaranteed off so I could attend ONE class, and was told absolutely not. Your schedule also can change at the drop of a hat; I've literally seen schedules change an hour before the shift was supposed to start."
bad,"The client is Comcast. You're expected to make sales, which only fall under a certain category. Management is crooked. You will get yelled at ALL day. The most enjoyable part is any break. Co-workers are generally just that. Get used to not having team assistance aside from a few good gems. You'll have to deal with customers of a company that are rated second worst customer service in the world. So before you even finish training, you're already loathed by someone. Your advancement is based off of favoritism. It won't matter how good you are at your job, someone has to like you or you have to be cute. In short, this place sucks. It has a huge turn over rate and there is a good reason for that."
bad,"The way they represent themselves is horrid"
bad,They have health benefits and various work schedules to fit your work/life balance.  Convergys has various clients to offer customer service contracts.
bad,It is not very good to work their the management is very secretive and not wanting to tell their employee's about demoting them.
bad,"No comment"
bad,It's a job if you have absolutely nothing else. Just don't expect to just be a customer support. Be prepared to have to up-sale unwanted/needed products to already unhappy customers.
bad,"managers joke - managing SALES person and they have never sold in their life......Wont leave sales alone to SELL, which is their whole purpose..."
bad,"This place is literally just a place to go, make some money at, and then leave. Do it again and again until you're tired of the repetition. They claim to hire as permanent but permanent means up until the contract that they have ends. In which ""they might change your department if theres an opening"". Good pay though. Ridiculous about having cell phones on the floor. Twice caught, you're out! Its a high school as well with half the employees acting like 15 year olds mean mugging in the hallway, and they have lockers for you too!"
bad,Its like a corral in and out..no employee appreciation and micromanaged
bad,Metrics not in your control are used to grade you regardless of how good of an agent you may be.
bad,"I am currently employeed however due to latency issues from the work servers to my computer am being constantly told if I do not find a way to fix the problem I will be terminated I spent hundred of dollars to have new cabling ran to my home inside & out got new modem ethernet cords upgraded internet speeds to highest level available trying to do what I can to resolve the issue we ran multiple ping tests to confirm where the problem was located and to different servers the only server the test ever fails when pinging to is the Convergys server I have been told by internet provider it is something that needs to be fixed on the employers server. However since latency does have to do with internet whether its coming from me or from the corporate servers I am being told is my responsibility. My technician even ran tests to find which area server was causing the delay & it was/is located somewhere in Washington DC i live I Norman, OK. I do understand that there are people out there who may take advantage of a position being able to work at home however I feel that after more than 8yrs of loyalty the company should be willing to try  a little harder to help get the problem resolved. Each time the problem occurs I am forced to clock out but still call the Convergys help desk or my isp and troubleshoot the issue for the full length of my shift yet I do not get paid for any of this time even when it is confirmed by the convergys service desk to be a convergys server issue I was not compesated for the time spent trying to resolve the issue. If this were the first time it had happened"
bad,This company plays with people's minds. They are a terrible company to work for. They make promises they cannot keep. They are cruel to their employees.
bad,"Management was terrible, did not care about the employees, promised advancement in interviews and didn't follow through"
bad,My ethics and morals could not allow me to continue employment here.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Convergy's was an ok place to work. They were overly concerned with how much you sell and not how well you resolve the issues with cell phone customer's services. They also did not allow for you to have a good work/life balance.
bad,"Lunch stolen out of breakroom fridge first day, dirty maxipads stuck to bathroom door handle and sink more than once (absolutely disgusting), written up for Aux 2 (unpaid bathroom break) if you have to use the bathroom you are only allowed 9 minutes a week to use aux 2 and it takes 3 min just to walk to the bathroom.  Saw a young lady who I was working with BEAT DOWN by another girl while on the phone with a customer apparently over a man. Dirty workstations. Management is HORRIBLE. And the survey line.. at the end of EVERY call you are required to say. "" one more thing Mr/Mrs...if you wouldn't mind, PLEASE stay on the line for a ONE question survey"" the survey asks about their ""Netflix experience"" not the customer service experience, so if they are very upset about their bill or rebuffering which most of them were and they give u a ""no"" you get in trouble for this. Too many people there with no self respect, or respect for anyone else."
bad,"While the pay is good, it is needed to attract new employees.  They are almost always hiring because they can't keep employees.  The management is a tight crew, and rewards those who suck up.  They are about the numbers, NOT about customer service."
bad,"Supervisor's not willing to work with you, typical day at work very confusing no order always fighting. Hardest part of the job, not being trained properly to handle customers satisfaction. Very very high turn over."
bad,"Convergys has a great looking building. Their training curriculum is at best horrible. Its a lot like the detention scene in ""The Breakfast Club."" They change the instruction to a forum they know wont work and in the end blame you for their failure to instruct you. In the end, Id rather be back in High School. At least there if your training sucked, you could change classes."
bad,"The training schedule was weird, 4pm to midnight, once on the floor we were told to tell customers we had no supervisors, so if someone asked for one it'd be a ten minute back and forth of ""let me speak to a supervisor"" ""I don't have one"". The customers were always complaining about everything and would blame you, as if you came and stole their vehicle's warranty personally somehow. The TL's gave us little info and the system was confusing as h e double hockey sticks."
bad,"It takes up your entire day, you can never advance in the company and they treat the staff like trash."
bad,my coworkers overall were great. The management on the other hand were not...the constant feeling of fear of doing something wrong  was always on ones mind...shifts were based on how they felt you did and picked fault in the job even if no fault was evident ..leaving no room to advance
bad,"Not a career, temporary work if you need a job at best. Place is not clean been with company three years have yet to see a vacuum, upper management makes the money huge bonuses while those actually doing the work, make just above minimum with no chance of a raise. I repeat they don't give raises. Medical benefits are useless its a company in California being in NY it doesn't help. Unprofessional manager's and work environment. Run do not apply. You will be sorry you did."
bad,"The workers were good, but minimum wage and very heavy labor at times."
bad,Worked from home which was the reason I stayed for close to 2 years... I did learn and gain experience with technical skills . Static Ip and things of that nature.. I often felt underpaid and overworked.
bad,"This job was very depressing for me. It was so terrible  at that place that I could not take it any more. But if you are into the ghetto lifestyle than this job maybe for you. The work area is nasty and its sad because housekeeping work so hard to try and keep it clean but like I said its ghetto. It is only a few tls that care about you the other ones  dont care about you they just want their numbers to look good. I worked in subscriber but I heard some horror stories in sales. Its sad to say but after working here I dont even want a gm made car, its ridiculous the kind of phone calls we would get about the equipment that dont work or they were sent to the wrong b/c a, the previous advisor didn't listen to the request, b. Their system is stupid and either has the street plotted wrong or it doesnt have the street in there at all or it would not pop up after putting it in several times, or c. The  previous sub cant spell and sent them to the wrong place. Than the technical support is in the philippians with attitude problems who dont do their jobs. I could go on and on but Im not so I leave you with this even if you are struggling to find a job please dont work here you will regret it like I did. Go to several temp agencies first to see if they can help you. I have a degree and I know I didnt build up 60k worth of loans to make 10.25 An hr"
bad,great benefits good trainer not so good work atmosphere hardest part of the job unsatisfied customers
bad,"Worst job I've ever had in my life. Pay was decent for area however training was a waste, constant schedule changes, very disrespectful management. Management starts at 12 per hour,  how much could they really care."
bad,"Horrible management! Split days  off that change from week to week.... no real educaton that will help you advance. Read a book on customer service is better than their training. Constant turnover of employees, which is the 1st indicator of poor management.  I have seen bleeding employees who were told they could not leave. If you are 45 seconds late you will be assessed a .25 penalty point which affects your meager .40 raise and can lead to dismissal.  The biggest issue is that upper level management lies. Convergys overbills the client by having employees take the same training two to three times. Because your start time may change daily or weekly it is difficult to plan your life. Only 1 person is allowed off at a time in some departments. I advise against working at the Charlotte location. This is an unbiased review by an ex employee who has worked at several call centers over a 30 year period. Best wishes in your job search!"
bad,I worked for convergys for over 3 years. During my time there I saw alot wrong with the company. The politics are ridiculous and there is no communication between upper management and representatives. I applied for multiple possitions in the attempt to move up in the company and only had two interviews in which I thought I did really well in. However obviously was turned down for both possitions. One possition was mainly because the people in training were still new and trying to tell me i provided mis information about sales and pricing of the products however i was the top salesmen at the time so i know my information was correct. The second possition was for a lead agent possition and I was interviewed by my old supervisor who had just been promoted and he went into the interview with expectations of what my answers would be. One thing i know is you never go into an interview with any expectations or you will be disappointed. The benefits at Convergys took a dive this year. There are no co-pays on any of the medical insurance. The best insurance they have is the dental. So if you don't mind spending all your money on medical bills go ahead and work here but i for one need my money for my bills. You are expected to allow any and all irate customers to cuss you out and you can't even tell them to calm down to allow you to help them. Most customer service companies have a policy where you can professionally ask the customer to stop using that type of language or you will have to disconnect the call or you will have to escalate the situation to a supervisor but not this place.
bad,i worked there while pregnant was not aloud to take more than two bathroom breaks did not get paid maternity leave   worked all aspects of fedex customer service and tech support
bad,Providing high level support for technical issues on phones was fun but its still a call center. Very shady methods for keeping wages down.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Drama with bad management no help every man for self. nothing really good about the job at all.
bad,It sucks thats it this is not the job for you if you dont like to talk with other people
bad,"In a day I review OnStar services  with new and returning clients so they know what Onstar safety services they have and their account information is correct.  I cancel previous services on  GM vehicles which were traded in for new  ones.   I transfer clients to other affiliates for  certain technical and  billing services not part of  Onstar or specific to their gm vehicles.  The hardest part of the job is selling  hands free calling minutes  which  activate part of their services.  We compete with blue tooth and unlimited minute plans from other cellular providers who sell less expensive minutes which  do not expire.   Selling minutes is a requirement to receiving incentives and maintaining certain quality goals. It is also part of our advancement. I have learned not to  depressed  when I do not meet certain targets everyday, but take solace in the fact that I have given my clients a good customer experience."
bad,This was the worse job I have ever had!!  Management was horrible; they would yell at you on the floor. When you  needed a manager there wasn't anyone to help; and when there was they acted like they didn't want to be bother. The call center was like a open door employee would be there one day and gone the next door. If you are desperate for a job take it; but look for other employment the first day!!
bad,"hard workers will only be workers here.Ambitious people not allowed.Growth opportunities are not for people who are honest,hardworking and having high integrity.Salary is ok.You can grow if you belong to a certain state.so though convergys policy states there is no bias, in reality there is a serious bias in terms of region/state,to a certain extent the caste. The hardest part of the job is to prove to the management that they need to make corrections for  long term client relations but unfortunately we are only little people in the organisation."
bad,"I learned alot at Convergy's its self motivated place with good benefits and good people to work with, My Customers were My main priority and focus. I build long lasting Relationships with my Co-workers and Customers. I adaptive to rapid change always Motivated others and my self to Rank the highest In our Group. The hardest Part of the job was for me Leaving my Team Leaders to get A new one. The Most Enjoyable part was getting rewarded When I did a magnificent Job."
bad,This is a company that is used as a stepping stone to something else.
bad,I learned a lot and loved my job but Minacs was one of the worst employers I've ever worked for.
bad,"Has no job value what so ever. This is a revolving door. Management is ridiculous. Co-workers were great, but i think the overall moral of management and company policies need serious changing."
bad,"Management is very lacking"
bad,"Promotions tend to be based on tenure and not ability which leads to a general trickle down effect of poor performance and cutting corners for a paycheck. You can tell that almost all managers at this site didn't really care about their job and were just glad to not answer calls. As such, most of them should have been answering calls while more qualified and driven individuals ran the show to try and lead the teams to a better outcome."
bad,When I started with Convergy's in ALbuquerque NM. I was the first one in line. I was guaranteed a job for at least 5 years. Their contract with AT@T was cancelled 3 1/2 years into our employment. I thought that i was going to be there a long time. But as we can see their are no guarantees. I liked my job there.Im sorry it had issues. Maybe they wern't as serious as I was about my job.
bad,"I have worked there for a year and it is dehumanizing, they would rather let you go than advance you because there is always a fresh training class to replace you. They pride themselves on their high turnover."
bad,change the rules everyday and make up there own rules to fit the situation 
bad,The job was misleading. It was really a hard core sales job that was suppose to be a customer service position.
bad,"turn over rate is horrible"
bad,"Convergys provides a slightly higher than minimum wage for phone support operators and is the general definition of outsourcing within the US. They pay you receive is significantly less than you would be paid providing tech support at other companies that provide the same tech support. You will be required to deal with all sorts of customers from happy to sad to angry, one after another, with little to no break, and to enjoy it for little pay. You will be required to work around their schedule for you, they will not accommodate you if you are in school or have other reasons. They work on a points system that counts towards termination if you receive a certain amounts of points: any lateness, sickness, any absences, it doesn't matter what the circumstances are or even if it is excused, if it is not part of their schedule for you, it counts towards it. Do not expect them to be caring or sympathetic, even if you have an emergency and a written doctor's order not to attend work for a certain length of time, they will not excuse it or even try to find a workaround solution - unless it's been approved before the emergency happened. Shysters. I would not recommend working for this company to anyone, and I would never work there again."
bad,ALOT of people do not like this job. it is not easy and not many can handle it. if you are tough skinned and can think clearly to not take things personally. then its a great job it starts off at ten an hour. you will see you first check and think your rollin in the money. almost everyone does this and then they quit 3 weeks later and have NO MONEY LEFT.
bad,"I worked for this company for 3 years. I advanced from a telesales agent into a Team Leader position. I put 100% of myself into this job, but that was never good enough.The company has a reputation for a high turn over rate. Everyday, I had to wonder, is today going to be my last day? There was no job security whatsoever."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Meeting the sales goal or the customer Service part of the job was good. I liked the training on the different products provided by the company it helped when getting the customers to change from one plan from another or one merchandise to another. The management didn't follow up on rules and regulations on products and changes for the company and customers.The hardest part of the job was the scoring from the managers, they would find anyway to give you a low score. But disputing and reading the company do's and don'ts help you prove your point, the company has a info stream at your finger tips you can find the answer pretty fast."
bad,"I started with this company in march last year. Absolutely loved everything about it. I worked with Netflix as a CSR. Loved my co-workers and upper management. A few months later I was being paid the same as co-workers that slacked or lied to customers. Management had favorites and let people slide by. Myself and others were treated with disrespect by customers that were lied to from previous co-workers. Customers weren't so friendly at all, and management didn't care how many times you were cursed at or threaten you still had to take call after to call without a one minute breather. If you're literally throwing up, they don't care, won't send you home. Hospital notices don't mean anything to them, ever after I got in a care accident. Worse of all I was doing everything to become hiring up, coaching others, getting amazing surveys back from customers and being on time. Management never gave me a promotion, and ended up de promoting people who deserved it more than their favorites that they picked. Team leads were having adult relations with a lot of their team mates on or in the buildings premises. I ended up leaving the job because I was promised a strict schedule so I could take care of family (had paperwork from the state and everything) and one day they tell me my schedule doesn't work and their going to hire someone who can work nights for less pay if I can't work what they want."
bad,"I worked for convergys for 12 mos and it was the worst 12 mos of my life!!! please do not work there, they all micro manage u, they have no values and dont care about your at home life. even the site leader act worse than the supervisors! its all about money and not the freaking workers who are working to get u the money. I dont recommend it all"
bad,"a typical day at work was solving customers issues with thier cell phone accounts. I learned that Convergys only cares about saleing uverse products and not their AT&T customers. Most of my co workers were really nice but some thought they were""God"". The hardest part of the job was trying to talk people into buying the uverse produts when they were almost always in a 2 yr contract with someone else. The most enjoyable part was when I did make a sale they did do a company wide annoucement"
bad,"After working with the company for the past five years I have found them to over work and under pay all employees. The company does not take into consideration how hard everyone works each day. There is extreme pressure of making the metrix every day. I have seen more people come and go in this company. There isn't any formal training at Concentrix. Most of the time you are just thrown into a program and expecteed to suceed without training, This company is a modern day sweat shop One of the key issues with Concentrix is that they haven't given anyone a raise in the past five years. So if you want to advance in a career this isn't a company that you would want to work for ."
bad,Management: Changed several times and never got better. They were never around to help with issues only they could approve.
bad,Convergys was an abusive place to work due to
bad,"Training was great, but as soon as I hit the floor I felt like throwing my badge to the ground and walking out the door, they make it seem like everyone is there to help... Uhhh, NOT THE CASE! It's like being thrown to the wolves and finding you own way. My whole training class started out with about 29 people, there are only 4 of us left. The stats they try to make you maintain are unreal! How do you expect to verify accounts, figure out the problem, fix the problem then always make sure to SELL on a every single call in a small allotted time ? If I didn't have great co-workers and bills that I need to pay I would walk out today. Schedule changes are the most annoying part! They don't try to work with you, they tell you that you get this many days off a month and this amount of lunch time, lies, lies, LIES! Once you question it they tell you that when you signed your contract it was ""if available"" meaning if they're understaffed (which is everyday) there is no way you can take your hour lunch of have unpaid or paid time off. If you're even one minute late you get points, you have to make sure to run all you systems and load everything up so you can start your shift on time. Meaning you basically have to show up 15mins early (without being paid) to open all the systems on their god awful slow computers. I have so many more complaints but I don't want to post them because they might figure out who I am and fire me tomorrow. We were told not to ever type anything about the company because they are all monitored and will find out who wrote it."
bad,This company cares more about money than they do the employees not the customers of the clients. They threaten to terminate way more than they support you to do a better job. Too many rules. Too strict of rules. Not many people can make their stats.
bad,"The main job was to answer phones & resolve the customers issues; whether it be tech support, paying a bill, changing or downsizing their package, finding out where their technician is, etc."
bad,"This was the WORST company I have ever worked for. The culture is horrible, and they have put immature people in positions of power. There is absolutely no structure at all!"
bad,working here is like working lost lugage at the airport....you never have a good day. Everyday i went to work i became depressed.
bad,I dont have any comments in regarding the company. Only its a call center experience like to have for temporary job.
bad,"The management was terrible, because the communication with upper management."
bad,"There is a lot to be desired at convergys. The company, from the ""immediate manager's position"", could use an over haul. Upper management is fantastic."
bad,I learned that no 2 jobs are ever the same and this company proved this in more ways than one.
bad,"If you like working for different campaigns almost every month with minimal job security due to the fact that the company can't keep contracts cause they pince every penny possible than Aditya Birla Minacs is for you. Did I mention that the majority of management is in India, worst company I ever worked for and worst call centre experience I ever had."
bad,The company is a good company to work for so please don't get me wrong. The company's different accounts that they have as clients are rediculous on their standards.
bad,This is a company that doesn't care about its employees. They dont care if you have a family or not they want you to work around them.
bad,"I was fired from Convergys. . I was forced to work almost 80 hours a week on salaried pay to complete the necessary requirements of my job. When I refused to work so many hours because it was affecting my home life and destroying my marriage, I was fired within 2 weeks. My boss at the time was using favoritism on many of her employees and using it to promote the ones she chose."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Got called racist for quoting MLK I have dream speech I'm Mexican  was told not aloud to also the force you to sell to people who have lost everything
bad,"I work on a sales line at Concentrix. The incentive is made progressively more difficult to meet. I find the atmosphere to be very competitive and the people who work there are not happy to be there. The company dose not care about the employees, although the management team does seem to care but has little control over the aspects of the job that effect employee satisfaction. "
bad,I started working at this place because I have been out of work due to surgery for many years. To walk back into the workforce with this type of employment it is horrible. Poor training poor communication poor management unprofessional it's just the least. I continue this employment until I find another job. This company needs work!! Technical support is not technical support work it is a slick way for this company to not pay people for accounting. The reconciliation in banking questions should be moved to it entirely different department. If you just need money yes work for the company otherwise don't waste your time
bad,Management is quicker to talk to your peers about you than they are to talk with you even when you request meetings with them. There are clicks like high school with favoritism.They’re quick to continually add new duties and requirements to your position without any type of raise. Instead we’re sometimes given toys from the dollar store. Upper management told us more than once that we can easily be replaced and tells us we are crazy to try to better our positions. We were even told to “ask what happened in Arizona” when peers requested raises. A few of us did ask and never did find out. Management’s scare tactics and complete lack of respect for us and the agents are why the turn over rate is so high!
bad,"This job comes with some of the rudest customers you will ever deal with. You earn PTO but every time you put in for it, they turn you down even if you request in advanced. The systems never work properly and always have issues, they have so many blocks on the computers that it takes forever to even open them. They don’t teach you what you need to know to help people, they teach you the bare minimum and expect you to look everything up as you go along  in a system that is hard to look things up with unless you’ve been doing it forever. It’s by far one of the most annoying jobs I’ve ever had. The pay is decent though."
bad,"Poor management. Lousy communication. HR department is useless. Company will go out of their way to find an excuse not to pay you bonuses, raises etc. Company has zero integrity."
bad,concentrix is good but dish was awful biest and very depressing place to be made dish makes you feel out of place and not good enough they pride themselves on the money you make them then run you threw the dirt
bad,"If you are unlucky enough to get picked to work on the Fed Ex site you will quickly find you are just a number they don't care about you. Your OM won't even know your name, she only cares about hanging with ""her people"". Also, Fed Ex could care less if their customers get their packages or not so you are there to be screamed at and berated by angry people for 8 hours and longer a day because as people quit and your load gets heavier they do not hire more people they let you drowned and force you to work overtime."
bad,"Just plain bad management with no respect to hard work.  Do your job and shut up.  Want to advance in education, management doesn't back you up.  Do extra work they expect but don't expect that on your appraisal.   Greed is plenty in management. Direct managment and local VP."
bad,"Trainers, Team Leaders, and higher positions aren't helping anyone. They are toxic and never trust them."
bad,"Low compensation and very stressful job."
bad,Very unorganized management. Lots of favoritism. Very stressful and I would not recommend this to anyone unless they like thisthis sort of environment
bad,Concentrix has been the only job in my life that ever made me feel like I would never ever be good enough. Very stressful atmosphere! No matter how hard I tried I was put in Boot Camp and told that my job would be in jeopardy if numbers were not higher. I was constantly doing the best I could do. I am an Administrative Assistant. I went to college. I could not stay in a job that treated people like a number.
bad,"the team leads are rude. the place is dirty, especially the bathrooms. the actual call center floor is infested with bed bugs ugh. they mess up on payroll more than a little bit"
bad,"Unfortunately, I had the displeasure of working at this call centre for just under a year before I quit. But believe me, it felt like a lifetime. By the end, Concentrix was horrible for my mental and physical health - not just because of the yelling and name calling from customers all day but also due to toxic management. If you have to use the (dirty) washroom, you better do it on your scheduled break - there’s a lovely, passive aggressive email sent out about that monthly. One of them said there is ZERO reason to take a bathroom break 20 minutes before your break (so don’t drink water ever even though you talk for 8.5hrs a day with a new call coming in every 8 seconds). Concentrix was tolerable and even sometimes fun before they made major changes to our OMs, job roles and systems that were rushed and terribly executed. If you need money, stick it out for the training (team leaders and trainers are only good things about this place) but also be aware that there is constant payroll issues at this place."
bad,very poor management-----very disorganized and being moved around to different departments constantly.     they treated everyone like they were in a work release program.
bad,At my location I worked for the better half of a year and a half. They have agents and team leaders. Team leaders are paid $15 agents are 11.75. after a year they never asked and assumed I would want to help train new agents. I was never asked I was just told this is what I would be doing. For a while it was once a month then it became every week for months at a time. I never got a raise and when I asked I was pushed to the side really unfair
bad,The people the job and the way they communicate are all bad this job is terrible if you apply talk to no one and just do your job come to work and you will be fine
bad,"Not much to say. It's a call center. You take calls. You're chained to a phone. You're micromanaged. It's hard to get the shift you want. Someone is always looking for you to mess up but they don't have much to say when you do well. Not easy to advance and move up or off the phone. You pretty much have to brown nose and get in with the ""in"" crowd to get a position higher than a phone position. the only pro is the pay is decent for a call center."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Horrible place to work, they show favoritism and they work you like a slave and it’s a revolving door. They will fire you for anything and they plot on firing you from the time you get in training"
bad,"You are like a number in a chair.  No real care or concerns for their employees. No one in management knows what they are doing.  "
bad,"Do you like complacency, how about boredom and days that seem to drag on forever. Do you like a management team that has no direction? If so you will love working here. Are you looking for a place to work untill they fire you? Well sign up fast."
bad,"I wasn't there for long as it was a stepping stone to another more permanent role. However it is a quick and easy option to gain rapid work."
bad,If you need a job fast I recommend. They’ll hire anybody. Turnover rate is very high. I came in during training they said if you miss no days and have good quality  you’ll be able to advance and you’ll have more lead on choosing your off days and starting time. LIES! I was the only person That didn’t call off or was late I even got a certificate for perfect attendance and best dress. So everybody that I came in with for Sunday and mondays off and I got Tu no weekends off they show favoritism I quit after 2 mos
bad,The managers do not know how to properly do their jobs. They take their personal problems out on their employees. They will tell you that they do not think you are cut out for the job instead of trying to help you and give you tips on how to make the transition from training onto the floor an easier one. Pay is decent but not for the work you do and the customers you are verbally abused by.
bad,"Company focused more on sales than customer service. Instead of helping the customer resolve their concern you constantly had someone in your ear while trying to listen to the Customer, asking what they are available for and to get the customer to add a line to their account, sign up for DirecTV or internet. It was a very stressful job. They always promised incintives for making sells but I   never seen it  pay was a lot less than what they said and you are not able to see your check stub"
bad,"I worked on several contracts at this company when it was Convergys. While it varied by contract, the job was quite stressful as both a customer service representative and technical service representative. Benefits are reasonable but wages were and are low. I stayed there for two years but had to quit as it drained by soul. Also very little flexibility and very strict attendance policy. Good way to learn about technology and business operations"
bad,"I have been here for less than 6 months, the environment is alright, I do not like the way management are like turtles in their shells (always in their office never interacting with anyone). They micromanage you and what you're doing but never have presented with what their expectations are or what is unacceptable. We have never been presented with a ""point system"" , therefore no one knows what the actual policy is for calling out or being tardy. I also think the lack of care from the management is why the turn over rate is high."
bad,"I was harassed by a team leader at Concentrix, the HR dept. basically did nothing and this person who has a history of firing people without just cause is still working at the company."
bad,If you like people completely running over top of you and keeping the chapstick business open due to kissing tail then this is the job for you! I loved my job at first. It was amazing. They fed you this pipe dream and you think that man this job is so much better than all of my other customer service jobs and then.....they completely renig on EVERYTHING! If you are not a favorite or a brown noser then you get NOWHERE! If you aren't meeting specific metrics for the company you get NOWHERE. The turn over rate is awful. They can't keep anybody. The Lynchburg site is hemorrhaging bad. They are losing thousands of dollars a day because they can't get schedule adherence right. They spend more money trying to get people to do their job than anything. Management will sweep any issue under the rug and consider it handled. I hated coming to work. I would sit in my car and cry because I didn't know what bullcrap id have to put up with. I quit because it was too stressful and I questioned my sanity. I filed for unemployment but was denied because HR lied through their teeth. I even had a phone hearing and they STILL lied. Screwed me big time. Word of advice: DONT DO IT! ITS A TRAP!
bad,"This place is good to work at as a first job but like the title says the management sucks. I’ve literally seen how people would try to put in PTO (paid time off) and they would cancel the time even if u got approved for it. Once u leave training its basically every man for themselves. You have some good team leads that will try to work with you, and then you have some that would be two faced. You just have to look out for yourself there."
bad,You were taught to answer the phone as quickly as possible and end the conversation just as quickly.  Very poor management and never got a straight answer on anything.
bad,Eig ein sehr angenehmes Arbeitsklima aber der Rest ist für n A****
bad,"I worked there for just under 2 years and eventually left because the frustration and daily stress level from working there because too bad to deal with. "
bad,my understanding of what was  required of me to perform my job with this company was understood but after paid training I was placed in learning lab immediately and my expectations were very disappointing the floor staff not all was completely rude and not knowledgeable at all some were lazy and only wanted to collect a check this was by far the worse company ive ever worked for their turn over rate is horrible several people including myself left this job and never looked back I truly belive that this company could do and be better if they were to hire the correct staff.
bad,"Struggled in this role, the shift hours vary which means one day you can be working until 9pm and then the next starting 8am and working weekends so no social life. "
bad,Das Unternehmen praktiziert eine strenge Sparpolitik.
bad,This is the worst place I worked for.  If you are in need of a job then go for it but other then that go somewhere else.  There is no coaching and the supervisors are the worst.  They talk to you like children and it is the most unprofessional place ever.  Avoid if possible.  I would recommend car washing or digging ditches before working here.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Terrible place to work! Unorganized unprofessional and they mess up pay every other week ! It’s likr working in a zoo with no zookeeper. The managers sleep with everyone. They give you VTO UNVOULANTAIRLY ! Oh and the bed bugs are terrrible !
bad,I worked there for 10 months at the Lynchburg VA site for the financial line.  I was a mentor. I had several issues with other mentors undermining my authority. People were placed into a mentor position who only wanted the job to avoid phone time. I maintained professionalism and was told time and time again if there were any concerns to go to a team lead or my HR manager and every time I did I was blamed for the situation at hand. I was told repeatedly that I was butting into someone's business and taking frustration out on people.  They honored employees who did not deserve accolades. They monitor social media and have people report personal things. They do not use fair hiring processes they know who they want in certain positions and they use interviews as a formality.  You feel irrelevant and unappreciated.
bad,"The worst company ever, at first I didn't believe in it that it was bad. They will get rid of you in seconds.  Someone told me they're very difficult and pick whom they want to continue or get sacked.  I should've listen to other people when they told me it's a rubbish company lol. Plus canteen prices  are expensive and favoursim other staff over is very sad to be honest. They got rid of me when I did a good role play, and they will try to find excuses to get rid of you. The best part was training."
bad,on my opinion Convergys may sound great on advertisements and all but once you get there the experience is totally different just to some it up it was just horrible.
bad,You can do well at this company depending on the manager you get.  Some managers are extremely horrible.  I would still be with the company if not for the last manager I had.  He was out to get anyone who did well.
bad,"Working for Concentrix started out amazing. The teachers and the training provided were phenomenal. However the minute you are done training and finally out on the floor, the pressure and the stress is unbearable. Constant pressure to take as many calls as possible, if you weren't getting calls done in minutes, you were spoken to. This is technical support, and a week out of training you were expected to resolve every call within 10 minutes or less. If a call takes over your break, youre still entitled to it, however the onus was set that you really shouldn't and just keep taking calls. If you wanted your break without looks and eye rolls, you should have resolved your call quicker. Managers were never understanding and if you needed a sick day WITH a doctors note, they still acted like you just bailed on work. Terrible TERRIBLE environment, company and mangers."
bad,"I currently work here and I am frantically looking for new work.  At first this place seems great you move up fast and get raises with that and when you start a new role you get a good schedule.  That all ends"
bad,"Training was a blast and got on really well with the people I was with in training. That's where the pros end. Training never taught you how to use the systems so during your first proper working week, you were thrown in the deep end and had to learn the systems as you went along from other colleagues. Management and TL say no phones are allowed yet they sit on Facebook all day. Very unprofessional place to work"
bad,"Ripped me off my hours sometimes. They don't care about your health. Point system is VERY stupid. So, even if you had a doctor's note, still get a point. They don't take superior calls. they don't care about your schooling or if you had another job. they just don't work with you with anything. I'm not sure if anyone else is experiencing this, but the managers at Anthem is not organized."
bad,Gewoon niet doen. Bedrijf doet maar wat ze willen zonder enkel respect voor het privéleven. Wordt ingeroosterd wanneer ze maar willen dat je werkt en kan niet over onderhandeld worden. Verder hele leuke collega's maar daar stopt het dan ook.
bad,It was basically kids straight out of high school or in college. The cubicles were all torn up. Everything was dirty. When you came in for your shift you had to wait for a desk to open up and if one didn't you were considered tardy.
bad,Very unorganized and hours are horrible. HR person Ariane is probably the worst never reponds to emails once you leave the company regarding recieving 4% and i still havent recieved it and i quit 6 months ago. Also alot of pay issues almost every pay. Horrible job! I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone. Clients are horrible aswell and are very rude.
bad,If you can fog a mirror you will be hired. During my time there I witnessed 4 physical fights. Went on lock down twice for gun related issues. Management had physical fights on several occasions and had to be walked out of the building but returned following day.
bad,"Depending on the contract, this company could be a good start to come in many cities. Their managing are not really helpful. Insecurity of work, like every callcenter."
bad,"Although the pay was decent, the environment was the most unprofessional and the management and higher ups were a joke. The girls were petty and created so much drama in training and it got physical couple of times with one girl actually spitting on someone else and the trainer did nothing but give them a slap on the wrist when they should have immediately been fired. People would leave on breaks and smoke weed and when we would come back in the office you could smell it and yet nothing was done. You expect people of higher authority to present themselves as such, yet I saw several female higher ups dressed in mini dresses, hair not even brushed, smelling like cigarette smoke, and dirty tennis shoes, and it almost felt like high school."
bad,Management told me to follow 3 different secdules when I was confused about what days off I had they terminated me even after admitting I was inconcinstently told about changes they determined that the fault wasn't theirs
bad,"Convergys at Watertown - for what I was doing, at least - is ""support"" in the way magicians are ""magic."" Customers call in to get assistance or information with something related to their account, and while its resolution is a key focus of the CSR, they also have to up-sell products, services, and overall prolong the interaction in the name of marketing as opposed to ensuring the most thorough solution for the customer. And this is mandated with quotas which are enforced by a management team that does not interact with the customers, and therefore cannot speak to the effect of how to handle them in an intuitive way per the nuances of any given call. They are smart manipulators and can teach you conversation tactics and how to dodge questions, like the customer is a foe to be conquered with sales, but they care not in terms of acting with integrity or long-term rapport and reputation. Because it is easier to lose a customer and lock-in a new, unsuspecting one with an ETF-insured contract than it is to actually support customers and retain them. Sales > Morals. This is obvious for business, but don't work here if you have pride or shame. You'll dread every day."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,it's a place to work that will allow you to get a check. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone unless you're really looking for a way to pay your bills and make a living for yourself and/or family.
bad,"Worst job I have ever had. Management are no help whatsoever. Toxic, sales at all cost environment.  I would not recommend to my worst enemy. Training is abhorrent."
bad,"This is a good opportunity job for someone just starting out in the work field. An opportunity for a young individual to learn how to work for a company that can teach the ""suit and tie"" aspects of a company ."
bad,"Wanted too much but not willing to pay, hours change every 90 days, not really a chance to advance, its like a big high school, work on point system, my tl was great but the company overall sucks"
bad,When I stated at Convergys it was very nice but as the time passed you just seen things a little different. Everything was very disorganized sometimes the employee themselves didn't even know what promotions where going on due to the management.
bad,"* A typical day of work is taking one call after the other for 8 hours and having a total of 1 hour of unpayed breaks. Mind-numbing."
bad,"liked having  4 10 hour days, supervisor did try to have fun things to do to get to know each other, had a security guard at front employee door, so not just anyone could walk in"
bad,"Customers call in for help. You're forced to push DirecTV promotions onto them. The software they use is very outdated and difficult. There's no demo version of some of the back-end technical programs, and so you're supposed to learn them out of training on the fly - which is very difficult to do when you've got an angry customer yelling at you. Supervisors push you to NEVER transfer a customer to a manager or someone who can help them if you cannot."
bad,"The idea of convergys as a whole is great. However, there is no rhyme or reason to their choices when they pick employees. In my class alone, a umber of people were fired quickly and some of them tried to physically attack employers for the termination."
bad,"Do not know where to start, you never get paid correctly, bonus always removed for any given reason, docked pay if you need to go to the toilet, Managers who have no clue as to what they are doing, Massive mobile phone fraud on upgrades department, if your not Irish you have no chance"
bad,More help with new products would have been better than a 2 day training . We literally had to handle everything ourselves and going for help better be your last resort
bad,"terrible hours, high turn over rate, they make it really hard to book days off, management does not care about the staff. late hours, no solid schedule"
bad,"stressful and it seems like no one in management staff cares about the lower workers, kept juggling us between contracts when one would pull out, very stressful"
bad,The manger  shouldn’t be manger they are rude an nasty  this place is full of drama.they are not  professional.this place is ghetto they don’t pay nothing but 10 run from this place theres no growth here.
bad,"If you enjoy feeling overworked and like a robot where corporate pretends to seem to care about you while simultaneously forcing overtime and paying you a portion of what you're actually worth, this is the job for you!"
bad,"Poor management, unprofessional coworkers, bad working environment, forced overtime, inflexible hours, underpaid for position, company has questionable practices in how it deals with its contracts with its customers. The place is basically a meat grinder for employees, gaining them as fast as they lose them. DO NOT WORK HERE, it is not worth it."
bad,"They are constantly changing policies without informing people properly. They also don't offer many advancement opportunities. The people aren't really friendly either. The person who conducted my interview did not make me feel comfortable working there, they were very unfriendly during the interview and when i would respond to a question asked, they would cut me off."
bad,Concentrix is a very low pay job with zero raises or chance for advancement. It is a very slow paced environment with very little incentive to be successful.
bad,"Typical day at work involved high call volumes"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"You gain vacation hours for each 5 years you work there, as far as co workers, great, management not so much. Would not refer anyone, I do not want any enemies."
bad,Help line pay is lowest in the Detroit area. Benefits are poor and expensive. Management is understanding. The problems seem to be out of their control.
bad,"This is not a stable company at all.  Management is terrible and provides no support at all. There is tremendous competition among employees and it was the worst professional experience of my career. Long hours, high stress, poor management."
bad,"Very competitive,horrible management&they constantly mess up your check or half way pay you.They are very unorganized,it took 3 weeks for me just to get a badge,its always hard to find parking,poor paced company."
bad,"Took the job at Convergys but it was arguably the most unprofessional place I have ever worked. Constant slandering of companies and colleagues from advisors and trainers, constant foul language as well as what I can only imagine would go down as  harassment from a number of colleagues towards females. The wage is okay depending what you're used too but the staff members are extremely brutal and management aren't a great deal better."
bad,was promised certain things that were not followed trough with  impossible expectations and lots of pressure. really hard to deal with the hr and management. training is through and well done but the expectations are to much for what you make hourly
bad,"Concentrix was a nice place to work at first but then it was unfavorable. You are not paid correctly, very unorganized, management is unprofessional. They care more about the client than their employees! Horrible company!"
bad,"No matter how hard you tried, you could never reach the goals that were presented in order to get your full commissions.  Even if you did manage to meet a target one week, they would change the target to an even higher number.  You were nothing but a number to the corporate machine even if you had a great manager.  Managers would change regularly as well, so you never knew what was coming at work."
bad,The management do not care for the employees and they just want us to work like buffalo's. They just want the outcome from employees and they least bothered about our problems.
bad,"Interviews were conducted over the phone. Which would explain why so many rude, ignorant,  unprofessional people are hired there. It's like being in high school."
bad,"Some of the management there are great. Some. Their policies are absolutely ridiculous. They also do not have a conversation with you about any issues regarding your performance. Instead, they wait until two days before your 90 day probation period is over and then fire you. Oh, and this is after they've requested you provide medical documentation for them, which you gladly provide. Work on your managing skills and maybe you won't have a new training class starting once a week."
bad,"For those who want a casual work environment and casual dress, this is for you. Also ideal for those who have severe weight issues and would have difficulty getting a job in the outside world, then a call centre is for you. You have 2weeks intensive training, then on the 3rd week, you are sent out on the floor with no real systems training. There is a lot of training that is totally irrelevant for when you go on the floor. The systems are quite difficult and for some advisors, it can take up to a month to know it! Once they show you the system, you are expected to know it as soon as and when you ask for help, you are told that you have been shown it so many times and now should know it.. . .There is a culture of telling on your fellow worker for any misdemeanours. The breaks are very short 2 x 15 mins and one 30 min for lunch. It’s long hours in front of a screen, so I can imagine back problems and eye strain issues. The canteen is disgusting as people don’t clear up after themselves. A very multi racial community and they have male and female prayer rooms for the Muslim community. Also unclear is the commission structure which they are very vague about. If you are looking for a stop gap for a short period, then this could help temporarily but not ideal for a long term career, too rigid and long hours! Also chance of catching coughs and colds as no windows open! A lot of the staff look like they have had the life sucked out of them,!"
bad,"At first I thought that I was really going to like work with this company the is ok as well as the benefits. The work environment although I work from home is extremely stressful. All the management except one that I had are MEAN and full of attitude. Working customer service is stressful enough but having to deal with MEAN, Managers with attitude, and no professionalism at all makes working at concentrix a nightmare. If you are not a tech person you certainly want to stay away concentrix is a company that have vendors that they perform customer support for and I wonder if these companies know what type of management they hire. Maybe they do and just do not care because they are getting the job done. I will not refer not one more person to work with this company."
bad,"Se gostas de ser tratado com condescendência por clientes, superiores hierárquicos e colegas;"
bad,"Honestly worst place i’ve ever worked."
bad,The environment was very loud and unprofessional. Would often have customers complain about the background noise. Very Stressful and pressuring management and monthly sale requirements. Building issues including mites/bugs.
bad,"No job security, asking senior staff about status of contracts, and getting no response at all.  Then all of a sudden, people were getting brought into disciplinary meetings and dismissed for no apparent reason.  Any appeals were heard by staff from a different contract who hadn't a clue about the systems/procedures in place.  Managers more concerned about meeting their targets than caring about any problems staff had."
bad,"They did not train properly, poor management, they have a strict policy. They did not have properly cttained managers. They don’t have a work/life balance."
bad,Not worth the money or stress. The atmosphere isn't how you would expect and the employees are lazy. Nobody likes to do their jobs. It's ttoo much of a demand and pressure on us for little pay.
bad,"If you came to work in a call center thats the job you're going to get. It's 40 hours a week every week, if you aren't willing to make that commitment it isn't the job for you. Hours are not flexible. If you are starting the job and you need certain days off, even if they are months away let them know in the interview. If you mess up you will be fired, don't do anything you shouldn't."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Training was unhelpful, and getting additional training on the floor would be impossible. Management was very rude and you would have daily, weekly, monthly quotas you would have to reach and if you could not meet these requirements you would get written up."
bad,"The advisor position itself is great, training was not complete and management needed reconstruction. They are a full description of Quid Pro Quo voliation."
bad,I have worked at Concentrix for 6 months dealing with the United States and their Problems with their Cars that i'm pretty sure if they actually put their brain cells together they would be able to figure out their own Problems.
bad,"Their project oriented company putting their employees into different projects on site, They do not pay the same wage across the projects but all the employees are convergys employees. "
bad,they were sued for not paying employees right. no real training. managers are horrible. they layoff managers all the time without notice. never trained well.
bad,The company does not care about keep its employees happy. they only care about the money they are making. Stressful job for minimum wage. would not recommend
bad,"The overall experience was informational, i was very satisfied with being able to gain as much customer service and computer experience, but the management and turnover rates are horrible."
bad,"A typical day of work at Concentrix starts off by passing one of the many swipe doors that for the most part don't work.  After you spend 25 minutes trying to find an empty desk to work at you need to sign in to the computer system as with most jobs and then open your many applications used throughout the day. The calls taken throughout the day were mostly disgruntled customers angry about being taken or scammed by onstar, which for the most part was true due to the ridiculous metrics and sales standards for the company - which if are not met, job termination can be a result. The ""sink or swim"" management style lead to general turmoil and instability in the company. The culture of the workplace was dehumanizing at best with signs and posters plastered along the walls that basically stated ""you'll never do better than this job"" and ""the client matters - but you don't"". The hardest part of the job was simply showing up - no other job had made me dread waking up in the morning as much as this one. The only enjoyable part was leaving at the end of the day."
bad,the training class was great ....but on the sales floor was a diifferent story .i love helping people ...however on the phone was hard ...because i couldnt call them back if we loss connection for example ...i felt bad about taken advantage of costumers and not giving them more options unless they asked for it...
bad,"On getting this job, you are filled with the hope of getting extra cash on top of you wage that never actually comes. Always a problem with commission payments."
bad,"It seems very nice at first but Team Leads get annoyed when you have a valid question, they focus way too much on making sales. you will get burnt out very quickly and become very irritated with the entire call center."
bad,You have to have a doctor's note to go to the restroom. Very uncomfortable and stressful working environment. I would not suggest anyone work here ever. I did not feel safe.
bad,I worked for concentrix for less than a year the pay was subpar to other call centres in the area and there is no work life balance your shift is set for 3 months unless you move to a new department and then only your exam scores and tenure are counted towards the next shift bid I loved working with my coworkers and team leads but the management only gave political answers and often flip flopped on what was actually happening
bad,Was fun and great experience to build customer service but they did close down the company cause their wasn't enough mangers to maintain the work site.
bad,"Everything in this company comes down to business needs. If you need to trade a shift with someone that has 20 less seniority than yourself, you must check with each person in the middle. If they want the shift instead, you are stuck with the lesser shift that you did not even want. Management will take very long to assist you with any scheduling, no matter how much advance notice (although that's if they even help you). Only one paid break per shift with a mandatory extended hour of work. Least amount of pay per any call center in the area. Benefits kick in after 6 months which is nice, but no dental until one year. QA is horrible and will not provide any feedback for calls unless it's resulting in a fine for the company."
bad,"Apesar de bem localizada e contar com uma infraestrutura interna de qualidade para o tipo de serviço, os sistemas internos funcionavam de maneira péssima: caíam de forma intermitente, obrigando o funcionário que presta atendimento a ""se virar"", literalmente. Nada de errado em uma situação normal -- imprevistos acontecem --, mas, durante meus quase oito meses na empresa, isso se tornou rotina. Atender clientes já é um trabalho cansativo e esses problemas só pioravam as coisas, pois, com o sistema ruim, o atendimento atrasava, os clientes ficavam na fila e já chegavam em linha prestes a explodir. Infelizmente isso foi piorando ao longo do tempo, pois houve uma série de cortes de gastos e demissões, o que deixou o ambiente de trabalho insustentável para muitos -- e a maioria não dura um ano lá; saí por vontade própria porque já estava me fazendo mal ficar lá, mas era questão de tempo me demitirem. Como dependemos da avaliação dos clientes, muitas vezes não adiantava fazer um serviço de qualidade. O cliente pode dar nota 10 para você e dizer que ficou insatisfeito com a empresa. Pronto, sua nota 10 não valeu para nada. Ou você faz tudo certo e recebe a pior nota possível porque não fez o milagre que o cliente queria. Sempre arrumam um ""ponto de melhoria"" na sua atuação. Sempre você poderia ter feito mais para reverter o jogo. É cruel."
bad,Hate the hours at this job and the point system they don't care about the employees of gas money and I took of the benefits and school for me to get a chance or get or get or get I think bout to go where you can get a table for me to
bad,"The company sucks! It's the worst job that i have ever held and I've worked for multiple fast food places. The typical day starts with no managers to assist, so you are on your own until one comes in. Then because they are COMPLETELY only focused on sales of Direct Tv and nothing else (I.E customers) they are always down your throat no matter how hard you try to sell. They don't understand that the customers are calling in for tech support or billing issues, and ect. ,not to listen to their (the company's) 5-10 minute speech for Direct TV. Even if you do make sales/ sale goals, it is never enough they will always push for more. Now i under stand they are out to make money but helping the customer should always be first concern, and it isn't.  you are timed for the entire call and if you don't verify, open account, find out the problem, fix the problem, answer any questions, and try to make a sale within the 5 minutes they give you, they start screaming at you for being on the phone too long. When you do make the sale you don't get the compensation until 2 months later which is their ploy to keep people there.If you do leave before then you lose the sale/ compensation, which is completely unacceptable. They say full time is your position but they cut hours all the time with no notice. Management just depends on who you get but most don't care and don't support or assist their teams."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"The job was work from home pilot program. There was issues with the systems, poor training and new managers with NO experience. I'm sure with time the conditions will improve."
bad,"No help from management, literally was called incompetent to my face for a manager override call.  Empty promises.  Never allowed to use your UTO or PTO."
bad,"Management had to much personal problems. The pay was good, but you were just a number and they would always push you to upgrade customers plans. The customers were a lot of the time calling in to complain."
bad,"A horrible place to work unless you are just starting out in the call center business.  The only good benefit was the free Directv I got for working there.  The good coaches all left or got fired.  You can get a good bonus if you achieve your goals, but so many people are dishonest with customers to achieve these goals it makes you look bad if you try to do it the right way.  If you want to move up to a higher position you get no bonus with little to no pay increase.  And the call center area itself is like a dark dungeon with roach sightings a common thing."
bad,"I am expected to sell sell sell.  I don't feel that I am appreciated.  HR department is not really there for you.  They do not appreciate the employees as people, I am just a number to them"
bad,"This is the kind of job that has to give out bonuses for attendance, because the job it so horrid, that people just don't show up. The pay is abismal, even if you work on one of the higher paying contracts. They wave bonuses in your face that are very difficult to obtain, because they usually have to do with creating good customer experience, but they won't give you enough time to actually follow up with that. As mentioned in the title, this job is extremely hard to show up to, there are days where an entire row of people aren't in, the management is often times not in either. Convergys seems to me to be a place where they make it extremely difficult to obtain the information you need on purpose. The health coverage is nice, but you have to pay upfront, so I am unable to use it, as I am not making enough money to balance bills and debt, while still having enough to go and get my eyes checked."
bad,"The job was decent for the most part. The managers, if you got in good with them long enough, would do their best to make sure you did well there. The pay was alright. The turnover rate though was incredible. There was always a new training class coming out onto the call floor every week. Also there was always a job fair type thing going on in the lobby. Over 100 people would come in for a job and only 20 get put in the class for training. Everyone else had to apply and interview again."
bad,"I have worked for the company twice.  First in the late 90s and second recently.  They did try and improve the conditions for work, but at the end of the day, it is still a outsourced type of job.  A typical work day was people peved that their beloved TV did not work and blamed everyone else for their problems.  I learned to have lots of patients and that there are better jobs out there.  The local management team was pretty good.  They all were nice and could accommodate most things.  The client they had at the site though is not my favorite company in the world.  The most enjoyable part of the job is when the day was done."
bad,"Turn over rate there was something i have never experienced befor. New faces every day i would see once or twice and then never again. People would be terminated quite often and you never felt your job was secure. Had me and coworkers on pins and needles constantly. Job attrition was extremely high for management. I think i seen 1, maby 2 people get true promotions to management while i was there (5 years). Many are gone. If you can get on a day shift great. If not, the hours are hard to deal with. You cant have cell phones at your desk, or smart watches, paper, pens, magazines, wallet or purse, food, ect. You must be able to deal with sales there and deal with --extreme pressure to sell-- by your managers. Not to mention take the feedback from angry customers who do not appreciate the sales pitch, let alone their original reason for calling in!!! Jobs good for quick cash i suppose. Dont expect anything good long term in regards to pay or job satisfaction. Seen multiple grown adults break down at that place. Paid training there was great and lots of fun. Full time hours was good. Many other internal company jobs were moved overseas such as payroll, scheduling, ect, which i'm not a fan of. My recommendation; take this job if you really need it and if you can handle it. do not get your hopes up or expect anything good. Look for a better job while you work there, don't waste your time."
bad,"After working there for so long, I made one mistake and cursed on the phone due to a leg cramp and wasn't allowed to speak to HR and was essentially forced to sign release papers while emotionally distraught due to family being hospitalized. They took advantage of my state of mind being so distracted to stop me from talking to HR and went around procedures to fire me."
bad,"unless you can the handle daily stress of being yelled at by customers, and have the ability to offer products they do not need or want, to every customer that calls in, plus having to solve the issue they are calling about (which is the best part for me), and doing all this without losing your mind, I would not suggest this to anyone other than my enemies"
bad,"This company will not care about you at all.  Constant pay issues and absolutely no evidence that they are aware of what the employees do on a day to day basis.    I still work for them, but I am looking for other opportunities daily."
bad,Change is the only constant and it can become strenuous to keep up.  What was perfectly acceptable yesterday will be unacceptable tomorrow.
bad,The place you don't want to depend on for a steady pay check because you may not get paid. The most unprofessional place to work and management should start training on how to deal with people on a more professional level.
bad,"Relaxed but toxic environment"
bad,"Your only a Number, not only for concentrix but for their client too. No care or attention is paid to  the staff that need it, only the staff that are sleeping with/best friends with this managers. Care for pregnant/disabled/vulnerable staff is next to none, no risk assessments done etc. Workload at the beginning isnt too bad, but then it becomes horrendous! Teams on constant phonecalls, late workers on targets for paperwork, nasty and vile 'managers' breathing down your neck constantly. Dont get me wrong some of the team managers were absolutely fantastic, even with the pressure they were under themselves. Stay away from this company."
bad,"You must use wired headsets.  This prevents you from being able to walk around a little bit if slow.  What you learn in training depends on the trainer.  Some are excellent, others are not.  You change teams on a regular basis.  You will have some team leaders you will never want to leave and others you can not wait to move away from.  Co-workers are the same as with any company.  You have good and bad co-workers.  The hardest part is the ever changing rules for how to answer calls and working extra hard for promised bonuses only to have them removed.  For the most part, I loved my customers. As I was also a training coach I really enjoyed helping the new hires figure their way around.  Working from home was wonderful.  Pay was not good, but did have excellent benefits."
bad,"Some people have found success within this company but if you just want a steady job then you will be disappointed. This company draws you in with untold stories of success and reward in an effort to big up the job role to new starters. The benefits outside of work seem fantastic but when it comes to the job itself, you are never quite secure. While I was working at Convergys, I saw hundreds of people coming into the job almost weekly with happy faces and leaving a few weeks later looking deflated while longstanding employees we're let go without a second breath. Convergys law is quite literally take no prisoners and give no mercy to either the customer nor the employee. You'd better just look at the 14k basic as all you can get because if you don't try hard enough, then you don't get paid commission and you get a written discussion from the managers. You try hard, and you might still not get paid your commission and possibly get a written discussion. Even when you’re well over target, something small other than quality can remove your commission. From their lack of reward and empathy, they have lost alot of their best salesmen to more deserving companies who wouldn't return for a pay rise."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Easy place to work in. Customers are nice at times. Management is not up to part, there is no flexible schedule. But besides that Not so bad of a place to be."
bad,"a typical day at work, you dread. I don't think anyone EVER wants to be there. they teach you something and then change their minds the next day about how they want things done and then YOU get in trouble about doing it how they taught you in the first place. management is a bunch of losers that just can't get a better job. the hardest part of the job is actually wanting to show up. and the most enjoyable part of the job is the cafe downstairs! oh and training isn't half bad. they tell you what you want to hear to get you to work there and then screw you over in any way they can."
bad,Never again will i step foot back in the place. Management are sectarian bullies. You get into trouble for nothing and in my case get bullied out of your job for your religion. Unless you're riding one of the managers you're wasting your time.
bad,Messed up company with no room for advancement if you don't suck up to management. Multiple team leaders that decide to constantly change or add to an already overwhelming work load for very little pay. Micromanagement is the key phrase used by almost all the employees to describe the work environment. They will sabotage your pay when you start. Performance is decided upon purely by metrics rather than job. You can get 100% on all tests and still be told you are not good enough. They will also deliberately skew your metrics by tightening them until you cannot raise them as a way to get rid of people that even suggest the pay is not adequate for all the headaches.
bad,All of management refuses to help. There are a lot of inconsistencies with what recruiting tells you and what happens. Wvetyone in my training class was told the starting pay was $10.50 when it was really only $10 and that's all we received. They apologized for the miscommunication but that wasn't all that happened. The bonuses come at least a month after what's promised. The paychecks were never accurate I was always shorted. I had surgery and they gave me points and promised to remove them but they never did. I had a coworker in a leadership position who only got a 30 cent raise after years and years of working at Convergys. They refuse to let you go home if there are calls waiting to be answered and they will not pay you for overtime even if you were to be staying an hour past closing. They don't work with your schedule and all the managers are condescending about it. You also don't get your sales bonuses unless the customer keeps the product for at least 2 months so you will not see your bonus until that time passes. They don't give you money you earned and they lie about it
bad,"If they pay you on time it's not acurate. And management acts like lazy 7th graders."
bad,"Sign in, open all programs, pray computer is functioning properly and up to speed, troubleshoot internet connectivity problems for customers, get yelled at by people who have no idea how computers work yet own one anyway and insist any problems with the computer itself or the service they receive in a different country than your own is directly your fault, process payments for people who don't understand what a monthly fee is, calm said customers and empathize with their problems, schedule technicians for repairs, set up/close accounts, all while documenting all interactions with customers.  I learned Einstein was right: ignorance is infinite, and that some jobs you must weigh the damage on your soul with earning a living.  The management team was largely a dictatorial menace, akin to Mussolini, Stalin, or Hitler in levels of understanding, empathy, and logic.  The co-workers were the only redeeming aspect of the job, as most had high IQ's, great personalities, and had to be friendly to a fault to deal with the mostly unreasonable clientèle on a daily basis.  The hardest part of the job was feeling a piece of your soul get hacked off every time you heard the *boop* in your ear and a new customer was on the line, and all the exciting ridiculousness that followed suit to that point.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the break room repartee, and quitting the job in question."
bad,hoping to leave just cause there are another call center but they are ok bad hr but everything else is ok but i will be glad to leave no more calls
bad,"Very unorganized. During training we were taught one way, once you get out of the floor it is very different. Support takes too long to get to people when they have questions"
bad,Company is very unproffesional and have serious payroll issues. You are lucky to receive a raise or pay check on time. My experience with concentrix was nothing of what I expected from the interview. The company is unproffesional and now closing a lot of location because of payroll issues. The bigger people are stealing money as well as not making sure there employees are compensated . The turnover rate is horrible. Nobody last long here unless you are in management.
bad,"This job starts off everything with a ruse. They promise things that aren't on the table. Hours are cut but they offer over time and then they say they are closing then start hiring again. Nothing makes sense there. "
bad,"The company closed- "
bad,"Management is unqualified for their jobs. They do not live by the core values, or lead by example. They do not appreciate people that want to come in and do their jobs, they like to micro manage."
bad,"The first three weeks are great. Paid training in a classroom environment (and I loved my whole class, great camaraderie), the lessons and simulations made us feel like we were learning everything we needed to be successful call center reps, easiest $10.50/hr I ever made in my life."
bad,"Convergys has a culture of meeting their goals with the lowest possible cost, effectively creating an atmosphere of negativity with  overworked and underpaid employees just doing the bare minimum to keep their jobs.  Convergys is not competitive with other similar call centers in the area and should be avoided entirely."
bad,"Working through Convergys should have been a fun experience, but what it turned in to was a nightmare. After getting pneumonia and a promise of being worked with the company let me go and refused to give proof when told that I was speaking unfriendly words to the customer. They promote poor customer service and shove you through the system without giving you a lot of real training, just a lot of trainers talking about their day and a little bit of actual training."
bad,"Convergys has a nice environment, but only thanks to their employers. Other than that, management and supervisors do nothing to work with you. When you are sick, they will not take doctors notes. They just do not value their employees."
bad,The working environment is completely unprofessional and unorganized. the pay rate starting off was 10hr when I was working there they had just gotten a raise to 11hr. supervisors are unprofessional they only look out for employees that had longevity working there. schedules are made definitely to fit the client they don't care what goes on in your life you have to be at work at all times. There is no moving up in the company  everyone definitely stays stagnant in there positions.I would never work for Convergys again. Maybe on the blue cross and blue shield side but never for the cable companies they have there.
bad,"stressful work environment. daily abuse from customers. short breaks. little to no interaction with co-workers. you are evaluated weekly on your performance. many factors are beyond your control. pay and benefits are good, but they have to be to try and compensate for the daily stress of the job. unless you enjoy staring at a screen and being yelled at all day, do not work here."
bad,I worked here for almost 3 years so I've experienced my share of ups and downs. This place has been going down hill for the past year due to poor management and terrible shifts. The pay is terrible for having to deal with angry customers all day. The only plus is the medical benefits and the people you work with make it so you want to go in the next day.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"DON'T BELIEVE IN PAY  RAISES   nor show  appreciation for employees regardless of how long you been employed with the company  , this job is only  concern about filling a seat and hours on the  phones..  Management is a joke and only think of themselves."
bad,"Je suis parfaitement  autonome sur mon poste de travail. J'organise librement mes taches quotidiennes et hebdomadaires (répartition des évaluation, statistiques, comptes rendus de réunion, évaluations, débriefs). Je coordonne le travail des évaluateurs opérationnels dans le but de respecter les procédures liées à la norme NF (évaluations hebdomadaires / calibrages mensuels)."
bad,"They start out OK.  But they change your schedule, they will reduce your incentive pay.  I worked for them for five years.there were no perks for staying with the company. Upper management will lie to you and break promises.  My last year I was earning less than I did my first year.  I met all my sales goals and performance goals.  And I still earned less.  If you are making any kind of incentive pay they will make changes so that you earn less.  They do not care about you at all.  You are just a number to them."
bad,"The initial interview took 4 1/2 hours.  The schedule for the DirecTV project literally changed day to day and can vary any where from 15 minutes to an hour. If you are so much as 1 minute logging in late (even if it is due to the computer running slowly), you get a quarter of a point. These can add up and result in termination. The training does not even remotely cover what you will actually be doing on the floor. and you receive virtually no assistance from team leads. And the Team Leads, supervisors, and scheduling team absolutely do not respond to emails and based on my personal experience, they do not address or fix the issues that are relayed to them that need to be addressed or fixed (computer issues, system errors, application issues, time keeping, etc)."
bad,Not so happy towards the end I was told that I was going to get a .50 shift differential I never recieved it things started out great I must say I did enjoy my employment in the beginning
bad,"spread apart off days that make it difficult to accomplish anything outside of work"
bad,"Don't expect much from a work/life balance perspective. This job is about one thing and one thing only: money. In training you are told that ""we don't pay you to think."" so good luck trying to be original and inquiring into outdated policies and procedures. Leadership plays favorites and they definitely don't try to hide it."
bad,"A typical day at work is a mix of stress and relaxing. There are very strict time allotments for each task which is not always obtainable due to systems that are problematic and make it very difficult to even move the mouse!  "
bad,"A typical day at work would be spending the first 20mins of my shift trying to set up my work space because everything runs so slowly. "
bad,"I absolutely did not like Convergys at all the turn over ratio is so high I worked there for 5 months I am surprised I worked there for that long, if you are young and just trying to make some money for the moment it is a good job but as far as a career NO...it's like high school all over again."
bad,"Minacs had it's ups and downs but overall the company is a joke. You are expected to work long hours and not complain. Your first break and lunch are not paid for and you only get  one paid break in the afternoon (which I believe is against the rules). "
bad,"Low pay, no raises. Incentive/bonus system is a joke. A lot of favoritism with upper management. Computers are out of date. Chairs break all the time and are nasty along with the floors. Management always micro managing every little thing. Very unprofessional. Company doesn't care at all about their employees."
bad,"I does no good to complain or bad mouth a company, I will just say for several reasons it wasn't a good fit"
bad,"Being an outsourced worker means two things:"
bad,"Concentrix - one word: mess."
bad,Company is good for a starter job or a job that is needed to put a dollars in the pocket.  Am overqualified for this position which in turn made it less than enjoyable to be there.  Very demotivating when realizing that there is more with you the people you know versus the over qualifying skills one may have to progress and grow.
bad,"worked at Minacs. LOVED the job initially, there were multiple changes in management, no consistency. Favoritism. The HR manager at the time, the best thing I can say about her...snake!  Hire and fire at the drop of a hat. I was floor support, then the HR manager and I had a dispute, without warning, no issues at work, she fired me. Blamed it on attendance! whatever!"
bad,"Work from home job (seasonal)"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I was excited to get this job because they start you at $10 an hour and they claim you can progress really quickly. The only way to get anywhere in this company is to brown nose, make massive sales, and not tell higher ups that a TL is disrespecting you. I've been harassed every day that I worked for a week ever since I told a higher up that one of the TL's waived a flag in my face which was extremely disrespectful. They act as if resolving is the number one thing, but in actuality it is sales, tv sales. This is not a friendly company to work for and you should only apply if you are okay with people breathing down your back about sales. SALES, SALES, SALES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Everyone is miserable and never smiles, unless you are selling."
bad,"I was in the billing department and did not care for the position. Mandatory overtime was often required, which was fine but it was required on top of overtime that was voluntary. Breaks were too short and sometimes scheduled five hours in between them. As always I did enjoy my co-workers and the management team."
bad,It started off as a good job until we were placed on the call center floor.  We trained for about a month and a half and was placed on the floor for 20 days.  After 20 days we were judged based on our stats.  People who did not have the ideal stats were fired after only 20 days on the floor. The people were not given any notice; just fired after the 20 days was over at a random time.  Management doesn't care about you or your family here at this place.  The pay was low for all the pressure we took with this job. I did learn new customer service skills that I will use throughout my career.
bad,Would not be bad if they compensated fairly for the work you do.
bad,They expected you to sell at least 5 u verses a shift....the hardest of the day was always trying to please the customers and your supervisor... the most enjoyable was the .50 more and hour on the weekends
bad,convergys was the worst place i have ever worked at in my life. They dont care about their employees at all. It was so dirty there. They never cleaned the desks or vacuumed the floors. I did learn to talk to customers. Help the customers.
bad,"Out of 22 people that started training with me, 5 made it to the actual job. Everything the recruiting officer and human resources told us was complete BS. They said they would work with you on any issues that come up, just let them know. Didn't happen, they don't give a rat's a** cause they can always find someone to replace you."
bad,This company is okay to work for however the management and hr over at on star is horrible the turn over rate is crazy  they fire people left and right and there is no room for advancement if you are looking for a place to just get call center experience the this is the place other then that dont waste your time
bad,As a employee at Convergy's I would have to say the pay is good and they have plenty of overtime but this is NOT an equal opportunity for everyone! They have favorites and some can get away with what other cant! They force sales on each and everyone of us but do NOT train for sales at all they train you enough to know how to use there system but do not proovide information on the task that you are required to meet! Very unproffesional dress code and Poor Managment!
bad,This company is hands down the worse company I have ever worked for. They give no raises all the team leaders are clueless on what is going on. I would seriously use this as a last resort. For what they want you to do they pay garbage.
bad,I learned a lot from Minacs and still miss the people and the work.  Ultimately it was not the place for me.
bad,"I really disliked working here. Instead of treating you like a person, you're treated like a number. They don't care about you and will fire you just as easily as they hired you. The management constantly barks at you even if you are putting forward the sales numbers they desire. It's never enough."
bad,"in bound call center, helping customers on there choices of cell service and problems also processing payments."
bad,Agents are promoted and given more chances or more opportunity based on the supervisors personal feelings and not professional performance
bad,"The best part about this job is that its so easy, but boring. The paychecks are nice though. I liked their incentives especially the unlimited overtime. Plus it was mostly clean thanks to the custodians. I loved that we didnt really have to adhere to the dress code. Its not a professional working environment. Its just like high school. This is not the place to succeed nor does it have job security. Sometimes I think they come up with new action plans to get people out of the door. There is no floor support, so if you have a question, better fast type it in the chat room and hope someone out of 100 people will answer your question. If you need a quick and easy job to get you by through college, then this is the place."
bad,if you like a place where if you have a problem and you ask a supervisor about it and it never gets done or if you always like getting different answers from people...then you'll love that place. glad im gone.
bad,Dealing with customers on a day to day bases and making sure that all issues are taken care of. That customers are satisfied with products and service.
bad,"typical day at work includes alot of stress,not from incoming calls but from management that will not help."
bad,Boooooooo they don't care about their employees life outside of the company I had to miss physio just so I could work there
bad,i wouldnt recomend anyone to work for minacs even if it was the only company in the peel region to work at. they have no respect for anyone and there is no job security.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Working here was the worst experience I have had. Not to be unprofessional, but I was shocked at how the company operated. Middle management is non-existent and don't treat their subordinates with any respect. When I interviewed the company brings in a Manager, a Senior Team Member, and Human Resources. Human resources here is very close with ""special"" employees on certain teams and also creates a lot of gossip. The women I worked with here were very competitive to shine the most and were very manipulative. I've worked for both small and large companies and this one was something between that I have never witnessed before. Once I left and got back on solid ground I couldn't believe what I put myself through with this company and its false promises."
bad,"I worked for the RCI client in Convergys. While it is one of the better clients, the amount of actual organization of the two working together is unfathomable, mostly at the fault of Convergys. Both companies are too cheap to open up the other side of the call center floor for employees to sit and work, meaning they switched to hotel style seating, meaning that your seat is never the same. That creates a huge problem for employees that are more tenured, because they have a lot more stuff they need to keep at their desk compared to the dozens of new hires that come on the floor every other week that can steal your seat."
bad,You must pay attention to you’re work and not get caught up in the call center life. A lot of drama but that’s anywhere you go. Be careful to remember your place on the totem
bad,"If you live at home, have a pension or other income, have people skills, and don’t mind stress and unreasonable “goals”, go for it while looking for something else.."
bad,If your a person who suffers from Anxiety this is not the place for you. There are some days where calls are in que for hours and it's a never ending stream of calls with frustrated customers who are yelling and treating the advisors poorly.
bad,"I was out sick due to chronic medical issues.  They asked for doctors notes then fired me even with those. It is very frustrating for a company to ask you to go to a doctor, not provide insurance then fire you."
bad,"Direct management does the best they can, but company policies and procedures are stifling and unreasonable. Rate of pay is just above minimum wage, bonuses are unreliable."
bad,"This was and is the most toxic job environment I have ever worked in. My immediate team leaders were amazing, however their bosses were horrible. It’s a very high stress job with upper managers that don’t care about your mental health."
bad,management never assists the company only care about sales instead of customer service. issues never get resolved. management and HR do not notify you when they change your return work date when on FMLA Maternity Leave.
bad,"This company definitely has a clique. If you are not kissing up to the management or lord forbid ever stand up to them for what is ethically right; you will have a Target on your back. No matter how great you are at your job or how hard you work. They change policy everyday and terminate with no warning, even if you were not made aware of the change. Good luck working for this company."
bad,"I got termed apparently for ""having cancer too long"" and blame it on ""the system"" im still currently struggling to get back to work to the same position I had, never forget how disposable you are in this company cause they don't care at all"
bad,"Not a good place to work, no chances to advance, poor pay, limited amount of help given to agents on the phone, you are left to fend for yourself awful onsite facilities."
bad,"Shocking mess of a company, "
bad,Working at concentrix was so stressful. They will give you metrics thats hard to achieve. The management will terminate you if you made a mistake (like you place on hold the customer for a minute)even you're tenured.
bad,"Lets start with mistreatment by the company, bed bugs, shorted paychecks and much much more. This place doesnt care about employees at all and has such a high turnover rate that unemployment offices accept immediately. That also make up things to fire you. I wasted almost 2 years of my life at this place!!!"
bad,Not enough teach time the whole company attitude was rough. Everyday was a free fall. The teaching wasnt fluid learning was difficult at best I gat it my all
bad,Management is 50/50. Training goes quickly and encouraged to not seek help other than management. Gathered enough experience to use with healthcare degree but work flow is constant and stressful. Stay to yourself.
bad,"Not surprised this company has an extremely high turn over rate. Management will step all over and lie repeatedly to employees in order to keep their failing contracts. Hours are inflexible and, although paid time off is offered, it is very hard to get approved. You are only allowed to get up from your cramped desk to use the bathroom 3 times a day. Managers provide “puke bags” to sick employees and refuse to let them go home."
bad,"I recently worked at the Warren Mi site at the GM tech center. This company is a JOKE. If you are a loyal and dedicated employee do not waste your time with this company. They take their employees for granted.  They are HUGE on promoting and keeping FRAUDULENT employees. If you flirt and dress provocatively then management will love you. They are all about doing as I say and not as I do. If you are favored you dont have to follow any rules. Management has absolutely NO structure. The higher ups only care about you making them money. Not about you as a person. They refuse to work with expecting mothers or anyone with kids. Its like they expect their employees to choose their job over their families. They play around with not only your hourly but also the incentives that some of the departments can earn. They notify hourly employees last minute of changes when it comes to our paychecks. The amount of filth in this building is ridiculous. BED BUGS all over to where the state had to threaten to shut the building down if they infestation wasnt taken care of. Advisors hooking up all over the building, doing drugs on campus in the parking lot."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Good for first customer service role but bad to remain more than 6 months."
bad,"Avoid this job at all costs. Management doesnt care about you. Coworkers dont care about you. Customers dont care about you. This could be the last job in the STATE and I wouldn't work here again. Management is never there to help you, they're always outside chainsmoking or goofing around. They yell, shout, ring bells, and blow whistles while you're on the phone."
bad,I would not recommend working here. They constantly change the policies and will expect you to know them right away with no explanation. If you do not follow procedures whether you know them or not they will fire you.
bad,"Unless u are looking for a job where u feel like u are in jail, being monitored and screened daily. The campaign I was in was extremely strict. You are super micromanaged. Training was too quick and the job itself is complex. 98% of my training class did not feel ready coming out of training to perform the actual job. 80% of my training class quit the first week out of training."
bad,They will use and abuse their staff. Change the job descriptions. Management is heard talking about how they don't care about the employees they don't want to hear about problems. Accrue the PTO. It will be denied right before you are supposed to have the time off. They will try to make deals with employees and never hold up their end.
bad,This place is so unprofessional.  There are always people yelling and ringing cowbells while you’re trying to help a customer.  Customers are constantly given incorrect information.  You train for a month but still have no idea what to do when you hit the phones and if you ask a question you’re treated like an idiot.  My first experience on the sales floor the girl I was listening to was more concerned about her intimate activities with the hr manager than her job.
bad,"My TL was great, other team members of management very unprofessional. Not for adults with kids you will struggle. Changed dress code suddenly expecting employees to purchase new wardrobe"
bad,"You never know what to expect day to day. Your computer may or may not work. Supervisors do not want to take any calls. The work hours can be erratic. There will be 3 or 4 hours between your break and lunch. Many of the employees appear to be quite hostile due to the working conditions. Not a friendly place to work. "
bad,"Worked for Concentrix for over 5 years in numerous roles and management. This company had the desire to be a great company to its customers and employees but lacks the care from its executive leaders. With the newest acquisition, The company has lost all integrity and humanity. If you want a paycheck but also like being worked to death and being made into a slave with no voice then Concentrix is your place to work. If you prefer to be happy and not over worked and underpaid, look for alternative employers."
bad,"I was fairly excited to dip my toes into the call center employment field when I started working at Concentirx. Training classes are fine, the trainers are nice and the course is fairly easy, however once you're on the call center floor its almost completely different. The training course only explains the bare minimum of how to use the systems and half the time systems are crashing or do not work anyway. Speaking with any team leader was always a 50/50 chance of being ignored or helped, and if you go to them directly with an issue on a call, even if told to do so by a CAC they will become irritable. Most of the time you can locate your on floor help (CAC) in a different department chatting it up. As well as the professionalism in that place has been thrown out the window. The whole time I was working there it reminded me of highschool with all the drama and rumors. The only good thing about working at concentrix is they will guarantee you two days off in a row every week."
bad,"I have been with the company for 5+ years, every year the benefits get worse, the compensation is taken away by changing pay schedules and changing benefits. The company treats ever person like a warm body to fill a seat. The company that you are contracted to such as OnStar or GM has no choice in the treatment of the employees, which means the manager cant help you, HR is just there for show. They put on a good song and dance hosting events for employees, but it is only a distraction from Concentrix digging in your pocket to take more money when you are not looking."
bad,"Working there was a constant mash up of micromanagement and knee jerk reactions that proved to be counterproductive in the end."
bad,AS a customer service agent each and every day was different you had calls with some amazing people that understand you are just an agent trying to assist them the best you can . On the other hand you had people that were so rude and disrespectful they made some cry. as for the bosses some were there to help others were just there to collect a paycheck. when you asked for assistance they would say read the document. with a customer who has already waited for a long time on the phone before they reached and agent reading a document would not help. working at Concentrix was not a good experience and I truly hope they fix there ways and treat there people a whole lot better then they are at the moment. See when I get a job I an there for the long haul but in this case the wage you receive is not worth the stress and heartache each and everyday.
bad,"It was extremely fast paced with little to no down time in between calls. We received cases faster than we could work them, so your workload was always too much to handle. "
bad,"Coaches were there fir Power roles, not to help agents who are there custimers. QA are sad miserable people who know NOTHUNG about work culture or customer service."
bad,"Save yourself the time, management believes everyone is replaceable except themselves. A lot of people walking around on a power trip. Scary place for someone who just wants to pay their bills and not be homeless."
bad,"Overall I wouldn’t recommend this place of employment. It has so much potential to be a great place but either there’s a decided lack of will or just plain mismanagement that ruins the possibility. "
bad,"The company has too much discrimination and too much confusion with management. The job did not have any respect for their employees, but  the company would not support the employees in dealing with the issues."
bad,"I won't discourage you from applying and working for this company. Truth be told, I was hired at a time when it was so hard to find a job and I had too many bills due. For that I am thankful. In a short amount of time, I caught my bills up. That being said, management here is nothing special. Its all about who you ""know"" and how much kissing butt you're willing to do. Even the best kissers will find themselves without a job or constantly ""threatened"" to be dismissed if your metrics don't come up. The metrics is a joke, It has very little to do with you and your performance. If you pucker up however, the managers and team leads may ""promote"" you to a sneed or peer support. But don't stare down a long nose at everyone else because the truth is you're in no better position. You're sent in to do the dirty work and when that works gets beyond your scope, you're fired, demoted or leave on your own due to the same frustrations as other agents. Those frustrations are usually from lack of training, support and being talked down to worse than any kid these days would stand for. You're told the campaign ended but then you're labeled ""Terminated"" and they do it in a way to stop unemployment benefits. While I only made 10.00 per hour, there were opportunities for overtime and that was good. I managed to make at least 800-1000 every two weeks. I changed team leads twice in a three month period and the last one was horrible. She is the one they send in to ""terminate"" and she does that very well. No compassion, no insight, no smarts or wits about her, just go for the jugular is her job. I would"

bad,"A communications company with no internal communications good luck trying to get a hold of an HR person."
bad,"Mangers suck in the AMC program , your points don't never start off , its all drama there mangers are snakes never again 11.00 not worth it NEVER !!!!"
bad,"Concentrix regulations and policies are a bit much for it to be a work at home job, you can’t get sick or have anything happen in your life. You don’t get much help needed once you hit production floor and some managers are amazing and want to help where some are horrible and don’t care at all. Ok pay but the headaches and micro management (they change policies and procedures monthly)"
bad,"Everyone was friendly, but there were loud, inappropriate conversations going on constantly, even while you were on the phone. The management would talk to each other loudly across the room or stand right beside you talking and laughing while you were talking to customers, to the point where you could not hear. The entire building smells like urine, it is dingy with poor lighting. I do think the pay rate was fair for the work, and everyone did seem nice and want you to succeed, but I did not feel comfortable there and was shocked at how the management behaved on the floor."
bad,"If you truly have no intellect, aspirations, or pride, then this is certainly the place for you. The facilities are frumpy, the parking lot looks like Syria, and the work is menial & disorganized. When you walk in, you can feel the hopelessness wafting through the air. The worst thing of all, in my opinion, has to be the people. In my final months of my second stint there, there was a one-on-one brawl in the hallway due to a love triangle. The people there are just hopeless, it's what I'd imagine county jail is like. They don't care about their work, they carry themselves like undomesticated ruffians, and they are quite simply just not people you want to come into contact with on a day-to-day basis. The pay is also pathetic but, based on the work you do, they might even be overpaying which is a scary thought. Avoid this place like the plague unless you're hopeless."
bad,"management was poor, lazy and power-hungry, they believe they can walk all over you without getting in trouble, they also threaten to move you down in the compony if you have a bad call.  the hours are pretty long, they change around your schedule last minute and expect you to be okay with it, don't make any plans if you have a day off because you might end up working. Money and incentive are the only positive, if you make a decent bonus be prepared to get backflash from your coworkers, they feed off drama and spread rumors."
bad,"This company used to be Convergys. Employees come dressed to work as slobs, They do mass group hiring for all positions. Parking lot is messy. Seasona"
bad,I already fill one out apparently it diddnt get save so I'll just say if you want management  that cares you won't find it here. If you strive on stress and being in a whirlwind you'll love it
bad,"Concentrix is a easy job however if you want don't want to battle the issues of payroll not properly paying you, the lack of management skills that the managers have, and the ghetto environment then this is not the job for you. I wouldn't suggest this place of employment to anyone."
bad,"Everything is constantly changing and it feels like no one ever has a clear path as to how to implement the changes. If you apply for advancement alot of the time, the person who does t know how to copy paste will be the one who gets the position. They will use you to perform management duties when convenie t but wont give you the title and pay you deserve."
bad,Just don't bother trying to move forward in this company unless you have connections to management. The pay is not competitive at all. I loved the job I was doing and the customers were great.
bad,Convergys was not the best place to work. The turnaround there is out of this world. I lasted for about 8 months and I was the last person left from my training class by a few months.
bad,"low pay, non professional employees"
bad,"There is so many thing wrong with this establishment, when it comes to the management to employee. But more importantly the employee. Stressful environment, no real structure, poor management, little to no leadership"
bad,"This company is the worst company ever.  Concentrix should have at least 100 class action cases in the works based on how they treat employees.  Training is short,  so much information and not enough time to process.  Managers show favorites, unprofessional and only look out from themselves.  Very high turnover rate.  Firing and hiring constantly!. You have to use break time to go to the bathroom!!!!!? Seriously!!!!! Most importantly,  please pay close attention to your check.  Make sure it's correct because hours will be missing."
bad,"Management was less than sub par and a lot of drama in the workplace. Hiring employees that could not complete job tasks. Was forced out due to a reorganization in the department. I was the one chosen to be let go, even though I had the most knowledge of the programs and most tenure in position. Was given an option to find a position in same pay grade."
bad,"Out of 16 people in the class, 4 are left after getting out of training within 2 weeks. Everyone is promised great training UNTIL you get out of training and trainers refuse to help. This is a health care customer support call center. We were told SEVERAL times you have all the time in the world BECAUSE these people are old or disabled. They have nothing else to do?? This job really  is NOT what it is meant to be. The $11.50 an hour is for a reason. You do not get them starting wages and benefits with no experience what so ever other than having ""compassion"". Highly advise research before jumping on that crazy wagon"
bad,There is no room for growth and not all of the TL's treat people the way they should be treated. I am happy I left for a better paying job but I do miss my work family.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,The training was insufficient and the pay was not commensurate with the amount of knowledge and skills required.  I would not work for this company again.
bad,"So many rules and regulations!  Tethered to a desk by a headset 8 hours a day.  Abusive customer calls and then you get demoters for these calls because the customer isn't happy and there's no way you can make them happy.  Most customers are angry with the product not with you, but you suffer the demoters anyway."
bad,"Not only was this job a colossal waste of time, the energy of constantly arguing with customers and unsympathetic tones we were forced to use was the most awful feeling in the world. The pay was next to nothing ($10 and hour) and the management was unsympathetic. Under constant THREAT of getting written up or fired, this was my least favorite jobs I've ever had."
bad,Management tries to come up with new rules and regulations that end up contradicting them. The systems are always down. And they always try to find some way to cheat you out out of your hours/money
bad,Concentrix is a job you get when you just need a job. They do not care about their employees. They do not offer cometitive pay. The management is poor and it's very boring the moral is poor.
bad,"It was my first call center job. I started when they first opened up The management was not bad, but having to read a 45 min script without interruption was hard. It was like any other starting company trying to figure it out.  Not only that it was up to the employees in the company to keep the clients happy and continuing to do work with the company. The scary thing is that it is not guaranteed to keep clients."
bad,"The company was not friendly and not trusting of employees.  Did not properly train the employees. I was left to fend for myself on many occasions. This company was so shrouded, an employee has no access to HR or any other dept., just a team manager who is already bogged down with work."
bad,"Working here was like going back to highschool, drama and extra stuff everyday and you barely get any work done. Customers were always rude and never cooperated I ahted this job,"
bad,"If you need money really quick they are always desperate to hire people. They spend more money in to training new hires who aren't guaranteed to stay, rather than trying to keep people who have been there for years."
bad,"I would look for a job elsewhere if I were you. Even though they have computers you can use on your break, or ping pong table in the break room/cafeteria that you can use. Earning paid time off, company provided meals from time to time. It does not make up for the fact that working here is very stressful."
bad,"Management are terrible not aporoachable at all. Staff slagging other agents. Management harrassing you when you of due to beaverment leave saying when you’re coming back. "
bad,"Training classes start each week? What training? All you hear is sell, sell, sell, but don't teach the systems. You're on your own, no direction. BAD!"
bad,"I was with one company for many years, and when Concentrix took over it became way worse. No privacy, if you took anything on the production floor it had to be in a clear bag. Coaching went downhill, unless they wanted to talk about what you were doing wrong. There was no way to express frustrations with the job, as it was just brushed off by saying the client is looking into it, or we only care what you guys are doing. Became too stressful."
bad,"Convergys has many things that needs to be worked on through this account. First, the pay and benefits are insulting for the amount of work. The company throws out cash, prizes and food as a way to motivate the ones who abuse the system and try to keep the current employees from leaving. Extreme high turnover. You have to cheat to get rewarded and if you abide by the program which the matrixes the management uses see all of these stats, your chances of being rewarded are slim to none. Management also plays favorites for the ones they like. Convergys constantly tells us that Apple only cares about the experiences but not so when it comes to your bonuses, promotions and couching sessions (1 on 1 which your team lead, which basically getting chewed out on every bad call you had and none of the good calls you had). When it comes to your chance of promotions, they love to pull out all the stats (which everything is recorded and reviewed) to use against you. Never a good job comment. Customer surveys are sent to every call you take and whether customers are honest or not, use it against you in some way. I would not recommend working for this company unless you need something else to find while working here. You will begin to see a HUGE contradiction in this place. If your not management, you are not safe because after 8 failed reviews, they let you go anyways. Work hours is 10 hrs for an actual 8 hr position."
bad,"Team leaders all having you doing things different and if they change your team lead you get written up for doing things the way the old TL use to do them. Leadership fails their employees in every shape way and form, they need to clean house all the way up the ladder!!"
bad,Been working for Convergys for 3 month! Everything was going well until there was few changes in the team that resulted in few members of the team to be constantly picked on and basically abused for not meeting their targets! Problems with getting paid and they do everything not to pay you.
bad,"Convergys for me at first was a nervous place to work, as any job starts off to be. Once I was comfortable with not only the environment but the people and the job I was actually doiing I was perfect at being a retention specialist for At&t and DirecTv. One thing about convergys and At&t, At&t means AT THIS TIME. Literally overnight things can be changed to something totally different what you were use to. Trying to adapt to change was something I had to become us to. I was good at my job and received very big bonuses. The $$ is there in the company, just have to work very hard. I eventually moved to a form of management for 1 1/2 years several roles. Convergys reached their breaking point with me with the job started to wear on me emotionally and eventually physically. Coming to a job where as a retention specialist being cursed at, yelled at (by customers 90% because I was manager) I dealt with it a lot but, im human and can only deal with only so much. I would get sick 2-3 a month and it just was working. Just because I was good at my job didnt mean I liked it.  I did love the people I worked with some I became really close with and will never lose touch with, thats one thing I will say that kept me going. The positive people at convergys and the fun we had. If you work here be prepared to be stressed."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Never met my managers yes there's multiple. They switch you to different teams is what they all it. Degrade instead of assist when help is needed. I was always told I'm doing a great job but yet my manager would always email me about firing me so I was totally confused. Very loud every where I went .did not like it at all
bad,Very poorly run company and treat their staff horribly. Never let you have the time off you need and doesn't approved of medical leave of absence. Stressful place and i would never recommend anyone work there
bad,"Everything about the environment at Convergys is negative, from the coaching methods used by team leaders which is more comparable to bullying than leadership, to the disorganized and chaotic structure of the company."
bad,"I would recommend because they hire anyone so if they need a job yes, but not for a career.  At least not with the experience that I had.  Management especially site manager was back stabbing, and confidence is not something that they know anything about.  You go to management with a problem, and all of management, site leader and other employees know about it."
bad,If your taking calls at the center than you would be required to maintain a level of patience even a parent didn't know existed. Most calls are unhappy clients. You may deal with a few satisfied customers through out the day. But that's only after you have spoken with them.  I would not recommend anyone passionate or outspoken to work here. It really takes someone with the ability to tune out and turn off there emotions. The management staff for the most part have teams that are required to compete against each other which creates animosity between employees. It is not a unified environment working together for one cause. There are some dedicated and proficient members of management there as well. And some very questionable persons of authority. I have seen blatant disregard for compassion and human nature. I have seen abuse of authority on levels that were shameful. Many complaints were filed against particular management and still it continues. I honestly felt that the staff just got used to this behavior after time.
bad,"Overall ok company to work for without the office politics being played. Supervisors were allowed to lie and harass employees at their whim. HR supported them regardless of the truth. I worked there for 6 years and was constantly being harassed by a supervisor who I assumed was pretty cool, that is until her advances went denied. All MESSl broke loose from there. Be careful, she may still work there."
bad,"Although it is known that you have to adapt to your environment, and constant changes, at Concentrix nothing ever seemed to be concrete. The management is very disorganized, and there's a lack of communication from HR to Senior Managers, Senior managers to team leads, and from team leads to advisors. it seems they sell you a dream, and provide a nightmare when you're hired. the cleanliness is below standard. there's about 2 janitors for the week, and it seems their jobs are neglected at times. from odd smells in the hallways, to menstrual blood on toilet seats, I constantly came to find the janitors either just walking around, or conversing with other coworkers or on the phone. There are shift bids every 3 months, which i was not very fond of, as you have to rearrange your plans and life around your new schedule after such a short time. It also seemed we had issues with our system and computers daily.this prohibited me from performing my job as needed, because our resources were not available, causing our customers to become frustrated. In my time there, i was also given different answers from anyone i asked on one question. it seems no one is certain of the info they give you, because you'll receive a completely different answer from the next person. with all the disorganization and miscommunication, tension was always present on the floor, which sometimes made things uncomfortable. I also experienced employees ignorance and lack of knowledge of their own expertise, so it was hard to find someone to depend on and i often found myself learning new things on my own. i was told"
bad,"Honestly, they move you around and your schedule all around, on 12 hour notices. They say they work with your school, ""just bring in your school schedule"" then you get everything set in place and they  change your work schedule and just don't care. Just remember MONEY is more important then the employees and the members on what ever contract. I get that the money is important , but to change everything about an employees schooling to the point where they may not be able to go, and make it almost impossible to try and explain why you cant do this, because they don't tell you about it until the day before. This is a good job for someone with out kids, school, another job, and okay with schedule changes like crazy."
bad,"There are never enough people to do the amount of work that has to be done.  Projects are tough to manage.  But, there is a culture of doing a good job and getting it right the first time, which I appreciated."
bad,"Ghetto!!!Never an dress code, even with signs posted throughout the building...HR hires anyone as along as the seats are filled with agents  the company makes money..Do not care about employees that are commited."
bad,"There is no grace period for being late. The staff are composed of Agents that went through training with us, so they are just as likely to steal or not handle the workday properly. There is a lot of favoritism. You can only clock in 5 mins early. if you miss a day for being sick it will not be counted only if its consecutive days with docs note. Also if the Team Leaders or staff does not like you, they can choose not to change something and lie about not changing it. Most of the computers are not working. The system is always messing up.the bathroom is 2-3 mins away (if you walk fast) because the bathroom on the production floor is broken. also that time you spend away from  your phone (bathroom breaks) is lowering your score to be better. So drink less. Can't keep the same locker overnight. Cars were being broken into, tires were being slashed and my purse and phone still isn't found after I lost my locker key. They wont pull the Security cameras to see if someone stole it. But they pulled the camera when someone's phone was stolen. They fingerprinted over the 90 day period, not on the first day or the day we did the interview. Not enough supervision for the Team Leaders or the Agents."
bad,Moderate work environment with young and active people. The company will give good experience to new graduates and build good cooperative skills for working in such atmosphere
bad,"This is the absolute worst company to work for. Management is not dependable or trustworthy. It's sad you're not able to depend on & trust your management team. The environment, elevators, food vendors, security, HVAC unit is horrible."
bad,"There is not a sense that employees are appreciated for the work they do & the turnover is extremely high.  Unfortunately, you can make high salary due to sales commissions, but the environment is one of struggle & very little happiness."
bad,"I only worked here a short few months but the company didnt care about their employees, only about their customers. They were not willing to work with me about my schedule due to not having my own transportation at the time. As well as not working with other co-workers who were having issues. You were expected to show up regardless of anything going on outside of work, deaths included. The paychecks were amazing and the most I have ever made at a job but in the long run it wasnt worth all the headaches and unnecessary stress and feeling like no one could help me with work issues."
bad,"This organization (the venue where I worked) had much political corruption, backstabbing and favoritism. Working long hours in the classroom with only 30 minute lunch was taxing week after week and then they just pulled the plug on the program all in one day."
bad,Management is poorly run and does not care about employees. They have favourites and call you out in front of everyone. Lots of people have gone on medical leave due to stress.
bad,"Training was fun but we didn't have the proper tools to prepare us for the job & once we got out of nesting it was sink or swim! Management is horrible & TL's are very unprofessional & they tell you will never advance & grow with the company, you make more as an agent so basically it's not worth moving up. Plus you have no life with flex schedules! The only good thing I could say is that my former employees were super sweet & more helpful than the managers & TL's."
bad,Great place to work if you were Friendly with uper management. Or one of there puppets or messed your way to the top like most of them did.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"The company forced it's employees into pay cuts when it lost it's contract with Amazon and did not honor pay amounts as promised during transition.  The management staff continues to manipulate employees into changing departments or lose jobs with no regards to  shifts needed for those that have families."
bad,work here becomes hard for someone after training simply because the proper training is not given. people are not easy to work with & it is honestly hard to satisfy the customers of comcast because agents are not given the proper training.
bad,"answer calls from customers and offer to sell them products/services that will benefit them."
bad,They change the work hours every week. Recruiting gives you wrong information about schedule. Didn't like dealing with angry customers and work there 10 am to 7 pm.
bad,"When you go through""recruiting"" and get hired, the company tends to   lie or avoid giving a straight answer to IMPORTANT questions in the hope of getting you on board because of their need to fill vacancy due to a high turn over rate. Their point system is ridiculous, if you are noticeably sick, and miss a day, you will loose a point for that. They say you wouldn't have points against you for absence in 'extreme' circumstances. I have yet to see that extreme since even a death in your family doesn't count, or a legitimate medical appointment (not even with a doctors note). The schedules are NOT flexible, even though they use that word in one of their schedule bidding options. Team leads walk rows and breath down your back to make sure you are offering sales on each call. talk down in your ear while you are trying to listen to what the customer is saying. The thing I have a difficulty with in this employment is offering to make a sale to a customer who is obviously irate about their bill and are looking for a discount but you are supposed to try to get them to sign up for more services.  What you learn during training and transition is totally different from when you actually hit the production floor. Training  does not 100% prepare you for work life on the floor, yet the team leads get frustrated when you ask for help with something you were not taught. it is an ok job, systems are easy to learn, get commission if you hit the minimum pay out for each month. Perfect if you are single and your schedule does not matter. No work life balance. Now the site is closed on Sundays to"
bad,"Got to work at my desk 15 minutes early, logged into the system,  logged into the headsets,  took one call after another until it was time to go on break for 15 minutes, then took some more calls until my 1 hour lunch, walked to burger king, walked back 15minutes early to log back into the system to take calls and then went home unless I was asked to do some overtime on the phones. At the beginning my supervisors were singling me in not out, they were very supportive and wanted to have everyone in their team succeed, they encouraged us to strive better and better.  Then the third one came and wanted to make a lot of unethical changes.  Supervisor was singling us out and kept the people he wanted."
bad,"Almost no training for what the job entailed, even with a ""training period"" of 6 weeks."
bad,"Don't apply here . Clueless trainers , HR is clueless . The environment is run by clueless people who fire you for anything without explanation .Trainers smoke weed and encourage you to smoke as long as you spray cologne.  this company is a law suit away from shutting down . They don't pay you on time . Always issue with pay checks"
bad,"The company is good. However, not satisfying when it comes to salary, benefits and most of all it health benefits. With the stress this job is giving us, it is not giving enough salary to it's employee depending on their experience."
bad,"I was hired as a supervisor and let go within 4 days because i was not a good fit for the group so they say. The senior ops manager started the same day as we did and was given the ability to fire people he felt wasnt a good fit for no reason at all. I understand that the job was at will but i mean seriously, do we fire folks just because we simply dont like them? Where is the professionalism in that? Please dont apply, they will interview you and talk about you like a dog aftetwards."
bad,"The company provides no assistance, programs, coaching, etc to help improve job performance. The company provides customer services for other company's. Convergys is only interested in making money, not in the success of their employees. Convergys gets paid more for the people sitting in training compared to the people that are performing the job. This causes are major breakdown in the management structure and causes a very high turn over rate."
bad,The work that you do and the amount that is paid to the employee does not align. The management is more worried about themselves then the employees. The left hand does not know what the right hand is doing. The setup is poor and if it was not for the small team I currently work with I would have left a long time ago.
bad,My schedule was never steady. Smokers were given more breaks than those of us that weren't. Rules were constantly changing. I loved my team leaders and that was about the only thing I loved about the job. They will hire anybody doesn't matter how trashy you are. Most of the females there looked like they were going to the club. No room for advancement and never get a raise.
bad,I was not happy with this company do too you have some people who are like 21 and they wanna act ike the can talk down to you and then kid and joe in your face
bad,"There are hundreds of workers on the floor at a time, but no structured seating. So, every day you're working beside someone that you've never seen before. Team Leaders change weekly, and notifications are sent out by email which let you know their name. You cannot email out, so issues with your Team Leader must be done in person (only an issue if you haven't met them yet and don't know what they look like). Most chairs and desks are broken, so it's difficult to find a place to work before your shift. It can take about 20 minutes, and usually you end up settling for something that's close enough. The hours can be very long and your days off could be at opposite ends of the week. So, you could end up working 11 hour shifts for almost 2 weeks before seeing a day off. The time between calls is about 3 seconds, so there's no time to take a sip of coffee, for example, and the average call is about 45 seconds. Employees are expected to keep up to date on emails and forums between calls (again, about 3 seconds between calls). There is a substantial amount of information to read, and forum articles have a quiz at the end of each to make sure that you're absorbing the information. There is always a possibility that you're going to get an emergency call, even if you're not in that department. The turn over rate is very high, which can be depressing. Not 1 person from my training class of about 25 was still there a month after training finished. Emails were sent out from time to time saying it was too busy, so bathroom breaks wouldn't be permitted for the next x amount of time. The possibility"
bad,"Not a very professional workplace. The coaches are slightly two faced: one minute their your buddy, the next they threaten to fire you over goals or HR appropriateness. They use fear tactics and lies to get you to do what they want. HR, recruiting, and higher-ups constantly mislead you and mis-direct you. I have never been more miserable than working for Convergys and RCI, and the only reasin I haven't quit yet is that I need to pay rent."
bad,"The job itself as a customer service representative was alright. The diversity of customers you dealt with kept the job interesting. You really felt a sense of satisfaction when you resolved a customers problem.However the management is not held in such high esteem. "
bad,At Convergys I handled inbound customer complaints and conducted trouble shooting to detect the specific source  of the device malfunction
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Worked at home for Convergys.  All I can say in all honesty about this company, is that they really need to get a handle on their work at home department and how it is ran."
bad,They are too focused on selling than the customer service aspect of the job.  They say that you aren't required to sell things but in reality you are. I worked there for 7 months and it didn't get any easier as time went by.
bad,my current department assigns things to do that set our department up for failure.The company no longer values tenure and hard work like they did years ago.  The department is about to be dropped by the company we are contracted with and the upper management is doing nothing to prevent it.
bad,"-If it was a different company besides Comcast that they were hired on for, I might recommend it to others."
bad,"the schedule is constantly changing, the management is pathetic and passing the buck is a way of life around that place, and they take advantage and miss lead the customer on a regular bases"
bad,The management does not know what they are doing. Rules are changed every single day. You can ask 5 different the same question and get 5 different answers. It can be ghetto at times. Ive seen fights on the call center floor.
bad,"My experience at Convergys was terrible! I would advise no one to work there! Yes, it may be the typical call center environment. However, they make no effort to ensure a good work culture."
bad,the only good thing here is the friends you make the management is awful and there no room for a promotion and don't even ask for a raise because they are extremely CHEAP
bad,"*Call center environment"
bad,"This is a typical call center routine.  Clock into the computer after you find a seat which is not assigned to you ever.  Find your supervisor if possible, say hello to co-workers.  Keeping your job is the hardest thing about Convergys.  The most enjoyable thing aboout this job was leaving at the end of the day.  The employees were great, the customers were great, the job was great, but the executive management was not great.  They say they work with school schedules, they do not.  I learned I do not want to work in this enviroment."
bad,Bungling from one crisis to another. You are expendable there and they regularly lay people off in November then hire new unskilled people in March so their end of year numbers look better.
bad,"undependable, rude customers, lazy team leads. UGH. Good pay, garunteed hours"
bad,"In my opinion, I liked Convergys as far as my job assignment goes, but as far as the attendance policy, I didn't like it too much. Convergys went by a 12 point system, and after those 12 points, you were dismissed. The thing I didn't like was the fact that whether people were sick or dying, they were going to get points deducted for being absent or tardy regardless. Even with a doctors note."
bad,"you sign up to work one schedule then find out your working totally different hours, they add hours to your schedule when ever they feel like it (same day before you come in to work) then when you log into work thinking your on time really your late, and you get wrote up for it. if you have a family emergency with your children and they are hospitalized you will be made to make the choice between your child and your job, speaking from experience, and mind you I worked there for almost 3 years with excellent numbers one of the highest paid cause I was one of the heist producers."
bad,If you enjoy sitting on your butt all day listening to people complain than this is the job for you. If you make extra sales the customer has to keep the service over so many days(months) or you loose the incentive. Alot of promises not kept for advancement.
bad,unorganized place of work. the work is not worth the pay. There was nothing given in the trainings that were relevant to the issues that were give when the job had to be done. The trainings were rushed and not the least bit interesting.
bad,"Stressful, Noisey, Not enough training, Ridiculous expectations, Managers who refuse to accept responsibility/lend a hand"
bad,Convergys starts out great but their point system is what destroys all hopes of progressing and growing. also the opportunities to grow within the company are very rare as they just move supervisors and mangers around to different areas when a certian project chuts down.
bad,"Would take call after call of angry customers, back to back, until shift over.  I was given two ten minute breaks per day (full time) and a 30 minute lunch.  Once got in trouble for using bathroom during time not on break.  Benefits were not very good.  Attendance policy extremely strict, could not be even one second late.  When an attendance point accumulated, it did not fall off for an entire year.  Management would sometimes act condescending when coaching phone calls.  Pay was a dollar less per hour than other call centers with the same project (not outsourced to Convergys).  Opportunities for advancement were very few, and did not offer higher pay.  Supervisor staff was constantly short-handed, and help was often unavailable when needed.  Weekly pay incentives were not possible to be reached, I even confirmed this with a manager who was able to see that nobody on the entire call floor had reached even the lowest incentive grade.  Time off was limited in that you could not save it beyond one year, and management would never approve more than a few days in a row, even if you had accrued an adequate amount.  This made vacations nearly impossible for some."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I was one of the best in my class.. im not just saying that my stats were prefect  but because i missed 6 days in 9 weeks ( i was very sick the first week.. and they told me it was ok to come back that it wouldn't be used against me so of course i trusted them because you should have trust in you're employer ) I was fired after i graduated the 9 weeks,you are only allowed 4 days. there was quite a few ppl that they let go. They keep you until the end because they receive money from the government about 2000 for each ""student"" that finishes. Literally they make you come into work have a mini graduation after.. you're all excited to get out of training and then they pull you aside and fire you because it is unfair to other to not follow protocol ( BS) .. and proceed to walk you out as if you're working at some prestigious place. Very unprofessional.. their are so many classes going on at the same time. Its like a big scam they are pulling. "
bad,was a not so wonderful experience. People were un professional and not a drug free work place.
bad,"Slow sometimes, always getting yelled at not paid enough to get yelled at."
bad,"I did not have a pleasant experience at this company. The training is fast and not adequate. They have a high turn over of employees and do not see to focus on retaining of employees as they will just hire a new class of people. There is a definite communication problem between management and their employees. They do not seem to value their employee productivity and have NO pay reviews for a increase in salary. Your are pretty much stuck at the same salary despite your efforts to provide excellent customer service!! I worked for them for 2 years and was considered a long term employee, so as I mentioned they have a high turn over of staff"
bad,Everyday the workplace was filled with negative comments towards other employee's and customers. Was not a clean and enjoyable place to work at.
bad,"Half the details I was given in my interview were flat out lies. Training was a joke. I went onto the floor unprepared and didnt know basic things like using the computer systems. Management was uncaring and unwilling to help. There were constant errors with payroll, which had to be fixed on my own time. Nothing was consistent at all. Different agents were held to different guidelines and rules. Policies changed often. The work was extremely repetatve, customer very angry and often abusive. There was talk about fast advancement. This was a joke! All lies! Benefits are HORRIBLE. Insurance didnt cover anything. Management is constantly reprimanding, belittling, telling your not good enough. Management is not there to help at all. Only to kill your spirit. I have never been treated so poorly by supervisors in my life."
bad,"Take customer service calls assist customers. Somehow you have to convenience the trainer that you are worth hiring in training class if you are not a good test taker. Tests are very confusing at times and you may even be given contradictory info in class or within the programs you use yet you have to pass so many of such tests. If you are a bad test taker I doubt this job is for you. I did not pass required tests and was fired for ""this is obviously not the right time in my life to have a job!"" As said by manager who fired me in training class. I did not miss a single day or hour either."
bad,"job has AWESOME benefits, but depending on the type of person that you are, this job might not be for you. with a very nice le way of absence tracking, you pretty much have 11.75 days that you can have off without getting in trouble, but if you are like me and have to have surgery, and then you get sick. 8 of those 11.74 are used up. and then you have to make sure you never miss a day again."
bad,"Don’t bother, bonus hard to get always looking for a reason not to pay out, poor management only look after friends, easy job and great staff to work with"
bad,"Anfangs war alles super. Kollegen das arbeits Pensum und auch das Gehalt incl Provision. Mittlerweile, reiner Stress Druck und Mobbing was mich krank gemacht hat. Ich für meinen Teil bin froh, bald den Job zu wechseln."
bad,"Managment is wayside, you'll get no help if you need it. Speaking only on UHC, if they feel you're not ""connecting"" they will fire you. If you aren't ""assisting"" they'll fire you. If you so much has have an inkling of anger they'll fire you. They're very bias, you can be having just as good a conversation with someone and they'll reward the person beside you for doing less."
bad,Doivent faire des changement majeur comme la direction
bad,Amazon UK the management was poor thats all I want to say. The process was really good however the mangement was not up to the mark. My manager used to torchor me for no reason.
bad,"I didn't know what I was getting into when I got this job. It's a call center. I didn't think it'd be that bad, since I've worked in customer service for years. But no, there was mandatory overtime every single day with no real incentive. The job was so stressful to me that I had to take two LOA's within two years. I couldn't do it anymore."
bad,its an okay place just starting out as job but not for a career for the future. it is just an okay place to make money and build a resume for the begining.
bad,"The R&R in the company is very simple and easy but there is no further career improvement. If you are looking for the ambitious and meaningful job, I would not recommend this job and company."
bad,"I just want to start by saying, I'm speaking on their UHC account ONLY. I have no idea how their other accounts are running but mine was EXTREMELY unprofessional. Training is 8 weeks long and I can honestly say it was the most unorganized and unnecessary training I have EVER experienced. The trainers are very nice but oblivious to the account materials, I learned absolutely nothing about what I  would be doing on the production floor. Absolutely no assistance which is why 80% of the entire department quit.they also change your schedule multiple times without knowledge  even though it's not noted in your offer letter. I put 5 stars for job security because no matter what, they won't fire you. I had to quit to get out of that unprofessional situation.  The money wasnt even worth having to lie to people about their health insurance and  get ignored when you need help. I DO NOT RECOMMEND."
bad,I'm a new hire and my first time working in a BPO. It's fun they said. But it's okay. Got a good Manager and good teammates. It's a good management Its fun.
bad,"Ok pay, very stressful job. Training does not teach you everything you need. Was there for 7 years till the end never really felt like family or anything of the sort that is said in there. When I really needed this company it failed me. But when they can use you to develop a department they will drain you. Even off the clock."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Management was not quite on track and just get upset inbound customers calling about misunderstood information. The company was slacking in a lot of places.
bad,"Was promised Our Jobs were Secure and nothing to worry about, when the original company was bought out within a month the notices of layoffs began within 2 months the notice of site closures began."
bad,Easy but boring and ever since concentrix took over it has went down hill! They nit pick at EVERYTHING! No raises no real bonuses no overtime! Team leaders think they operation managers! If you need a job quick then go here but I wouldn't make a career out of it! They change things up and don't let you know until you get scored on your calls!
bad,"The completely inadequate training for this job made it very stressful & nearly impossible to do my job effectively. I went through 2 levels of training & both were a total JOKE. The 2nd level, which was for becoming a higher level of CSR with more expertise to deal with more complex issues, was even worse than the first. It literally consisted of us sitting in a room for 2 weeks, being expected to learn a TON of new information (on complicated health care insurance issues such as claims) by simply reading online modules for 8 hrs a day, with no instructor & no interactive learning activities."
bad,They sell you a dream at the start then it all goes down hill 8 weeks training that could be done in 3/4 weeks. No point in working here at all they don’t care about the staff all they care about is there targets there’s like 1/2 managers that actually care the rest do not care one bit! They sell you the biggest dream ever do not fall for it!
bad,"Concentrix is not a terrible place to work. I’ve worked in worse places. It’s a call center. With that said, the work environment is beyond unprofessional. Overall, the people were nice, but some of them talked about things they should of left at the door. It’s very High School. Leads are arguing with employees. Pay is very low. No way that a person could live off what they pay. Lead Management can be affective, but the three months I was there I had never seen upper management once. Training was very unorganized My class basically sat around for two days while they were trying to get logins and passwords together and getting “students” on the same page. They really need to streamline their training. All that should have been done before we arrived for our first day. No real room for advancement. To sum up if you are desperate for a job then they basically hire anyone with a pulse. Beyond that there are plenty of the same types of jobs around the Rochester area that pay better and the environment is more professional."
bad,"Relatively low-stress job, assuming you have no bills to pay. Pathetically low pay, nowhere near public transportation, which is a must considering the lousy wage. Perks are non-existence and sick-time is simply taken from your annual vacation time."
bad,Concentrix management struggles during the busy season and happily lays employees off during the off season. They make every weekend business critical and missing one day prevents any form of growth within the company.
bad,"I had technical issues every day and most of the people in training. I never received my paycheck either, and no one will get back to me about that.I feel that is poor HR"
bad,"This employer is a call center serving inbound and outbound clients for a wide range of services such as cell phone accounts, technical support and in other capacities."
bad,I hated that job that's why I wasn't there for very long. Nobody likes receiving calls to participate in surveys and I hated having to be that person calling.
bad,"do not recommend working with this company. This company overlooked me several times for higher positions when I had clearly lived up with their expectations. It seems with this company the only way to advance oneself is to butter up the best you can to the higher management.  If you are not one of the ""in crowd"" then your shot to a promotion was non existent."
bad,when I was employed there we were told about all of these policies for the client that we working for but never received any paperwork or handbook to sign to say that we know and acknowledge not even a regular Concentrix employee handbook
bad,"Expedia Berlin. Mitarbeiter machen viele außer Vertags Aufgaben. Convergys/Expedia bekommt Geld für das. Zahlt Mitarbeiter aber nicht. Mitarbeiter hat Lohn nur für Hotels Buchung. Flügtickets, Service, Autovermittlung usw Verkauf/Support macht Mitarbeiter GRATIS!!! Expedia sagt "" Wie investieren dein Lohn in modernste techniche Geräte und neue Räume"". Jeden Tag ""Moderne techniche Geräte"" haben Störungen und sehen antik aus. Mitarbeiter hat keine Rechte gegen Management, Trainers, Teamleaders. BGB und Arbeitsrecht bringen Management nur smileys."
bad,Stay well away. Worst management ever! You are thrown into the deep end since you start. A lot of staff leaving because it's so bad! They made such big promises but it was all rubbish
bad,"Never work for concentrix. It was a nightmare, the only good thing about the company was the jobs it gave the community. They hired everyone that applied that was legal to work. Their training was acceptable. However, the way you were expected to time calls, get treated terribly and without fair compensation. Many were screwed over by the company for their bonuses, many were fired without reason or fired for illegal reasons. There are many legal issues the company faced. Do not work for this company ever."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"thought it was a great company to work for until all my co workers started to disappear one by one they where getting terminated for things supervisors would tell them to do as well people would get fired for simple mistakes and these where people who had never had any verbal or written warnings on anything whatsoever anyway this place is a nightmare ,there is a reason that they pay for the training as a sign on bonus for you to come work for them. it is sad I spent two years of my life there just to be done the same way I seen my fellow friends and coworkers be done.i should have seen it coming"
bad,"intense workload on employees it would be better if the company was much more organized."
bad,A typical day starts with you trying to find a desk to work at. If you start later in the day this not easy.  Alot of the stations are not working. Then to be on time you have to log in at a desk which can take up to 20 minutes. All if this is done on your time. You are expected to take a call at your start time which can only be done was you are logged into your systems.  It is no wonder that there appears to be a high turnover rate. Alot of errors with paychecks. Great trainers and team managers but that's the only positive point l can make.
bad,"I have no problems working in that account at all. What makes it difficult is that management will just roll out policies and proceedures that will not benefit agents at all. They are not flexible with bargaining of schedule and they even denied my resignation when they promised that once there's a JO with a different company they can let go of the agent, they would plot your OTs in your schedule when it should not be. And they are using some tenured agents to be trained in a different LOB to lessen the call from that LOB and make you feel that you are promoted but that was never the case. If you want less stress, you might want to consider other BPO companies instead."
bad,Other larger comapnies made contracts with Convergys to to takenor make their calls for them but you get paid WAY less than if you worked for that company directly. I started at $10/hr and after 3.5 years I made $10.40/hr. The management is a joke and plays favorites. Horrible company.
bad,"Depending on the contract youre signed onto, you sit and take phone calls all day and be yelled at by people who dont want to pay their bills. This is a job i do not reccomend to those without the ability to work on their own with very little interference from management and very little interaction with others."
bad,A typical day at work was extremely stressful. I did learn a lot at this job and moved up to a Senior Advisor. 
bad,The client outsourced my job. I was then retrained for the same client under a different program. There was no advancement or leadership under the new program.
bad,If you have *any* other options then avoid Convergys like the plague. They push you out on the phones without sufficient training or testing and basically abandon you after a matter of days. Good pay and benefits but not worth the damage to your health and sanity.
bad,"It was a decent job to work at, it's a very fast paced environment you take a lot of calls for the insurance company. The expectations of the job are kind of high, you have to be logged into your computer and logged into all your systems and your phone within a certain time frame. The job training was kind of a joke, I didn't really learn that much and I had to rely on what little information I knew. Most of the class time consisted of just sitting there doing nothing for like 4 hours then we'd jump into something that was slightly useful and then we'd sit there again and do nothing.  There's minimal support on the floor if you have any questions about something and the floors chat to help out associates, is also a complete joke good luck getting someone to help you answer your question. If you need a supervisor GOOD LUCK getting one. Overall this job is okay."
bad,I hated this job. It is AT & T. You have to fix people's cell phone while offering different products such as internet and cable. I had selling. Sometimes you would get yelled at because of the customer's stupidity.
bad,"I can keep this short: don't go there.. Staff is treated badly, management has no clue about what they are doing, accept for one, but he can't cut it on his own."
bad,"complete inflexibility with hours and if you have kids you better have a non working spouse to take care of them. none of the supervisors know what there talking about, no courtesy between departments"
bad,"Concentrix is full of favoritism and job insecurity... Management has double standards, no room to advance.. it's easy to have your job on the line"
bad,people always cried due to the way we were treated by management and customers over the phone. It changes you as a person and not in a good way. they do nothing to support you when u cry from youre phone calls with nasty customers.
bad,"Concentrix Southfield specifically was a horrible experience. From your pay not being accurate, to actually being able to talk to your TL/ OM about it. The leadership was horrible. From talking about people on their team to just demeanor in general. The environment wasn't fun at all. I hated it. You have to work overtime to make decent money."
bad,was a difficult pllace to work. many hostile customers while your hands were tied as to how much help you could give. always pushing sales even to angry customers. they did not appreciate your hard work even though other CSRs sat around doing nothing.
bad,They view you a serial number.Will compare problems from your worklife to their personal and ridicule you and belittle any health defects or problems.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

bad,"I have worked here for a year or less. Here I learned useful skill, and you are not told how the people in your team really are when you are new. You are taught fear of the superiors and from job mistakes from the beginning and expect you to overcome the fear and be great"
bad,i had to leave company because i am a single mother and they wouldst provide me with 1st shift. i was there for about 6 months and wast getting off till 9 10 o' clock at night
bad,"Convergys is one of the biggest call center industry in our country, they only hire the best in the market so i do believe that i am one of them.  I worked with them for almost 6 months. The work environment was good and my workmates are also good. I am very eager to work always since i really love my job."
bad,"The trainers were great to work with, but felt they didn't prepare you for how the calls would be before going onto the floor.. Very stressful environment once taking calls."
bad,"Unprofessional to the highest degree, employees are allowed to come to work in his/her pajamas. Lots of favoritism, if you are not considered as part of the ""in group"" be prepared to be terminated. I in my 21 years of working never worked for such a company. I truly wouldn't even recommend this job as a place to get experience because you will get the wrong idea of how a company should operate, as well as poor experience."
bad,I have never been so stressed out in my life....My training teacher taught us one thing...Then once we got on the floor...our floor manager told us another thing....So it was like we didn't really understand what to do because we were told to do two completely different things and didn't know how or what to do in crazy situations.
bad,"I was supposed to have a license to work there and it never arrived, some friends also worked there and their finger prints never arrived on the mail. Management can be mean sometimes, and you feel overworked with not many recognition of work."
bad,"They take employer PF contribution amount from your salary,"
bad,The management are not good in doing their jobs.. Incentives were delayed at some time. The facilities are not complete. Theres no receation activity area.
bad,The work was great when you first get there but then you have to deal with all the drama people bring into the plan. The day started at 4 and it would end at 12 depending is there were enough cars made on last shift.
bad,Convergys will make promise for incentives and then the management will ignore you when you try to get those promises fulfilled. This could turn into termination over something that was the managers fault
bad,"I am working since 5 years"
bad,"I find once you work in a call centre they are all the same. Sure this call centre was okay because you got to help people with their technical issues, but for the most part, the pay is terrible and you get disrespected alot by the customers on the phone and no one seems to care. I feel I am more valuable then that and therefore will never work in a call centre again."
bad,"Work was easy, the calls made the day go by faster. However, the company barely worked around the outside life of our employees. They refused to work around child care and other incidentals. We were treated as numbers"
bad,its a good start for people who have never worked and would like to gain experience in the customer service role as well as the call centre environment
bad,I do enjoy working at convergys however with the sales experience I have £14000 is not enough money to commit myself to this company I enjoy my job however freinds i know who work in convergys hitting the targets given daily and not hitting commissions makes it a deal breaker for me.
bad,"The company it's self is great."
bad,"The company isn't a bad company, but there was a lot about the job that makes what they offer you not worth it. Lots of benefits, nice coworkers, immediate supervisors were usually good, but the overall management had a bit of a detachment issue from how bad the job could actually be. Getting blamed for the customers' problems and being expected to just take the responsibility for it is unreasonable considering you often don't work for the company you're doing service for anyway."
bad,"For a call centre that promotes in training that agents are important to the success of the company why are are agents subjected to using inadequate tools in their training process?  Constant loss of connection, freezing of Internet Explorer sessions, use of visual aids that are hard to see in a classroom, outdated hardware and software combined with a training cirriculum that doesn't flow properly doesn't make for an interesting training environment. The fact you can't take paper notes and do not have any access to training materials out of class and have to commit a lot to memory is very challenging. Chances of advancement are limited to the elite few. Everyone has to start as an agent regardless of past experiences, work experience or skill set. For a company that provides tech support for other companies they need to look at their own IT infrastructure because it's only a matter of time before Convergys experiences a cascade of technical issues within because of their lack of their own technical support team.  Great ""sales"" to get a person onboard but as an IT job the pay is below the poverty level and is not inline with the going rate for tier two IT support in Ontario. Basically it's a Mcjob."
bad,Management is incompetent and they can not keep contracts. No communication on how to do things. Was told they hire within but would not take people off phones because we are to valuable.
bad,I wouldn't recommended too many people to work at Convergys. Poor management staff low rate of pay with all stuff we have too do.
bad,"There was too much drama for a job environment. Unprofessional. I worked their a shot time due too many problems during my training class, also my training class was cut short an my class was not ready to be on the production floor."
bad,"If you're 16-20 yrs old, and/or this is your first job, you may not think it's such a bad place to work. If you've been in the job arena for any length of time you, more than likely, will have the same opinion as I. You practically have to raise your hand to go to the restroom....and I didn't even work in the call center area!  If you can stay away, I would advise that you do!"
bad,"inbound calls +100 minimum/day"
bad,"I typically enter in information from Ford and Mazda dealerships (ex. Report a sale, Certify a vehicle, Update mileage and sales dates, and Processing checks for Ford ESP Goodwill project."
bad,The job itself was easy and enjoyable. The work environment and the management was one of the worst I have ever seen. In a matter of 6 months there were over 75 people who left the company because of the work conditions and the management. I would not say Concentrix as a whole is a bad company but the management team that I worked under is horrible. I truly feel sorry for Concentrix as a company because I am not sure they are aware of the bad reputation the management team over the specific project I was working for is giving them. It was all about the money and the hours to turn in to their client and they could not keep a staff to fulfill the obligations the management team had committed to the client they were servicing.
bad,The facility was filled with old furniture and broken chairs.  Expectations were unreasonable and supervision was paltry.
bad,"Convergys hires a lot of people because their turnover rate is very high. There were more than 20 people in my new hire training class, and I graduated with less than 7. Not only do a ton of people quit, but they terminate the employees who work hard to keep their jobs, over trivial reasons."
bad,"I would go in, get on the computer, and get yelled at by angry customers about the same thing day in and day out. The management and coworkers were nice, but I didn't get to talk to them much since I was always getting yelled at. The most enjoyable part of the job was that I did get to talk to a few nice people over the phone who were reasonable."
bad,need more flexibility with scheduling due to school. would have been a great job if they were more flexible
bad,None of the managers tell you the same information. training is long and not helpful for positions.
bad,"This is a underpaid call in centre job for the most profitable company in the world. I just plain do not respect the fact you cannot afford a car to get to work from this place."
bad,Convergys was not the right work environment for me personally.
bad,"They are very hard to work around scedules. other than that, its good pay. but the calls are always back to back, no breather time."
bad,i didn't like the people or the work environment. It wasn't a great place to work.
bad,"- Filter multiple email escalations & determine priority. Contact clients to resolve issues or draft letters of resolution."
bad,"Convergy's has  by far the WORST Management team EVER! The Head Members of the Chattanooga Team are discriminate and Unprofessional! I would  not recommend this job to anyone! Chattanooga Convergys does not care for it's employees or Team members. Your name will be SLANDERED for the slightest mishap! Never need anything from Upper Management, they treat their employees like DIRT!"
bad,Convergys is more for someone who is just starting to get into the corporate business.
bad,Call center employees are set up to fail. Training is not adequate. Performance is based on statistical figures which are almost impossible to meet.
bad,"A typical work day would be to troubleshoot cable, internet, and phone services."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I honestly feel that if they were to hire team leaders and sales coaches that were actually nice and didn't get in your face for stupid reasons, then it would be a great place to work."
bad,"Was scheduled several times to work 10 days in a row with swing shifts varying from morning to night shift within the same week, night shift was shorted 1 hour due to time change-over. Did not provide remote desktop tools, poor documentation for end-users, and eventually sent all support calls overseas. Still stuck it out for 3.5 years even if the rollover was 3 months. Immediate management was sympathetic, account management was out of touch. HR was virtually non-existent."
bad,"Valuable skills to be learned here, along with valuable life lessons."
bad,"My typical day at work was on the computer, and headset helping customers."
bad,"Being harassed by Managers, sick management is horrible, been to work sick so many times because I was scared to get an investigation, schedules and shift rotas are a mess, business management doesn't care about agents, extremely high amount of work while being understaffed for months, unreasonably controlled, wouldn't recommend to anyone to start working there!"
bad,"I was hired for position as billing rep, and 2 weeks into training we were told that this site is now going to be a technical support sight only. Their not increasing your pay, tech reps get paid more than billing reps. They throw you into a crash course for technical support, you have to learn 15 new systems in 2 weeks, the training for technical support should be at least 4 weeks . Their setting you up to fail and make you look like a fool on a call. Their gonna cost their client AT&T a lot of customers."
bad,I would log in from home
bad,"I worked at the Oshawa location and dreaded going in to work each day. Management were standoffish and forget about trying to move up in the company unless you had ""friends"". Additionally, you're treated like a number...so much so that when I was let go, they didn't even know my name. Hilariously awful. Also, they didn't know WHY they were letting me go except to say that it was within my 90 day probationary period. Later discovered that they had let go quite a few people at the same time. Possible overstaffing issue. The pay was nice as a starting wage within the call centre industry but I would never consider returning to here, nor would I encourage any one I care about to apply. They can make all of the excuses they want, however I experienced the awful environment first hand and know the truth of my words."
bad,If you enjoy a call center It will be a fun place to be.  If you disagree with dumb choices by your management then you will not get along here.  The management goes by the books 100% of the time. Good luck if you choose to be here.
bad,They don’t pay extremely well and management can be draining because they don’t want to help half the time. It’s hard to get the shift you want and they are constantly changing the incentive structure which sucks.
bad,"Working at a call center is generally great for college students. They offer several different shifts that can be changed from semester to semester, tuition reimbursement for certain degree fields, and most managers are able to meet certain work accommodations easily. Advancement is difficult due to high turn over rates at the advocate level, and those at the management/staff level have usually been there for a while and don’t plan on leaving any time soon. The compensation doesn’t always match the effort put into the job. Often, hard work and going the extra mile is compensated by verbal thank you rather than monetarily (bonus, gift, raise)"
bad,The management at Concentrix is terrible which is the team lead. The team lead for Mac+ is not a good one at all. Concentrix need to pay close attention to there team leads for work at home. The one I had was not fair at all. I pray no one has him because he knows what he does is not right. The pay is good though.
bad,"Loved working there at first until I was told I was getting promoted when I didn’t get promoted. Got told I’d get promoted if I moved products, still didn’t get promoted. Watch who you trust. I had a great team leader and she was the only reason I stayed so long."
bad,not good peopel to be around  did not like the work and you would have to make a sale to be able to make more money then what you were making with out the sales
bad,"No es una buena opcion para un trabajo fijo, definitivamente"
bad,"Very ""clicky"" and not employee friendly environment to work in makes the job stressful and tense.  the Team Leads really should know the product before trying to coach a Rep with something they know nothing about.  Absolutely the worse working environment I have had the non pleasure at."
bad,"Absolutely no regard for Human Rights legislation. Unwilling to accommodate staff when needed. No work /life balance. I was a single mother with absolutely no help, they refused to accommodate my schedule to match daycare options. This is a violation of the Human Rights Code in Ontario. They would accommodate other people for various reasons that were not required to be accommodated in a accordance with human rights legislation, but would not accommodate my needs."
bad,"Place is not even in business anymore, it got bought out by another company, but when they were open, most management was horrible, not understanding at all, horribly treated employees, very stressful"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,convergys is a great place to work for a first job to start off  it wa s my first job and i was looking a a job at the moment its not a bad job just very unprofessional
bad,"I recently, and briefly worked for this company as a Seasonal CSR.  As others have pointed out, this place is extremely unprofessional! "
bad,"This job is not for everyone. Personally, I enjoyed it more my first time there than my second (this review is based on my first time). It is very cut throat and competitive. You get yelled at a lot by customers."
bad,"I don't even know where to start when you get hire by concentrix you are not working with concentrix you are working with there clients, i was working as a onstar advisor and it the worst thing i could ever do to myself they sechdule me for long late shift such as 4pm-1:30am as i specifically told management i do not drive and have no other means of getting home apart from the bus, they do not care about their employees as alot of favoritism is done by management i specifically handed in a doctors note saying i cannot work late shifts due to medical reason i even explain why and they still schedule me late hours until i was admitted in the hospital and had to stop working there. while they do pay you and overtime is top notch it is not worth it you hardly have time for yourself and its both mentally and physically draining. i aint even done i could go on and on about this place!!"
bad,"I put in just about 4 years. I worked for directv. It used to be a fun place to work with lots of incentives and really no stress. Then they pulled ACE and we were all forced to go to CLG. Then Att took over and not only did we have to try and save customers from disconnecting but we had to get them to buy cell phones and join att mobility. It was never taking care of the customer it become OFFER OFFER OFFER. I was given many opportunities when it was a nice place to work. After a few month on the phone I became floor support, then I started ojt. I was a sit in TL, and I was given the opportunity to travel to help launch other contracts and it was all paid for. Each time I was sent out I was gone for 4-6 weeks. And then I become a trainer. The place had gone downhill really. I would not recommend it to anyone unless they were on another contract or was desperate. The turnover rate is so high they are hiring the bottom of the barrel and nobody makes it 2 months."
bad,"Convergys is not that bad but there was a time when I thought there was a fast track program if youre good enough, all of which was pretty much a lie. When they have managers, they just push you harder. Run the numbers up with disregard for your bonus. "
bad,"If you're ok sitting at a desk talking to rude people and having no purpose other than being told what to do and how to do it, this is the place for you."
bad,convergys I a good job if you have a lot of patience to get cussed out and be nice and can handle with people calling and wonting stuff free or there going to cancel and you job is trying to save the cx
bad,I was not paid on time for the work I preformed for the compay and the first check was 5 days late.  As a result I would not recommend that you apply.  There is a TON of paperwork to be filed out and it is very difficult to get the job.
bad,"lack of communication between team leads and co-workers"
bad,Management will make up policies and none of the TLs seem to know the same thing you get a different answer from each one you talk to and they think that the night shift people can some how magically get the same metrics or better than the day shift people.
bad,"-generally it was fun to work here, there was some rude customers but it was easy to handle that"
bad,"Worked here for a while and found the facilities to be lacking and somewhat unclean. Vending machines overpriced and workers underpaid. The call centre floor is either too hot or too cold, and understanding of the levels of stress for the employees was inadequate."
bad,"Be very prepared to be super bored and not get much done on your first couple of days in training... they systems are sssslllllloooooowwwww and the training environments aren't much of any help you must be very self-sufficient working here you better be very quit to learn things and take them in and remember them because you will not get much help when you get to Learning Lab the Floor Support will ghost on you or be MIA and you TL will be pretty busy and wont be able to assist you if needed luckily I had an awesome trainer and had worked with the company before and had some knowledge of how the flow so but didn't help me very much the systems are different than before and the company policies change a lot.... you much be someone that is quick on there toes and pick things up quickly or there is no way you will make it in this job or environment... I don't really like it here, always have to wonder if anyone will be there to assist you if something goes horrible wrong or you get an escalation, or even if you have a simple question people will ghost on you and sometimes your left by yourself so for your scheduled lunch and breaks make sure you go on time and not early or you might come back and no one will be there to help you for a couple of calls... its not a horrible place to work its really not but you really have to be very self-sufficient or you will not make it!! Luckily I am but the lack of organization in the site is terrible that's what is making me look for new jobs and wanting to not go into work because everything is ""New"" no one really knows what to do and everything"
bad,This is a very high-paced call center. Training is fairly good but several of the actual floor managers were poor in judgement or else very judgmental. Managers had very high goals
bad,Always get pulled up for little things managers only care about sales no way of progresson...managers will call you a liar no organisation and filled with glass promises
bad,"It was cool gig for a person who's used to manual/physical labor , just sitting talking to people helping them solve issues about apple products but living in Cincinnati I was not willing to keep making the commute to erlanger ."
bad,Worst and worst company ever seen its like Dharavi in Mumbai . Domestic mentality from management team running international business . Go man go first learn to stand and then run a business
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Management was very poor. Very unorganized. None of the management team has the same work place knowledge. Good place to just get some hours and a pay check. Not a good place if you work you are looking for company structure.
bad,"The experience I had working at Convergys was surprising.There was no detailing of information given at the time of hiring concerning you had to work off of each call for production with communication with the customer for scheduling bidding. "
bad,I would deal with sick people of the other people I have had to deal with on a daily basis. Life is to short to walk away everyday more drained after work than before.
bad,"Let's be honest - PPI ends next year so to learn 8 systems, constantly get berated for lack of accuracy by people who claim to be managers without any of the skills or qualities required and to be put under pressure regardless of what department you are in makes the wage not high enough."
bad,I did not like the frequent schedule changes. I would work til 2 in the morning then would have to return back to work at 7 am. I loved working for OnStar providing directions from people all over the United States.
bad,"You have to train yourself, management is far from professional and you often question whether the things they do are legal. They may be legal, but far from ethical."
bad,"definitely watch for pros and cons. poor management, shows favoritism towards employees, don't pay enough for all they are asking of you. supervisors are not who they supposedly represent."
bad,"This was a temp job working for open enrollment (seasonal). Very monotonous. Not something I'd want to do on a permanent basis. It was mainly made up of millennials and pregnant, tattooed mothers to be"
bad,"Be prepared to work with ghetto people."
bad,"Concentrix HR is a complete joke. They micro manage your bathroom breaks and have unrealistic expectations. Additionally, they are known to short hard working employees on their biweekly paychecks on numerous occasions. Avoid them if possible!"
bad,Not a proffessional place to work at all managers would ignore you most of time and expect you to be an a***hole to sell. When I left it wasn't handled correctly in the slightest. Managers had as many breaks as they liked. The hours were completely unsociable. Avoid unless you like to be pressured into hard selling.
bad,"I had a lot of concerns regarding our pay. a lot of salary disputes, we were not even provided with income tax refunds. it's kinda unfair for some of the waves have received pay retrocharges while for us, we did not even receive a single cent from it. "
bad,"The people who work at convergys are the only reason I stayed there over 8 years."
bad,"I hate working at Convergys. Call centers are clearly not my thing. A typical day at work is super long. Shifts are usually 1:30 pm-10 pm. After this job, not interested in working at a call center."
bad,"I absolutely love the people I work with. Genuinely fantastic people. That's it though. Nothing else positive about the place. Managers do what they want with no real direction. No stats. No productive help. No one from any other department has a clue what they're doing. Targets for bonus are ridiculous. Its a RETENTION'S department for a mobile phone service, not a sales department, yet you get disciplinary action if you don't sell a certain amount of broadbands??? Shocking management. Systems practically never even work. "
bad,this job started off with a great feel and an even better atmosphere all things changed when the training was over people wdere getting fired left and right the turn over rate is so high you might as well count your blessing everytime your able to clock out because whose to say you even have a job the next morning management gives little to no care about you or assessing any issue  regarding situations at the job its a money factory with the only gain in adding revenue to trainees and firing once the office become fully staffed. makes sense why they always have trainees every week
bad,Convergys is the most high stressed Job to ever work with. It's like everything that you do is wrong no matter how right you are. There is favoritism all through that place smh
bad,There is not really anything nice to say but that the people you worked with are nice. You can work 30-40 hours & they have insurance choices. I knew I could find something nice to say.
bad,The atmosphere was like walking into the land down under everyday. The people I meant were great but everyone was down. They didn't know how to boost moral.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"loved the people they make a great work place., loved the different projects that I was able to work in., to bad were still not in Canada I would still be working for them"
bad,"hardest part of the job is trying to comply with the unreasonable request by the company, extra overtimes with very low pays, mandatory time offs without notifications"
bad,"Like a hive of ants, one worker gets crushed there is always another to take his/her place. Management lied about performance to avoid paying benefits. Had to pay $25 a week to get home from work."
bad,Concentrix is a great company world wide but the site I am currently at needs help..dramatically. Pay compensation ... would be the con of the Atlanta site.
bad,"Every day was like a typical day for me, I have learned so many things and Convergys transport facility is a great which i have ever seen, My hardest part of the job was to learn about Mumbai's route which is very compulsory for work in a transport line. I have enjoyed every day in this company."
bad,I know reviews are done mostly of spite but i wouldn't recommend working at Convergys because they don't work with you on schedule they throw mandatory overtime in everyone's schedule forcing your shift to be anywhere from 10-12 hours long with only a 30 minute lunch and they don't work with you if you have transportation issues such as bus riders etc.
bad,"A typical day at work is having to show up about 20 minutes before you start work."
bad,Worked for Convergys for 2 years was always worried about being fired. Moved to the retention department and was very afraid to loose my job due to not being able to retain customers due to unpredictable price increases.
bad,"Good monetary compensation, but management and job culture were terrible.  I felt like no one had your back.  If you had a good month of sales, you had a lot of support.  If you had a bad month, team leaders could care less."
bad,"I was a customer service retention rep for the Directv project"
bad,"Minacs did not meet my career goals. This business is very unorganized and dishonest from HR, employees and payroll. I wouldn't recoomend this contract postion for anyone"
bad,"management wasnt very good, friendly place to work full of employees from different ethinicty easy to get along with. working hours were too long on some occasions. company itself not very well organsied in reagrds to sorting each teams rotas."
bad,call center rep is prob the worst job. Management was not as supportive as they should have been.
bad,"This company is  unorganized (the location I worked for, claude freeman dr). They do put overtime in your schedule without your knowledge, you get no say so. It is a very drama filled work environment, you have to stay to yourself while working here. Why? Well that's the only way youll make it, is if you keep your adherence above 95%, good quality, stay out the drama!!!!"
bad,I did not like working for this company mostly because of the people. They were rude and treated you like dirt.
bad,I have never worked in a environment where people were treated so poorly. The hours are horrible and the managers are even worse.
bad,"Training is SO long but you learn so little. It basically sets you up to fail, I don't need to draw a poster,  I need to learn my job. Everybody who is above you is on a power trip and have no clue how to lead. This makes for a very high school feeling environment. The place is SO unorganized honestly I have no clue what the difference is between the trainers, red hats, and team leads because they literally just all stand around on the production floor. And once you go out to the floor, good luck getting help,  everybody knows just as much as you. Not every answer can be found for troubleshooting. Very inflexible with hours, basically for all 10 weeks of training you can have no PTO, holiday pay, or shift differential, so basically just plan on not having a life because every day missed even for an emergency is counted against you. I was told that I needed to schedule school around work even though going back to school was my top priority. Also the lady with the dog who hands out the checks is so rude for no reason. Basically it's just high school with more stress and less freedom/organization."
bad,"A place to pass over to the next job."
bad,"this  company is a call center dealing with at&t customers,resch u -verse customers and taking supe calls"
bad,Although a fast paced job the individuals handling the customers are the most important employees and the least appreciated.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Managers who have been there for over 20 years with two cubicles pushed together. No respect every week they have a new training class. They have fights in training.  Favoritism is at it's highest there you constantly get lied to about everything. They keep and hire who ever is stupied enough to believe anything. The clapping every 2minutes is ridiculous but it's allowed because it's a husband and wife team. One a manager other a Team Leader. So anything goes in that place.
bad,i care for the customers i encounter and the way this company handles some of them are just unexceptionable.
bad,"I left the company before completing training because the ethics were  all screwed up. Women in my training group were getting written up for their clothing which was normal at first, our first day around lunch time I see men wearing the same type of clothing the women were getting in trouble for. That was not fair. Then when we were getting into the training the instructor told us the job was sales AND support. I applied for sales. He then said be ""prepared to get cussed out because these people are crazy"" "
bad,Bad place to work. Very poor in the way they treat employees and the customers. Micro manage you to death and does not pay that great even compared to what other companies alike pay. 
bad,Good benefits and extended training. Not an enjoyable job at all!
bad,"I really enjoyed my day to day work with Convergys. However the upper management is consistently inconsistent. The old adage practice what you preach is not followed at all, they do not lead by example. once a manager reaches a certain level they find it much easier just to get rid of a problem, other than coach and develop that person. Coaching and developing your employees is the mantra with convergys. The Benefits however were phenomenal!"
bad,Does not care about employees only numbers. Yiu have penalties even if you are admitted to the hospital.
bad,The bad thing about this place is there is no job security. What is the point of having a job if you don't know how long you will be there. They care about themselves not the employees. Some of the managers are lazy and if you are not on their team they pretty much ignore you. Many people don't even make it past 6 months. What does that say?
bad,"Never work here, they do a 70% turn around every 3 months. They hire anyone that can type more than 20 WPM and is over 18- and they get great incentives from the companies they represent for the turn around. One of the companies they represent is the lowest rated Phone provider in the US and they do nothing to improve the scores."
bad,"I will say that I was extremely excited to start this job right off of the bat. The interview was great, the training even better. Then all of a sudden, things just did a 180. The Team Leads there are not only disorganized but also completely illiterate. This is definitely a pipe dream job, which sucks because the employees there are great."
bad,I strongly dislike this place and I would never work for them again. They really don’t care much about their employees. Care more so about the dollars. Not very family oriented at all. It’s especially tough working there as a single parent. Your  team leader was hardly ever around especially when you needed them. It’s hard to move up in the company. They show a lot of favoritism.
bad,"Experience was awful. Unprofessional management, hostile work environment, weak HR representatives, no corporate to contact. Would not recommend to anyone. Company as a whole very uncouth."
bad,"Didn't make it out of training, the trainer I was assigned to believed in insulting and degrading various people in the training class.  Management did not believe in making sure you had the tools needed to do the job"
bad,Started as a Pharm Tech Trainee up until they did a group meeting saying they lost Walgreens contract. Found out Via NEWS KGUN 9 that Concentrix bought company and shipped jobs in Tucson to other call centers. Not very Professional. People/co-workers are great.
bad,"Getting yelled at all day on the phone rude customers. No work life balance finish work at 11pm back in at 9am. Asked to work around bus schedule did not get the schedule. Dirty work station and difficult to find a work station thats empty. Worked one day in member  services got switch to sales because that where business needs were.  Good for hours though and management is ok. Just to many changes, not a good schedule, not clean office."
bad,"It's a job, until it's not. You're cattle pure and simple. It is like any other call center job so if you have worked in one, you've pretty much worked in them all."
bad,"the salary doesn't match at all the work they made us do and that's not fair. And the management, some Team leader needs to learn how to correctly do they job."
bad,I enjoyed working for ITunes however all the other adversity is would made this experience difficult. We learned alot about the service provided. ITunes
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Some of the management genuinely cares, but most of it is not very supportive and is very ""do it yourself"" oriented, with not much support available.because they have ""more important things to deal with""."
bad,"If you're looking for something for two weeks, this is the job for you. It treats you well in training, and then a few weeks on the floor and you're a doormat. They treat you poorly and don't offer a challenge but rather, threaten your job with surveys and fake reports. If you don't stay at a 90% rate you're fired. They don't keep people for long and there is a high turn-out."
bad,Stuck in a classroom for a whole week learning all about the job on the phone then you have a test after that 1 week  which they don't tell you about in the interview! if you don't pass you get sacked then get thrown onto the call floor not knowing what to do. You then take your first call straight away you never get any help The staff were horrible too everything about this job was a joke.
bad,Very boring and dry. You sit at your desk the entire shift without pens or paper or cell phone use. It's very boring and repetative. Managemenbt was also very dry and boring to work with.
bad,I enjoyed working with the Sprint project however it was hard to fully be able to do my job when they are restricting my teams capabilities and were focused on creating drama rather than handling the customers.
bad,"everything was great. No problems what so ever.. Except when the systems went down off and on. the usb drives were defective. Or IT didn't fix problems that allowed access into their systems to complete your training and learn the software, and you were thrown out to answer customer calls without knowing the software no more than the customer did!!"
bad,Answering phone calls for customers who have problems with their cell phone or their wireless bills. Agents troubleshoot to correct device problems and help customers to understand their wireless bills.
bad,"Title says it all, getting laid off. While they offered to move me to a different account, fool me once shame on you, fool me twice...................."
bad,"Support Role Feedback:  ie: Quality, IT, Workforce MGMT, PMO roles, Support Functions etc.   "
bad,They don't honor the referral program they have for prospective employees. I left the company with them owing me a whopping $2400. Also You're not allowed to cancel insurance. Half my check was going to insurance.
bad,"We were told SO MANY things before starting, but when it got down to getting paid what we were told, it Never balanced out in the end to what we were told upfront.  We worked in a call center environment taking incoming calls for customers interested in Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans.  Convergys staff would go along behind us when we were most stressed, had a hard time hearing the customers and we were getting to the end of open enrollment and they would ring cow bells, yell and celebrate!  There was a Time and a Place for Celebration and that WASN'T IT!  "
bad,"Promised to be employed for 2 years and it only lasted 11 months. We were supposed to receive health benefits and never received.  When we had questions, HR was difficult to get a hold of and once we did get them, they weren't knowledgeable nor helpful."
bad,"No habia horarios fijos, variaban cada 15 dias.  Habia que atender solmante a clientes furiosos que querian desconectar su servicio de cable TV evitando que lo hagan y ademas vendiendoles mas productos.  "
bad,We were a call center that had contracts with American companies to provide customer service for phone carriers. We handled both landlines and mobile phones.
bad,"It's the worst good job because the pay is good but the management sucks. It's a lot of favoritism, the managers are rude, the OM's really don't hear both sides of the story they just believe the TL's. Some TL's will say they would do things for you, but won't and then you get terminated or punished for it. The TL's also plot to get people fired, and sometimes they're rude. But, the good thing about the job is they have good benefits, 401 K, retirement plans, and etc. You also have room to be cross trained to develop skills in different areas. It's was bitter sweet for me but I ended up resigning because I was overwhelmed everyday at work."
bad,Convergys is a terrible place to work. The workplace is dirty. The people working there are immature and irresponsible. They don't take things seriously.
bad,"If you have any  accessibility issues , not the place for you unless you want to not eat or have to fine a  see-through container that even with ice packs does not keep your food cold. The lunch room and only place besides going out side to use your cellphone is on the 2nd floor, but is 3 flights of stairs up. No elevators. They tell you need to be in 15 minutes early to get your station ready and to find a working keyboard and mouse. But they won't pay you for the time you are getting ready to work. "
bad,"I am not normally so vocal about on the job complaints.  I've worked bad jobs and worse jobs, but once I've left them, I let the issues go.  However, I have never worked anywhere with such blatant incompetence, deception, and outright employee disrespect as when I was at Convergys.  The entire structure seems to built breaking their employees down as people and turning them into mindless drones.  They spend a month and a half training you before you even take a call, to which you think you would be ready to run the programs for the job, but they are so incomprehensibly complicated and non-linear, that even people who had been there for 10+ years struggled to use them.  In short, words are not adequate to describe how much I want to save people from working that job."
bad,"I started in August there were 28 ppl in my training class and now there are at least 9 left. Need I say more?"
bad,"Mainly during the day we would have many different calls dealing with customer services, for example resetting there cable box or just explaining there monthly bill, as well we would take payments or offer to upgrade services."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Convergys works on behalf of Vodafone the company in the news for being the worst company in regards to customer services in the UK in 2015/16. The staff and management at convergys are actually very helpful but they are hampered by the most insanly ridiculous system they have to use which really would take 6 months to learn. Not the 2 weeks basic training you get before being thrust onto the phones to deal with actual customers, after working there a month i found nearly every call was an angry customer calling to complain that somthing has gone wrong with their order/bill of any number of reasons.. nearly everytime this was caused by employee or system error and not the customers fault yet we are told just pretty much tell them tough s*** because we have niether the training nof capability to even help customers anyway. The job description is pretty much try to get people to upgrade no matter what and if the call isnt for an upgrade do whatever you can to get them off the phone or transfered to another department. The salary is minimum wage which for such a stressful job is insulting, the commission structure is purposefully set at impossible levels. The hours are pretty much 11-8 most days and can be working upto 14 days in a row because its a shift pattern.. you will almost always work weekends too. They hire 50 people PER MONTH which is obsurd.. it just shows how many people quit straight away, of the 19 in my training class only 11 made it to the phones, when i left there was only 5 remaining 3 of whom ive heard have left after me. Worst job i have ever had and i worked"
bad,I worked there for 5 weeks in the chatham branch . The management was all over the place. When you had a question you were talked down to like you were stupid and like you should already know the answer to . You had to guess what to do . You had to spend almost an hour unpaid looking for a place to sit and if there wasnt any places then your pay was docked and you were advised you were not being efficient atnyour station. They didnt train us enough to know what to do in complicated situations with customers and dealerships. Most of the young employees made it feel like school talking about their intimate lives while your trying to be professional on the line with customers and discuss their matters. When they were not working they were congregating around people who werent and the one sided headphones made it very difficult to hear . Individuals who worked there if they had medical concerns they were perceived as not worthy of being able to use the washroom unless it was in the alloted time frame . The worst part was not having adequate work stations that had a computer that worked and didnt freeze all the time and having to run around trying to find a supervisor to correct the problems. Then the head office in india would dock your pay because their computers in chatham office quit working and would render you helpless while trying to complete your call with no programs or windows open. Not being able to leave your desk for break cause your on a call and when you go to take your break time that is allotted when you do get off the phone and they tell you you were late when you
bad,"Poor Work environment,  there are no permanent seating. everything is assessable from the property. Parking is horrible."
bad,fun working place. good and fun activities. work security is good. all information's are being handles with most security specially with confidential information's about customers.
bad,"It was a good paying job, 40 hours a week but a very stress full job"
bad,"Management is good and job culture is also ok, but salary is less, job work and life balance never meets and job and work have always been on a high degree."
bad,"It was a very decent job until they switch up TLs every other month, and not being organized as a big company."
bad,"In my opinion working there was the worst experience ever the pay is not enough and navigating 5 different systems is not easy and the worst part about it your commission is based on customers opinion"
bad,at concentrix the fundamental role was to generate interest and set appointments for I.T resellers and business partners with businesses and public sector organisations that have I.T projects with in the are the area the campaign is specifically aimed at. Working on behalf of some of the major I.T players including EMC/NetApp/VMware/IBM/Citrix/Microsoft
bad,"Training was made fun, good trainers. When hit the floor everything changed. Most important the hours for me were no good. The company did not work with single parents, although they would arrange hours around students and religious needs. That is my only complaint."
bad,Working at a tech support call center is harder than it seems. Hop on the phones when you would get in and have people calling you very angry and frustrated. Most often was able to help resolve the customers situation and problems but often times would have to escalate the issue the customer was having. This was a good steady reliable job to pay the bills. Once there for over a certain time period a different schedule was given if desired. I went from working the late shift to 11:30pm to the morning shift in the AM which was much better. The people I worked with were always fun to chat and get help from. This was a good job to pay the bills.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of sitting for 8 hours, with the exception of two fifteen minute breaks and a half hour lunch. I am in the resolutions department which means I try to talk people out of cancelling their service by offering several different options. I was told that I would not be ""selling"" anything and that there were no ""quotas"" to make and I found out that this was a lie. Not a misunderstanding, not an overlooked detail, a lie. Co-workers are for the most part bored in what they are doing and see this as a means to obtain benefits. The hardest part of the job is trying to convince people that they should keep a service that they do not want or need. There is no enjoyable part of the job."
bad,The job is based on performance however your performance is not how they base it. Confusing i know.
bad,There is no benefits. Sometimes your schedule would change over night making you late or early!
bad,"Shift bids were supposed to go off of performance, yet top performers were given the worst shifts. Call floor was very 'catty'. HR can never seem to complete necessary forms, including insurance and FMLA. Due to their poorly designed timestamp/ clock in systems, several advisors were shorted pay on several occasions"
bad,Bad experience and still in contact with the president of the company right is right and wrong is wrong.. I will not stop till I have reached satisfactory....
bad,first off let me talk about the management of the turbo tax program at the tempe location. All woman who act like your typical woman instead of professionals. You get jealousy because the managers are sleeping with the employers its crazy. You get mangers not liking you because of how you look. For sprint they came from a different location that had bed bugs and brought the same furniture which in turn brung the bedbugs
bad,"If you are a person who can not solicit over the phone, by reading from scripts, then this would not be the ideal job for you, just as it was not for me."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Ridiculous point system. You get points even with doctor notes. The pay isn't that great. Management has no clue what they are doing. I would never work there again.
bad,"At first, it seemed like a good company.  Over time however, I found that management was not that great!  They have too many petty people who will do anything to make themselves stand out even if that means they put down other people.  They mirco-manage too much.  OH do not make a mistake because they will alert everyone to let them know you made a mistake!  Their training could use some improvement."
bad,"The customers were great,it was just the old time white way of dealing with black race autihoritative ones.They dont have the training for my type of person. They refused to hear anything but the white old way of handling things.  They gave me permission to trade and to be off and to work replacement days , then they fired me calling it too many breaks,"
bad,"This is my personal torture chamber. You get shrieked at for things you can't control or you're bored out of your mind. Stare at the same ugly walls every day talking to the same angry entitled customers. In an 8 hour shift you spend 1-2 of that listening to hold music that hasn't changed in 10 years. "
bad,This job doesn’t have a steady call volume and bad management. Tries to be very strict but the environment is horrible and very ghetto. No room for growth
bad,"The pay is ok, but management is horrible. I’ve gone through not receiving pay on time to not being paid my full amount and having to wait till next pay period to maybe receive it. There is no micro managing here which i did appreciate. But the pay was not enough for what we dealt with as of dealing with yelling customers."
bad,"You have to ask a lot of questions.... lack of integrity."
bad,Management would  seldom answer when reaching out for help and I went through 7 team manager due to constant re alignments without notice .They would constantly have pay issues where we would not be paid correctly
bad,Laid off after two months of hard work. We were told at least 100 employees were laid off after extensive training in hard work. We were given no notice and was told they were overstaffed. Very poorly managed.
bad,The company would be a good company if they learn how to treat the staff. This not a company I feel deserve to have the contracts they have. And the mangers should not be managers if they don't know how to establish a better relationship with they staff.
bad,"I’ve never worked here but it sounds harendus how do they keep staff , the wages look really poor for people that have families really didn’t think companies like this were still around"
bad,"They expect you to know everything right out of training.  Have to troubleshoot for spectrum which can be challenging due to irate and angry customers who don't want to cooperate."
bad,Was not impressed with the way the handles things the job was very stressful the teaching was poor and they had too many people to teach for one teacher
bad,"The OM is a bully and they will fire you for not selling on calls that are inappropriate to sell on. They make you sell to soldiers who are leaving to go protect the country, they make you sell to people who are calling to cancel an account due to a death, they make you sell to people who have mental health disorders and need to fix a situation that was caused due to these issues."
bad,"The company was very unprofessional  ! Customers was very rude but other than that everything was fine "
bad,To much pressure on sales part but customer service part is awesome. No issues with the people as long as they are valuing my rights as an employee and making considerations on emergencies
bad,"As a team leader this company has given me an opportunity to sharpen my leadership skills. It has also taught me to ""think outside of the box"". I would recommend this job to anyone who wants to learn how to get their first experience in management."
bad,A typical day at work is stressful. I learned how to deal or handle different and multiple personalities. Will hire anybody or anyone. I've met some really great people and also some really horrible and unkind people from this workplace.
bad,"the pay was terrible. if you didn't kiss the site leaders behind it pretty much means your stuck in your position and never move up or until the site leader in Tamarac would fire you. Fortunately, not everybody there was like that except for the Jessie Operations manager who loved to smell the site leaders chair after she had sat there for hours."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Stay tuned and stay on task and sale, and make sure your customers issues has been resolved before getting them off the line and always show empathy to each and every customer"
bad,assisting people who had problems with there cable and who need to schedule a service call from one of the Comcast cable company technicians. also assist with internet problems
bad,Very low lack of support and the company shows favoritism to some employees while treating the others unfair. DO NOT WORK HERE .................................................................................
bad,"This place is a nice place to work only if you can deal with High school drama on a daily basis. They are like children who are immature, you will be babysitting this call center if you work here. As well Upper management changes very continually due to terrible upper management staff."
bad,"hours are really bad, and we have to let customers treat us likle the scum of the earth"
bad,"They are reliable when it comes to job stability, however they were not good with support from management. Also they do not keep you with a steady schedule."
bad,This company say they want quality but hiring people that can't spell the word or know the meaning. They find any reason to fire you if management don't like you anymore and will not give you proper training. If you make a mistake its ok until its that time of the year when they looking to down size. The pay is $9.50 starting when the type of stress you deal with is $12.50 not the type of job to look to build a career with.
bad,Answering the phones all day long. Certain management helps only in certain situation. Scheduling is bad and you really cannot have a life. They co not seem considerate about certain things that happen in your life. Co-workers are fun. The hardest part is dealing with the many attitudes.
bad,the workplace is really fun but the management is poor in service they cannot handle their employee very well. I'm actually expecting a lot from them but it is a dissapointment
bad,"Answer calls for AT@T Customers and resolving phone issues"
bad,This job did nothing but lie from the start. Full of children really. Because of all the lies I never wanted to be there. Oh and this job tried to brainwash people into believing that sales is customer service. Dont waste your time here.
bad,"Enjoy attending to calls and resolving the customers queries,also enjoyed working in rotational shifts initially was very hard with UK shifts as was working with wipro for grave yard shifts."
bad,"pay was good, but if you are looking for more than some temporary fast cash you should probably keep looking. 10 minute breaks and it takes you 2 minutes to log in. the system has glitches and they blame you for them. customers ask for a supervisor and it takes forever for them to agree to take the call"
bad,The trainers and supervisors aren't very friendly or helpful. The training class didn't offer everything needed to be able to perform the job completely. I had to learn a lot on my own once I started on the phones. The company is more worried about how much money they spend to train you and how much money you're bringing in for the company than the actual customers themselves.
bad,"Telemarketing, calling selling deregulating energy and calling people with political surveys"
bad,The position itself was not hard easy to learn; however the management is poor needs work.
bad,co-workers were great. That company is all about sales and you get fired based on your scores.
bad,"I liked the managers and workers, but with this company they did not care or are not willing to work around your personal life,."
bad,This place is a terrible place to work. The training sucked to put it in nice terms.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"If you can't work ten hours a day, don't work here. The Management does not care about you, your mental health, and will not accomodate for any different hours whatsoever."
bad,I was fired because of the fact I didnt have any empathy. When i wanted to take the class my mgr didnt put me in them. Two weeks after I was fired so was she for not doing her job and costing the company unemloyment
bad,"Convergys was a really great learning experience but it didn’t work out only because they are really unprofessional and all over the place . I learned so many new things and systems while working at Convergys . I also learned how to deal with irarte customers, and how to defuse and avoid a upset customer"
bad,"A lot of work in tier 2 for $12.70.  They give you pizza, and hot coa coa. A lot of work. Job consist of customers upset about the product they have.."
bad,Hours are way too long and the managers don't care about you. You are seen as everyone else... some of the managers are nice... lots of customer abuse that you have to take.
bad,"So I worked for convergys for over 14 months I connstantly hit targets too."
bad,"The job is easy, but the customers are not. It's part of the job, but the hourly pay does not compensate for what one puts up with. They recently closed down a department because of how bad it got."
bad,working for vassic logan was founded by group of family members and I was apart of the running of non profit organisation got to go many different events be apart of fundraising and also admin side of the role
bad,I was there 8 months and then they move everyone to a new department with very little help with training almost all on our own and if you fail your fired it was great to start but has gone down hill and almost no pay raise. Its really a soul sucking job if i could give less stars i would
bad,where is the communication? Management refuse to do this and treat the workplace like a nursery. Avoid at all costs.WORST PLACE EVER
bad,"They just treat you like your expendable and with no care , There are good team leaders but bad management. Do not work here. Please dont ."
bad,"The nature of the job was not for me, however, if one can stick it out, there's plenty of opportunity for advancement due to high turn over rate."
bad,"Very stressful and not professional at all to work for, staff is not treated fair and the support staff for the management is very poor. Would not endorse  this place to anyone"
bad,"Extremely poor mangers, favouritism for certain ‘younger’ employees, truly awful experience. Would never recommend this company. Unrealistic daily targets expected, 4 weeks training received did not help once you were on the phones and using systems."
bad,"The ""interview"" was supposed to take 30 minutes minimum. The entire thing lasted 14 minutes. A couple mundane questions and a job offer. The recruiter said they were not at liberty to tell me the company I would be doing the job for. I received a few emails directing me to their website to fill out different forms electronically, read through some documents etc. Received an email from a company that I had to travel to in order to complete a i9 form. Another email from the recruiter saying I would be receiving more info via email regarding training, from my trainer."
bad,"I worked when the company was called convergys on their apple technical support project"
bad,This was the most mentally abusive job I ever worked at and it wasn't the customers ! I had to take inhalers and other meds . I would get yelled at by the managment
bad,If u work sincerely then it's not the right place to work as they will give u more work. They are people who received star awards and best performance awards and gave there best since 10yrs but never got promoted. No career growth waste of valuable time. TL's are rude and sarcastic. No job security even if you are in a respectable position. U can get removed easily. As per the recent feedback of employees. There are not happy with the company management.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Empresa que prefere demitir quem quer trabalhar e nao dar oportunidade de crescimento pra quem quer.
bad,It's provide what its was I needed to get the job done.  Grateful. Not sure why this system will not allow me to move forward without more wording regarding my time at concintrex.
bad,Great place to get your foot in a door after high school or to get back on your feet as an adult. Great managers but the rest of the staff can be life-sucking. Not great morale.
bad,I’ve been working at this company for 4months and I absolutely hate it. We were supposed to have 5 days of training but only had 2. The managers don’t know anything nor do they help and the operations manager is rude she takes her position to her head she belittles people. The calls that we take are easy considering it’s a lot that we can’t help homeowners with. It’ a good company if your needing something quick
bad,"it just turned into me taking hour long bathroom breaks to avoid the daft, harassment that came from customers daily. With the added stress from the employers it was not fun. would not recomend"
bad,"Concentrix bought out company. Were told culture, focus would improve for callers and staff. 6 months later they announced site closing. Draw your own conclusions"
bad,"During a recent merger, promises were made and not kept. Have decimated workforce. No regard for employees. A lot of hype about caring for employees only window dressing."
bad,"Expect to put in far more work than what you get paid for. If you are a hard working and honest person, expect to be given more work and then be made fun of for it. "
bad,"On a daily basis we are handling customer inquiries and concerns, we offer support and resolution."
bad,"Training was frustrating because there is no knowledge base to build, just memorization of web pages and mandatory scripts. A lot of time was wasted waiting for trainees who were late, disruptive, not paying attention, or not able to comprehend the training, as well as computers or systems not working properly, waiting for repairs. Limited time away from training (24 hours) made it impossible to continue, even though far more time was wasted doing nothing, than I needed away from training class. Trainers were inconsistent with knowledge and procedures. Equipment was missing pieces, unsanitary, and insufficient for the number of trainees."
bad,"Working here Concentrix in one of their client as customer service specialist for years. I can say that my first year was good and happy working environment but after another year passed and the management has been replaced, the working environment become so stressfull/politics occur/favoritism/unfair judgement without proper trial and due process. Colleagues becomes stuck up,racism by the local Manager. I was disappointed of what the company turn out because of poor management. Management sucks big time!"
bad,"Want you to technical support on a program your not fully trained to use or understand, everything is a grey area, and management will try to get you to do things your not suppose to do. Inequality certain staff teams are held to a higher standard than others and are forced to follow policy they were never informed about."
bad,"For 25 cents above the minimum wage, you have a tidal wave of work to do for one of their clients that is a financial institution.  You have to write exams on anti-money laundering and privacy laws.  You also have to write a test on how their internal system works for daily employee use.  Their database of customer information goes back to the days of DOS and you have to memorize dozens of key combination codes for everyday use.  You also have to sell products associated with the financial industry.  Your sales have NO bonus structure or commission attached to them.  Everyday upon start up during the training period, something was not working to get us properly trained for the floor when it comes time to talk to the public.  Because they're still using Windows 7, yes, Windows 7, it screws up your ability to work properly.  You can pour coffee and flip burgers for the same money and this job is worth at least 18 to 20 dollars an hour but pays only $14.25 at the time of this review and you don't get a full 40 hours if you go full time.  In the fall, 24/7 shifts start and you will have to work the overnight shift.  You will be overwhelmed with work for very little money.  I stayed almost two weeks out of a four week training period and I and some others in the class were not nearly ready to start our jobs when the time came.  Decide for yourself but you will be under paid for too much work and you will have to deal with abusive customers and worry every single day about accidentally violating people's privacy or having someone try and pull a scam on you."
bad,Managers and Team Leads were so unhappy they were asking us for job leads and they had no idea where or when their next assignment was going to be.  The upper mgmt switched people and team managers around so much you never knew who was doing what or who to go to if you needed assistance.
bad,Any call center you work at will suck eggs except this was an exception. The phones and computers rarely worked and you basically waste away in this environment.
bad,"Habe knapp 2 Jahre in dieser Firma gearbeitet. Kollegen sind zwar nett ABER..."
bad,"IF you're looking for a professional setting, management with leadership skills or""survivable"" pay THIS IS NOT FOR YOU! Calling this place a Middle School would be a total understatement. There are sagging thugs wreaking of pot, and stripper dressed""children"" swarming the building. No enforced rules nor dress codes validates the appearance of their employees.  If you're young, immature and just need""fashion money"" this may be your throne"
bad,"Management a very biased. Day shift against Night shift. HR don't do a deep research when hire. Management with issues that affect the performance of the team. "
bad,I hated working here. The stress in the building was so bad it made me physically sick. Some of the management was very nice and worked with you. My team leaders were great. I had several leaders being there they were all great leaders.
bad,The department I worked for required you to put up with to much garbage over the course of the day. I was litterally coughing/throwing up blood and had a doctors note for a mandatory day I left and still got in trouble for it. So your health doesn't matter there. They also promised me another job and then I didn't get one. They promised $11 an hour that didn't happen. They have a revolving door policy for their business.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Long rant about a TERRIBLE company."
bad,"The first place I experienced my job slipping away to the Philippines. management tried to put a happy face on it, until they were pointed out the door as well."
bad,Would not recommend this job. This place has been going down for years. the management has always been terrible. The turn over rate is because of the management.
bad,I enjoy talking to people from all walks of life. What I most enjoy about the job is that I get to help people and that definity puts a smile and my face and the customers.
bad,"I started this job under conditions and an agreement that they would honor a specific day off due to religious practices.  That was the condition prior to me taking a position with the company.  "
bad,"Bed Bugs, unprofessional management, favoritism,  no union."
bad,They promised me a good wage I saw slavery just like from the 19th century. Local people staying in front of old computers eating food like laboratory rabbits waiting to be slaughtered... At the end of the month your wage is 600 Pounds and your small flat costs 600 Pounds... Working for Concentrix in Gourock you must live in a gloomy place looking like a cemetery. Don't go there you could even find your grave... A big trap!
bad,"This place is no where I would recommend. Management really sucks. People smoke marijuana in the parking lot. When they let me go, the director of the place cursed at me which is very unprofessional even though I was no rude to him. The pay is not worth the work. The training is nothing like the actual job."
bad,"Low pay"
bad,"This was a good job - pay was okay. staff were fairly friendly, it was hard to move up in the company. Shifts were all over the place. a lot of reviews"
bad,They lied about the commission rate. They lied about having set schedules. They lied about approving PTO. They micromanage to the point workers walk-out.
bad,day was taking call fix customer problem like trouble shooting learn how to install receiver in customer home and hard part of the job if customer don't know where they need to install those receiver can get mad at me no fun time at work
bad,I didn't like it. It was high school again for training. They made us introduced each other. These rude girls laugh at me for my introduction. Apparently my trainer want us in groups and do projects with art constantly. Like it does anything. I hated high school and heard mean gossips about me behind the computers. I'm stuck with a class full of mean girls all over again for only $10.50 an hour. They push sale. Make sure you make a sale at least once in every call. If you like to talk a lot and makes sale with grumpy customers then you do well with this job. They used to put down $14 an hour but apparently people call them out on that. So they put only $10.50 for training. If u like high school and presenting poster for training. You like this job.
bad,"........................................"
bad,"I worked here for 6 months and worked hard without a sickness or absence. I then lost my son, which my manager then decided to laugh and sack me as I wanted a day off. I have never spoken to anyone who has liked this employer. They use you and never pay you correctly for months on end."
bad,"Convergys has no comprehension of time management. They force workers to work 44 hour weeks minimum and in busier months 47 and up to 50, while management works 40 and upper management is nowhere to be found.  You will be at a desk for what seems like and really is, forever. The nature of the job itself is not bad, taking inbound support calls from mostly courteous customers, however doing it for 10 hours a day is exhausting, and booking a day off is not possible unless you can make up the time on one of your days off. The management at Convergys London is outstanding however. They do whatever they can to help out whenever possible. They don’t look down on anyone and are always there if needed. They are flexible with sick day allowances only because they have to be. The staff in the centre is like a revolving door. There are only three people out of a class of 25 others I was hired with a year ago still working there. That should tell you all you need to know. This place is good for short term work but longer than a few months and you will feel more drained than you ever could think you could be from sitting in a chair for ten hours a day."
bad,There isn't much I can remember about convergy's. I worked there over 6 years ago. There is a high turn around rate. The job was stressful but became easier.
bad,When I worked there no matter what you had to try to sale uverse to everyone that it was available to and if it wasn't had to try to sale the customer something else to go with their cell phone.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,This job was a good job very easy going. The customers weren't the problem. The problem there was the people. They were always new people coming and going. There was never a steady boss you could look up to. There was always drama and it was not a good work environment. Your health can go from good to bad in just months of  working there. They fire their good working employees over reason they cant really justify due to lack of search and just wanted to get rid of people to be able to train people that don't qualify for the job. There is a whole lot of wrong things that go on with this job but the work its self was easy.
bad,"Un organized company still using paper products"
bad,"Just a caution that I suspect Convergys and some other work from home jobs put out the word that they are hiring but will sell your information when you fill out the application. My advice would be to give them a fake phone number and a email that you don't use for personal/ serious business, that way you don't get spam calls. Be careful because I think they benefit financially from your info even if your not hired but in turn you get nothing from them.The reason some of the companies like convergys always appear to be hiring is because they need more info to sell/use that you give to them on the application/resume."
bad,"I worked here for over a year and i wouldnt wish it on my worst enemy. Place is ran by a bunch of clowns. Team leaders are so unhelpful and so unapproachable, they would prefer to belittle you infront of people than give extra support if needed. In the year i was their i had 1 coaching session yet you are expected to improve stats etc on a monthly basis. Long story short they need to have a serious look at management and other higher ups ans seriously re consider their employment."
bad,This is a company that will definately hire everyone they interview. That can be a bad thing. Any and everybody is able to walk through the door. They do not pay enough for the hard work the employees put in.
bad,"Very constrictive on workplace setup. Unable to write anything down. Had a ""stickie"" system, but unreliable. Too much information to try and remember."
bad,"If you prove you know how to work a computer (which might not work correctly), then you're likely get hired for whatever contract work your local office does. "
bad,"It's a call center, there's not much else to say about it, not a fun place to work. Training seemed comprehensive until actually out on the floor, then all it was was looking stuff up on the computer."
bad,"It is a very stressful and micro managed job. The new apps have the ability to do the same job as the advisors and the company probably will not be in full business much longer.If you want quick money then its good for short term, but if you are looking for long term its not worth it."
bad,Accounts with this company are excellent but don't expect immediate resolution from Human Resources if ever you do have any problem with your benefits and all. They're taking century to figure out things and they can't even resolve you're concern.
bad,"Bad environment to learn.  bad leadership, bad training, hours and labor taken advantage of.  people not provided all rescources necessary to succeed."
bad,"The employees and management team are great and want you to thrive, but the hardest part of the job isn't the work, it's the stresses of dealing with such passionate customers."
bad,"no flexible hours. the hours available were not manageable"
bad,I personally didnt really like working there because id go to bed stressed everyday. i was told if i didnt make a ridiculous amount of sales a week id be fired and it just stressed me out day to day.
bad,when i first started working here it was fine but then it became very unorganized and then the work load decreased and they sent people home which really was unprofessional and affected my pay and the managers were very unprofessional
bad,Call center.... Sitting at a desk all day... ridiculous call quotas to meet....little chance for advancement. Only redeeming part of the job was was co-workers... someone to share in the misery.
bad,work you as hard as they can and pay the bare minimum.  customer service is good if you can get on the chat team.  most will start on the phones however.
bad,Convergys is one of the biggest call centers in the Philippines. It provided competitive salary package. It is also a company that would refer to a job seeker due to its stability.
bad,"horrible experience"
bad,"Pharmacy technician- must complete each call with an average handle time of 60 seconds, yes, 1 minute. 60 calls an hour, 8 hours a day. some weekends also."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Working for this company was more trouble than it was worth. They were very unorganized and made unreasonable demands. They weren't employee friendly at all.
bad,This company was a good stepping stone for me to move up into a different type of job.  At the time  I was looking to get out of retail an get into a office position and this job helped me do that.
bad,"the training period is too short, the trainers lack paitience and make you feel like you're being annoying when asking questions, their attendance policy is way too strict, alot of gossip"
bad,The company is unorganized and you could never receive a full paycheck because they would mess up the time on your check. The leadership is just completely unprofessional and undesirable.
bad,"This job was rewarding as a customer service job, because I love to work with customers. The managers had their favorites. which made the job very hard because there was no team work. This job was a big store with many customers. It always needed cleaned, restocked, and a good team to accomplish these tasks. This is probably why they sold their company."
bad,Their turnover rate is really high. They don't train their people correctly. Definitely not worth the aggravation. They will hire anyone and just as fast as they hire new people they will fire them.
bad,"it's a job, plenty of overtime"
bad,"Absolutely no leadership. I was there for less then 3 months and that's about the average anyone stays. 4 Site directors, 1 HR Managers, constantly changing personnel in IT, HR, Training and it's basically a revolving door when it come to people at the CSR level. They would mess up your OWN pay checks, by putting what they ""THOUGHT"" how many hours you worked instead of going whats on your PHONE IC loggin"
bad,"This company is such a mess and very unorganized and you don't get paid any money and no raises! For starters training is a complete joke my trainer was messy and tried to get you fired. We did nothing the entire time but play hang man, listen to music, and do various other things that wasn't about of the job. Never had system access and you had to call help desk to set up your own access logins. My experience in 3 months was terrible. Not to mention my trainer was purposely not taking marking whether of not you where at work so you would hardly have a pay check. The other employees are actively looking for work elsewhere, they talk about the staff and management like crazy and try to tell you to look for a better place to work. All in all my experience was horrible. DO NOT WORK FOR THIS COMPANY!!!!"
bad,"Good place to work, people were nice. Phone calls difficult sometimes, but there was always assistance from TLs if needed."
bad,Convergys has poor upper management but when I did enjoy my job doing admin work. I was constantly busy doing hourly reports and always in Excel. I enjoyed my job position and I did enjoy my Team Leader and the direct upper manager I reported to. My co-workers in my department were nice. I would have to say the hardest part of the job was when they decided to close the company on such short notice.
bad,"This job doesn't even get a one star in my opinion , first of all training is 3 weeks and you get trained on things you learn in grade 2 not enough time listening to calls or taking calls , so stressful pay is awful should be getting at least 13$ an hour you have to deal with so much stress and trouble shooting , can only book 4 days off a year and u get the same shift for a month with no choice mine was 3 to 1130 Monday Tuesday off , your senior advisors hang up on you when you need help , I walked out one day couldn't handle it !! stay far away turn over rate is CRAZY !!!! No one stays"
bad,This place is a dirty zoo. The desk are dirty. First call center that makes the employees share headsets. So unsanitary. The supervisors sleep with staff members
bad,"Really didn't enjoy working for company or the type of work. Pay sucked, rude customers. Management horrible. Training class had 14  people in at there was only 4 left before we hit the floor."
bad,The provider we contact through was not holding up to it part to provide the services that we offer to the customers. We would complain as well as the customers. I seen no progress happening to get some of the issues resolved to keep our customer happy and satisfied.
bad,"This was overall a very stressful, disappointing job. At least it was full-time and overtime was almost always available. And my co-workers for the most part were great."
bad,"Convergy's is a low paying, high pressure work place. They tax all prizes over $1... If you need a job quick, you will get a job quick. just make sure to have a real job b/f you complete training."
bad,it has a very high turn over rate no doubt due to the lack of management and i was lied to about my starting pay i only gave one star because i had to to continue
bad,"the training has a lot to be desired. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,I felt right at home here It was family oriented It was a nice job to have
bad,Fast pace call center that allows agents to interact with the customer to resolve an technical issue.
bad,"In the short period that I worked for this company, I was jipped out of my accrued time off- paid and unpaid. it was impossible to get this time off approved, even if it was requested months in advance. A typical day at work included getting yelled at, usually cursed at by customers. The management wasn't bad, in fact, my team leader was awesome, but the overall company management wasn't the best. i loved my coworkers, mainly because we all went through 7 weeks of training together, so we became a little family."
bad,Fielded inbound and outbound calls in regards to the customers past due accounts/Third party collections.
bad,"answer inbound calls"
bad,convergys was a relly good place to work.you take inbound and outbound phone calls about sprint customer service situations.the hardest part of the job was dealing with irrate customers.managment was very good
bad,"bad, terrible, stressful, extra terrible, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad"
bad,"the training was good, they were actually consitant when we were in the classroom doing computer training but when we got on the phones and was in the middle of helping a customer we would have a question and be sitting there for at least ten minutes waiting all the while the customer is getting impatient and starts to question us and our ability to do our job, so i say the trainers could have payed more attention to us when we had our hands up and had questions"
bad,"The hardest part of the job is dealing with irrate customers."
bad,This is not a business that I would encourage anyone to apply
bad,I have to honestly say that I did not enjoy working here at all. The entire time I worked there co-workers and management were so rude and were never there when you needed assistance. I would rather be homeless and broke than to work at this place again.
bad,"emergency services .lost or stolen credit cards.sending money via western union ,cancel cards"
bad,"I would only suggest this if your wanting something short term it is a very stressful job, the money is only really good when your doing overtime"
bad,"Calling Center "
bad,"Great starter job, out of high school, during college. Isn't a long term career."
bad,soul sucking job---horrible--stare at a computer screen all day and talk until your whole face hurts so bad you want to cry--no going to the bathroon from 5-7 cuz it's drive time--they do not care about their people jsut the bottom line horrible job
bad,Inconsistent practices. Work need in consistent management practices. 
bad,Outsource company and it showed in the management.  Not much direction or oppurtunity for growth.
bad,"awful, worst job ever--treated like a number-would never reccomend to anyone"
bad,Work was stressfull and very little appreciation was put forth by company.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,the days are stressful if you've never had sales experience or not well with interacting with people it's not a good enviroment to put yourself in. There's constant drama everyday
bad,"This company is horrible, they do not understand how their employees feel or work becuase they push things that they have never done or attempted. Management does not care about their employees and they only care about sales and meeting quotas, they do not even care about making the customers happy."
bad,Answering customers questions and complaints for a medical insurance.
bad,"Convergys is not an ideal place to work. You do not get paid what you are suppose to make, you have to clock in 5 minutes before your shift but you do not get paid for it. The training is a joke. They give you the basics and the rest you have to figure out by trial and error. When you go to your team leader, trainer, or supervisor with questions, you are ignored. I love talking to my customers but hate the company itself. They are more about the sales and not the customers. And if it were not for the customers, there would be no job."
bad,This company is now closed but it was a basic call center job. Poorly managed and very unprofessional at times.
bad,"A typical day at work would be assisting each customer with quality service during every single call. I learned how important quality customer service truly is. Management was okay, but most of my co-workers were awesome. The hardest part of the job was not being able to accomodate each customer. The most enjoyable part of the job was training."
bad,"Today at work was a yet typical day but still there was something learned new today which i learn something new everyday! Our company has moved to a new company so everything is different now, there is a new dress code, new learning system, and new managers. Ive learned today how to pull up 20 systems at once and be focused on only one that was kind of hard because im use to working with only 8 systems at once so thats going to take a little time. but the most enjoyable part of my day was getting to know our new managers and how nice they all are and what they have to offer for our company."
bad,A typical work day included taking multiple inbound calls from Sprint customers. A full work day usually totaled about 75 per shift.
bad,I originally accepted the position only to receive health care benefits. I was very good at the work but I did not enjoy it
bad,There were alot of things that I would change about this job and how people would communicate with each other to get the work done
bad,Mondays and Fridays are the busiest days. I learn how to deal with the customers.
bad,The pay sucked and I did not like having to put up with the customers and their attitudes for little pay.
bad,Make you think the job is better and more stable. Lie about how the company is going then cuts hours without any warning. Pay is good but with no hours u get no pay.
bad,"Employer creates an hostile environment by over scheduling employees to seats available. Employees are fighting to get seats when they arrive and when they leave to go on breaks. Meantime a timekeeping system is marking them tardy or absent. Supervisors do not resolve issues, ongoing the whole year I worked for this Employer. Also Employer does not give the required breaks allowed by law often make employees work five to six hours before giving a break."
bad,"Convergy's is not the most convenient place to work if you've got health related issues. The equipment is never cleaned, and accounting is constantly messing up on the pay, in that they always seem to pay less than they should. Besides that, despite having the amount of employees that they do, they can never seem to keep anyone on a set schedule."
bad,Do not ever work there. You are just a number. They will treat you badly.
bad,"Not sure that this company can be rated with five stars. The work is rewarding, I love helping people and being of service, but the demands of making sales for the products seems to over-ride the quality of good customer service, leaving many people, stressed out or not able to continue on with this company."
bad,Concentrix does not care about their employees. The point system really sucks and they change your schedule every week! Its hard to keep up when you have a life outside of work!
bad,I have no review to enter in on this line. There are no comments I would like to make about this job. I've only worked there for some time and I have no complaints
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"that was one of the worst places to work, my manager is/was racist and showed it without fear of reprisal. when I complained to the supervisors about the behavior she was demoted but nothing was done to fix the problem my manager created."
bad,"The culture of company is Great Everyone worked with was amazing."
bad,"Everyone at the company is nice, its just not my kind of work. I like the challenge of selling things not just sitting around hoping someone might call"
bad,The management does not care about what you have going on and the team leaders are poorly trained.I liked helping customers but i would not recommend this job to anyone
bad,"The people that you will meet working for this company are all fantastic, diverse people with goals and potential to meet them. However, although the people you will work with are great, it does not make up for the fact that often times changes will be made to your schedule, as well as your job itself, without any prior warning to you. You will most likely have to take on additional responsibility at no extra pay."
bad,"Convergys is a world-class customer management firm."
bad,"Good place to work for. Worked from home. Was not able to select the schedule I wanted to work. I was only able to use PTO, which I didn't get much on each paycheck. Couldn't elect to request off without pay. Insufficient training. Was not able to listen to phone calls for training. Did not understand all the functions of the job. Threw us on the phones with little training."
bad,"Working with so many people is fantastic, but a more structured and reliable management team would be ideal."
bad,Bad experience they don't work around your life or what you have going on. I would never go back to work there. They lowered my pay I was making 11.50 when I started and H&R Block lost their contract so I had to go with Cabelas contract and I was making 10.00
bad,Worst place I have ever worked for.  Nobody has communication and the co workers are rude and discuss respectful. I dread my small work area. And the people around it.
bad,I liked it at first but this go into 24 bull c%@# is what drives people over the edge. If that stopped then I would think more people would stay there..for every hour you work you have 1 minute bathroom time.I would love to go back but things would have to change
bad,"Look. It's not that bad. The only complaints I have, are the paychecks and the rules. "
bad,"The company is ok, i personally am not to fond of it. The job is easy and the company give you the chance to always move up. The pay is ok, and its good for people who are looking for something quick."
bad,"Convergys is an okay company if you are trying to gain weight and be stressed completely out. The training department was great, but once you hit transition, its like impending doom. Management, coaches, teamleads, and trainers are all on a different page (at least for the AT&T project). They lack communication between them. One person will tell you that its okay to do one thing, and others say that is wrong and you have to do it like this. It is NOT a difficult job and could be quite enjoyable if they would get their stuff together. Also you can't have anything healthy at your desk besides liquids. All you are allowed to have is hard candy. If you want to gain weight, great job to have! They won't even allow dehydrated fruit. Its a little ridiculous. So not pro-health!"
bad,its really good working her because the staff are very helpful in addition to this the working hours and everything else is really good and very helpful and flexible.
bad,"Concentrix is a good company."
bad,"I enjoyed my job with convergys, they were good to their employees."
bad,For better prospects and career build managing and controlling all the co_staffs reporting to senior managing time puntual cooperate with the team staffs all who the are working with me
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,very good place to work for and would go back if was asked too to go back great people and always had the hours that was given to me or the extra hours i asked for
bad,Really nice work calm professional work environment with great management that shows a strong interest and company growing and expanding the workplace
bad,Good place to start your career as a customer service representative. Pay was not so fantastic but training was pretty good. Team leaders were good as well.
bad,awesome place to work  24 hour operation    i deal with GM dealer only  we have about 20 different departments with in the On Star family.
bad,"As a telemarketer and customer service representative, my responsibilities included promoting a wide"
bad,They keep moving your matrix on what counts for your bonus. So they are taking away the opportunity to make money to support your livelihood.  If you don't live by yourself this may be fine.
bad,"Training was okay. The pay is decent I suppose. Once out of training they put you on a team. I was on a team for a week before I met my actual team leader. It’s a good stepping stone into a call center, but it was very disorganized."
bad,There is not much to say about this company.  The coworkers for the most part are easy to get along with. Sometimes you feel like you are in high school with all the gossip but other than that if you do your job you will be fine.
bad,I hated it there. It was the worst experience ever. This was my most stressful job ever. Management showed favoritism. The building was ran down and filled with bugs and mice.
bad,Working there was due to people that only knows their friends from the inside for you to work regularly there if you don't you will be dismissed if they don't like you..
bad,"The pay for this company is amazing, but with a great pay scale comes with a horrible work environment. We’ve had fights break out on the call center floor, people would steal others food from the break room, no PTO would be available, which made it easy to get points. They do not work with you on your schedule. Asking for PTO is like asking for 1 million dollars. It never happens. I have a really sick mom, and there were times when I just couldn’t make it to work, so I would have to take a point because of it even though I’ve had PTO. It’s unfair to the people. They don’t care about your personal life. If you’re in college, this is not the place to work. Do not get sick, they’ll fire you."
bad,"I have nothing good to say about this company. It is a typical call center. No Comment it is a typical call center, well maybe not typical ok. What el"
bad,"It's worse than high school. A bunch of young women ""trying"" at supervision. If you are Gen X or baby boomers, the silly way that you are spoken to anytime you have a question is absurd. Forget RESPECT if you want a CHECK!"
bad,"Concentrix were great at first, good first impression, and got along well with everyone in the team. Training should have ran longer, with less emphasis on up selling. I don't think we were given a physical contract to sign-in is that even legal?  Volunteered to move to a different department, little training or support provided. May as well have gone in blind-folded. None of my calls were listened to. Team meetings never happened. People were only interested in how much availability there was. People couldn't be bothered to do their jobs properly . Managers were nice though, and I got on well with my team. HR are abysmal. Overall, not the place I would recommend working."
bad,I had bad anxiety while being on the floor and it does not help that the Team Lead told us if we mess up once than we would lose our job. Instead of being encouraging they were making us terrified to do our job.
bad,"This job was pretty stressful, I feel management did not care about the employees, no time off was ever approved, i was not very happy working in this company"
bad,"I would never recommend this place to anyone, they have horrible management and hours, they tell you that you are able to choose your hours, they they bid it out based on your performance, so if your good at your job you get the good hours if your not so good you get last choice."
bad,Convergys is a good starting place to get into customer service but I would  not recommend a long term position there due to instability in scheduling.
bad,"US sites not given adequate support, guidance or training.Company presents as if they are concerned about people, but their strategies and decisions are all driven by analytics......you are JUST A NUMBER AT CONCENTRIX!!!"
bad,Poor management. Better customer service. Increased pay for different lines of business. All employees training in natural disaster routing. Provide m
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Too many ppl having realtions with each other and bring their problems to work. Supervisor sleeping with agents and showing favoritism. HR not helpful and higher mang doesn't allow agents to speak. You must keep a paper trail on whatever is said to u they lie a lot
bad,"Convergys was a oppurtunity I was blessed with at the time, I would recommend but I also wouldn’t. In a way convergys caused unwanted pressure and stress."
bad,"The output in medical claims were more important than accuracy unless you were audited, then accuracy would cost you a pay bonus, which was unable to be reached by me for the 6 months that I worked there."
bad,"Terrible Management, inconsistency especially with pay and overtime. Too many distractions in the work place. Good place to get call center experience but no room for advancement"
bad,very knowledgable job and you can move up quickly working your butt off but too much drama and gossip and no one cares about the employees and not a happy place to work for sure
bad,To be honest.. this job is cold calling.. mithering people in the day time whilst at work.. id say 80% dont have the time to speak to you but they pressure you to keep them on the line to make a sale.. to be honest its a very noisy American atmosphere with clapping and very hard to hear.. if your desperate for a job and sell its for you.. but be warned there very strict and listening to you while you chat to customers in my opinion i thought nah i need to get out and find a real job.. good luck if you try..
bad,The job was not what it seems. It was not a good company to work for and they treated people like garbage. I am glad that they are closing down in the town that I am living in.
bad,I left several years ago.  I no longer wanted to work in a call center culture.  Not sure how it is lately.  I have only driven past the location recently.  Most people I knew that worked there have left since my depature.
bad,Akways be prepare to work as soon a I clocked in. Very serious fast pace and tedious because we dealt with patients and medications so HIPPA was was very vital.
bad,I really dont want to write a review. i did not enjoy much bout this company i strongly believe it lacks in management and how most departments are ran.
bad,"They do bot care about you unless you are doing your job 200%."
bad,Simply don’t waste your time with the stress and worrying. The environment is is not great for working in and nd also management is very difficult to work with.
bad,Horrible place to work so unorganized not enough seats to accommodate the people hired half of the computers they do have are broken . If you have kids or medical issues where you have to constantly take time off of work this is not the job for you they are not family oriented at all . You do get paid time off sometimes and allowed to get time off but have to request 2 weeks in advance also unlimited overtime and incentives for perfect attendance high scores etc but it’s like high school in here
bad,"Long story short, Convergs did not follow up on any of the hiring attributions they put out. We never received our raised, we worked the same schedules all 9 months, despite them telling us they would change. Mine happened to be 6am-330pm. The team leaders do nohing but gossip with each other about the employees, and about the CEOSs upstairs being untrustworthy. This place is just bottom line unprofessional"
bad,"It was not a terrible place to work, although the constant changes in procedures, inconsistency in what was and was not expected and no positive feedback on performance reviews made every day feel like your job was being hung over your head."
bad,This is the most stressful job you have. It's not the work that makes I stressful it's the fact that because you work there you will have no life. The force you to work overtime (mandatory overtime) by adding an option extra hour to your shift and making you work for half your lunch. Sure the pay is great but it isn't worth your soul. It is even said that a lot of people who do work there end up with PTSD. if you value your you time I would put this job as no go.
bad,They don't care about anything beside the company. Your social life will not exist while working for this company. You can have a doctor excuse but will still get points deducted.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,customer service is not the problem the team leader and management is very disrespectful. the management doesn't follow companies rules. to as a whole the company is a disappointment.
bad,Nothing much to say about the company as it is not in my career and not upto the mark in regards to salary as i have to compromise for the same but the name is with the fame also for the company
bad,I am open for shifting schedules as long as it will somehow adhere to what the contract indicates. Shifting schedule i believe is necessarily that everyday your schedule will change. And every Month you will change your Team leader. I am very adaptive to change. As long as i can still have time for myself and my Family.
bad,"This job is not as it appears to be. it is entirely sales oriented, they will not work with any schedule and will keep your days off as far away from each other as possible."
bad,"It was all about sales, they didn't take into consideration people are people and that not everybody was meant for sales. When asked to transfer to a different position I was told not to and that I would excel eventually when I applied for customer service in the first place. Work drama around you, just unpleasant. So many fraud occurrences. Just horrible."
bad,This management weren't great. I did learn a lot. My customer service skills improved drastically. I just didn't like sitting in one spot answering phone calls back to back all day. I'm sure some people enjoy it. Just wasn't right for me.
bad,"During my employment there were many times inappropriate & disrespectful things occurred. However, I was taught to up-sell/market our product. The hardest part of the job was finding an open work space. The best part was the conversations with the clients."
bad,Marketing dog food to people as they came in your store. Easy job to do but hardly any pay.... just enough to get to work and back home nothing else. Managers were extremely strict about sticking to the rules and would NOT help at all. Lunch was not provided nor did you get breaks.
bad,"All managers do is throw people under the bus. No job security Netflix is now gone. Company is downsizing. Everyone just points the finger all day. I dont feel safe ever in that place. Fights break out, people smoke marijuana. Just ugh! Avoid this place if you can. HR Consultants are no help. The place is ran by a bunch of High School Drop Outs."
bad,this is not a good fit because your hours are not flexible. you get 7 hours and that is considered part time with no lunch. This is not a job for a person that is married or has children because you work constantly with no real time off.
bad,The Company has a very high turn over and they want good customer service. They also want speed and a High Adherence which means get the customer off the phone as quick as possible which is a Conflict of Interest.
bad,I started Convergys at the OnStar site. Training was simple. This company is a joke. $10 an hour for all the thing you must do on a daily basis. I was severely ill in July and had to be out of work for weeks and I still got attendance points for not coming in. SAD!! Do not work for this company. 29 people started in my training class and all of us moved on!!
bad,"- Monotonous days at work"
bad,Learned about the company Directv and specific programming packages. The over all environment had activities for teams. Also provided time to improve on an individual level with weekly meetings with the supervisors.
bad,Hardest part of the job is the technology failing during busy times. It's a busy day everyday. My most enjoyable part of the job was my training my trainer was the BEST!
bad,"this employee is only for high school students, college students or someone between jobs.this job dosent care about anything other than the bottom line, money"
bad,"Listen to 6-9 calls and Identify critical behavior."
bad,"The worst place ever. It is a great place to get Call "
bad,"Attending outbound calls with angry customer is one of the typical day at work."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,at first it was a good place to work but when rogers took over it got progressively worse. everything was about selling even when it did not make sense. pay was o.k but sucked compared to other called centres benefits were decent but vacation was divided you could take only 1 week off in 6 months instead of taking a full 2 weeks
bad,"I really felt that this Company doesn't have its employees best interest and I do understand its the business, but it's not as compassionate as I thought."
bad,"great employees, inconsistent communication from leadership, client vendor relationship challenges, small classrooms for training, make shift training department"
bad,"The contract netflix is fine, but minacs is a joke they expect you to work and take verbal abuse from customers for 9.50. Management is real funny acting you have to be clique' to get a promotion, they dont care about your scheduling needs either"
bad,I would never work there again. Manages are not empathetic. Rules and policies change constantly. No support. No job security. Expensive benefits.
bad,Was a great place to work. Then a change in Operations Management and it became unbearable. Micro Management. Extremely high Stress factors. Too much inconsistency between Team Leaders. Different answers from Team Leaders. No one on the same page. Right hand and left hand in different worlds. Q an A Supervisor had no concept of the customers demands. She had never taken any calls and therefore had no clue as to what the agents were up against.
bad,This company couldn't care less about it's employees. They outsource jobs out of the U.S.
bad,There's some pretty good people here to work with. I personally am not a fan of the systems used here but that could just be due to receiving different info to the same question by several different people. This position is just not quite my forte as I'm not really into being a sales person.
bad,There is no room for growth and lots of turn over. Seek better employment.
bad,This is only a have to job. The management doesn't have a career path and the pay is dismal. Management treats employees as they are children and not bright
bad,"I learned to take orders over the phone for may business, being a customer service agent for many companies, took insurance claims, and credit card applications. I would answer the phones and be knowledgeable about the product or company the caller was calling for. I had to act as a manager for companies as management for me was almost impossible to contact when you needed them. I never got to meet my co-workers because I worked from home and the workforce changed constantly. The hardest part of the job was getting information needed to do the job if you didn't know where to get the information you didn't have the ability to make sales. I liked working by myself and not having to be in an office where you sat side by side doing your work and having a very difficult time dealing with the customers because you had no guidance."
bad,no good - hated it - it sucked - great co -workers but we all hated the job - who wants to hear negativity from the moment you start your day til the time you clock out
bad,There was no communication in the company there wasn't much room advancement.
bad,The company is not steady or reliable here in valdosta
bad,The company was not flexible and did not care for the employees.
bad,"Concentrix is not a good place to work by any means."
bad,Management is horrible. They want more but they take away more from the employees. Pay is way below what it should be. Favortism and discrimination are rampit.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,It started off as a really good job. but every month it is harder and harder to get bonuses. pay varies every month. The have advisors where I work doing mandatory 10 hour days. if you don't want to do 10 hour then your more then welcome to find another job.
bad,this place is petty and dangerous. People get drunk and high in the parking lot before coming into answer calls. A female attempted suicide in the bathroom december 2018 because of the harassment. Managers dont want to know about incidents here but  claim an opendoor policy Trainers and associate trainers harass people on the floor because it gives them a sense of power. There are no security cameras 🎥 on the floor so trainers/associate can harass employee at will with out fear of retaliation or proof of their wrongdoings.
bad,"long hours, poor management who does not care about employees, job is draining, scheduling can be annoying and no room for advancement. just want you to work, work and work."
bad,"processes change multiple times per month, opposing instructions from different managers, agents share headsets (huge hygiene problem). Low wages. No work-life balance. Agents regularly don't get paid on time, and sometimes your pay is short. Very chaotic and unprofessional environment."
bad,"If you looking for a manager to advise and actually provide guidance, prepare you for a career goal, know the knowledge of the process of the position and is never at the office to over look the department and relies on the trailer hood rats to be the pseudo manager then you are welcome to work here. You will be negatively talked about and watched like your in prisoner in Rikers Island."
bad,"This is mainly for their hiring and training departments"
bad,"Better pay would make employees more appreciative of the position held and more incentives, I feel like it’s more of who you know at Concentrix to evolve and excel in the company. They don’t allow the good employees a chance at evolving."
bad,"Game playing, high school bull. "
bad,"No help from the so called Team Leader. Constantly reviewing calls and quick to point out flaws or what could have been better, first the call was too long, next time sounds like you were rushing the customer. They're were just way too hard to please. They tell you it's not a sales position yet if you dont sell enough it affects your overall weekly scores. Just too much going on, would not recommend this company, if you want to keep your sanity intact!!!"
bad,"Worked on the Intuit account, when I was interviewed they failed to tell me that it was only a temporary position, instead I was told it was a full time position. You only get a week of training and then you're thrown out on the call floor without hardly any help. Plus you actually had to post on a message board (where all employees could see) to ask permission to go to the bathroom, break or lunch"
bad,Don’t recommend. The management doesn’t care to make you better. The least amount of work they can do the better and if you fail they won’t hesitate to fire you even though they don’t take the time to help you.
bad,If you are looking for something fast they will hire you quickly . But for the long run no . They sometimes offer free stuff and food but managers suck and they act like they care but don’t really
bad,the money was ok but the worst part was getting yelled at allday long by people when it was not your fault.  on the positive side you got to here some really stupid problems.
bad,The job was ok as far and he work but need better training and management attitude did not make you feel comfortable the job. no qualified instructors to help
bad,"Bonuses and incentives declined over a short period of time.  Team leaders not as supportive as should be.  Grading of calls very strict and unfair. Customers allowed to speak to reps very foul and ugly without intervention of team leaders even when asked to help. Team leaders only would refer rep to utilize tools, ""scripted retort"". Most times quotes never applied to real situations.  Reps were pinged for not handling call in a particular manner or reaching out to a supervisor.  Even when being cursed by the customer, reps were still expected to make a sale. Pretty stressful."
bad,"The work itself was not cut out for me. At one point I was getting rude customers on the daily and decided I wanted to"
bad,The Delivery Executive constantly made poor decisions which tricked down to the management. There was a huge nepotism problem and they pay much lower than the average for the positions they employ.
bad,"The environment is very similar to any call centre environment. If your bathroom breaks are too long, you're penalized. The direct management is not really helpful in any inquiries you have. Long hours, little option to trade shifts and when there is, it's only accessible through the work server."
bad,"Overall job is alright "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,The days I needed for dr appointment were denied all the time and I could never take a day off. They didn’t wanna give me the days off due to my religious beliefs.
bad,Management is hard to get a hold of when you need help. You should be reviewed once a week to help with improvements but that usually did not happen with me. You have to force sells on people to make good stats.
bad,Favoritism at its finest. If you kiss butt all day long you might get a promotion. Unable to accommodate shifts.  The hardest part of the job is being screamed all day.
bad,"Difficult to stay positive, extremely strict working conditions, no flexibility, very low morale. Superiors constantly expect more and offer nothing. We are given laughable 'committees' with no budget and no support, and are told that we are responsible for our own morale. Your time in the bathroom is monitored, you are disciplined for things out of your control like train delays, employees who perform well are expected to perform better with no incentive to do so and employees who do nothing aren't penalised. There are no windows, no sunlight. Its depressing."
bad,"During my time at Convergys, you could tell it would not be a permanent fit. Lack of professionalism is one of the main causes of not being interested in the job. Rules are loosely enforced by management."
bad,I highly doubt this review will help anyone since its nearly 20 years since I last worked there. It was just an entry level job much like working at Wendy's. Horrible product to support didn't help either. Just stayed long enough to find another job.
bad,"just a job to get your basic bills paid, not really any job satisfaction, high turnover rate, they hire a bunch of people every couple weeks, by the end of the training the class is empty, people left! and you get fired easily also"
bad,I was a representative with an inbound queue. I needed the flexibility at the time to be able to work from home so this was a good opportunity for me at that time.
bad,"Het werk was interassant maar best stressvol."
bad,"Work life Limited advancement,."
bad,"While colleagues for the most part were genuinely helping each other, the management fails to listen to the team’s advice. As per most call centre enviroments, management is too focused on metrics.  "
bad,"Management will put you where they want you to go at anytime they want, regardless of what you want or what you don't want. You are an employee and in exchange for money, you have no option but to work. Your only out is if someone in position likes you, or quit."
bad,"If you don't know someone in high places there is no room for you to move higher then senior advisor.  The pay is low and the only rises you get are very low to the point of being useless, such as a $0.03 per hour rise."
bad,you do everything. And you work beyond office hours to get things done. You work extra with no pay. Not enough salary to compensate your needs. Bad management.
bad,"was not able to accommodate people of disability.  ergonomically unsafe workplace. broken chairs. computers on tables. documentation provided but not enough.  Only place I have ever worked at that said customers were allowed to verbally abuse you and you had to take it."
bad,"The job was okay. And i use that phrase very VERY loosely. From where i lived, it was a 20 minute commute to work everyday which i did not mind. It was in a nice area which made it even better. In the 4 months that I actually worked there, I learned many things about the company we were actually working for (a vendor site). Management was a tad bit iffy. Depending on which managers you got, their job was just to sit there and feed you information. Since we were chat only, our supervisors didn't take escalations at all. We had to transfer to a different department for that. Towards the end of my time there, they tried to butter us up with free snacks during specific days, free cake, playing video games, etc. "
bad,"Convergys has many options due to being a call center. My individual contract has become cut throat and demeaning. The work itself is overly stressful and consistently changing. If you get a good team leader that will work with you, you may have less scheduling issues, however you have a set amount of time you can miss before you are terminated and you are required to use specific verbiage on every phone call. This would not be an issue if individuals were required to say typical things, however we are required to thank callers for our jobs, or again we are able to be terminated from employment."
bad,"There is a potential to make money but employees are very disposable to Concentrix so job security is not likely. The rules seem to change on a daily basis and management will get rid of anyone to protect the managers. They give extra hours without even asking for and say its mandatory to do, but at the time of joining they say that its not mandatory.  If you are a person who just needs money then this is the job for you."
bad,Company run completely off who you know not what you know. If an internal position becomes available you can apply but they will already know who they want to have the job beforehand so more than likely a waste of time and effort. Positions in HR have been offered internally to people at there choosing which were never even advertised or the person interviewed for.  If you've no interest in moving up in the company then go for it but if you do you should try make a good friend in management! With the unfair pay some people work hard for a bonus they don't receive yet they are automatically given to mentors even tho they literally do what they want.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"- VGH (Voluntary Go Home) but we are FORCED to go home (2 hrs work then EL (Extended Lunch, no pay) then we are asked to log out already. Imagine I'm from Bulacan and I worked in Makati. Travel time is longer than my work hours. Then you are not paid because you are asked to go home because of low volume calls."
bad,"I worked in the healthcare division of Convergys. It was a revolving door staff, with unreasonable policies for their workers. You only received a 20 minute lunch, with 15 minute breaks for a full workday. At one point I was denied access to the bathroom."
bad,"Very stressful, expectation for new hires is total unbalanced, TL and Sme's can be very rude, lack of support for home workers, your left waiting for someone to help you when you have customers on hold. Constantly being called on because you cannot do a case up in under 3 minutes, worse job I have ever had"
bad,"work in convergys was not fun but i will take it as a learning opportunity, there were very long Hours and the expectations to know what the did not train you on was there too"
bad,Calling current AT&T customers and trying to upgrade their landline with AT&T long distant plans.  Different packages to offer clients depending on their needs or wants.
bad,"This is a place for those who are just looking for work for a short term, as it is based on contracted work from different companies. Very poor management from supervisors while I was there temporarily while waiting on another job."
bad,"at one point this was a good place to work, but at the time i left the company it had started into a downward spiral.  Upper management came up with a culture, but proceeded to ignore it when convenient. If you know the right people and don't make any waves you are all set, but otherwise you not last. The rules only applied to those that were not performing as the company wanted."
bad,"Convergys was a great place to work when I began several years ago.  "
bad,"A typical work day at Convergys is completely random. You will never know what you will see or experience with this company. They are a 3rd party vendor for Onstar, without any of the Onstar benefits. You are generally working for Onstar, but convergys' name is on your check. It is a low level customer service platform that trains you how to accommodate customers and that is where the advancement options end. In order to move up is to rub elbows with the right people  and be recognized as a brown noser yes man with no soul. Doesn't matter how hard you work or go above and beyond, this is company and its client ie Onstar is completely toxic. Upper management has no regard for you or the quality that you bring to the table. you are a number  they can work for as long as they can. Not to mention the mass that they hire is atrocious. Many of its employees are not professional nor do they have class. Don't waste your time with this place."
bad,To not Excel or shine here. They will find ways to get rid of you. They will make promises they will not keep and cause more issues. The best way to survive is just be a corporate monkey.
bad,"If you're fresh out of rehab or jail, this is a good job or if you have no self esteem, or are looking for a reason to lose the esteem you do have, this is the place for you"
bad,Convergys work environment is really ghetto and unprofessional. They have picks and favorites as far as the team leaders. They give you all over the wall work schedules
bad,"BPO company with less fun loving environment."
bad,"Excellent if you have no family life, schedule restrictions and no desire to advance.  The training was adequate albeit full of drama.  Once you are on the phones if you can adhere to your schedule and do your job you'll be fine."
bad,"Required to make 200 phone calls during an 8 hour shift. Write ups if quotas not met. No raises. No advancement. Supervisors showed a lot of favoritism to employees they liked, were much harder on the ones they did not like."
bad,"The workload is too much than what they pay the employee, as well as they make the employees feel that the service they provide is as if too much. They want more and more then what they give and the job security is very bad! you can just get suspended for a reason that is not even on the handbook and lacks proof of their faults."
bad,"Management is a bunch of arrogant jerks with little to no communication skills. They constantly play favorites and it feels like a giant Kindergarten class. Training lacks any real value, mainly just ""check the knowledgebase"" bull. The workplace culture is as diverse as one can expect. Hardest part of the job is that they expect unreal expectations. If at all possible, do not work for them."
bad,"Typical call centre work. Training is thorough, however, once you're on the floor don't expect any help. Team leaders generally avoid having to get involved with complicated calls. Job can be really stressful due to the policies and procedures created by the client and company. Wouldn't go back and work here even if they offered to double my salary. You get treated worse than a child in grade school, having to put your hand up to request if you can use the washroom. High stress, low pay, if that's your bag, go for it, they'll love you.  Wear a diaper."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,In concentrix if you need best out of  employees the supervisor and trainer should be more encouraging and enthusiastic instead of scaring the new employees about the Inbound  calls.
bad,"I have been with them for almost 3 years.  You don't get your bonuses unless the whole team meets the goal.  Even if you have met the goal.  So you have to carry those that don't do their job and they don't get punished for it."
bad,"lots of work for such little pay, they expect you to want to be there but all that seems to happen is people being rude or comments revolving around the building. its like working in jail for minimum wage."
bad,"This organization tends to gloat that their CEO was once in the company taking calls and so to try to say that you can become the CEO if you focus on the company."
bad,"the schedule changes constantly, the bonuses are nearly never accurate, the management is a joke, the phone call requirements are unnatural and seen through quickly by the customers."
bad,Schedules were not honored at all. I told this employer I had child care issues not to mention other activities I was involved in after work hours and in 3 months my schedule was changed 5 times and never once were my original stated hours honored.  There is a general lack of management support and agents were mostly left to twist in the wind.  You are evaluated slowly based on surveys from customers yet customers are made to wait on the phone for hours because there is a general lack of information provided to agents.
bad,This place is not organized. They don't care about you or your personal life. They run on the point system. You get points for being a minute late no grace period. You could be sick with strep throat for 3 days and you would still get points for everyday you missed even if you have a doctors note.
bad,"I only recommend this job for students coming out of high school, I wouldn't even recommend this job to college students.... it is very unprofessional."
bad,Very poor company to work for in a job for 8 weeks after training and told us they lost a contract and we needed to look for a new job. Poor HR hadn't a clue what was happening
bad,The job environment is just uncomfortable the turn around is ridiculous and there are people in positions that don't know how to handle their job title responsibilities
bad,a beginners job that is all i will say. if you are just starting out this is an ok job to start with. i have nothing more to say about this company.
bad,"In this organization our AM behaviour is not good,its treat like a employees are a student.In this company salary package is not good"
bad,"I advise you to avoid this place as much as possible. Its a good place to be until you find better, not to stay. They don't care about their employees or management.  All they do is fire all of the good managers, that stand up for what's right. When you're sick and in the hospital, they don't call to check on you. Instead when you return to work they make you getc a doctor's note and still don't excuse your absence. The employees come to work looking like they just rolled out of bed, wearing pajamas, head scarfs, gym clothes, and crock tops. So unprofessional!"
bad,Not the best place I've ever worked... Extremely high turnover rate. Team leaders were nice but anyone in a higher position wasn't the greatest to deal with... Now they pay low and expect too much from everyone
bad,"its like a black hole where all the trash gets sucked into. the only good thing about that place was some of the people."
bad,I would not recommend anyone to work here if you want to work in a professional work environment. They are unprofessional and the computers and phones barely ever worked.
bad,I have never worked for a company who had such horrible management skills...and communication skills. This company is very selfish and greedy. I worked there almost 4 years with one wage increase at 90 days. People hired after me with less experience were earning more than rest of people on the floor.
bad,"Very stressful due to high call volume frustrated customers and very complicated and over detailed computer systems to operate which makes problem solving for customers long and unnecessary. It used to be a fun environment to work in when it was just  DirecTV ,but since the AT&T merger the  environment has become hard to be in  that lot of agents are leaving  for other jobs  and un certain as far as job security. Many good people got fired that had been there for years, and the turnover rate has become very rapid. When it was just DirecTV it was a feeling of family and a caring environment but since the merger the mood is very reptilian and kind of cold"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,This company will never care about you and have absolutely no goal to have quality employees. Quantity over quality.
bad,When you get through training they put you an on the floor and expect you to up sell everything you can. The hours are never set and breaks are almost nothing. If you want all the hours you could ever want and do not have to worry about the schedules. This is a great job for you! Not a bad place to work for those reasons. But it does take a lot out of you.
bad,The building is a dungeon. The pay is not competitive. They thing if they give you free tv services that makes up for not paying better hourly.
bad,but that was aboiut the onlhy good thing i can say bout the place it the room was alway to hot and crapped most of the other team just lacked bout
bad,"Polyglots instructed by monoglots. WFM chaotic , philosophy of all stick and no carrot. Great colleagues , incompetent management who give contradictory orders and work haphazardly."
bad,This place was the worst place every. I was not said what is bad but it is not a place you want to stay long. •	Prepared complete and accurate work to update customer files need more traning
bad,"Not much to say about the company.. they say it's easy to ""grow"" in the company when they hire you, but I had yet to see someone in a different position.. even when there was an available position, a person who was WELL QUALIFIED held the position TEMPORARILY while they brought someone from a completely different program and trained them for SIX WEEKS, then sat the temporary person back down as an agent.. NOT cool. If you're fresh out of high school you may enjoy this job but wouldn't recommend this job to anyone who is mature, and family oriented. The only way you get a halfway decent schedule is if you're less than 40 hours due to ""school"" or ""daycare"" (seen people without kids bring in ""daycare schedules""). The place is seriously just ridiculous. But I loved the work I did. The environment was just not one that I PERSONALLY could grow in."
bad,"I have been doing phone work for many years. This company exploits it's work force and pays extremely low wages for what this work involves. Call center work is about the same everywhere however I used to make double what I am making, doing this same work, shame on Convergys and it's customer for paying a non living wage. This company fosters a hostile work environment from the management team. I quit today because I was humiliated in front of my team, who I was really starting to dig. Stay away from this company it is a last resort job!!!!!"
bad,"The convergys in Tampa is ridiculous. "
bad,"Unorganized and disorienting place to work, systems constantly failed and management knowledge level was equivalent to newly employed representatives. Did not even increase pay with promotion, very disheartening place to work."
bad,"I was working in the sales part. the money was great but its supposed to be plus commission. i never got my commission check the entire time i was there. Also they have an EXTREMELY   high turn over rate, and people would get fired over simple things. would not recommend at ALL!!!"
bad,They are very unorganized and not professional. The company would be a great place to work at if they hire more professional people who know how to do there job.
bad,very unprofessional place of business and i would not recommend anyone to work for this company. you will not be happy working for these people and your check will be messed up every pay period.
bad,"SiriusXM is the branch I worked for under Convergys."
bad,Taking calls for OnStar.  Never had a set schedule and your schedule can change within 48 hours without you know at times.
bad,"This is a third party supplier of human resources to solve customer issues. They have contracts with sorts of companies which supply and serve or a product. I was on a computer repair account, an internet service provider account, and a cable television account. Customer issues ranged from repair, to billing, to retention, and up selling customers more services. The hardest part was maintaining composure with the next customer after being yelled at by the previous customer and not given an opportunity to fix their issue. Did not happen often. The best part was being recognized by my peers or management with doing a great job for the customer."
bad,A typical day at work involved worrying whether or not my schedule would be changed or it hadn't changed after I left work the previous day. I learned how to use billing systems. The management didn't really care about anybody but themselves. My co-workers were the best part of my day. Hardest part of was telling people that I couldn't help them. I enjoyed helping a plethora of people.
bad,"Overall, my experience at Convergys was not fantastic. "
bad,good for someone right out of high school. Place to learn how call centers work. Location is in a central area easy to and from.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Not worth it. Back ache, neck ache, the most uncomfortable chairs, unfair, not professional, and a lot of other bad stuff. Work this job to get what you need, and leave"
bad,"In my short time at Convergys, I was not pleased with how the department was operating. The Team Leads did not know much about how to run a call center, the environment was strict beyond imagination as it required a manager approval just to have cough drops at the desk among other things and it was an unpleasant experience. I have worked in several call centers over the last 14 years and have never hated a job so much as the one with Convergys. It is definitely one I will not be recommending to anyone."
bad,Answered inbound calls during the day. Upgraded and  sold Onstar products.  Made sure all customers were taken care of before the call ended.
bad,"Walk into the call center, sit at my desk where I couldn't have any paper, calendars, pics or anything for that matter, because we were handling customers accounts and the employer didn't want anyone copying customers information. I learned the importance of time management and how to assist a customer, while going above and beyond the call of duty. My co-workers were pleasant individuals who came from all walks of life, attempting to make a living working in a part time call center.  Every position was part time, except for the managerial positions, which were never available. The hardest part of the job was not being compensated for the various changes. Even when expectations shifted, more responsibilities were issued with no additional compensation or incentives. Employees who had been there for years were oblivious to raises, holiday celebrations or anything fun, that would require the staff to reward said employees.  I enjoyed talking to customers from various parts of the US and making sure there needs were being met."
bad,"You are expected to be a robot and not a human being, Over time hours often go unpaid, incentives that were promised go with out payment as well. Mandatory overtime, 30 min lunches after working for 9.5 hours. No room for advancement. Outside people who dont know the job are hired to manage advisers who are capable of leadership. Dead end job. Consistent check bi-weekly but that is the best and only good part of the job. Lots of loud young women conducting themselves as if it were a hangout and not an office place. Good Luck if you accept a job there, and good riddance  to your sanity."
bad,"Convergys was not a professional atmosphere, they do not compensate their employees well and they have a very high turn over rate."
bad,"They do not work with any of your scheduling...If you have a family pass up this job! They dont care all they care about is ""stats"""
bad,This is the kind of job that provides no security. You're only useful as long as the vendor tells the company you are. If the vendor company has an issue it results in half of the staff getting laid off. The management staff is also worried about keeping their jobs so you're on your own everyday you go into work. They do not tell you when you are no longer needed. You walk into work and if your badge doesn't work that means you are no longer employed.Terrible place to work.
bad,"I did enjoy my coworkers. I made a lot of friends that I continue to interact with today. During my time at Convergys there was a contract with Comcast Cable Company and there was a division of three departments, Cable, Internet and Phone service. The trainers were good but there was a lot of fraternizing within the company. I mostly kept to myself and focused on advancement opportunities that were never available. There wasn't a professional standard but the call center was mostly diverse. The hardest part of this job was being able to focus with all of the negative change and attrition. The work schedules were also the worst that I had every heard of which made the work/ life balance difficult.  The most enjoyable part of this job was learning how technology works and contributing problem solving techniques to the trainers. Convergys was a great start for me to learn phone etiquette and how technology works. As a Company, I hope that there has been some improvement with the level of professionalism and ethical behaviors within this company."
bad,Considering the price these customers pay for their vehicle they are completely rational and understandable on calls with Agents.
bad,point system sucks! if you are going to have a point system it could not be in conjuntion with your job service and personal proformance. And if you are going to punish someone so severly for time rational than you should have some kind of liway reguarding sureful different in times between machines.
bad,"I was employed at Convergys for only 3 months after being offered a position elsewhere. This place was the worst place to ever work. The management were very unorganized and the fact that Convergys is a third-party company is what I think make it worse. I worked for Charter Cable, (which I've never heard of until after I was given the job when my interview was over). Work-life balance was nonexistent. After my training class ended, no later than two weeks after, half of my class quit because of how discerning the place was. (It was 25 of us). The environment was VERY unsanitary and depressing. As a college student, I was told that I can have my schedule accommodated, didn't happen at all. As a call center rep at a third-party, I do believe we were placed into the ""bad calling que"" because I can only recall one customer being satisfied with the services. Every customer were rude and I felt so bad for them because of the services that they were given. If you are a college student like myself, very concerned about losing your nights and weekends, and if you have CHILDREN, this job may not be for you. It's all in what you make it and I'm pretty sure it all depends on the location as well, but I wouldn't recommend working here. The training was cool though. You'll have to literally work above and beyond JUST to get a decent work schedule if you may. I do HIGHLY recommend one to do ALL of their research before moving forward with this company. Their website doesn't do any justice."
bad,"Worst pay and nobody cares about you or the job you do for them. Air conditioning is always broken, and it gets so hot on the call floor that people get dizzy or sick. This happens weekly."
bad,"Richmond, VA location: they short checks every pay. Attendance is taken manually. Everyone that is promoted is usually someone favorite. This job shouldn't be you're permanent job. They do have a lovely office building. Management don't have a clue what there doing. Horrible place to work. No incentives are in place and you're on the phone more than 10% of the time"
bad,"While I worked there, someone was shot on the parking lot. "
bad,"over the last several months have fired 75% of new hires, and management, I have seen so many people that have busted there butts working there but have gotten fired just because management didn't get  along with them. As far as im concerned it was the best place I ever worked for the first year but I have recently grown to despise it due to the high school esque environment that has been happening as of late . They recently fired 2 of the best people in there positions and I feel that's  a sign of things to come."
bad,"Convergys would be a great company to work for if representatives were given the tools and proper training to do their job. Numbers are the only thing that matter at this call center and there is little opportunity for growth. Pay raises are available, granted that you do not miss a day of work during a 6 month period. This job is the best at getting someone started who is interested in doing customer service."
bad,"I worked at this job while being contracted by AT&T wireless. At first, the job was fun considering they trained you and ensured your skills for the first few months they were there. I heard the training only gotten better since I left. The problem with the place is the management. When I first got there, the top executive of the floor knew how to handle calls and resolutions to resolve this. He would composite the floor if we meet quota with bountiful raises and office parties. It was a shame when he got promoted (not because I didn't think he deserved it) but the lady who replaced him was your A-typical high school popular type girl. When this happened it was not what you know but who."
bad,"I loved meeting new people and working with customers. It makes me feel great to help a customer anyway I can. My experience there was VERY negative. The team leads were very rude to new employees, all they cared about were sales. We are commission based so I would lose sales because I could not get coaches to even answer me back in chat to help complete the sales transaction. In overtime I had a team leader call us names and demand us to stay over our scheduled shift until he said it was ok for us to leave. When you call Human Resources department to report an incident, nothing is ever done about it."
bad,Management is very unprofessional. Everyday is different rules changes and expectations change at the drop of a hate. All the employee are miserable working their. Their is no employee appreciation at all.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"At Minacs I find it difficult to keep an positive attitude. They stress that the customer is number one parodied , however the customers are at the mercie of poor floor management. There are three computer programs for provisioning customers accounts. Only one of the programs can provisioning from A to Z (CSM), which is the most difficult program to learn. Instead of up training the employee's that are there, they just keep hiring new people and train them with the latest program. This creates frustration and low manorial with those still forced to work with inadequate programs that limits their abilities to make commission on sales, even if they have taking the in to learn the system on there owe, they are forbidden to use it. There is a sales team, however all employee's are under pressure to make four sales a shift. Thou I am in customer care que, which means all other department will transfer there customer to customer care que for all corrections of billing, service issues, install and changes to their appointments, lowering their bill by changing their services, TSS (temporary season suspension) etc. When a customer wants to add or began service they are prompt to the sales department not CCA (customer care agent). As well if you don't tack the sales you have made they will be stolen. Mainly cause of the system, if a sales person on the floor or in the store makes an error in provisioning the customers order, the agent who corrects the order has now been placed as the agent who made the sale. Simply because to upgrade the system has been deem to costly. Thou the company"
bad,"At minacs I found it difficult to concentrate due to the fact that you have no personal space, it is very difficult to get days booked off and they are overall a very disorganized and stressful place to work."
bad,Supervisors befriend and show favortism to different employees
bad,unless you like being alone with no help on major issues this job is NOT for you. You sit at a computer get talked to very badly by the customers you help and the TL'S ONLY CARE ABOUT SALES!!!
bad,"I worked for this company for one full year..I recently resigned this week. Straight to the point...pay is $9.00/hr with a .40 raise if your attendance is below 1 point. then in another 6 months another .40 raise. You do not pick your schedule, they do that for you. You can be put on mandatory overtime with any notice. They expect you to check your schedule even on your days off. The BEST part of the job is working from home, learning about cell phones, learning your team and co-workers, and enjoying your days off. The WORST part is MANAGEMENT you have none, only people who go by titles. If you are on a call and need help, you have a long wait in chats, most team leads take just as long. They just listen to your calls and monitor your metrics. They will post for everyone to see when a customer gives you a compliment for excellent service. But does not change your pay, position or mean anything if you get a customer that is upset about their cell phone service and give you a bad score, and it is truly out of your control. God forbid you have a death in your family...My uncle died and I could not use bereavement pay because he is not considered immediate. I had to use a vacation day. Also, if you do not use your vacation time within a year you lose it all and they do not pay you for it. MANAGEMENT loves to make termination threats on a regular...SYSTEM ISSUES is a huge burden...They have incompatible software....They use a USB drive and if you get booted off the system. You have to call their help-desk and talk to people that are rude and not speaking the best English. They will"
bad,"• Coach, support, and develop 15 agents to ensure compliance with regulations and federal laws for telecommunication."
bad,no pay raises.Some Management doesn't treat the employees fair. My co-workers were awesome. We had the best boss. only 1/2 hr lunch
bad,A TYPICAL DAY AT WORK....
bad,During the first 6 months of my employment at Minacs I was happy with my job. I quickly learned that they put entirely way too much pressure on employees to perform without the tools needed to do so. I alon with many co-workers found the expectations to be enrealistic.
bad,"The company raised some ethical issue with me, I was hired as a customer service specialist and was turned into a pushy sales person."
bad,My experience was horrible. They were unorganized which lead to their closing.
bad,The work is easy but it's not a friendly environment. Management is not to par. Being a part of management I have no voice. Hardest part of the job is working with people who do have integrity or strong work ethic. I've learned it's not what you know or how well you do the job it's who you know. Most enjoyable part is I love training the agents.
bad,When this company took over our site they immediately starting cutting corners to save money. Most people lost their jobs and a lot of the companies pulled their contracts.
bad,"By far one of the most terrible places to work. However if you are apart of the management team, you won't have any complaints. The uneven pay scale favors heavily the salaried management team. If you are unfortunate enough to be apart of the hourly staff, you have a truly bleak outlook. It's been stated that there is room for growth and advancement for those who seek it. The truth is you are a rabbit on a treadmill with a carrot tied to a line dangling in front of you. I can say this because I am currently apart of the management team at the Farmington Hills, MI location. As an hourly employee, you will be lied to so that you will work at advancement to the best of your abilities. If you decide to verify what I'm saying by applying for a position, ask this question during your interview,"" How often are performance reviews given and what is the average pay increase associated with those reviews?"". It has been said that people that go through struggles together tend to become close because of that struggle. This is why 9 of 10 of the people that have submitted reviews, that were not told to do so to boost the ratings, will say that the people that they work(ed) with was/is the only pro."
bad,"Combined bill specialist for AT&T solving billing issues,upgrading services selling new services for U-Verse TV and highspeed internet,and digital phone service.My supervisor is awesome,like most of my co-workers.Most enjoyable part of the day breaks and lunch.Hardest part of the job is to solve problems and sell product or upgrades irate customers ina timely matter."
bad,"was not happy at all with that companie , does not handle themselve in a professional manner"
bad,"Its a job and it is a place where you can the experience you need to move on to a call center geared towards advancements, benefits, and success. You have to start somewhere, so why not there!"
bad,Customer service for a major telcom. Pay was about the same that people made there 10-15 years ago. Poor compared to most call centers. No assigned workspace or equipment. (Do you want to use someone else's headset?)
bad,"Convergys is a hard place to work. The company is centered on sales, never mind employees, because if this one won't, there's a line at the door."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,face paste learned well but training class was very boring management is all about numbers and not enough about saving the customer the co-workers were great for the most part the hardest part of the job is not knowing when your last day will be the most enjoyable part of the day was going home
bad,"I would take about 300+ calls a day, I learned what TRUE customer service really is without dealing with customers face to face. Management was okay there. The hardest part about this job is that I had to resign because it needs way more security, and advancement, i want to be able to be with an company and make it become my career. MOST enjoyable part about my job, helping customers, and up-training new workers."
bad,Professional skills on the phone in a call center type of environment. Management mediocre.
bad,"Worked here for over a year. Never got yearly raise. Never got bereavement. They do offer overtime regular, but only because turnover is so high. They tell you that you can advance, but that is only if you in cliques."
bad,"The people (other agents) were really nice and helpful but the issues seemed to be a huge lack of communication between managers and agents. Rules would change all the time and no one ever knew which was current and which weren't, each manager would think different things were correct which made it more confusing for us agents."
bad,"If you're content with getting promotions soley on favoritism and certain people receiving special treatment this is the place for you. Hard work doesnt accomplish much here, its all about who you know and socialize with."
bad,In training we did not get to learn the programs we would be using due to the practice system being down. We were thrown on the phones live and expected to perform to their standards when we were not given any time to see the systems prior or knowledge on how to navigate them.
bad,"Management wasn't involved really  and pay was horrible. And training wasn’t as helpful, it went by fast. When you reached the floor it wasn’t much help."
bad,Work for about a year at this company. First time at a call center and a very poor experience. Management was more interested in finding a date. Unable to take bathroom breaks unless it was break time.
bad,"During my time there the company had extended their hours into a 24-hour a day working building. The competitive shift bid is enough to give pretty much anyone a nervous breakdown. Landing on midnights, after a shift bid where my performance was put against people who have been at the company for decades, I was left to scrounge and try to figure out transportation because the city of Belleville doesn't have buses running."
bad,"High stress with no support, what else can be said.  Co-workers were great but upper management treats everyone as a number.  Typical call centre work"
bad,"Dont trust no-one. Upper management take credit for your work, and happy to throw you under should they need to."
bad,Muito baixo salario e sem oportunidades de crescimento profissional
bad,I swear I thought I was having a heart attack while I was working there. I actually went to the ER and it turned out to just be stress and a bladder infection because I was not allowed to use the restroom except for on my lunch or 2 10 minute breaks.
bad,"The people that work here are very immature, and there is lack of respect with agents and management. The company does not give raises and if they do it's maybe $0.07 maybe a year if that. The dress code is business casual. Overall this job is a stepping stone for someone who wants the call center experience but don't expect much out of it."
bad,"I'm employee of cnx . I observed this thing that people who working here as a excuctive from last 5 years there salary not more than 14,500rs😂😂. If somebody wants to work here, start as a fresher and support his or her family too. I must advise to them it's really bad idea. So think twice if you have planning to join this company."
bad,The job environment could’ve been better. They’re about their bottom line instead of the mental space of their workers. It’s not the best job to be at.
bad,It’s a outsourced company who had various projects come and go do to lack of management and meeting goals set forth by the contracts of the companies they represent! On top of management having inappropriate relationships with agents they are above
bad,Upper Management is horrible. One OM would fudge numbers to make his numbers look better than others. Also we were all informed to go on job posting sites to fudge reviews to make the site in Lynchburg look better than it is. Which is unethical.
bad,"Poor team management due to being under trained and or not accessible."
bad,"Management was no good, couldn’t have phones, pen, paper. Very boring, sitting down a lot, not flexible work hours. Poor conditions all around hard to"
bad,Training is inadequate especially for the amount of abuse one has to take in the beginning from customers because of not being properly trained to answer the customer questions or fix their problems.
bad,"Like many public companies CNX manages to each quarter to satisfy the market rather than have a long-term vision.  They say there is a long-term vision; but no actions indicate their desire to achieve it."
bad,"Starting there was fun, until you understand that you will never get a raise. They praise they promote from within, but that means they play favorites. Managers sat in the office all day trying to figure out what to eat while everyone on the floor stole money from the company so much, they were forced to lose all clients that they had (3 at the time). HR was a joke and no one was professional."
bad,"Very rarely are you in contact w/ an actual human. Issues are rarely resolved unless you literally track someone down and shove said issue down their throat. When working overtime, incentives are offered for a certain amount of time worked (e gift cards). I worked 12 hours of OT and still have yet to receive the incentive ($50 egc for every 1 hour OT worked)... so, my rating is quite POOR."
bad,"Cette entreprise vous recrute pour ensuite vous annoncer qu'elle allait licencier 17 personnes."
bad,"I even reached out to the CEO who passed me on to operations manager because I was not understanding my job. They said we will work on changing campaign(they were hiring for different campaigns) but then my manager said meet me online & proceeded to tell me I was terminated! If your phone tool goes down...beware, they'll say you are ""stealing time!"
bad,"This company is the worst company ever."
bad,"the job is not for those easily stressed out or busy bodies. you have to stick to your planned schedule. the customers are demanding because they are driving and need directions immediately. you have to pay attention to every little detail far as hearing the address because most people do not actually know where they are going. the off days change daily some weeks you will be working a 10hr shift 6 days in a row depending on te needs of the business. working at night is better because of less calls but still a lot. vto is rarely offered. mandatory ovetime depends on if people actually show up for their shift which is never. they work on a points system and not pattern. the job is not bad if you NEED a job, bored at home, or need experience to add. training is very in depth and is 5-6weeks."
bad,"I enjoy assisting people as a whole, but as with dealing with people in general it can be stressful. When people have integrity a workplace is easier.  Management as a whole did not promote that type of environment."
bad,"During the beginning of training it wad okay. Getting to know the systems you will use once you go to production. Once I got to production, I had to pull up a system that I was told during training that only managers had access to but they made me pull it up during calls. I had no direction on what to do, no support, and I did not like the fact that we had to ask every customer that we spoke about directv anf add a line even though the majority of the customers couldnt afford their cell phone bill as it was. I would not refer anyone to work there for any reason."
bad,"When I first started I through the incentives were great. And they would be if all the TL's would participate.  But they don't so even many of the employees feel that it's pointless to come in and take call after call and meet metrics and are not rewarded.  And if they are the management team took away the favorite incentives anyway so now there is no incentive."
bad,"The workload is very heavy (even when working in the Shared Services department). The demand on things to be done is high, but resources are very hard to acquire - not because of the skills needed, but because the benefits are not competitive enough."
bad,"Very robotic standards with disciplinary action taken if not maintaining standards"
bad,"I have been working for Concentrix for a year and half. The worst place ever, people are discriminated and problems ignored. There is absolutely no work life balance, most of the ex employees sue the company for abuse of employee rights. stay away. Workforce management can change the working hours as they please without any notice later they dare to inform you that you have been ate for your shift. Rotas are released only month in advance."
bad,Not the best place to work.��Not very organized. Easily left behind and forgotten in the promotion process.i was supposed to be getting a promotion to the position of team leader after two interviews I heard nothing back.
bad,Management does not care about any of the employees and at the same time there's crazy favouritism going on if you are friends with your managers. Awful environment to work in
bad,"Convergys is typisch een bedrijf wat gebruik maakt van arbeidskrachten met een zwakke positie in het verkrijgen van werk. Op Amerikaanse leest geschoeid met meer plichten dan rechten. Om omzet te generen geldt het zogenaamde service level. Dat wil zeggen dat er zoveel mogelijk telefoontjes afgehandeld moeten worden in zo min mogelijk tijd. Je bent vanaf binnenkomst tot einde dienst gemonitord op binnenkomst via de toegangspoortjes, de electronische prikklok op jouw pc, en het telefoonsysteem. Gesprekken worden allemaal na-beluisterd en opgenomen. Het salaris is voor 40 uur 1700 bruto per maand. Carrière is alleen mogelijk als jij een team weet te drillen om zoveel mogelijk de telefoon aan te nemen. Ziektedagen leveren 20% salaris korting op, met 2 wachtdagen zonder salaris. Parkeren kost jou zo'n 40 euro per maand, en voor een gratis parkeerplek sta jij minimaal een jaar op een wachtlijst. Het verloop is schrikbarend hoog. Met de opdrachtgever van Convergys heb je meestal niets te maken behalve een klachtenregen die jij als case owner over jou heen krijgt in de vorm van e-mails en maar naar eigen inzicht moet oplossen. Verlofdagen zijn zeer moeilijk te krijgen omdat door de krappe bezetting in de teams het service level daalt wat weer van invloed is op het verdienmodel van Convergys. Ik kan nog wel even doorgaan, maar mijn ervaringen met deze werkgever zijn dusdanig teleurstellend dat ik een carrière bij dit bedrijf afraadt."
bad,The job was great I loved working for Humana and helping people .but the pay sucked the job atmosphere sucked the people and team leads were childish but overall I loved Humana and hated convergys
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

bad,"Management at this company is very poor. Multiple CEOs in short period of time impact the overall direction of the company. Last manager was poor at best, no communication, no understanding of personal issues."
bad,I worked there for a short time they lied and said that we didn’t have to worry about our scores on reviews until the third week we started with like 15 people and like 5 or 6 was let go within the first week or so I was let go after management is awful. Area manager was awful she had a attitude with some employees the p.a or whatever they are coached u during your reviews and they all lied and said we didnf keep up how hard is it to say certain stuff they don’t make it easier for u they want u to say it exactly the way on script which is fine and dancy well maybe u shouldn’t have 60 of the same words in it and knowing I don’t know how many people having a issue with that word. Only thing I see that was alright about the place was your scheduling I mean u barely could do more than 40 but if u wanted less that’s fine. The pay wasn’t great at all for being a calll center if citi and then can pay 16 they can pay the same get with the program or at least get near the pay.
bad,To be honest I am only speaking for the unit I was in when I gave the ratings. And for good reason. First off from the supervisor to the manager had 0 professionalism. They gave certain employees more than special treatment. And then lie to your face even though you have proof. I just didn't lower myself  to the level it was borderline criminal to say the least.
bad,provided a lot of work to this company and they treat their employee very poorly. they have horrible communication with management as well as HR.  I would not recommend any to work for them moving forward unless the foundation is changed.
bad,"I learned a lot about FedEx services & the call center environment. I was able to grow as a call center agent, perfecting my product knowledge & call center practices. The job description for technical support does not  even come close to describing the skills we needed to do the job. Learning to work in a crowded, noisy environment was also a challenge. Changing schedules was also a challenge. In my particular location there was a lot of bias. If you were not in the ""circle"" then you never got a chance to advance."
bad,"The only call center I've heard of where you could have a 4 hour phone call. I enjoyed working in the chat-based support area, the calls were potentially way too long."
bad,"For most people it's a job. you go in, do your job, go home. It is High Turnover so only the stubborn people stay. No matter how hard of a person you may think you are, you are bound to have a mental breakdown or two."
bad,"I feel like I am there all the time and I dread it.  Positive treatment go to the people that make sales.  It is a requirement to offer on every call regardless of the situation the customer calls in for.   "
bad,When AT&T took over it became a high pressure sales job.  They took the fun out of working for Convergys. Most of the management seemed unapproachable and not too happy to help you with problems. It's not easy to sell cell phone and data plans to a customer who is angry about their bill or quality of service. Most of the other CSRs are great to work with and are willing to help new people understand the use of their systems.
bad,"The company pays decent the hours are all over the map, the management never wanted to take calls and the work culture was unstable as well as lacks and unsecured with inward fights on the parking lot for me."
bad,"No room for advancement, short breaks and short lunches, They don't care that you work a 2nd job, back to back calls, attendance is based on a 12 point system which is horrible, no set hours."
bad,"As a current employee I am very unsatisfied. I hate waking up everyday going to this job. If it was not for my child I would take my chances being unemployed. Once I leave this job and Yes I am going to leave this job I do not plan to return. Everyday I fear for my job because the upper management within the building are careless. They're all friends on a personal level outside of work and it shows a great deal in the work place. ""Compliance"" is not compliance and by that I mean if you are going to enforce rules make them for EVERYONE including your so called friends. They make you work like robots and I know work is not supposed to be fun but we are human and deserve to be treated as such.  The pay is horrible for what you go through with the customers. We waited 2 years for 0.20-0.25 cents raise. What a joke!"
bad,The job is a steady job but you get a single year raise to top you at 14.75 and not alot of room for moving up in the company. Most of the higher positions are filled by people intending to stay for many years to come.
bad,"I was hired on to do a job for a new client the company had obtained. Due to errors on reading said contract, I was hired on to perform pharmacy technician duties but was only processed into the trainee level of the process. Upon three months into the project, my entire hire group was moved due to the inability to get further call volume due to mismatching credentials needed from client's home state's healthcare guidelines. I was not offered a chance to rectify this, nor were they willing to help fund obtaining the credentials for our group. We were then thrown into a different project with a rushed training regiment, and deployed into a new client whom had an unrealistic time frame to handle customers on the line, especially when one considers the work we were expected to do."
bad,"Unprofessional place of employment and disorganized. Not a good management workplace. Drama filled place of employment. One positive is having weekends off. During regular work week, hours do fluctuate and don’t have a set schedule."
bad,"As far as call centers go, Convergys is better than some. Most companies have the cost of new employees as an investment. Call centers pass the cost of hiring and training on to the customer. That means they have no reason to keep tenured agents; They cost more and don't make the employer any more money. Tack on FMLA and you have a target on your back. It results in a work environment where you are a number; same as every other number. "
bad,Concentrix may be a good company but in Milwaukee office it sucked. The Team Leads would threaten the employees daily with being fired if you don't meet their unrealistic rates. Usually the TL's wanted a higher rate than the company did. The only time there were positive things being stated was was the client was in the building.
bad,"Log into pc, take calls assist with troubleshooting. Learned to reconnect client to internet, tv, and phone service. Management not available for supervisor questions, escalating calls to upper tier department, the customers and coworkers"
bad,"The job is stressful if you work during the day, its more relaxed overnight. they don't really work with your schedule. my manager was horrible. The rules are so unrelated to the job"
bad,Convergys is okay to work for the wage is livable (as long as they remember to pay you that is) but the managers often question why there teams don’t preform for them but then slate there team to the ground. Management is management and staff are staff and the two don’t mix.. if your well liked and lick bottoms well you will be fine however if you object to being slagged off or name called and speak up for yourself your days are numbered
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"The place is very unorganized and they change things without any notice, like hours or days working or client. Employees come to work in clothes they slept in the night before. Don't follow policy."
bad,I dont have any experince with this company. I have never worked with this company before. I don not have any information about this company. Thank you
bad,"Converges Is A Great Job If You Want To Get Experience In Call Center. I Wouldn't Suggest This Place As A Career , As Though its Takes A Long Time To Move Up & The Start Off Rate Isn't Something You Can Provide For A Family With"
bad,This call center doesn't care about its customers all they care is if you can stick them with a new service or device. Management is unavailable for most issues.
bad,"A lot of incentives and giveaways. "
bad,poor place to work. upper management doesn't want to help when they are needed. very hard to schedule time off or dr appointments due to you have to put in for your time off 5 to 6 weeks ahead an wait to see if it will be approved. So if your kid gets hurt an you have to make an appointment to go to the dr an miss work due to taking the child they will give you a point
bad,"Good benefits if you survive the bs. Management will throw you under the bus. The metrics are insane and constantly changing, not worth it at all. Constant turn over the only way to become a TL is to have a Bachelor of Science or Language Arts."
bad,The people who work there are fun it’s a nice environment but the scheduling they need an lot of work. They give you like 3/4 hours of mandatory overtime and takes 30 minutes of your lunch. Once they assign you to an schedule you’re pretty much suck they put me and the wrong your band and it took almost 2 months before they “fixed” my schedule.
bad,The career advancements were nonexistent . The supervisors were immature and unprofessional. The lack of communication was awful. They up and let go of people with no warning. The work environment most days is not professional. Promises were made and never fulfilled. Changes without notice happened too frequently.
bad,"Mi experiencia con esta empresa ha sido polarizada con un inicio muy bueno, buen tiempo para almorzar y descansar, con training excelente, disposición para ayudar y buenos recursos. Una vez entrado al piso y a pesar de estar bajo excelentes TLs pude ver como impera la desorganización , las preferencias y los chismes. Si Ud lava las manos correctas y se hace amigo de los que ocupas para subir,lo logras. Los recursos de IT son limitados con gente inepta para el cargo, almuerzos de 30 min que no aplica para todos , sino que los agentes que somos lo que generamos la riqueza para  la gerencia no somos tratados de acuerdo a lo que brindamos . El salario es pírrico y la gerencia inexistente con la salvedad de un caso extraordinario. El ambiente de trabajo si bien es relajado estamos sometidos a metricas atroces y tiránicas.  Lo que puedo decir que me gusta del trabajo es que tienen buena soda y los compañeros son geniales. Por favor las peticiones de  muchos de aquí convergen en lo mismo: Mejor salario,transporte a San José de 6pm a 9pm y a la casa después de las 10pm, Mejores recursos IT y verdaderos IT y no aprendices, Internet sin bloqueos innecesarios , computadoras con cuenta admin, como los grandes empleadores lo hacen donde confían en sus empleados y no los tratan como niños que deben someter y controlar, dejar sus concursos ridículos , somos jóvenes no adolescentes que nos sometemos a concursos y días ridículos , donde la gerencia nos premia nuestras métricas de dolor con pizza y no buscan incentivos reales donde nos sintamos apreciados y realmente valorados como profesionales"
bad,"The place is very unprofessional. They did not even know our class was showing up for training when we did and they gave us all the wrong times. "
bad,"There is not many good things I can say about this company. They will work you like crazy, shove candy down your throat to stay awaken because you have to sell sell sell. Its all about money to them, you mean nothing. No matter how long or hard you work if your numbers are low you are fired."
bad,"Convergys Management was good for opening the door for a person who wants to get technical support experience. At the time they would hire anyone and everyone. The company was mismanaged and so they went out of business. The pay wasn't bad and it was good to have this on your resume if you are an I.T. specialist... Otherwise, this job was more of a stepping stone than anything else (if you have high goals)... Company is out of business... No use discussing a company that no longer exists."
bad,The company had an extreme lack of stability and support from Senior Management. The department was completely unstructured and had little-to-no resources to assist in our daily job functions
bad,"Poor management, low salary, no raises after a year, little to no room for advancement, no schedule flexibility. Payroll is a large problem as they short checks often and take a long time to fix."
bad,People are rude. Mess with pay. Mess with benefits. No one helps you. Training teaches nothing about the job. People steal things constantly and no one does anything about it
bad,"Starting out you will be forced to work a night shift with no weekends off, I feel the pay isn't enough for the work you do or hours you work. However they do provide you with PTO and UTO its very hard to put it in"
bad,Did not like the job. Some people are meant for this though and really good at it. Was not a fan of the work environment. Some of the management was good and some not so much.
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the helping part when it comes to technical problems. Troubleshooting, probing questions, finding out how the problem existed and what caused it. Stressful Job, mandatory overtime is really painful and you dont get permitted even if you have a valid reason to be late or absent or if you cant take their pre-plotted overtime in your schedule.I didnt grow in that company but I learned alot of things. Getting along with different kinds of personality, enhancing verbal communication, and the new terminology in this new age of computers."
bad,A typical day includes being berated by both customers and supervisors.  I learned about timeshares.  Management was less than knowledgable about their own policy/procedure and exhibited a willingness to throw potential under the bus to avoid losing their own job.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Unless your management or buddy buddy with management.  They don't pay enough to retain good talent it's not worth it, you're better off driving out to Wilmington to find a job with a decent starting pay for the area."
bad,"The environment was stressful, the management was pool trained or didn't care about the quality of work their team was presenting at the time, the ability to handle issues individual agents had was limited it was a miserable experience working there from a business stand point. however the relationships with co workers was the best business ive had to meet new exciting people."
bad,"Typical day is very busy and time consuming."
bad,"This was a good company before but due to management changes, they are just giving more goals to achieve but less motivation to their employees. I experienced being transferred from one LOB to another. Due to that, your experience with your account will reset and eventually cannot apply to your desired position. Salary will change as well depending on your transferred LOB. Incentives are not so worth it. Your job is so hard yet you're just receiving snacks that you can buy on your own. There are incentives too that are not so hard to reach. Managers are so high of themselves not until they realize too many people are leaving."
bad,"These guys make it sound like they're wonderful. "
bad,This was a challenge for me I didnt like the culture of the job due to my experience I did not find the task challenging more like the culture of the office
bad,Concentrix is a place where you go to get experience and then move on to your next step in life. Concentrix is not a place to stay a long duration unless you know people in the great positions to move quickly up the ladder.
bad,With better management concentrix could be a better workplace. Management is underdeveloped and not very trustworthy. A good management team can take a group/company a long way! Concentrix does not make the workers there feel valued.
bad,Convergys is good as a whole but differs process wise. My process' management was the worst one could have. Please avoid joining Convergys for Dell process
bad,"Convergys was a great company, but management was hard to work with when you needed help or you were falling behind. It is really hard to balance work and home life if you want a decent paycheck. The atmosphere there always immediately brought be down but I enjoyed talking to the customers and helping with their problems."
bad,It was call center and had no interest in the works or the work condition and job security was very poor. The place was never cleaned and and chairs were not very good for your and if you were sick to many time you were let go even if you had note from the doctor
bad,"Flexible Hours....room for advancement, Room to grow and learn.  I would definitely recommand to anyone who needs immediate employment.  The starting pay is good."
bad,"Convergys provides solutions that optimize the everyday interactions between customers and employees. Managing these relationships, fostering improvement and adding value to them is how we enable organizations worldwide to improve their business performance."
bad,"Did not follow training guidelines on production floor. Management was not helpful at all, they were never on the same page. Never had a set schedule, Last minute schedule changes."
bad,"Typical day at work consists of answering phones for selected contract.  Management is always changing.  Been there for quite some time and it has changed dramatically in the last couple years.  Before it merged with convergys, it was actually a good place to work with mixture of improving morale.  The hardest part of the job is finding the right person or persons to talk to about any certain issue."
bad,"A typical day at work was all about sales."
bad,"The training is easy, and actually taking calls is easy if you have any customer service experience.  That being said, if you have any sort of life outside the job, kiss it goodbye.  For a full time job of only 40 hours, the shift they always give (from 2pm to 11pm) makes it impossible to accomplish anything around the house - especially if you have kids.  After a couple of months, you are always tired and don't have the energy to actually enjoy your days off or the paycheck you're earning."
bad,"management is horrendous. They can't keep their accounts, and very high turn over rate. I would highly recommend avoiding this place. Please, do yourself a favor."
bad,"Not recommended if you want a career. Just pray that your pay check is correct. If you have problems with your team leader, their supervisor may help you."
bad,societe deplorable pas de coaliton pas d'esprit d'equipe Magement totalement incompetent
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Unnecessarily strict. It's understood that a business should have some security guidelines but it's to the point where t makes me uncomfortable and makes me feel like a robot. I can't have a personality just do as they say, wear what they say, and don't get 2 points because you'll be sent home and fired. And it's not that difficult to inherit those 2 points. This job personally isn't for me. It's difficult for me to give any positive feedback, but if anyone is interested, experience the job for yourself."
bad,This company is driven and ruled by numbers. It doesnt matter that you give excellent customer service and have had many of your customers email and write letters saying how helpful and excellent you were...upper management only looks at the scorecards (which are rarely kept accurate)
bad,"Low wages, Dwindliing Benefits which take forever to get, weekly ""coaching""(what you did wrong all week"") Management cares only about what affects them. CONSTANT PRESSURE to perform. GREAT Co-workers, hours constantly changing so they're hard to plan around. ""Fun"" culture is sold to you, but it feels more like a slave ship with a supervisor and a drum...Hardest part of the job is not driving away on breaks, but I really enjoy the co-workers.Thiis is not a Career- it is a stepping stone"
bad,"I worked here temporarily and while it seems good to start, this quickly build up. I had been having a rough few days and instead of taking me aside and asking me what was up, they just fired me. I did not get a write up or anyone interacting with me. I showed up for work, I did the work they asked, and I had been generally a good employee. There are good people working there, I just wish they would handle certain situations better and give employees a chance to explain themselves."
bad,Convergys is constantly changing the commission structure which makes it difficult to budget their money.  They do a poor job of training and I have no desire to ever work there again.
bad,"I worked in many areas, but with the exception of the last 2 years were all in the Quality Assurance (Testing) area. Initially we were testing main frame applications using main frame test tools and methods. Eventually we started testing Unix related applications."
bad,"poor management, very easy and simple tasks little to no experience needed. No organization, provides necessary experience to move up within the company. Difficulty accessing benefits."
bad,This Convergys site was a disaster from the moment I stepped in the building.  It provided a great challenge and I was able to affect change from the inside but it was already too far gone.  Convergys has closed this site since 2014.
bad,"High employment turn out rate."
bad,"I worked for this company when they took over my call center that ended up closing. They offered benefits that were expensive, there were not many advancement opportunities and were extremely difficult to deal with and get a hold of. I was not a happy worker for this company, would have much rather of gone back to all my previous employers than work for them again."
bad,"Please do not think that this job is permanent. I was abused verbally everyday by upper management and when it was reported to a higher authority they did absolutely nothing, so if you take this job be looking for something else."
bad,is a nice place to work at starting out as a teen with no worries or any type of bills to pay pays well but is very unorganized and the managers don't really care about the employees
bad,"I knew this place was weird from the beginning.  The first month I was there there were several times the police had to be called to the front lobby because so many people were having issues with their checks.  Also, management is a bunch of overgrown high school students who do not know how to keep any information confidential.  Lastly, this place laid all of us off without any indepth explanation.  There were at least 3 active escorts at this job and multiple people who sell drugs and or solicit drugs to others.  Gossip, fighting, blackmail all occurred right in front on my team.  At times I had to remind myself it was a call center.  Pathetic."
bad,"You are moved around like a ping pong, raises are taken away, pay not correct and takes a very timely length to get correct back pay. "
bad,"I was here for a year only because i needed the money until i found another job. finally i just said forget it and left. the management is horrible and they dont care about their workers what so ever. if youre having family issues or emergency issues they dont care even if a note or something is brought to them youll still get a ""point"". I would not recommend what so ever"
bad,"Learned Team work"
bad,"Gostei de fazer parte do time da concentrix, porém a estrutura d empresa não tem um ambiente favorável a saúde"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Job security was difficult, since you could be fired at any time."
bad,This workplace allows violations of the Code of Business Conduct to continue; after multiple times of reporting the same issues and concerns; nothing has yet to be done to resolve the issue.  The Management Team here are about as professional as a  child playing pretend; they DO NOT know how to run a business.
bad,"A typical day at Conduit involved just taking calls all day. Most of those calls would be from angry customers who would berate you and call you every name in the book no matter what you did to assist them. Working in the billing department, I heard more than the typical worker. Customers would call immediately yelling about their bill increasing. On top of the stress of being yelled at on a constant basis, the company expects you to offer a sale to each and every customer, without fail. There was no excuse, no matter what was being said to you, by who, or why. If you did not offer to sell them something (which would often times just lead to even more yelling), then you could face punishment, up to and including termination. "
bad,"Renew monthly/annual contracts with all customers. "
bad,"This job was one of the worst I've had. You go into training and they teach you all these things so when you go onto the floor you feel like you're already and expert, come to find out that 90% of the things they teach are in no way relevant to the job.  So now your getting upset and irate customer that you don't know how to deal with because you were not properly trained in the things you actually need to know. The supervisors are HORRIBLE. While I was there I was one of MANY women who endured inappropriate behavior from male supervisors who were NEVER punished for their wrong doings. The supervisors and very unprofessional and they play favorites. You WILL NOT get promoted at this place of business unless you are prepared to brown nose. There are no parts of this job that are enjoyable. The shifts you get are not good at all and you don't have assigned seating so you have to find a seat every morning and risk clocking in late to work because you cannot find a seat. some people will try to reserve seating, which is not what they are supposed to do, and my very first day there 2 women got into a fist fight over a chair, This is NOT a professional environment. so if you are looking for something very temporary this is an ok job but this is in no way a career for a professional looking for long term work. I guarantee  within the first 2 months you will want to quit. Out of the 25 people I went into training with only 22 of them stayed."
bad,I was able to learn great skills in identifying and solving problems.
bad,"Nobody was on the same page. Your Team Lead would tell you one way and when you switched teams your new Team Lead would say whatever your previous Team Lead told you is not the complete truth. As a reward for giving great customer service one year they decided to give us a slice of bread in a ziploc baggie with a note that said ""Congratulations on your great call ( something along those lines) her is a piece of bread ""mmm, heat it up and put butter on it."" How insulting to  your employees. Is this a commercial and I'm supposed to pull some ""I can't believe it's NOT butter"" out of my purse or do you think we live some 3rd world country? The following year as a way to appreciate us for one whole week we received some serious fun. Day 1 bubbles blown in our face as Team Leads walk up and down the isles. Day 2 a ring pop, Day 3 a long hot dog balloon (not sure proper name)  blown up and put on our desk to make an animal. Day 4 glitter, and on day 5 a glow in the dark necklace! REALLY what are we 5?"
bad,The best thing I can say about convergys is that I did learn really good customer services skills. My team leader was really good at listening to calls with me and pinpointing what I can do better on the next call. Besides that the pay wasn't really that good. You were supposed to be paid for performance but often it was left out the check. Nobody working together just working against each other.
bad,Worked on taking calls and assisted customers who were having problems with their DSL or just needed to connect to it.
bad,"Good work environment"
bad,"Communication skills are horrible,matrix goals are not reachable."
bad,"This company has no clue how to run a productive call center.  The only thing that matters to them is the bottom line.  I was told this was a customer service job and when I asked the recruiter about selling I was told there was some ""light upselling"" involved.  As soon as I got on the floor I was given a quota and expected to push the hard sale on every call.  Nearly impossible goals with new responsibilities added constantly and you NEVER get a raise.  About halfway through my time there fixed schedules were abolished and I often found myself working 7 days straight with different shifts every day and staggered days off.  There were also many times when I would not get a scheduled break until about 4 hours into my shift or lunch until about 6 hours in.  Mandatory overtime was added to my schedule during my shift with no warning.  Their website was inaccessible from home - they actually recommended that I take down my firewall to gain access to the website so I could check my schedule to see if any changes were made on my days off.  Advancement was a joke - in order to become a team leader you have to first take a pay cut and become a ""TSS"" which is not a promotion but a ""job assignment"" and hope for the best.  Benefits were a joke as well.  I enrolled online (the only way to apply for benefits) and after receiving confirmation that I was enrolled I subsequently found out I was not and had to wait a year to get health coverage.  HR is outsourced to some third world country and the onsite people are powerless to help you with anything except hiring or firing you.  My wife got"
bad,"Staff nice but pay is low, long hours and boring unless you like telemarketing"
bad,I worked in the Comcast Quad at Convergys and it is the worst place to work. There's never a Supervisor available and the calls are difficult because they don't give you the proper training. The co-workers are loud and rude and they walk around talking and laughing while calls are being taken. The quad has roaches and mice and the employees do not respect authority...The pay is ok.. The best part of the job was my breaks and lunch.
bad,"little consideration for employees "
bad,"Was extremely dirty for a call center. Had get to work 10 plus minutes early to wipe find a desk to work at clean it and headset. Which was gross I do not go to work to clean up other people's hair and rotten milk. Was really unprofessional place with awful work hours.I was promised better hours after training if I did well in class, I was in the top two everyone got same shift."
bad,"unfair pay structure, no holidays given, favortism for management, minimal bonus.  wage did not adjust for cost of living adjustments as minimum wage increased. if you need temp work it's good or if you are going to management awesome, expect your regular job to be outsourced."
bad,If your interested in unstable environments this is the place for you.
bad,"Convergys is the most unprofessional place I have ever worked at. The team leaders are corrupt. If they do not like you, you are gone. If you do not sell U-Verse you are gone. The whole sales thing is ridiculous. The company would provide better customer service if employees did not have to worry about selling U-verse."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Disorganized management. "
bad,"Convergys is a place to find a paycheck,  I apparently started working for them at a bad time as they where short on managers.  You never really got any feed back unless your number went down instead of up or steady.  Each manager was overseeing 50 plus people in a system designed to only oversee 10-12 people.  So it was very hard to get any help if needed.  But it was a paycheck  you got a bonus on your sales and You got a bonus for meeting goals and being there during your schedule."
bad,this company wasn't too good.  a lot of turnover too.  they were worried about things that wasn't about helping people with DSL. 
bad,"answering phones and troubleshooting cell phone problems on the computer using various programs. Pitching sales for TV Service,Internet,and home phone."
bad,"High stress environment, low paying, my co-workers are great, though low paying and bad benefits"
bad,"Horrible company, so many constant changes, they give bonuses then take them back. Hostile work environment. Train Wreck!!!"
bad,"This is a horrible place to work. There is no communication at all. Management will tell you the wrong thing just so you can stop asking questions. You only get 5 days to call off a year without them being held against you and if you're on a last chance they do not count. You only get 10 minutes a week to go to the bathroom on an unscheduled break. There is a survey at the end of each call that asks how the customer feels about Netflix and they hold the no's against you and they could ultimately cost you your job. The only good thing about this place is the fact you get a free account. There is no job security and they will fire you at the drop of a hat. The schedules change and they do not take your bid into consideration. They don't care about outside issues you may have that will conflict with the time you work. If your doctor takes you off work they want you to still come to work and when you get there they will send you home and hold it against you. Do not expect a raise even though they tell you in orientation you will get one. Only a handful of people has made it a year there. There is a lot of favoritism and you have to suck up just to move ahead. They bypass the good agents and pick the ones who don't know anything to get promoted. They will fire you and ask you to come back. Take my advice, do not work there."
bad,"get into work, and get on the phones deal with happy and sometimes pretty upset customers. Try and find your lead if you need questions answered. Trying to up sale to very upset customers is something that is pretty hard to do. But sometimes it can be done."
bad,"The overall company as a whole is ideal, however management has a lot to learn about being respectful and kind to its employees."
bad,"- At first I loved the Job, training is about the best thing they offer. Management isn't great."
bad,"Impossible to get help when you need it, management team lacks knowledge and/or understanding of the job."
bad,"this place doesnt care about u as a person...the management is no where to be found...atmosphere is always changing...noone knows whats going on..AND keep up with your hours..they often have ""mistakes"" on payroll"
bad,"The work is high stress (handling nothing but customer complaints) and the pay is definitely NOT commensurate with the duties. Just in the few months I was there, they kept piling on the duties, but not upping the pay by even one cent. While there was a system in place for rewarding top agents, your chances of being in that top ranking was extremely low and so was your payout. As for schedules, they are outsourced to a location in India and are changed constantly, as in every 15 minutes. This is not an exaggeration; it is a fact. Schedules were changed at the whim of the client (AT & T) and if you didn't keep up with the constant changes you received points against you via the estart system. As for training, I did not feel at all well prepared and often felt as though I had been thrown to the wolves. This was a feeling shared by many of people I worked with that had been hired at the same time as myself. I did have some nice coworkers, but an honest assessment of most of the staff would be that they are largely unhireable at any reputable company. If you think that body piercings of all types, prominent tattoos and exotic hair colors and styles are office appropriate, then Convergys is the place for you; otherwise run the other way. Quickly."
bad,Answering the phones for AT&T customers was the easy part helping the customers was the easy part. But the management there not so good. Co-workers were great its the upper management that needs help.
bad,"Enviroment is completely unacceptable. Individuals in management did not have any morals or values. The company does not respects its employees, illegal activities are conducted and the pay check stubbs are often incorrect."
bad,Management treated people like slaves there is nothing more to say
bad,I worked at COnvergys for a year. The company likes to tell you that you can always move up and I tried for months. My stats were always above goal but the company has favortism towards certain people and those were the only ones who would move up in the company .
bad,"I like what I do, I like the people I work with, but there tends to be a lot of favorites in our work environment. A typical day on the job is to get to work on time and answer all incoming calls. I have learned to be patient with people in need."
bad,"We were responsible for enrolling AT&T Employees and Retirees in the benefits. I learned a lot about Medical, Vision, Dental, and Life Insurances. The environment of the call center was fun."
bad,"worked with this company while i was in school. Trying to help customers over the phone seems ok but can be nerve recking. Multiple supervisor changes. before I quit i had no idea who i was suppose to answer to. thats how many time the supervisors changed. at the time i was there, the pay was ok for that type of job. again, ok to start but not to stay."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Typical day at work: Log into your machine, start taking calls to sell sell sell. Fear that you haven't sold enough."
bad,"Most of the time the computer system would not work and it left customers in precarious positions. Most were unable to receive turn-by-turn directions. Occasionally, would get a call from a customer who was paying for a service that would not work in their vehicle because the software was not compatible with their vehicle. For example: turn-by-turn directions in a car without turn-by-turn capabilities. The agents were pressed to get sales and many did not pay attention/or were forced to get sales to keep their jobs."
bad,Strictly an entry level call center. If you have any experience you should skip this outfit.
bad,"assist customers via telephone wit cable, internet, and telephone issues."
bad,You can learn a lot at this company because of the dynamics of the Call Center business and their acquisitions globally. But in return you must trade your life is the company.
bad,The climate is currently in flux at this company. Workaholics will be very satisfied in any position. Learn to be exceedingly flexible to take advantage of all possible opportunities.
bad,This company was a little un-professional which as I had to work every weekend and schedules changed every week.
bad,"Easy work with a fun office environment to be in. Will not work around school schedules and lacks organization when comes to paychecks and schedules being correct. Benefits are not as great as they should be, company makes up for it by offering over time pay and extra incentives."
bad,"Training is good and pretty easy, but once you get on the floor, it's awful. You're trying to help upset customers while being attacked by your manager to sell the customer more services. People who are upset about their cell phone bill being too high do not want to buy DirectTV from you and if you don't get sales every week, management is just straight up mean to you. My manager would literally throw things at my team on a weekly basis, while we were on the phone with customers."
bad,"harassment gets looked over, there is severe favoritism, and they do not care about the staff. there’s a very select few people who are in charge that actually care and made working there worth it. It’s 100% ridiculous how some people are treated. if you’re gonna work here, be ready to have EVERYONE in your business. high school all over again!"
bad,"The job itself was not difficult at all. However, the management (upper management), broken systems, broken procedures, unhygienic environment, made it difficult and stressful. "
bad,Have been part of concentrix for almost 2 n half years. The management is cunning they always try to use it's employees playing silly games and showing false hopes backed by fake promises. Salary is very less no other.benefits at all. Don't recommend it
bad,"It's all about politics in that company. No set ethics and moral. I believe a violation is violation, be it for a close employee to the manager or for a not so close employee to the manager. But it's not the same in there. Which I found against my principles. Managers are a slack. All they care is how well you treat them. Overall, I simply was disgusted working with Concentric Kolkata. I am sure it's not the same in any other location."
bad,"The job perks were great, once you get past the three months I imagine, which I quit just before due to a toxic work environment. Management in general, and scheduling mishaps. Over all would not recommend."
bad,"This company is horrible, they lie to you, you get written up if you have to many bathroom breaks not lying they had a meeting with me to discuss how in the WHOLE MONTH I had 45 min in the bathroom ( which you punch out for and aren’t paid) and they said “I need to work on getting that time down or I’ll be demoted back to training again” they promise incentives then stab them in the back ( literally got $2500 taken away without them notifying us the employees the incentive or policy had been changed...which was changed 3 days before we were due to have the incentive paid out!!!"
bad,"Hired on for AEP many things were not the way I was told it would be in my interview. Had my pre training then went months wo work pay increased during training for being on the floor but they were not up front about commissions, and honestly didn’t know what they would be until 6th week of training. I left bc the mentors were confusing and each one said something different. My team leader was second shift so I rarely saw him . If you want days off during open enrollment don’t ask bc they said they will not take any requests for days off.  They also just pretend to care about UHC stands for. They are mostly just sale driven aand don’t care about customers time or plan. They said just enroll them and if they renroll you still get commission....."
bad,"The job was ""ok"". Issue was, any chance for advancement would only be offered to individuals the management team didn't feel posed a challenge to them. Having massive amounts of professional experience, I was overlooked for key positions in favor of individuals working Concentrix as a first job.  It's a very tribal environment, which is likely why this call center changes ownership every other year.  There is no success where personal bias is used in lieu of professionalism."
bad,"This place is so full of hypocrites. Lots of favoritism. And management will do nothing to help you. All of are stuck up, but at like they care. They are so fake and full of it, they will never pay anything for what's its worth. Plus if you want any remnants of a ghetto high school, this is the place."
bad,"So the lies start before any of us actually got hired. It all started when the job was advertised as customer support; we got into training where it was revealed to be a sales position. If I knew it was going to be sales, I would've applied somewhere else."
bad,This place in Chatham is a joke in the sense of advancement and the treatment. They kept the same managers who drove long term employees away. The employees literally go across the road to another call centre. This place is so bad that most employees take stress leave all the time and no one feels good about the place. It’s a good temp job but would never dig my feet in again for them.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"The job at first is exciting. The promotion from with in is true. However,three rings up the ladder and that's where it stops. A lot of work at that tier and the pay does NOT match the related responsibilities and duties."
bad,"I started working here and everything was great until they started to micro manage everything. You couldn't even move on to the next step of the process without having a supervisor come check your work to make sure you were completing everything. You couldn't even sell the internet services that were required to sell without supervisor approval. It got so bad that in order for you to even leave the site after work a supervisor had to come over and have you check off and sign a piece of paper saying you were leaving."
bad,Management is terrible. Stop hiring BODIES! Empty vessels.  Learn to encourage your employees and not treat them like they’re unimportant. Also stop hanging up on your customers they pay good money to use your service.
bad,"This company used to be great. After the buyout the benefits changed, management (the good ones) started leaving while the others are saying they should should quit (ain’t that great for morale??) "
bad,"I was okay with the small amount of time I worked there.  The training was good.  The people I worked with were fun. The team leads were informative.  It was a temp placement and so there was not a lot of time spent making the temp workers feel comfortable.  We were trained, put on the phones and the job ended."
bad,"While in training, made sure to let us know very customer satisfaction oriented. But once on the floor, very numbers oriented.  Alot of assignments passed back and forth."
bad,Speaking for myself I loved the job but the company was terrible. Attendance was very strict and the management team was very... I worked the apple campaign and it was cool but they forced you to advance and would not let you resign from a position if you felt you weren’t doing your best. I’m working from the same campaign but for a different company and it’s worlds different and it’s a much better experience. That location has since been closed so who knows if it’s been fixed... Just my experience
bad,My experience was okay with the company. I would recommend anyone that needed a job to apply.  Game-room was cool and a place to relax on your breaks. Training was to the point and let you know what the job was about. Commission could of been better but it was okay for a entry level position. If you are looking for a entry level position I would suggest you apply.
bad,"Typical day involved non-stop answering calls, learned about the needs of the client & learned interesting information about the automotive industry. Some of the management was amazing, but recent policy changes made it impossible to keep my employment there, they are taking any humane policys away. Your just an employee number, earning points when you make mistakes, and when you get 12 points you get fired. No humans."
bad,"There is an astronomical turnover due to the strict requirements combined with the abysmal pay. "
bad,"A bunch of messy, petty azz people who worked this company. Stressful work environment.  Very unorganized.  If need a job and can't pass a drug test this is the companry for you. Puff Puff. People who are always in their feelings about something."
bad,Crab in a barrel mentality and terrible pay.  Terrible management.   Little to no assistance with escalated issues.  Bed bugs in the building.  I witnessed multiple fights.   I appreciated the opportunity but too much drama not enough work being done.
bad,"Aside from a handful of honourable managers, they will tell you anything that they need to in order to get what they want.  The job is very stressful, they routinely block out time you cannot take for vacation, sometimes to the point of leaving so little time left that not everyone is able to get the time they're entitled to, and there is no improvement.  The only changes to this job are in a negative direction, with more work spread to fewer people, extremely few opportunities to move up (though often they create non-existent positions that promise advancement but are actually just a way to get you to do work outside of your job description without paying you to do so."
bad,where can i begin.. the environment here is so childish and high school like it will drive a Foreal GROWN PERSON insane! The raises were based off of favortisim managers tried to enforce rules but werent following the rules themselves! The pay is the equivalent to what walmart employees get paid maybe even less.. Management had there favorites all throughout the building!
bad,Wish I was paid more and manager was there when you needed them. You had to go find them on the floor! Coming from a new employee this is bad! When you need help right away it wasn't there!
bad,Management  were ok. It seems like ages ago l worked there. I have moved on now big time and rarely think of it. A  job is sometimes what you make it. Definitely the colleagues made it for me. Did not like the campaign. Couldn't wait to run out the door!
bad,Have nothing to say. The job paid the bills. The job was not far from my apt. Although there was a dress code everyone came to work in clothes you should not wear out period. Slippers shorts sweat pants. No parties. Bag of candy for Xmas.
bad,"No opportunities for you to advance. When they purchased Concentrix, there was promises of changes but they were all empty. Difficult to recommend to anyone."
bad,"This job is great at giving first impressions. The training is fantastic, the feedback is very detailed and gets you set for the job. The training staff really are the highlight of Concentrix. They are some of the best teachers I've had and are a bright spot on an otherwise ugly workplace environment. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,La empresa compensa los bajos salarios con un complejo e inalcanzable sistema de bonos
bad,"Typical customer service scene where you take in calls for calbe, internet and phone. Management lacks empathy to their employees, they rather impress the clients with false sales revenue and hammer the employees with those false hopes given."
bad,They management at Concentrix  are awful they don't like to speak with the member if they call in to speak with one to get something resolve about their policy. Pay needs to be better. They don't offer job opportunity within the company at all. Too much favoritism for some people and the others get in trouble for it which isn't right at all. If you do for one or a few certain amount of people the same treatment needs to be giving to everyone as well. Needs to be limited with being in after call work when on the phone and taken care of the member on the phone. Needs to better organized their parking situation better for the employees instead of having ride an shuttle bus if their shift starts at a certain time and if you park in the parking lot you might risk getting your car tow because their isn't enough parking spaces for all the employees that work there. You should better think things out including the parking for the employees and how many people are you planning on hiring. They need to be organized better as an company and treat the employees a little more better than they do.
bad,"Hard to balance life work with over 55 hours expected per week, paid for 40."
bad,"If your face fits u ll be fine, if it doesnt you will be left just to get on with it, great facilities but poor place to work. No support once you leave the classroom."
bad,"I worked here for 3 Months..."
bad,Not worth it not able to advance your career they play favorites so you can be bad at what you do but as long as you brown nise you will be getting promoted
bad,"it's a call center, lots of bad management, poor business decisions and no matter how good you are or how much potential you have for growth managers will often keep you down in a place where they can best control you."
bad,"When I started it was nice, the people were friendly, the calls weren't hard, but then the company did a ""shift bid"" and several people quit because there was now no regard for what we wanted from our schedules, they just assigned us work schedules with no real appeal process. Then the call queue skyrocketed and we were swamped for months with angry callers and stressed out managers. Then the Company got in trouble for the excessive queue and made made overtime a requirement for everyone. They changed my schedule as well out of the blue, without asking me what days off I needed and now I can only work 3 days out of the week."
bad,Everyone here is very inappropriate . A lot of them should've been fired. It really was a good place to meet friends. But alot of drug addicts Most (ALL) managers are on drugs except possibly one really sad.
bad,"Salary not the best. "
bad,Hard to move up and management doesn't care about scheduling. Would recommend if you don't have kids and willing to have inconsistent schedule. Overall wasn't terrible
bad,"Programs constantly leaving, no job security, recently bought out by new company, no loyalty to good dependable workers. Vending machines have ""healthy items"" that have 1800 grams of sodium in a sandwich."
bad,this is a high demanding job. You have to work long hours for 11/hr. You do have a possibility of receiving a bonus if you go over and above certain goals. It is hard because you have several angry customers that yell
bad,"Some of the major Cons:"
bad,"Job role entails speaking to customers on a regular basis through inbound calls. handle queries in regards to their bills/accounts. "
bad,"Great place for someone starting out in the automotive field.  Training provided, with an 18 month work requirement. The job is easy, if you have the required training."
bad,9-5.30pm sitting on your bum all day. No bonus as agreed. Worked for the company for 2 years with no pay increase. Male and female environment. Like a childrens school playground... lots of little girlies trying to get into males pants. Management doesnt really so much if you have a problem.
bad,The hours are too inconsistent for a good work/life balance.  The rules and policies were reviewed but very seldom were they ever enforced.  Was a revolving door and high attrition rate as the morale was low.  I was glad I had the opportunity to find employment elsewhere.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,I'm a current employee and I have been working there for less then a year.  I have to say your co-workers are great. but Management needs work.  They will look at ANYTHING to get rid of you or use Progressive discipline.  If you don't perform to their expectations they'll walk you right out the door.  If you need a job just for awhile until you find another that's fine but don't plan on staying long term. There are some long term people there that have been there before it changed hands.  They have a class starting every other week so what does that tell you?
bad,Management is hit or miss. They also don’t pay well. Pay is determined by the contract they have with their clients so there is little to no balance in pay for employees.
bad,"Do Not Apply."
bad,"Worklplace culture is quite okay, I love my subordinates and consituents at work and my immediate manager as well."
bad,"Simply can't keep employees, If all you care about is making sales and money its a great place to work otherwise need not apply. Call centers aren't for everybody."
bad,When I first start here you had to be 21+ years to get hired. After a while they allowed anyone fresh out of high school come in and that is when it went down hill and I had to get out. I loved the job before then.  We use to have themed days and different food venders there!
bad,"This company just wasn't for me. It was a thankless job that paid decent initially, till they decided to cross train and implement more tasks for no increase in pay."
bad,Sales job provide customer service and technical support via telephone decent breaks paid commission on top of hourly wages hard to get your sales and when you don't get a sale on every contact management would get extremely pushy
bad,"First, they limit service providers. When you are hired they will not tell you this, however if you begin to have problems AT ALL it will be blamed on your ISP & you can lose your job for it. Second, management is horrible. There is no vetting process for them, just agents promoted. Some of the management used to talk about how they were always late to work, tried getting off the phones, but were promoted. Multiple complaints across the board of inappropriate management. I would NOT recommend them to anyone looking to grow with a company."
bad,"I'd say some days would seem to look better, if I had been assigned a different project; as multiple companies reside as titled 'Convergys'. Yet almost all having to do with 'sales' the completion of assigned goals were next to impossible minus feeling like you cheated life to accomplish less then a 5min phone conversation to less than willing participants who usually hung-up upon calls, hating to be bothered."
bad,"Call Center; I worked in section that did telephone surveys. Points were awarded for completed surveys, but not many people want to participate in unsolicited telephone surveys; therefore, it was hard to earn points for surveys completed."
bad,"High turnover rate with this company for a reason. Strange working conditions, micromanaged and recorded and watched and monitored which all feels stifling.  Typical shift is 9.5 hours of which you are paid for 8.45.  One 15 minute break and half hour lunch are unpaid and one 15 minute break is paid.  Washroom breaks are monitored.  Ironically, smoke breaks are not.  "
bad,"Convergys was great job for georgia but if your looking to move up and get better hours and money you can kiss that dream good bye. Schedules are made by some company overseas (or so i was told) so you don’t get any kinda of say about your hours but it’s pretty much a set schedule rarely they’ll switch up your days unless you have to switch teams for some reason, Team leads are immature and unprofessional they basically sit around and gossip rather then helping agents, and the point system is just dreadful."
bad,"Typical shift was pleasant with little, if any, difficulties."
bad,"High turnover. Bullying management. I was not listened to, people not happy in general and it is evidenced by the high turnover. I would not recommend this place."
bad,Most of the people you encounter are great but the overall culture is very depressing. There is room to advance but not very far. And you can clearly see that you are not a valued employee just a number.
bad,"The work is easy and equivalent to what you get paid for, but the specific statistics that get set and specific business needs that drive decisions that are made are off putting. At one point, the statistic for receiving bonus pay for providing technical support was ""First Call Resolution"", where on a survey someone would mark Yes for the question ""Was this resolved on your first call with ______"". But in training and coachings, we were told most often the first thing that should be done is to check for any updates. If updates are found don't sit with the updates, schedule a callback to verify that the issue is resolved. This made it almost impossible to receive the ""performance bonus pay""."
bad,"we handled a lot of very important health info such as medicines, prescriptions doc appointments. policy info was not clearly lined out for us to explain to our guest"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"The job was not hard. They just decided to put 600 people out of work by shutting the site. The people were nice that were there, but they lost their jobs as well."
bad,There was no type of Job security. Management was never on the same page. The point system that they use is flawed. Overall i would only recommend this job to serious people in need of decent pay and hours. The main concern i had was the extremely high turnover rate. Everyone was constantly getting fired.
bad,If you don't have patience with dealing with unruly or rude customers please don't apply here. There are times when people will verbally drag you through the mud but you are expected to take it with professionalism and remain calm and collected at all times.
bad,"Dictated by a passive aggressive ""Site Director,"" working here was very unplesant. I would highly recommend NOT working here, if you are used to working for a company that treats you well. Convergys Tampa is where unethical business practices are made on a daily basis and employee morale is always low. Employees are forced to work overtime when it's convenient for Convergys or forced to go home when it's over staffed. Save yourself the stress and disappointment and apply for a job at a different call center!"
bad,overall the place is unstable just not a great place to work I was able to advance there with the lg program that was the good part about but the people there was too wild
bad,"It is a place of business for someone who has nerves of steel.  Myself I am a people person but the stress of the customer's got to me. "
bad,Systems were very unpleasant to work with which caused very angry customers because there were always glitches on the website. Supervisors would try to avoid taking SUP calls when requested by the customers.
bad,"Alles in Alles ist Convergys ein gutes Unternehmen, wo man angenehm arbeiten kann. Allerdings nur wenn man bereit ist seine eigene Meinung und eigenständiges Denken aufzugeben, denn das wird von den verantwortlichen Projektleitern nicht so gerne gesehen."
bad,"The only reason ive stuck this job out is my team and my manager. Every single day its the same repetitive KPI's (targets) which dont get me wrong are not hard to get, the thing is even if you try they will still raise it for an investigation or discussion. Being there over a year knowing how everything works and helping hundreds upon hundreds of people, some people I never see again makes me wonder do they value their staff. Of course they dont, i have never worked for a company or business as poorly run in my entire working life. There are managers there who have no clue, and advisers there who would make smashing managers. This job is all about who you know in my opinion and its about time i find something with better pay and more structured hours as rotational shifts are not for a family man."
bad,"Obvious favoritism management used to take calls to show they are part of the team but did not follow any guidelines set down for the agents and ignore any guidance from the agents. This is unfair to most management who tried to do well, but the most influential managers took advantage of their position and terminate good agents to keep up with stats."
bad,"Thank God I was placed in the fantastic Batch/Wave. We kept each other alive by laughing and bonding. I've had fun while training for the new things it feeds me. Its been useful, even until now."
bad,What can I say about this company?. I enjoyed my training but once I got to the production floor is was a totally different ball park. Though I enjoy helping others this is not a job I would do long term.
bad,Its a place to start off if your just getting into the work field I lasted a year only staying to myself doing my job... Management is horrible and they only look out for themselves
bad,"The training was very good. But once you got past that they changed things and they aren't as flexible as they say they are."
bad,"Did not like the company but it did pay well. It was my job to call Humana Insurance members to inform them of Humana Pharmacy, then try to enroll them in HP."
bad,"This company has high stress and high turnover not sure how I have lasted this long but have."
bad,They don't care about employees. All that matters is the client and they will constantly harass you until you perform and even then it continues. The bonuses aren't worth the stress.
bad,Would recommend staying away from this company the turn over is ridiculous and the work is extremely stressful with manager that provide no help. Worst call center experience.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"We would come in and get on the computer, had to clock in through the computer, if it was up. Bring up your ten windows and start searching for claims that you can do. I've learned what it takes to process a claim. Management was not helpful at all, because they didn't have to complete the training like us, so they didn't know how we had to process claims on a daily basis. The culture of the company was one that I had not experienced before, it wasn't as professional as should be.  The hardest part of the job was when you had a false quota system that was designed to either make you quit or for them to fire you.  There was stress to meet this quota system on a daily basis.  The most enjoyable was meeting the co-workers that I befriended."
bad,The management at Convergys does not communicate with their employees. There is little room to advance and when there is they always have a reason that you are not good enough or you are too good at your current job. They expect you to work 50+ hours a week and want you to not have overtime pay.
bad,"the overall as call center environment is was a learning experience. Upper management often lost sight of the working advisor and pushed unrealistically expectations onto the staff.Also, they would push advisors into positions they did not want or were capable fulfilling."
bad,"I will say the supervisors I had were very nice."
bad,No job security. No fair judgements for work mistakes. Salary is very poor. Staff are fun too. But management style also is not good. They terminate without looking back.
bad,"You are only a number at Concentrix. The training is minimal, and the managers are of little help. Because of the segmenting of departments there, it is difficult to create a career path."
bad,"Team lead and Operational Manager are rudes."
bad,"I applied to Convergys work from home online. My interview was 2 parts and was over the phone in the same day that they initially called me for the first. You will train together with a group of around 40 people in an online room assuming you meet the home office requirements. The training period (long time) was actually the nicest part of my experience working for this company. The initial staff that you meet is very friendly and more than helpful. I definitely was excited about working from home for this company. Eventually the training started to come to an end and the content they were teaching us got harder. It almost seemed like they had spent almost all of the long training repeating all the easy things and were now trying to cram the more difficult stuff in and shove us into production. If you couldn't keep up you were done. By the end of training there was only 9 or 10 of us left. Now my particular group was all assigned to work for Convergys as Comcast employees. Let me just say Comcast is as bad as the rumors say. Where I’m from nobody has that service so I really didn't know what I was getting into. Just before it was time to start production we started practicing by taking real calls. Your managers will say that contrary to what most people think, customers are not usually upset when they call. That is a bold faced lie. 4 out of 5 calls are from angry customers. Once you’re out of training you spend your days taking calls back to back. There is rarely a moment between calls. If a customer hangs up on you, your phone will auto ring in the next call and so on and"
bad,"very low pay. never keep promises on job advancement or compensation. only good thing about working there were your fellow co workers. no recognition for the good, but as soon as there are any mistakes they were on you. Very poor management."
bad,co workers is what keeps you going. some good team leaders others have their favorites and show it. Although when i started it was smaller and a fun place to learn and work. When owner passed away things changed.
bad,It is a job that is good for first time workers. It gives them a chance to understand what is needed to keep a full time job and possibly advance with in the social groups.
bad,"The schedules are the worst. It use to be a different schedule every month with different off days depending on how you bid."
bad,"customers were really angry 60% of the time and management would have policy changes it seemed like almost daily, the pay and benefits were decent but overall it seemed like a very strict atmosphere filled with an abundance of hatred."
bad,"I don't like  the environment of the company ."
bad,"I did not like the work environment at this company. The management was awful, was hard to advance within the company. Would not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,"if you thrive on negativity this is the place to work. It will drain you and your family. expect to be ""asked"" to stay long hours. lots of work and not enough pay. Benefits are good, so you are sure that your depression pills are cover."
bad,"por motivo de ética personal y empresarial me reservo los comentarios de mi experiencia personal con la empresa, sin ma que decir que tienen enormes oportunidades de crecimiento en el manejo de personal."
bad,Convergys is a place for young kids to get their foot in the door to customer service. After so many years if you last you will notice that the pay is horrible and no chance for raises. There was a cap when i worked there and no chance for advancement. Reps know more than management team. Place is like a mini highschool campus from top level to the lowest level.
bad,Great Over time pay and flexible schedules however not effective in professionalism and employment care. They do not promote within their company. Checks have been short numerous times. Their HR is not helpful with questions and concerns about pay checking being short.
bad,"I have been here around a year. The coworkers are great. Management is not so great. They never follow through on anything. Policies are constantly changing. There is no room for any advancement that I have seen so you are pretty much stuck where you are. Pay is ok but compared to like companies it is a little low. Health benefits are expensive and not very good. There is a dress code which is totally fine except some people seem to be exempt to it while others are not. All they really care about is numbers and not"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Being able to work close to colleagues was nice. I was able to gain skills in my customer service, and advance in technical support. They have tuition reimburement."
bad,This is a call center in Clarksville. You took calls about people's cell phones and tried to fix their problem over the phone.You work an 8 hour shift that felt like 20.
bad,"Overall, run like any other call center. Could be a good job if a majority of the employees were not constantly transferred among the various projects. As with all call centers very high turn around rate."
bad,"If you need a place to work, they'll hire anyone. I loved this company when it was Stream, before it became Convergys. Now all they care about is making sure there is someone in the chair to take the call. Benefits are terrible. Insurance is outrageous and a joke. They'll lie and promise you whatever just to get you hired to meet a contract quota. Half of the time, they change bonuses so you won't even get them or they'll make up some excuse as to why you didn't qualify for the bonus and/or incentive that quarter/month. They will string you along, telling you they want to promote you and want better for you. However, when the time comes, no promotion and it's given to someone who ""hangs"" out with the boss or is attached to their hip, rather than the person who actually deserves the job and has worked hard for it. Basically, don't waste your time unless you're in desperate need of a job and don't care about getting lied to or stepped on. Terrible company and they lose all of their good or tenured employees due to lack of actually caring about anyone but themselves."
bad,Better if you would have a higher salary for the multi talented agents that you have. What you have now isn't enough. The job is difficult but the salary wouldn't make your job enjoyable.
bad,For my first call center it was ok. I worked in many different departments seeing as they kept getting rid of them. I didn't like having to hear customers call me names and threaten me but I got over it at some point. The department I liked was technical support.
bad,"Recently worked here & enjoyed the first 2 weeks until our manager got replaced with an awful human being, Our new manager had zero communication skills what so ever. I knew more about the roll than they did. Management constantly watch you like a hawk or thats how it felt to me. If someone takes a disliking to you then you might as well pack up your things and find something else because its going downhill from there on out. Co-Workers are great to get on with & are the best part about the whole job. If you really want to work for HSBC id recommend applying for it through them directly."
bad,"If you wanna work here you have to be in it for the money. Not for customer care. You have to offer directv on every call even if the customer is calling to lower the bill which makes you look like you weren't listening to their needs for the call. "
bad,"just a job not much else a very bad job, customers are the worst people who have nothing better than to yell at someone who has nothing to do with the problem they are having."
bad,Senior management are only bothered about head count. you are not a person just £150 per day revenue. You are paid less than the going rate for the type of work you do. Avoid Convergys
bad,"if you don't kiss butt you aren't going to get anywhere, you can work as hard and be as good as you want they will still fire you over their lunch buddy in a heartbeat."
bad,"This company is awful. They promise things to every employee that they cannot come through on. I would not recommend ANYONE to work here, unless, someone in your family is literally dying, and this is the ONLY job you can get to save their life."
bad,"Co workers were fine, management not so well. Fun environment and great teaching abilities. The normal workday was when you would get about 40 calls a day and the sales would be booming, at least for me."
bad,Upper management strict and threatening. Unfair wages. Very stressful work. No job security. Awful work hours. Poor location. I have nothing good to say about this company besides the benefits plan.
bad,The organization is good for new immigrants to get their first call centre job.  I do not recommend working here long time as the Rewards and Recognition program and pay scales are way behind compared to other organizations within the industry.
bad,"If the client changes you have to retrain all over again. Benefits come and go. No security. No sense of appreciation. You can tell those who care vs those who don't, and unfortunately those who don't care tend to be the ones promoted first. When the client does change your job and title is not guarenteed. You could be a trainer one week and a lowly agent the next."
bad,Very stressful job for little pay work environment is very stressful.would not recommend anyone to this company to anyone
bad,"this job was tough, I had to talk to a lot of angry and frankly irrational customers. To be honest, it was doable, but I was happy to leave"
bad,Things change everyday. Nothing ever works. Management refuse to work with you. Pay wage does not makes up for the frustration in the work environment.
bad,No comment at this time about this job. It had it pros and cons. It was a learning experience.That is all I have to say about convergys. The at&t program was a good program to be on
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Not the greatest job. Consistently doing other site's jobs as well as your own. Terrible forward thinking and planning. Lack of training is evident.
bad,"My stay have been very educational especially that I was  a call center virgin back then. It was my first job and everyone is approachable and I stayed for a long time, I've already resigned recently and now I need some calrifications on my philhealth, pag-ibig and sss contributions but it seems like HR doesnt want to talk to me I've been trying to reach out to them for the past few weeks but the receptionist gives me a lot of excuses and at times their telephone number is not working. My back pay which includes my COE is not yet released and it has been more than 60 days. I'm really frustrated because my new employer needs my COE cause that will be the basis of my basic salary. For current employees, just check everything especially your contributions if you are planning to leave. :)"
bad,"I was on the AT&T and Direct TV project handling billing and technical issues. The job was easy no major headaches except for when you switch managers like 5 times within a quarter and you having to adjust to different management styles. "
bad,"Convergys was slightly unorganized but overall had the best interest of employees. They were understaffed in management, and the Human Resource department, but as I said earlier the managers they did have had wonderful work ethic and cared for their employees."
bad,"This is one of the most unprofessional, unorganized, inconsiderate corporations I have ever worked for. They will hire you on, train, and pay you for one job, then force you to another with no training."
bad,Job is very stressful. You are working in a call center with absolutely no flexibility for family. I learned that if you do not schedule things in advance they will not let you off and if you have any medical issue you go through this appoval period that is long and drawn out.
bad,"The company does not have any career paths. It does not divulge any policies unless you have already run into the situation. It requires a 90 day work before allowing you a week to register for medical coverage, in which it does not tell you when. If you miss it you are out of luck."
bad,"mostly listened to complaints from customers all day - no support or understanding from management - more benefit to company then to agents - company often stepped outside employment for own benefit - agents unhappy with work, but many felt trapped"
bad,"You have 5 weeks of training at first and then get sent to the phones after that. You take calls from clients about their bill, bad service, wanting more options, wanting to cancel, etc. Hardest part is employees attitudes."
bad,"as a typical work day all you do is go in to the job and sit down a start dialing outbound until you get to go inbound(if they favorite you). I learned in order to get ahead in this company you need to become friends with the owner and you need to stay and do ""overtime"". the management her is very lousy, it sucks to see that if there is a customer that needs a supervisor, they tell you to tell them to get them to customer care or they will tell you to schedule a callback but they will never call back the customer, the co workers rely on each other here, very lazy and they never do their job, you have to do things by yourself, even if they never trained you for it, the hardest part of the job is getting the manager to actually work with you. the most enjoyable part of the job to me now is getting ready to find a new job, would never recommend this place"
bad,The Job is a joke! The Company does not know how to train their employees properly. They push people to our last nerve. The company job is to help other companies with the work load that the actually company can handle. Time is not your friend anymore. It just sucks all over. Pay is good tho if you can handle a lot of stress and have no humanity.  Benefits are sorry and very expensive.
bad,"This is the type of job you have for only a little while. the rules are pretty strict, they hire anyone which is a plus and a negative. LEts just say i would never work there again."
bad,I enjoyed my time while at Convergys until the mandatory overtime became an every day occurrence that lasted for over a year.  The job made work/life/balance hard.  The job was not flexible like they stated.  Management switched often which made things difficult.
bad,I enjoyed the people that I worked for. The job was not my ideal but the atmosphere made it worth while. The hours were good.
bad,"My time at Convergys lasted all of two months. It started off fine, but rapidly deteriorated."
bad,"Work environment in Convergys is not a great atmoshphere due to management issues and how they run things there is no staff morale, other than that day to day it is a good routine with work status where you have targets to reach and you get pushed to reach them targets. The hardest part of the job would be dealing with difficult situations on your own when you ask for help you end up knowing more than the person you have to ask. I have learned in there that you have to sort things out on your own which you learn alot of things that you can carry forward."
bad,They don't want to pay you your bonuses and they don't relay information to you in a timely manner.  It is not a place I would recommend as a good place to work. It was very stressful place and you get PTO but don't get to use it.
bad,"The worst company  I have ever worked for! The have no employee relationship skills, the benefits are the worst and local management are puppets for the senior management based out of India."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,the people you work with are fun the people you work for are terrible i worked the comcast side and all the sups were just doing their own thing if you ever need one for a call good luck one of them hangs up on customers routinely and the others just don't care terms are very common went and would always hear about some getting fired attendance system is very broken and bogus.
bad,Extremely negative atmosphere.  I understand the work is customer satisfaction driven but employees needs must also be addressed.
bad,Convergys was only looking out for their bottom line and was having difficulty hiring and keeping quality employees. There was quite a bit of turn around for the line employees on the phone because of unachievable goals  set my the management team
bad,There's no help when needed during calls or with paychecks and PTO/UTO when time off is very much needed for emergencies.
bad,"I worked for Minacs for 4.5 years, it started out great with a great culture and a fun work environment. It seemed as though upper management cared about it's employees. Over the last 2-3 years there was a very high turn over rate, a lack of resources to properly do your job and meet expectations. as well a poor communication from upper management about job roles, transitions, and expectations. Overcrowding employees on one team was unrealistic, but pushed to the limit monthly. Micro management was typical, and putting in 12-14 hour days, and still not being able to complete all of your work is typical. This a company that tries to maximize profitability in a way that is non-conducive to a healthy and pleasant work environment for hard working employees."
bad,"Inbound calls for Direct TV through this company.  Customer retention department. Schedule change every posting. No regular days off ...unable to plan doctor appt, dentist appt, etc."
bad,"Good place to gain basic experience, salary is paid on regular basis and office is located in city center. Management is not capable to make operative decisions."
bad,The hardest part of my job is the schedule change every 3 months.  I enjoy working with my co workers and that is the best part of my job. Management and the company could careless who works there and anything about the employees. I work on the Netflix compagin the job itself is extremely easy but very stressful. If managment were better trained the job would be easier. Too many people giving confliting instruction.
bad,"I did live chat for this company. This consisted of 50-70 chats a day. What I learned is that unless you are liked, you will not be promoted. This company is geared towards younger people. As for my co-workers, I really didn't know them even though I did attempt to get to know them. Management was not on the same page with anything. The most enjoyable part of this was my hours."
bad,I think Convergys under pays their employees and does a bad job in trying to appreciate the employee. They schedules are done unfairly and the #1 goal is money and not the employee.
bad,"I helped  physicians to put together cancer treatment or other treatments covered by their patients medical plans.  A typical day would be to answer questions concerning open enrollment, insurance billing, and coverage.  They hardest part of my job was helping policy holders understand why certain things where not covered on their plans. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people find the best doctor or hospital for their needs.  I did't find management very helpful."
bad,"There is always room for improvement not one of the top places I really enjoyed working at. I didn't enjoy the pay that we were getting paid, the job was ran poorly including management."
bad,They are not willing to work around allergies when concerning perfumes/lotions even though paperwork is signed at the beginning.
bad,"Joined as fresher and had a lot of fun learning basics of software development."
bad,"A typical day at work for Convergys includes taking calls from angry customers about a product that isn't too good.  The chain of management there is lacking in various areas.  The quality of people they hire are also lacking.  They hire to fill seats to meet a quota put in place by the client. The hardest part of the job is trying to learn constantly changing information.  There are not any set or permanent schedules.  We worked the same schedule for two weeks before it changes.  The attendance policy is a no fault policy which means regardless of the situation, if a person is not in there seat on time they will be penalized.  One of the most unprofessional places I have ever worked for.  Dress code is not enforced either."
bad,"Unless  you need a survival job, stay away!  The pay is terrible, the management is terrible, no advancement.  I would never recommend this place to anyone."
bad,"Not a strong culture, was not a supportive environment.  Would not recommend."
bad,"At Minacs, you have to 'bid' for your shift."
bad,There has been a great turn around of employees. Many trainees quit before their first 90 day review
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,bad place to work horrible management and no chance for advancement  would not recommend to anyone
bad,If you like being harassed everyday by customers and management this is the place for you!
bad,"Never have been more depressed in my life then working at MInacs. Its a ""in crowd"" job where managers only look out for their friends. You are nothing more then a number."
bad,"A 9 to 5 job, stationed at a desk learning how to troubleshoot customers issues with internet as well as tv. Also informed of account info and sales(up-sell). I was able to train new hires for having great numbers. Most enjoyable part of this job was training new hires and meeting all typed of new people. The hardest part is practicing patience during tense situations."
bad,"just a basic call center job,, taking care of business needs on the phone"
bad,did not enjoy working for this company at all because the were very unorganized
bad,very poor management. co-worker were great but the leaders were clueless to everything.
bad,"Convergys is not for everyone, they are constantly hiring meaning a high turn around. In the facility where I worked they tried to work with you the best they could, but with only 1 to 1.5 weeks notice on schedule it was hard to make plans for family. Job can be stressful at times dealing with angry customers and then trying to sell them something. Convergys does have a rock solid sales plan, and you are coached, if you are willing to listen and follow you will succeed with this company. This job was just not for me."
bad,I wanted a fulltime job where I would be able to advance and relocate when I got married. There was no relocation opportunities so I had to resign.
bad,"Seems as if rules are made up as they go.  No uniform set of guidelines to govern employees.  Learned to trouble shoot 4 lines of service including high speed internet, home phone, cable television, and home security.  Hardest part of the job was the inconsistency in work schedules.  You could be on mornings one week and evenings the next, you are schedule according to the need of the company which would make arranging child care a nightmare.  Convergys also did not give annual or semi annual raises, nor did they give raises for extensive up trainings.  Convergys did promote a relaxed yet professional work enviroment when on the production floor."
bad,"A typical work day consist of answering calls and making sure to meet call time goal while simultaneously providing an excellent level of customer service. Management is not as tangible  as they seem upon hiring process, but they do make it a point to acknowledge employee achievements throughout out the quarter. The hardest part of the job would have to be the hours which are 3 pm to 12 am , they are unable to assist  when is comes to schedule changes for ANY reason including medical ."
bad,my working exxpirence was horrible in orientation they make the job seem so much more proffessional than it really is. there is no room for growth what so ever
bad,"The job itself wasn't bad. It was the people who were. The newcastle site ones are like a clique. They don't welcome you and you can sit there on the phone for eight hours without them speaking you. I want to leave so badly but paying for my studies on my own. "
bad,"no proper directions, no proper planning, lack of people management, management not approachable,"
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the travel opportunity when available. However, one is expected to travel for extended periods of time from 30 - 90 days at a time depending on the client requirements. Everything is always based on the ""needs of the business"" no matter how unrealistic the requests may be. Trainers are expected not only to train new hire classes but to also take inbound phone calls, support the call production floor as well as monitor calls for call quality. It is expected for trainers to work at least 60 hours per week. The culture is that there is no such thing as an 8 hour work day. Also there is no incentive for working extra hours or going above an beyond the call of duty. Opportunities for pay increases are minimal."
bad,Sent to many jobs overseas. Statistics more important than good employees. example Older well trained employees near retirement age let go for various reasons. Like to hire younger people.
bad,A typical day at work included me handling customer accounts and taking Supervisor escalated calls. Weekly meetings discussing Advisor issues to management issues and how to improve on communication in the building. The hardest part of the job was not being able to satisfy the customer with what they want with the tools we were allowed to utilize. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people that thanked you for helping them when no else could.
bad,The Job is okay but the pressure you a lot to make a sale. They tell you to use any means and then they put the blame on you and wiping there hands clean. There is a lot of favoritism.
bad,"training was very good, enjoyed it and learned a lot from my trainer, the support on the floor was non existant for me,"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"The work itself is easy, but repetitive. "
bad,"Typical day at work is being on the phones right when you clock in. if you dont auto in before you clock in you get in trouble. which isn't fair because you wouldnt get paid for that time being autoed into the phones. you have to put up with rude customers, managers, coworkers, work with multiple systems, at just a base pay of $10 when tmobile/cox/etc offer around $13-$14 for one system. They tell you its a customer service based job and then its all about sales, sales, sales."
bad,obstinate environment of work place everyday. i feel no job satisfaction over there.
bad,"This was my first real job, the culture here is very unprofessional and there isn't much job stability. Convergys is good experience for your resume in finding other jobs I they always refer back to my convergys experience. Good for a start but not to work there forever."
bad,It was a daily occurrence when i would get yelled at for TV shows getting moved to a different time slot. it just wasn't for me.
bad,"Training dept. does not do a very good job to get you ready for the project you were hired for. I noticed that training operations and floor management were not in sync when it came to what was wanted in the production floor because they would let their personal life and emotions interfere with work production.  Supervisor's would hesitate to help or just brush you off, or tell you to go look for a floor walker.  Most Supervisors demonstrated a bad attitude.  Operation Manager most of the time did not take your recommendations to improve overall agent environment serious.  The hardest part of my job was noticing Supervisors would target individual agents to fire them just because the agent disagreed with them or didn't want them on their team. And managers were approve the fire.  The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting the people that wanted to work hard and most incentives to produce.  If you are looking for a started job in the call center field, start here, but trust me after you see what I'm talking about and experience it.  You are going to want a better call center environment. "
bad,"I was a trainer for almost two years with the company. I was allowed to work 12 hour shifts 7days a week as an agent if the hours were there. Because of my performance I did promote three times in the in the first 6 months ending with Trainer."
bad,"Low wages, cool people, picked up a lot of customer service & call handling skills"
bad,I have not had a raise in over 4 years at this work place and the raise you receive is a joke. this place works you really hard to benefit the company and we as employers don't receive the benefits of the profit
bad,Manager and Team Leads seem not to know their jobs very well and needed more training. OK place but computers were not adequate.
bad,"Convergys is constantly going through changes, a typical day at work is to learn the new ways you are to perform in the company, I have learned valuable customer service skills and how to manage a team of agents willing to learn, the hardest part of the job is keeping up with the changes and making sure you follow the specs closely, with all the constant changes its hard to keep up with being top quality. Yet the enjoyable part is the fact we do get to speak with customers and help with any questions and resolve issues. "
bad,"Company provides very inefficient tools for the employee that make customers very angry, leaving the employees exposed at the mercy of the customers patience. The employees have to read callflows on every call and if you do not have the answer the customer waits indefinitely until they ask for a manager, which puts them on an escalation line that could have a long wait, is a horrible experience for both the customer and the employee alike."
bad,"while working for Convergys i loved the job, i was really good at it but i was never offered a management position. i worked for them off and on for 2 years however, they did not want to work with me being a new mother so i had to terminate my employment due to conflict with children"
bad,"A typical day at work involves dealing with escalated issues with customers' accounts that require in depth research and thorough knowledge of current and previous offers/promotions. It entails de-escalating customers who have been working towards fixing an issue with their account for an extended amount of time and be able to ensure them of a resolution. I've learned how to stay calm and completely remove myself out each situation personally in order to not get equally frustrated when communicating with an irate customer, most of which have given the company so many opportunities to fix their situation they've almost lost hope, but because they may be in a contract they may be just riding the wave until it expires, The management here is fairly easy to talk to when approached, but they lack clear and concise communication skills, especially in regards to everyone in management being on the side page. The hardest part of the job has been the recent announcement that they're cutting our bonuses, particularly a bonus based on February's stats that would've been received at the end of March and all the bonuses thereafter as well. When a meeting is called amongst all the Supervisors the first week of April about the new change in the bonus, especially a bonus that was expected the last pay period in March, that you're not told until April that you're not getting it leaves a lot to be desired and says a lot about the level of respect Upper-Management has towards everyone else. The most enjoyable part of this job has been my fellow supervisors who have demonstrated a sense of family"
bad,call center taking calls at vendor site
bad,There is NO communication between middle and upper management. The company does not offer raises or reviews. And the business ethic and organization leave something to be desired.
bad,"One on One Management engagement with staff,Fun enviroment"
bad,The repetition of job in some area can become annoying. Management need better employee skills. Nont easily to move in an advancement position...Persons newly applying have better move of advancement as well as work schedules.
bad,CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Inbound calls for billing, resolving issues with customers."
bad,I took calls for a cellphone provider in a call center. The calls were for the disconnection of service.
bad,They expect perfection but with the tools you have to use there are constant contridictions
bad,not bad
bad,"The customers are the worst, the managers do not work with u on ur work schedule. Pay is ok, but I wouldn't recommend somebody here. They have their favorites and have no compassion if ur sick and have to miss work it still counts against u. If u need a certain schedule dont even bother asking because they will not work with u, no matter what the circumstance is."
bad,sitting in a small cubical for 8hrs andswering cust call and inquireie about bills
bad,The job was ok considering the length of contracted employment.
bad,"In this great country we call the United States of America we are innocent until proven guilty. Even when we are found guilty we are judge based upon the severity of guilt. Not so at Convergys, for the smallest infraction you will get the heaviest baseball bat or the sharpest knife."
bad,"Once I arrived at work, I would login to a computer and pull up all the systems that were needed for the work day. Then I would login to the phone and wait for a call. Once the call came in, I would state what we were told to say for an incoming call and proceed to resolve the customers concerns. The hardest part of the job would be having to deal with back to back calls and making sure to leave enough notes on customers account. Also having to sell TV and internet services to customers who were already upset. Sometimes the calls coming in weren't even available for the services. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to resolve the customers concerns and making them happy."
bad,"I have almost worked for about 1 year now at Converygy's and at first it seemed like the ideal job paid training and all but once you start working on the floor, things change. A lot of my class mates quit there job looking for something better, sadly I am starting to feel the same way, what I dont like about converygys is that they monitor every since action you do on the phones and compuers, not only that but it is used against you ! for example, if a worker logs off the phone for 1 minute the managers are aware of this and will sit you down to ask why? I you can not provide a good response for this write ups will be issued, and convergys wonders why they always have to keep on hiring new people becuase they case out the ones that have been there already."
bad,"very stressful. busy. learned new computer skills, co-workers are friendly. hardest thing was dealing with customers and having management talking in your ear the entire time."
bad,A typical day consists of taking calls. Between the calls talking with my co-workers will always be rewarding. The hardest part of the job is the horrible attitudes of the people that call in. The most enjoyable part would have to be talking with my co-workers.
bad,"I loved working there at first. After training was over and you hit the floor running, there is no stability. Your supervisors change all the time, and each one wants something different. You never new what was going to be expected from one day to the next! Most co-workers were fun to be around but also very young! Management is very company oriented and very much do NOT care about thier employees!"
bad,"A typical day consisted of answering calls for Sprint PCS. Assisting customers with basic troubleshooting, bill payments, and price plan services. I learned to incorporate listening skills with problem solving along with working as a team with other coworkers."
bad,"I took this temp job, to work, while I was going to college. I actually learned how not to run a business. The people were nice, but lacked the education level to properly operate a business."
bad,It is ok just not a secure place to work....to much for to little
bad,"I can only speak for the division that worked with comcast, I've heard good things about the division that works with on-star, but customer service associates are treat very poorly by both administration and customers. I was called every name in the book by customers and employees are just coached on ""sitting there and taking it"". Training lasts 1 &1/2 weeks and then you're thrown to the wolves. abs. no regard for your home life, often times I'd work 3 weeks straight with 1 day off. the hours stink and they would often times change your market w/o even telling you, every customer you speak with is an angry customer b/c they've been shuffled around by other associates who don't care to help with their issue. works for some people... if they're desperate."
bad,"Too many of my programs were not working from the start (and these were programs needed to do my daily job ) my whole time working there never had my programs fixed, would ask for help an they blow you off, very poor management alot of kid running the place"
bad,"Overall its just not a very professional place to work, i wouldn't recommend others work for this company, unless you are prepared to deal with rude staff and no help from management with work issues."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"There is absolutely no reason to do well at this job, because if you can just skate by, and hold onto your job, you get the same benefits as if you exert yourself and try hard. You are absolutely just a number here, and in fact, that's how they refer to you. All the intra-office emails, employee signatures, everything that needs your confirmation, doesn't want a name signature. You verify everything with your employee number. It's not a good place to work"
bad,"Convergys has stopped giving its telephone reps raises. Extra income is based on your performance. So if your sick, not only do you lose pay for the day you missed, you can also forget about making any bonus. The benifits are terrible, and the turn over is almost 100%. I have stayed thinking it will get better, but it has not. RCI is a fun project to work on and I wanted to stay because I like the client. Convergys has taken advantage of a poor economy, they have stopped giving raises and have the attitude you should be happy you evan have a job."
bad,People in corporate need to do something about their management because they are horrible. They are always getting after you for ratings and surveys and care more about the survey then their employees
bad,"Working here was a serious nightmare. Training was abysmal, to the point where the trainer actually quit mid-shift. I can't say that I blamed her; she was not trained to train, had no teaching experience and was literally pulled out of production one day and told she was now a trainer. Her experience with Concentrix only spanned 6 months! The bulk of ""training"" time was spent with systems - which did not work. She read to us (which didn't work either). We were thrown into production with no nesting, during a busy time, and there were no Tier II agents available to assist us. We were shuffled around between TLs and were never even given any coaching. It's a huge company with thousands of employees, lots of clients like TurboTax, Quickbooks & Apple, big name outfits that deserve the best from customer support. It's too bad this outfit will implode someday. Tsk tsk."
bad,Working at concentrix you are glued to a computer for your entire shift. You are docked pay if you are even one minute late coming back from a break. They are very difficult to work with if you have medical issues and needs accommodation. They use that need for accommodation to prevent you from being allowed to even apply for internal advancements. They offer internships for programs that they don't actually provide. They offered me an internship as a network technician however were unwilling to provide any on-the-job training. I was expected to somehow learn how to be a network technician while sitting at my computer answering phone calls.
bad,"Communication was off..needs to be more organized, professional as well as more honest with customers. The commission given was not enough. Checks would not equal up to hours worked. Team leads were not always helpful and rude."
bad,"Managers a power trippers and they do not like you personally, they will do everything to cut you out in the project. Commissions are not being given on time They change process without prior notice."
bad,It was a nice call center environment. You had to retain lots of information in a short period of time so not missing any training was essential. Good training
bad,Must  meet sales targets ot lose job.  Staff are great but was cold and smelled bad.  Very unforgiving and stressful environment .  Liked the extra activities
bad,"Just don’t do it. If you’re looking for a permanent place and are fine with the typical poor management, school like environment, then go ahead and apply.  They will hire just about anyone from anywhere. It surpasses equal opportunity. It’s ridiculous who they let through the door."
bad,"So many targets to pass, interview process is a joke, they would higher anyone only benefit is the management are friendly and easy to talk to but they don't help our your needs that much such as if you have depression they don't know how to deal with it"
bad,Just stay away unless you want to pretty much live there. Ran by kids. If your face fits you'll get promoted and get an extra 200 quid a month. Long hours. Short breaks. People are lovely. That's the only plus. And they are all just as sick as everyone else. Just don't bother
bad,"If you like to have a consistent schedule or if you like consistency in your job, do not work here. So many changes were made and things I had been told would be happening didn't happen and they even changed around arrangements that in the end made it even worse working there than before."
bad,Do not try to make a career out of Concentrix . I would only recommend you take the job while you’re still looking for a career. Management wants you to “play the game.” You can’t be yourself there unless you’re negative
bad,There are times to stretch for 10 days with out any off which is against any company's policy. Not sure how this company is forcing/ asking the employees to stretch.
bad,I do not have any personal opinions about the job.  It is a pretty basic job with very basic requirements. There is nothing else to be said about this job.
bad,"I absolutely loved my job at Concentrix and believed the company did well by its employees who performed with passion and purpose like some of us do (and still do). However, the leadership team is lacking and has issues with nepotism, favoritism, is not supportive due to “absentee,” leaders which are the worst kind possible. It’s a thankless job for Quality, Team Managers and more. Did I mention the many hours Worked unpaid to meet deliverables? It’s a lot of work and no help or pay, and top performers are not promoted, people are moved up regardless of write ups or poor numbers. Culture sucks there sadly. And many hours were worked without help or pay."
bad,"great place if you like no policy, favoritism, and no clear paper trails you can account for on you behalf. Training is useless and its sink or swim when you transition. The site that I'm at gave us 60 days notice that there's going to be a massive layoff due to our client pulling their contract. So far they've done more write ups in the past week to two weeks with no clear policy given denied every time off request you put in and delete it. But yet useless management still walking around and they expect you to make up for all the employees they don't have by forcing mandatory overtime that know way convenient to your schedule. Slim opportunity for advancement and never real clear Direction."
bad,"The team Makes the work environment enjoyable. The job is fast pace but we can manager our workload. In the team I am in, we make the most of our day and we help each other out"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Very stressful job with no support and I have learned to be patient with Customers."
bad,"I joined this company and 1 year after I am moving out. It was good at beginning but I should have realised it was not that good."
bad,It’s a ok job if you like to sit at a desk all day. The management sort of cares long as you are on their opposite team. They don’t care about a schedule you may need. Everyone talks about each other. And the team leads are sneaky and say they’ll do one thing but does another and save themselves by turning on you. It’s a eat or be eaten atmosphere.
bad,"Dont work here.  You will have no work/life balance. You are at the mercy of the call volume. They will take your days off away, half your lunch time, and add overtime to your schedule with no warning. You may get a team lead, you may not. They only clean the bathrooms here, but the rest of the place is disgusting. And your co-workers are mean, rude and stuck up. Stay far away from this place. They cant keep anyone, evwryone is quitting left and right."
bad,"There is no job security here. At any point in time you can be let go. The benefits are terrible and the health insurance is unaffordable. The work environment is pretty relaxed, and while you are there you can get 40 hours a week, but don’t expect to be there long because they are constantly laying off."
bad,Concentrix was a job that was fun when the calls were low volume but when they are high times were stressful. The customers were rude for the project I was working on and ourn manangers would always tell us to basically cave into their demands which is why they always felt so entitled.
bad,Many problems with resources company is not interested in addressing. High stress environment with not enough resources.Absolutely no job security. Many co-workers leaving
bad,"Management has no grasp on the reality that their phone agents face, and enact policies that do nothing but crush morale and make agents look to leave. The pay does not match the amount of stress that you face day in and day out, and you will be micro-managed to death."
bad,I can't say or know what exactly you want me to say some members of management are not kind the day consist of sales an dealing with customers not a clean environment
bad,"The job preaches that it enforces soft sales, but actually encourages rebuttals during those sales. The goals, in order to make commission goals, are becoming harder to attain."
bad,"It was nice at first but after a few months you seen everyone including managements true colors. Pay was nothing if you have chilldren(s) and the location is crazy far, it's not worth the job or the time unless you live down the street."
bad,great pay i will work there anytime i have a chance.     need more advancement for employees who have worked hard and put in time there.  also need more benefits
bad,"Not  a very stable place to work in and there is no advancement opportunities. They do not appreciate employees that work hard, and give there all. Company only cares about their money"
bad,"Concentrix was a decent place to work and they make an effort to make it fun and there is a lot of freedom. The bad part is they have some ""supervisors"" who have no business supervising anyone. Good salesmen but lousy supervisors. They placed far too much emphasis on the hard sell rather than rapport building customer service. The way they have their bonuses and commissions set up is disguised as quality assurance but in reality is a way to keep people from commissioning by having a ridiculous and convoluted set of disclosures that must be read verbatim even though they are grammatically incorrect and redundant in places. Skip one single word, or say ""a"" instead of ""the"" and BOOM, no bonus for you!! :("
bad,"Convergys is just an absolute mess. Unorganised and no room to excel or advance. There was barely enough space for every employee, at times, I'd be starting my shift an hour late as there were no seats available. Managers weren't interested unless the big bosses were around. Social aspect was great though."
bad,"They have poor management. The turnover rate is high. Some of the team leaders have no business being team leaders at all. It's like highschool, if your team leader likes you you can do no wrong and of they don't they will be on your case all the time. "
bad,"This is an awful company to work for! They recent increase targets significantly making it much more challenging to achieve while at the same time changing the commission structure meaning even if you manage to hit commission, you'll walk out with at least £200 less than in the old structure. Management are overbearing and expect sale after sale despite the fact the market is changing. Not only this, but O2 do not provide any competitive deals meaning you're trying to sell with next to no effective discount. In addition, the client systems are appallingly slow, the office is in poor condition and outdated and all of the numbers being dialed have been dialed countless times before. "
bad,"The company is stingy & hate pay raise."
bad,"I did very well at this company on the level of just a technical support / account support agent with them through AT&T at the time. My biggest gripes were always just the management or lack of sometimes when needed to support agents at the lower levels. the threat of termination was always around unless your sirect supervisor went out of their way to cover you and decisions made anytime there was a customer that wasnt fully satisfied. My other gripe would be the pay. It felt awful driving an hour to make what i made and knowing that when a floor support roll or team lead position opened up that i didnt dare want to apply because i wouldnt receive bonuses unless then a team of people individually made that happen where as even at the lowest level of staff in the building with my monthly bonuses i made more than them, consistently. Very flawed system, and even aside from that we would lose managers quickly and it was almost always someone from another company that would come in and fill the role instead of people being promoted within."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"While the first few days of training wasn't horrible, one trainer was great another was completely unprofessional to include talking about her ex and why she transferred to the area. No paper, phones, pens, coats (even in the cold) was allowed in training or on the production floor. Training mostly taught how to navigate computer systems and what they were used for. Failing HIPAA was the most talked about thing because 3xs and you were fired. There was no ACW (after call work) beyond 2 mins or your name was blasted on the workfloor CHAT that was supposed to be for getting help on processes but was completely useless. TLs (Team Leads) were based on who used no ACW or were call center Leaders favorites. Some TLs didn't deserve to be leaders because they had no people skills and knew less than the tier2 agents. The SMEs that helped out during transition should all have been Team Leads because at least they knew something. You were informed that bathroom breaks were only to be taken at 2 fifteen minute breaks or 30 min lunch or you had better get a note from your doctor. If you were 1 minute late from lunch or coming in to work, you received these ""adhocs"" or notifications  (reprimands) that you had to acknowledge that you were late from TLs but could never get any help to real questions on actual resources to help with your job. There was no use of cell phones while walking on the carpet. Work schedules changed every week, never consistent. There was only 1 bathroom for the entire building use. Though you tried to ask for paid time off that was  earned, they never approved what"
bad,"The job itself is an easy day for anyone with a cursory knowledge of computers and customer service."
bad,My experience with convergy's was similar to most companies with some good and some bad experiences. The companies executive leadership team works off of a do more with less mentality due to continued budget cuts over the years. It becomes extremely difficult to avoid overloaded and stressed employees due to the high demand and workloads.
bad,"No accountability, high attrition, terrible culture. HR is ridiculous. Pay is hilarious. If you have no bills and just want some extra cash, its decent."
bad,"Not THE worst employer, but a pretty close second. I would only suggest working here if you absolutely need a job. It's not likely to turn into a career and Arizona is OVERFLOWING with Call Center's, for amount of dedication requested (sometimes extending beyond your job description), the pay is not competitive for the local Call Center positions in general, let alone tech positions. Especially with experience."
bad,"walk in take calls, fix peoples problems."
bad,It's a great way to gain an introduction to working in a call center.  They are really about the metrics and call volume.  It's not anyplace to think about having a career at.  The company can barely stay afloat with clients. Salary isn't competitve.
bad,Convergys is a very unorganized company. It took them over a week just to switch one thing in the computers for my team to take calls. They are also a bunch of liars. They said we were supposed to have a sign-on bonus on a specific date and we didn't get it on the date and they tried to make up for it by giving a tshirt away. pretty sad.
bad,"It seemed like it was going to be a great place to work but as time passed..not so much. Since they switched to new payroll company we were never sure if we were getting a full paycheck or paid at all. They hold back premiums by 2 weeks and any incentives you win you have to pay taxes on. They announced there would be no more care agents in our location, and that made a lot of agents feel uneasy and in fear of losing their job most started looking for new employment and have since left."
bad,Needs better working accommodations for the agents and better managers. More  explanation for payed time off as well as vacation time off. Fair scheduling do to seniority.
bad,Best training for call center newbies but pays terrible salary. Office politics is relatively high. Opportunities for growth and development not encouraged. (unlike other bpo). very long 1 day hiring process.
bad,I would enjoy some good moments while I was here but the new management team that we have is poor. I am already looking for a new job and to be honest I prefer to work in San Antonio.
bad,"Without being too negative I have to say I would not recommend this a good place to work, Managers were very pressured and the trickle down effect was so negative it was just drove people to either quit or people were fired for the weirdest things"
bad,"It is very easy to build a bond with your co-workers. "
bad,"Imagine a call center with terrible management, you're likely thinking of any call center you've ever encountered. Call centers are grueling work and they don't pay well enough to ignore the fact your management has no real management skills or that your call standards while attainable are lacking in understanding of customer service."
bad,Some projects are fine.  Normal back to back customer service job. Management is disorganized and do not keep promises.  Always change rules to suit them and employees are viewed as replaceable.
bad,"Management places undue pressure on employees daily to meet unrealistic goals. When metrics are not reached a punishment rather than encouragement based culture is manifested. Employees are warned and threatened every day of impending job loss if performance is not improved but the goals and standards are inconsistant and change from supervisor to lead hand and personal interpretation. "
bad,Co-workers were most part great to be around.  The trainers were awesome.  The owner of RCI group in Convergys was a little pig headed and if you didn't scratch her back than she didn't like you.
bad,"call center closed 3 months after I started working there, so can't really say much about them other then job security was zero and the enviroment was ok, though we were working there knowing the job was going away soon"
bad,"Concentrix is very big on making promises, however nothing the promise is done without any explanation, trainer was drunk on the job and manager just didn't show up when she had to leaving others to do her job but she took the credit, very bad management"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Steady hours starting on nights until you get a shift you want based on demand and performance not really any room to advance unless you are like a robot
bad,"Maybe I'm biased, but I had some bad experiences at Convergys."
bad,I miss the people I worked with. Sometimes information wasn't disseminated in a timely manner. Never felt as if employee longevity was an importance to them.
bad,"Very high pace work, lots of hours and days available to work, look to be answering a phone 90% of the time. Diverse employees and pretty fun place to work and meet people."
bad,"There are good things and bad things, Just like most places. I have been able to work from home for the last few years which I do enjoy They pay below market by quite a bit."
bad,"The job itself I enjoyed performing, my coworkers in the department I was in were great but I can't say the same for the other departments. This company hires any and everyone off the street. A lot of these employees come in smelling like weed and there have been multiple fights on the premises. The managers are very two faced and there is no room for advancement even though you put in all you time and effort."
bad,"- Limited career growth"
bad,"It was a false advertising claiming it was a professional environment but it was just like attending high School for grown ups! I was talked about, picked on for being just different and not being okay with certain things."
bad,Very inconsistent and unorganized which causes frustrations. They never make you aware of upcoming changes. Just throw you into things. Been there almost 1 1/2 years and no talk of raises.
bad,Whenever you start training you are thinking that your gonna have all the help you need. They are so focused on making sells that they miss the point of the job..... TO HELP THE CUSTOMER
bad,"Work too many hours & don't get a lot to show for it. The input/output ratio for work to compensation is HIGHLY incorrect. This is a business for profit, not for employee relations."
bad,The job isn’t fun it’s actually filled with rude customers that cuss you out all day  then the managers don’t really say anything the job is just a down job but Id you enjoy people cussing you out all day everyday then I guess this is the one job for you
bad,By far the worst job I have ever had they dont  care about your family life when it comes to scheduling management your only a good person when your a good seller other than that you're unnoticed
bad,good money but no set hours and they will move you from dept. to dept. even if you say you don't want to go. Managers will enforce rules that they themselves break with no backlash.
bad,"Management was awesome and the co-workers were great, but the people you have to speak to on the phone are nightmare inducing. Hard to unwind after work knowing you need to do it all over again the next day, and week, and month. Oh, and you need to sacrifice your break time to use the washroom. No quick toilet runs allowed!"
bad,"Pros: Pays decent, great for small businesses"
bad,"Production and metric measured without adequate compensation."
bad,"A job.. paid every two weeks"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"The work hours are long and you can be scheduled up to 7 days in a row. The policies can be unfair to employees, and customers can be frustrating, rude and often downright aggravating. The hours are long, and the breaks are short and very infrequent."
bad,"It is embarrassing to hear fellow coworkers talk the way they do with horrible grammar, made up words, and just overall ignorance when on the phones with clients."
bad,"Working for this company was okay, although I do feel as if the job was more about money than success. The company did not care about the customers like they should."
bad,"You work here when you have to, for they give minimal pay. many people work for some time and go away. ................................................"
bad,"I don't know what they make now working there, but when I was there we only made $9.00 an hour. Which in my opinion is not nearly enough for the work that you have to do, and the tools and training you need to be able to do your job successfully. The work environment can be extremely negative, and co-workers can be very ghetto and cause drama. It almost reminds me of high-school.........but worse."
bad,"You are not given the tools to effectively solve a customer's issues, the causes you to create an almost endless loop of call backs. Non-stop repeat calls all day. Supervisors are there to monitor you not really to help the customers."
bad,"Management sucks they don’t have good tactics, training sucks, didn’t learn anything !! Bad place to work wouldn’t recommend anyone to work here. no one knows what they are doing or have any kind of leadership"
bad,"It was an anything goes atmosphere even with the rules set up with employers. Never knew what your schedule was until a couple days before it was to start. The foul language and clothing were inexcusable, especially when customers were on the line and could hear it. "
bad,"This is not a career, this call center is a place where you would want to start out to get the call center experience under your belt but I can guarantee you will not want to stay at Convergys. This place of business is messy and lacks professional managers. Not all managers are the same, some are willing to help and assist but I would say out of 20 managers the percent willing to assist is a slim 7 & that is on a good day."
bad,"Worked here for about 8 months. I couldn't handle it much as it slowly became from a really good relaxing and friendly place, to really, really stressful. The management are on you every minute of the day, barely allowing you to breathe between calls, your personal time is unpaid and you get in a lot of trouble if you go over 10 minutes on a day (some managers don't let you take more than that a week). It's call after call from 8am to 11pm every day, so don't expect a break as 3 hour queue times at all times (customers are expected angry so get ready to get shouted at for a good reason too). "
bad,"Fun and fast paced environment. The sad part was only the agents that were buddies with upper management were promoted and prioritized. Despite all of these conditions, i still enjoyed my almost four year stay at Convergys."
bad,Not a Credible Company to Work For Especially If U Get Hurt. Shifts Sucks  No Room For Advancement That's All I Have To Say Period....................
bad,This job atmosphere was stressful due to lack of clear expectations with resources to help you succeed. Changes are understood but difficult when the expectation and requirements don't agree.
bad,"Long hours shift 10:20 hrs"
bad,"This was one of the most unprofessional jobs I have had in life. I worked for this company when they were known as Minacs , and it was just very unprofessional with management and the coworkers acted like they were in high school. The customers with the GM OnStar product are very rude and unprofessional as well. I would never recommend this company unless the pay is outstanding."
bad,"8 hours a day on the phones. Can only go to the bathroom on your breaks or lunch time. "
bad,Prepare yourself for a very unprofessional enviroment. Management and also fellow workers. Best advance keep your head down and don't take offense to what people say
bad,"Convergys is a toxic work environment. the best i could say of it is that it's better than nothing - but not much."
bad,"Helping customers resolve there problems, Fast typing skills, Reaching set targets, Poorly managed, So unprofessional, "
bad,"It was a good place to use as a stepping stone and for experience. But the way the company manages itself, its managers, and employees is horrible. It was not a professional environment."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Very Unprofessional! Never a set schedule. No one wants to help you they send you from person to person. The Team leads have favorites and are not fair. They act like they go by the 12.25 point system but they really don't its all about favorites and your performance does not matter to them if your looking for a long term job, this is not it..."
bad,Management had favorites as did the higher ups. Never paid out what was promised. Kept employers who didnt do the job but fired employee's who would perform
bad,"Micro Management. Good place to learn for a year and move on. If you in the wrong code for less than 2 minutes, you have someone over your shoulder. The policies change with every manager. The upper management has no clue what you do or how you do it, but thinks they can tell you how to do your job."
bad,"I worked with convergys for 2 years.. It was  okay to work  for 1 year  after that management become worst day by day.... No personal life space ,, no career growth. We can not manage our personal life with convergys. The hardest  part of the job was no break at all if the  chat flow high.... Even we were forced to starch the shifts ......    The good part  was they organize a functions  but that is for the management only even if entire floor was banging with song even then we are not allowed to move  our eyes from system...... Very bad experience....."
bad,"Company is extremely regimented and by the book when it comes to policy. All policy decisions are handled by corporate and local managers have little control. Promotions are rare and are based on metrics that agents have little to no control over."
bad,I would talk to 40 to 55 people a day about getting connected to the internet and maintaining a connection. I also started learning how to create and design websites here as well.
bad,"We received calls from customers having problems with their smartphones or tablets, and had to do basic troubleshooting with them. We were not supposed to provide complicated support unless they had purchased a protection agreement from the company. Too often, the customers needed to stay on the phone to make sure their devices would be working again; this made for long call times for which we were criticized."
bad,Take calls and make sure you did everything correctly never be late from breaks or lunch.  Why are you asking for this information the company is closing the Ogden location.
bad,"I do not have an opinion. I wasn't there long enough to form correct opinion.  I wasn't there to judge people, I was hired to do a job and that's what I did. I did not ask other co-workers what they thought about the job or their position.  I just believe they were working for their on reasons and which was none of my business"
bad,would not recommend to much people. mangers are not helpfull at all and only care about them selves reaching there bonus. the pay is minim for the hours you work.
bad,I started working here since 2012 but were still under IBM but i cannot remember what year were transferred to conemcentrix which gives us lower salary than the conecentrix hired employees ;(
bad,"Everyday I cried before having to go into work.  It was the most stressful and unhappiest place to be in my life at that point and time.  If you really need a job, sure go for it.  But don't say I didn't warn you!"
bad,"Nice environment, clean, sunny."
bad,"I loved my first couple months at Concentrix. I loved the people and the company itself. But then I was put on shift work from 4pm-1am and it was a lot to handle. Also, we were never told that we would be working for 9.5 hours when we started. This schedule was really hard to continue because I was also working on the weekends till 1 am, so you cannot have a social life. "
bad,"I thought the environment was fun but and the chats were never an issue. however the stats that are taken down are terrible and completely unreal. Even after working our backsides off we as a center still lacked the correct way and coaching on it didn't help it was just threats."
bad,"It is a generic call center,they don't care about you, I did chat and instantly hated myself the first day I walked in that building, the people are nice, they try to help you but I couldn't see myself finishing school to work there, there is title advancement but no reasonable raise, people can enjoy working there, more power to them, I have worked in other call centers but this is actually one of the few good places to work, they want you around tho, you cant take anyday of your life off, HR told me to get a letter from my church to take sunday off during my interview, I hadn't even picked a schedule yet. Long story short,  if you are a college graduate there's definitely more out there, if you just want to get by or are in your summer period looking for experience, this is perfect, they hire any disability"
bad,"The work place was cramped and to warm and the systems did not work as often as they worked and was lacking in supervisor help."
bad,Need to think before joining. Colleagues are fine. But the management is poor. Team Leader himself were stressed up. Need to re organized lot of things. Job guarantee is always at a risk.
bad,"-liked the work I was doing, liked helping customers resolve technical issues"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"The job takes over your life, doesnt pay well enough. Long hours, staring at computers waiting for calls to come through, and blamed for not making sales even though you may give your best shot."
bad,very strict environment be sure to follow the call flow and make sales or you will be doing extra coaching daily. rules change daily so make sure you are up to date.
bad,"Call Center environment, poor management, no room for growth or improvement despite advertisements. Learned how to deal with irate customers. Hardest part dealing with management and micro-managing. Most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers, not managers."
bad,"Horrible hours, stressful sales environment, management not willing to work with you. They will also hire you for a better sounding job, just to change you to a worst job at the end of your training. Run for the hills."
bad,"Customer service takes a back seat to selling DTV. ATT demands more of the contract teams then they do of the in house teams. With that being said, the only thing this company wants you to do is sell DTV."
bad,Not the best job in the world unless you want a quick $10 an hour mostly recommended for high school graduates who need money
bad,Bad pay for the work that you're doing loved that you got 24 hours of uto every three months offers benefits entry level job
bad,I checked my sss online and it was a BIG disappointment that Cvg didn't remit my sss contributions for how many months. CVG employers always check your sss contributions.
bad,No place for personal life of employees. Management never ask for their problems and so many commitments which are never fulfilled. I never recommend a company who is not able to take care of their employees.
bad,"very inconsiderate    unorganized"
bad,i honestly have nothing i would like to share. Besides were over worked and under paid. They should at least compete with the salary.
bad,"They will never do a coaching with you, never count on it. If you have to talk about how your bleeding out your ears, they won't respond to that either. Its a shut up and take calls environment, and incredibly lonely. If the hiring manager says they have a great team environment, they lie. When the trainer says she likes to have fun and this is the environment to do so, that is also a lie."
bad,"I would not go back to this place of employment. The training class was fun but when you get on the floor the only thing the supervisors are worried about is there job security. Yes they had great bonus opportunities, but its like high school. You have the top dogs that run the catwalks and they were bullies. They didn't care about their employees well being and they didn't care if you had an emergency. The only benefit from this company is if you were a great sales person you got great bonuses. Other than that it was uncomfortable."
bad,It's very unorganized in every area. I dont ghink they had much care or their employees long as numbers looked good to them that's all that matters. Poor communication skills from management
bad,"It's a very dynamic account where the only constant is changes, but it's really cool because I've learned so much with regards to handling customers and down to the product. Shifting schedules is not a hindrance for me to get tired in fact I enjoyed working any time and I love my co workers for we treated each one of us like a family. We received a very high volume of calls everyday because the account is really a huge company."
bad,"Working at convergys was not the easiest to say the least. A typical days work at convergys would taking around 30-40 calls every day, troubleshooting different things such as internet, phone, bill, and cable. I learned a few things about a Internet router on the inside. and if i was having the same trouble at home how to troubleshoot it my self with out calling technical support if not necessary. The management was definitely not the best they did not care for you what so ever. You stay in constant fear of your job. But your co-workers were enjoyable to work with. The hardest part of the job was having to deal with irate customers all the time. Having some curse you out over something that was not your fault was not the most enjoyable thing. The most enjoyable part about the job was the friends that I made while I was their"
bad,"Not a bad place to work as far as the coworkers, but there are few opportunities in the Greenville, Office for advancement.  And there are no cost of living or performance raises.  So if you have worked here several years and be paid the same as someone you are training or a coworker on your team who takes 30% fewer calls than you.   You may also get emails managers if you have have to go to the bathroom during your shift outside of your assigned break time.  Your headset seems like a tether. "
bad,"Turn over rate is high"
bad,"Poor work environment. Policy disallowed for any advancement internally. Poor hours. Poor HR assistance, Poor management training. I found this to be a very eye opening experience as in what to avoid."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,I find difficult to communicate to the management and the management seems like they were handling robots.The work environment is not conducive for those who seek growth here.The operation manager and the team leader are doing the same thing and there is no scope for escalation as the HR spoc is also looks like a helpless person making the work place very unhealthy.the only thing is you can earn money for short period and leave as there are multiple person who are waiting for their turn to get promoted for years but not achieve anything of that short.
bad,"was an okay job at first not so much later on constantly dealing with change and not the best of changes either management is not the best, not fair work place. constantly being told negatives not enough positive"
bad,The worst company I have worked for in my life. Management is horrible  and very unprofessional call center. No training but they expect a lot of production.
bad,"-This company does not know what they want"
bad,"- teaching korean kids how to speak and write English"
bad,"One word: GHETTO!"
bad,"Good to start for a first job , not so good for long term. You will notice that it will really hurt your back.( from bad chairs and broken and dirty computers) ."
bad,With AT&T buying out DirecTV they change things on a daily bases and yell at those who are not getting it. From a class of 22 only 3 people are still working there. I was one of the last to leave.
bad,"Worked here a little over 6 yrs. Started out fine when I was with AT&T work at home. Enjoyed it immensely. Once Convergy's did away with the AT&T WAH program( only within the United States I might add) , it was the beginning of the end. Some of us were offered a temporary NFL Sunday ticket sales opportunity, or permanent DirecTV position. I opted for the permanent position. Once the NFL Sunday ticket sales push was over, every person in my training class including me has magically disappeared from their employment. I was the last of 14."
bad,"This is a company where you can get promoted twice, and make less than those below you.  They don't value their employees, and they like to shoot themselves in the foot a lot when it comes to deploying new features that should benefit the consumer, but usually only cause more harm."
bad,"Don't be deceived. Make your money, get on your feet and leave quickly as possible. Unstable company that has issues with money. Every pay day I pray to God that I get one get a check , and two its actually correct. This company does not care about the employees and you can tell. They hire anybody, and if you were ever to visit you would see EXACTLY what I'm talking about."
bad,"Convergy was an okay place to work for. The working atmosphere was a little rough at times, but manageable. The training was a little short and confusing, you would need to ask more question than the information that was given. Managers were okay; only a few were enjoyable to work with."
bad,"my time at convergys has been varied to say the least ive been in 4 different department the most recent being admin bank which i really enjoyed, i wasnt happy when i moved back on to the phones as i wasnt asked or consulted by the management before the move. i prefer working admin jobs i feel thats where my heart lies"
bad,I never recommend Concentrix due to substandard Management who never bothers about Employee and also No increase in salary even if you are an loyal employee since ages
bad,"just a call center job, which got me through when I needed it.  I did learn some great things there about Juniper Networks and networking."
bad,"Convergys is not physically demanding, but it's mentally and emotionally demanding.  It takes a while to get used to callers who are often rude and insulting, but you'll get over that.  "
bad,"Demanding work, very fast paced, better pay than some jobs, strict policies, if you don't mind angry customers 99.9% of the time this job is for you. It is a good starting job for your first job to put on your resume, however, this is cubicle work and it does wear you down quickly. I was working 4x10 shifts (4 days, 10 hours each, with three days off) which seems like a very long time sitting down, However, you do get great flexibility with your shifts. However, if you don't like to be a number in a statistic I highly recommend not to do this job, it's easy to get work here, make sure you can type 60 WPM (easy)."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"The management was not there to help employees when needed;not really sure who my team leader was. Talking to customers was the highlight of my day, the good ones and the bad ones. I just dreaded dealing with the work environment."
bad,"Its not the most organized in the slightest, and the turn around rate with employees is pretty crazy. You're lucky to make it to your 1 year mark. If you ask anyone who's ever worked for this company, they all have the same opinion, at some point  EVERYONES worked there for a short time."
bad,"The job is an ok job I say this because the only thing that I look forward to was overtime, a majority of the people the are rude or act as if helping someone will hurt them. No matter how good you feel you doing they tell you opposite and lok for any reason to fire an employee."
bad,"The trainers didn't ensure that you were educated on everything enough to be the best representative that you can be. The resources weren't updated while I took calls, and they'd rather terminate you than train you better. Your job is never secure working for a place like this. I would never recommend working here."
bad,I was part of the work from home contract taking calls for a wireless cellular service. Was a very stressful job with little training and was difficult to obtain support with the work from home experience. Callers were difficult and always angry.
bad,"inbound calls and out bound calls, disconnect service, saved service, troubleshoot equipment,. the managers let their personal relationship interfere with their job.that has alot to do with the big turn over they have. i love worker with my co workers ...the hardest job about the job was and attending to the customer but not knowing if you will have a job the next day."
bad,"This is a good company to go to to gain experience in a high workload stressful environment. The company was not the best to work for, I would not recommend it for many. It is a great entry level job to go to when you want to gain experience to elevate into other fields."
bad,Its an okay company but it comes with a lot of mess..if you like working at one set rate then this is the job for you.I really did not like the atmosphere or how the employees are treated..
bad,Judgmental employees and very unhelpful. Feel like they are out to get you a lot of the time. There are some nice co workers just a few that weren't there to work but instead to gossip.
bad,"taking in bound calls, and you never know what is going to be on the other end of the phone. You WILL get yelled at for things you have no control over, and things other people have done. You are expected to trouble shooting smart phones, but the resources they have for you are pretty bad. Most of the computer systems crash at times when you need them. Don't expect help soon, they have most of the management on the floor, taking calls. Your days off are inconsistent, and often split. The best part of the job is some of the people you work with, not everyone is friendly. This is a good place to work, if you can't find anything else. If you find something else, run..run away fast."
bad,"The company has a good heart, helping people with disabilities live their life. Over all though this company is bad. No room for growth, no promotions, minimum wage for hard work."
bad,"Convergys hires anyone so their turn over rate is really high. Half the people you work with are extremely incompetent. It's pretty easy to move up in the company to a team leader or senior advisor, as long as you have good attendance and are besties with your manager. If you're absent because you were in the hospital for 6 days, they treat it the same as if you just didn't feel like coming to work for 6 days, which isn't fair to the people with legitimate reasons as to why they weren't at work. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was helping new customers learn to use their products, and the hardest part was when you got a customer who was extremely rude. Overtime is usually available but if you need less than 40 hours they'll give you a hard time about it."
bad,A typical day would be non stop customers yelling at you. I learned patience. A lot of micro managing. My coworkers were unique. The hardest part of the job was having no real down time from the moment you started answering calls until your break. The most enjoyable was when a customer would be just so happy that you helped them.
bad,Inconsistent and job security is worried at all times. Never know what your schedule is and it is always changing. People are always coming and going
bad,"Convergys is a company that hires home agents.  I started with Convergys November of 2011 - June of 2014.  Three years - not one raise.   My job was to do customer service for Amazon.  I had already had experience with Customer Service and being on the phones, answering questions, checking on payment methods, checking orders, updating payment methods, reconciling disputes about payments etc.  I was proficient and experienced with what I was doing.  Also multitasking with CSC (customer service central) and other internal programs.  That was a typical day.  The management was poor.  The hardest part of the job was trying to keep customer surveys at 90% or above.  If a customer called in and was in a bad mood, no matter how nice you are, they would give you a no on your survey.  Nothing you can do as to what they select.  So because my customer satisfaction survey was at 80%, I was fired.  The enjoyable part of my job was talking to the customers.  All walks of life are on the other end of that phone.  You learn how to listen.  Listening is a skill.  It's extending empathy when needed.  Understanding what they are requesting.  I enjoyed that very much.  Convergys in the end lost their contract with Amazon.  They do have many 500 fortune clients, but Convergys themselves needs to revamp the management.  Many long hours, especially holidays.  I learned to be very patient with customers."
bad,"I found Convergys to be a great place to start out when looking for jobs. I loved/love my job at Convergy's i've met a ton of awesome people HOWEVER, they do a horrible job with their HR department. In the time i've worked there soo far I've witnessed: "
bad,"I worked for Convergys for many years, I can tell you for a call center the pay is way below average, most start you at around $11-14 an hour, Convergys around $9.25 maybe a bit more if you have experience, they say more in their ads, but that is with there bonus thing, that is pretty much impossible to get, if you work the AT&T side they are open 365 days a year, no Christmas or Thanksgiving off, though AT&T employees doing the same job get all holidays off and much higher pay."
bad,Convergys did not help with my confidence. I was always a nervous wreck. I loved talking to people and helping them. I even built a rapport with customers by setting call backs. Customers appreciated this. They would always tell me that if more people were like me they would stay with AT&T. I thought I was doing ok. My stats started out in the negative of 50+. I had worked very hard and was doing everything the team lead would coach me on. My overall attainment was getting better. Instead of being last on the list of say over 400 employees i worked up to like between 156-170. I thought that is what they wanted. I could not get my average handle time down under 11 minutes. They let me go. I really would not recommend the company to anyone. Left bad taste in my mouth.
bad,Typical day include 8hr shifts with 45 min for lunch and 2 10min breaks. Patience is a strong suggestion due to the unprofessional structure of the company. Hardest part of the job is the overwhelming volume of calls.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Had very little training, was sent home every day for 2 months because they couldn't get their systems working, when the systems finally started working they went very slowly and kept crashing. They crash on a daily basis and the whole building finds themselves sitting doing nothing for an hour or two waiting on the system to be temporarily fixed - I would rather not be paid to sit and do nothing! Most of the employees can't clean up after themselves, one person went to the toilet on the floor deliberately ""for a laugh"" and there have been reports of people throwing food at the walls too. It's like being back in primary school!"
bad,"Work consisted of answering calls from Sprint customers about billing issues or phone issues. Supervisors were always hard to reach, at least four were on duty at one time. They had taken a person strait off the floor into management position with no prior training. This lead to many dissatisfied employees. Higher ups did not seam to worry about the lower down employees since they had more to apply. This leads to employees feeling unappreciated. Some employees were fired and then they were called to come back at reduced pay which was turned down. Stress leave was used by most employees at least a few times."
bad,"There is absolutely no consistency at this company. They will constantly change your schedule up until the last minute even on the day of an expect everything to be the same. Everyday the rules and policies would change and you were expected to do go with it without any discussion. There is a lack of communication between upper management and the supervisors on the floor so each person you go to for assistance with an issue will give you a different answer. another issue is there is no flexibility for staff that have special needs, for example staff with children that need to work specific hours or need consistency. The only thing that keep me going into work each day was the amazing people that I work with."
bad,"Friendly and good environment to work."
bad,"Very unprofessional, no manager help whatsoever, no time to log into systems to do work, no feedback to do job accordingly, human resources was no help as well regarding pay stubs, employment verification, etc"
bad,Management does not have any concern for the well-being of there employees. They only care about service level of calls and that people are saying things when they want to hear them. They do not care that you try to do your best but never meet what they are looking for.
bad,Lack of professionalism and managerial skills. I would not advise anyone to waste their time.
bad,"It is one of those companies you work for out of desperation, or perhaps it may be your first job.  The job market in Utah can be pretty tough as it is an ultra-conservative, right-to-work state.  There is an abundance of workers and government is a great friend to these companies that passively abuse workers.  Until the Federal Government provides healthcare and dental, working for such companies is not for the primary wage earner in a family.  Convergys"
bad,"This company is no longer around. However, this was a very good company, and the advancements was very great. Inbound call center that allowed customers to call in and go over the bills, issues with the phones services, etc."
bad,"A typical day at work was on the phone and the computer helping customers. I learned how to deal with customers and fix their problems. Very fast past no time to get to know co-workers. "
bad,A typical day at Convergys involves reacting to change in real time. I have learned that you have to be flexible to survive in a call center environment. I have enjoyed developing my advisors as well as my peers. While assisting others in their growth and development I have grown. My co-workers are all different which has helped me with thriving in a diverse population. The hardest part of my job is being able to consistently change. It is also hard knowing that my salary is not competitive in the market where I live. I enjoy being a cornerstone in my office. It feels great knowing that everyone can depend on me to be there and get the job done effectively.
bad,"very little information about changes mostly just a notification on mail"
bad,"Answering phones, taking payments, setting up new service for AT&T, review of the bills"
bad,"It is not my place to say if a person should work somewhere or not, but from my experience, this is not a place for anyone to work who has common sense, ability to understand right and wrong and who wants to work in a team based environment. If you are willing to be cut throat, back bite and to step over people for the sake or advancement, even temporary, then this is the place for you. Do not look for professionalism from coworkers or management. Be willing to adapt to new policies and procedures on a regular basis. Be willing to accept positive and negative feedback on a regular basis, even if you do not agree with it and they can not provide the backup to validate their claims. "
bad,"The over all experience with Convergys had its ups and downs. Training in the classroom was fun and interactive but once out and on the phones, it was clear that the jobs requires a lot more than just basic trouble shooting with the client. The list of things that can go wrong with Charter's equipment goes on and on. I realized that the first couple of months with Charter was going to be rough because in order for me as and Agent to learn, I had to handle every situation on my own and hope the out come was a good one. The support from my ""team"" was bleak."
bad,"Immediate manager was good, seemed to care about his staff.  "
bad,"Very small wage with a lot of pressure and an important turn over,"
bad,"very lax dress code and prode of it, due to the fact their pay scale is so low. that is straight from headquarters."
bad,Dealt with credit card holders and assisted in credit increases
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Convergys is an ok place to work. Benefits are expensive and your not making all that much to begin with. They really don't care about you or your personal situation only about the business and business needs. the one client I was on would send you home even if you didn't want to or couldn't afford to. My coworkers were fun. that's what made the job. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers without the proper resources to allow exceptional customer service.
bad,Management becomes biased of its employees and does not properly reward them for their skills.
bad,Convergys is the most ridiculous place to ever work for.  They know it and that is why they have very nice incentives. The money was nice but the atmosphere is bull. Everyone is two faced
bad,This job was contracted through a third party.  This particular job is better suited for those that are fresh out of high school.  The work environment was not conducive to that of the professional atmosphere that I am accustomed to.
bad,Typical day at work consists of complaints from customers due to equipment not working. Learned to research equipment prior to purchasing. Co-workers are laid back. Hardest part of the job is complaints from customers and trying to convert angry customers into sales.
bad,I did work at home for AT&T wireless. I was at my desk in my office for 8+ hours a day working 40 hours a week. I would take inbound calls from customers needing technical support for their wireless devices.
bad,The lower level managers are for the most part incredible. Your co-workers are a unique combination of different age groups and personality types. This job is ideal for anyone 18 to 60. You spend your day on phones talking to customers about their billing and preforming minor trouble shooting on wireless devices. The hardest part of this job is remaining detached emotionally from the calls. The customers will curse and yell but you have to remain calm and control the call.
bad,"I've only been with this company for about 3 months and I'm already submitting apps for another place to go. I'm currently a 21 year old college student seeking work that will compliment my schedule until I transfer off to a 4-year institution soon. Time goes by fast but it's really only what you make it. If you plan on working there for the money, DONT do it. It's fair pay but only if you're a college student like me. Working for a cable company like Charter sucks. The management is pretty cool. Everything isn't their fault but others just care less about the employees. They would just rather get the day over with. The company is obviously there for THEIR needs and not their employees. They rather their employees work hours that's best for the company and not the employee. There are people who have kids and they've quit because they hardly see their kids anymore after working there. One of the good things about it is that there, you're working in you own space and your own pace (if you get there early enough to find one). Everything isn't for everyone so Convergys is not for me but it's an experience to have in the meantime until something better comes soon. I DREAD going to work there but it's paying the bills for right now lol. It's a stepping stone from working fast food but I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone that's in college or have children. Please do all of your research before choosing this place."
bad,Convergys is a fast paced employer. It is difficult to balance your schedule without feeling pressured in any way but at the end of the day it is a job.
bad,"i did not work here for very long. it was a good place to start my customer service career and i do admit i learned a few things in the process."
bad,A typical day here included answering multiple incoming calls regarding internet and email issues. At the time I was employed the superiors over me were horrible at helping their employees. We were not allowed to give out any information that was not provided in training although you may know how to resolve the issue over the phone. The hardest part of my day was figuring out how to solve issues without stepping over my boundaries and making the customer setup a house call that would charge them due to an error that was their fault. I try to focus on customer retention for the company since it was the customer who keeps us in business.
bad,my typical day at work consists of online banking navigation and assisting customers with passwords resets
bad,"I currently am employed with Convergys on their AT&T Project.  Supposed to be customer service and sales, it is really more sales focused than anything. The training environment was alright, nice people, our trainer was good but went off task a lot playing a lot of games wasting time where we could be learning the multiple systems so that once we were actually training on the phones we would know what we're doing.  There's a lot of dramatic people who work there who tend to be a distraction. Managers/Sup's aren't very helpful most of the time.  The shift rotates monthly which makes it difficult for me personally because of childcare.  Pay isn't that great unless your making a ton of sales which is hard to when the customers are angry about something or don't want to hear your sales speech's.  I am currently in search of a different job to say the least....."
bad,"The job isn't very hard, talk to people on the phone and fix their issue. you get all the training you need to operate the programs. However, there is a huge emphasis on sales. This is an aggressive sales environment. You have to fix problems and get a sale within 10-15 minutes and you gotta push until the customer gives you a straight up no 3 times. It is a company that doesn't keep the employees informed of policies or changes yet expect perfection. Even durring training you are not taught what you are and are not allowed to do, you're supposed to figure that out as you go. It takes about 5 months to get used to the swing of the job. So if you want to work here, act like a car dealer, be diligent and expect to learn 80% on your own."
bad,"The place wasnt bad, had state of the art vending machines though a lot of it was over priced. At times you had to fight for seating and the company was more of a production based enviroment so it made it difficult to get days off when sick without being pointed or to use any paid time off accrued"
bad,"Well when I first got hired I'm like great I have a chance to grow and Make money.  Making money part yes growth no. I was trained poorly by trainer who never was clear on teaching we sat at computer all day reading. For 8 yours a day. In transition in the phones barely knowing how to do our job yet. The coaches were like and not helpful Use my csp. That first I was in car addicent still showed up for work the next day with my addicent report was told I was fine an the point wouldn't be added. Okay I'm great. Okay everything was good up until I was on the call floor. We has this chat we used to ask for help would take 10 to 15 minutes to get help and also this res desk that was to help with angry customer wanting us to something we couldn't do. Because of a policy. Sometimes I would get hung up on. Customer would hang call back upset at convergeys AT&T project. My Team lead wasn't really all the helpful was kind of rude at times. People on my team disliked him. I only liked our ace coach she helped me a lot more. I was in second car accident totaling my car on my way to work there. I came into work the next with my accident report and pictures. My tl told nothing I can do about excusing that and pointed Out unless it was jury duty,and pTO. I said its not my fault tl said your being hostile keep it professial take up with HR if you have any problems with it. Cried a couple of times too like I plan to get my car totaled I could even make up those point with overtime because of stupid numbers I was also told by the tl that I could make the time up for that. In one week to verbal"
bad,"The job was easy and ok, the management team made working there a nightmare. There was also several IT issues that needed to be resolved"
bad,"difficult place to work, with no life balance and very stressful"
bad,Not very professional. Unfortunately Convergys Corp. has gone completely down hill since i worked there in 2005-2007. I was very disapointed when i came back. The most enjoyable part of my day is talking to my humana members and saving them money. :)
bad,This place sucks. They hire anyone off the street. The managers are ok and the they offer good training.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Very low base pay, employees not told how sales driven position is until several weeks into training. Multiple disconnects within training,  6 out of 33 of our training class went to the floor. Tech issues on company side, unless you can prove it is specifically company you don't get paid for that time"
bad,"This company is not organized, and is not a stable place to work. The best part of this company is the classroom training, but once you get on the floor out of training, you have no support or guidance."
bad,"Revolving door. High Turnover rate. They try to make the environment better, but has a long way to go."
bad,"A new site director every 3-4 years comes in and demands change. The wheel gets remade every time and proven techniques are thrown out the window. If a agent can get past harassing phone calls from customers, the opportunity of advancement is the best I have ever seen. Supervisors that work hard to develop agents by ""stepping away from desk"" either have to put in more than 80 hours a week to catch up or get reprimanded. To much micro management and useless trackers required."
bad,"Working at Convergys is not all its cracked up to be. You are on a phone call in a pod full of people who are supposed to be taking phone calls, but most of them talk amongst themselves as if they have nothing else better to do. No one seems to have respect for others that are on the phone. I sit there struggling to hear what the person on the phone says. But I can't always decipher if that is because of the environment I am in, or if it is because the equipment I am using is faulty. The computers aren't updated, the equipment don't always work. There are fights that break out over who stole someone else's chair. Its not something I would choose to stay at, in the least. There are a few people I get along with, but I am not friends with most people. The hardest part of my job is not knowing if my training will be sufficient enough to actually help those who are calling me. The most enjoyable thing about my job is just getting a paycheck. Although, for what I have to deal with, the amount I get paid per hour should be a little higher than what it really is."
bad,Great place to gain experience but not a place to grow for greater opportunity.
bad,"I worked in the retention department which is a stressful job. When I first started it paid well because of commission. The client decided to changed things up it became close to impossible to make a commission so it felt as if I was working my tail off, getting screamed at by angry customers and then making them happy again, for nothing."
bad,A typical day at work was coming in early enough to remain informed on changes and log into system. I learned how important self-management is and how some employers do not appreciate their employees. My supervisor was a considerate young man that attempted to assist in every way he could. It was a mix culture younger and older individuals. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the inconsistencies. Most enjoyable part of the job was assisting the customers and the co-worker that I meet that kept me encouraged.
bad,"answering cus. calls for att uverse, I learned some new systems. management was horrible. no problems with any co workers. hardest part was not really knowing exactly what to do on the calls, lack of training that should have been done. most enjoyable was trying to learn a new part of retail, but really was just not the job for me."
bad,"Was hired as a full time employee only to be let go in 6 months when contract ended, was not made aware contract was ending or that I was a contract only employee."
bad,we had a great team but did not have any actual help when we really needed it.
bad,the work it self was fine i quite enjoyed it. the customers some times got a bit loud and rude but it wasn't anything that  couldn't be ignored. what really struck a bone in this work environment was that they would change rules and wouldn't inform you about the change until you broke it. they would expect u to do humanly impossible things like working with a bleeding nose or throwing up. 
bad,I had learned alot from there but improvements need to be made in management.The work place always changes in rules and regulations. So many people at work at once there would be no seats availible at times for hours.
bad,"A telecommunication company which values service over employee with the motto ""clients come first."" With a high retention rate and no area for advancement in pay unless certain metrics which are ever changing are met, the company does offer benefits but when you are earning close to minimum wage (9.00 to 10.00 per hr) those benefits just seem like more money cut from your paycheck. The work is easy and repetitive typically taking over 60-100 calls depending on your shift with two breaks. Employees are promoted to management positions depending on their work ethic. The most enjoyable part of the job is the fellow employees typically young  and enthusiastic."
bad,Its quite a friendly environment  where  many new things  can be learned like new software. meet many people of different cultures and countries. 
bad,"Horrible work place, hated it there. Management played favortism and a lot of lies were sold as many of us were hired on. AT&T got in their butts because the site wasn't doing well so they were firing people left and right for the most menial reasons. Free check for a few months beyond that not worth staying or making a career out of."
bad,This company doesnt appreciate the employees that it has and that has dedicated years to them.
bad,I currently work here. It's an okay job for right after high school. But it's not good for anything else. The policies and procedures change weekly.
bad,It is an inbound call center that focuses on customer needs.
bad,"Sending direction over the computer, setting up accounts. I've become more adept at multitasking. The management was pretty fair for the most part. I enjoyed most of the people I worked with. I was constantly scheduled for third shifts, so that was the most hardest part of the job. I enjoyed the compensation."
bad,My problem with Convergys is the lack of training and organization which made it stressful for new starts like myself.
bad,working at convergys was pretty good i loved all my customers and helpping them out just felt amazing. i learned to work under a time form .
bad,"My clients kept me going as they consistently appreciated my work. Convergys hires a constant flow of people and has many challenges managing the constant turn over. Only one manager ever said thank you to the employees, she is resigning!"
bad,"I worked here for a while an it is beyond stressful! 1, management has there favorites if your not in the loop they find every reason to pick with you. 2, management does not no how to do payroll messed 2 of my checks horribly. 3, they continue to change your boss an your schedule so you never really have any time to do anything if you have kids this is not the way to go. 4, there is no job security they are always bullying people that they will fire you which they WILL."
bad,"though the pay and benefits are really good, you're confined to a desk all day with minimal breaks, and though you get a few calls that are nice, much of the call workload is customers calling and yelling at you for things you have no control over."
bad,It gives you hours and job stability. They do not feel the need to work around family or personal issues that happen to interfere with work.
bad,Pay is good but the way that they run the place is horriable. wish i would move up in the company but i didnt feel like that was the best thing to do right now.
bad,"Work at Convergys was an exersise in futility. There was absolutely no advancement oppertunites as there was no lower, or middle management movement. When positions did open up in lower management due to terminations, or someone quitting because of the management culture of who you know. Not what you know, middle management would hold what some us called the popularity contest. Convergys' quest to be profitable at at the expenses of the work force was insane. I have only worked for a few companies that viewed their workforce as a liability. I will never work for them again."
bad,I never had a set schedule but didn't mind it my co-workers were great but management not so much they were always laying us off and rehiring us it was just confusing i enjoyed talking to all the different races of people that would call and the hardest part was quality control.
bad,From day to to I talk to patients and medical doctors about medication and insurance..... Patients ordering medications or out of meds fussing at you.................. Your advancement depends on a point system
bad,"Typical day @ work started @ 7:45 a.m. When I was offered this shift I jumped for joy. This would allow me to drop my son off @ school, pick him up from daycare and still have time to do homework, as well as activities withmy son. I learned that my team performed much better in the moring then the afternoon shift(we were all much happier). The hardest part of my job was saying goodbye to my friends and supervisor, we had become like a family, and they looked @ me as the team mom. The most enjoyable part of my job was the satisfaction I got when my customers would praise me for my help, and would tell me how they wished i were closer too them so they could fix me dinner, bake me a pie or just give me a hug."
bad,"great pay and benifits while the jobs lasts. very high turnover rate and very drama out place. very unorganized and unstructured, would NEVER recommend anyone to work there."
bad,"Call center takes calls for a nationwide cable provider. TL responsiblities include monitoring quality, pushing sales, and reporting as well as handling escalated calls."
bad,"Though energetic and basically a fun place to work, the availability of advancement opportunities lacked. Worked with customers with questions about their television service, assisting in order Pay Per View movies and events, adding services to their programming package, or paying their bills. Co-workers were fun and entertaining. Most difficult part of the job was trying to change angry customers into happy customers. This company offered free satellite television service to employees."
bad,"Typical Day at work was very quick and easy with setting up customers with Direct TV services and promotions, I learned how to quickly ease customer complaints into satisfaction."
bad,This company is a great place if you were a student in college.
bad,The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers. Most of my co-workers were good to work with. I learned a great deal about various software systems. The hardest part of the job was trying to please management because they were not employee friendly and set unrealistic goals. A typical day at work consisted of trying to help customers in spite of the unfriendly environment which management provided for us.
bad,"A good start in customer service, but not stable. A good job for high school students."
bad,"daily/weekly and monthly testing with 'must get above' exceptions (always above 90%). Always having more than half of the employees quite/fired withing a few months. Took an average of 200 calls a day, with no downtime/breaks allowed between even if it was an emergency call."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Liked the job in the begining, training was lacking. building was full of black mold, caused me to be sick all the time because I am allergic to it. They would not clean it up, so for health reason i ahd to leave."
bad,Management was very unprofessional and did not care to help or do their jobs. Very comfortable with their current positions and felt they did not have to adhere to the same rules as everyone else.
bad,"I have worked here awhile. I have to say the job is ok. The pay was fine when i started got regular raises for good performance numbers, They changed this two years ago, now you only get a monthly bonus depending on your performance but no pay raises with cost of living in area increasing. A few good managers but some don't do anything. Work Life balacne is non existent used to work with school schedule now if you don't have a school schedule every semester or quarter for your school they refuse to work with it. They value you about as much as your performance."
bad,Not a very professional setting. A lot of in-house issues.  Also Lacks security. Favoritism is very popular in office. This was months ago however I did not find working at concentric at all pleasant or professional
bad,Would not recommend. The company will end the project earlier than contracted. The pay is decent. When i worked there it was for Hr block as a technical support representative.
bad,The job duties itself were easy and rewarding but communication between managers and their teams was always unclear and no one really had any answers. No one ever seemed to be on the same page.
bad,Job & benefits are good but overall the growth and training options fall short.  The focus on managing people was more of a fire drill than on actual management rules/practices.
bad,"If you like your schedule changing ever week and working odd hours then you’ll fit in, when you’re told no weekends don’t believe it! This is a job fir single and younger people that like changing hours weekly!"
bad,"Concentrix is stable company although working schedule is the only problem in this company, I can't recommend this company to those who like the fixed schedule."
bad,"The work environment is fun, just wish they mangement was more understandable to life situations. With life situations such as deaths in the family or pregnancy they werent very understanding"
bad,"I didn't like working for this company. They have favoritism and benefits suck. I worked at two locations. I worked in Clarksville, TN and Jacksonville, NC. Both locations are not really appreciative to their employees. I was let go from both locations because of my PTSD attacks. Equal opportunity is a lie. Don't work for them. Try Asurion, a much better company."
bad,"I learned a lot on how IT work on BPO industry, on how the mangement handle their staff. We also have a low yearly increase, but still i learned a lot."
bad,"Terrible terrible terrible terrible. Rude. Demeaning inflexible unrealistic. Unattainable goals , silly expectations and unprofessional environment. Ridiculous"
bad,This company could have been better but every company has its flaws. Awesome people. Gained an Amazing amount of knowledge and grew as a woman during this experience
bad,I liked when I worked in Sales but I didn't enjoy the technical side of the job. They didn't have extensive training and I think that is what made me dislike working at Concentrix.  It was like we were being thrown to the Wolves.
bad,Not so much enjoyable. no growth in term of professional and financial. they put so much mentally stress. the worse management I have ever seen somewhere.
bad,"the days are long and the job is repetitive. not a lot of help to work with ones schedules. very straight forward, arrive to job, sign in to the computer and you get certain amount of break"
bad,"When you come in, everyone will greet you good morning. The manager will do rounds with his Starbucks and do the same thing. It's a repeated daily routine that did not motivate me to keep working with them."
bad,"Working with Concentrix has proved to be the most difficult and most stressful job I have had so far. I worked with Vodafone Inbound and the  company promised a lot to me when I applied: bonus, vouchers and a very relaxed job, which was exactly what I was after in my new job venture. In my time with the company, I received nothing. I sold a number of phones, tablets, mobile broadband and broadband and I was promised a large sum of bonus, to my shock to find I got paid 1/3 of that. Vouchers were never received as promised by the company."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,I dont come work here because it is closing. the pay was good for what we did and they worked with you as much as possible to your needs as a employee. The people were very laid back.
bad,"I honestly don't have alot to say, except the merge from Convergys to Concentrix was horrible! Company shut down, Management was very messy, unless you kissed butt, than just like that they would work with you, there were favorites who got away with more than others. I'm not surprised the company shut down!"
bad,No guarantee that you'll have a job from one day to the next. Programs disappear overnight. Upper management doesn't treat employees very well and pay isn't very good regardless of the program you're on.
bad,"Promises & more promises with no delivery. Written up for things beyond your control. Resigned after 4yrs due to stress. "
bad,Warren Michigan  pay is 11$  call center for On Star for GM cars. Bed buds and team leaders will stress  you out with pressure to make sales. You can't have a life in the start of the job they want you on call 7 days a week. Lots of young kids work at the call center location. Making sales and being stressed out. You will have to take an assessment to see if your typing skills are up to par. I would not recommend working here. The company is unorganized and  a bad environment
bad,Sales sales sales. Pushed and stressed for sales and not interested in fixing the customer problems. However I worked their before the company change so it may be different culture now.
bad,"The racism in the Tempe call center is terrible and tolerated. If you are a professional Inside Sales Person, run and run fast. Almost everyone carries a THC oil pen or blatantly smokes Marijuana. This is a terrible grind with ot the only true way to earn."
bad,"I worked as customer service rep and did surveys. We got laid off and closing in September and moving our sample to Savannah, Georgia. Time goes by so slow, you constantly get rude people or people who can’t hear you on the phone and continue to say degrading and mean remarks. I felt pushed to get a high number of completed surveys per hour. Worst part is sitting there doing nothing especially when people aren’t answering you can’t read or anything. We used to be able to color or read books or do homework while waiting for someone to answer until policies got super strict. The pay should be higher especially for weekends because no one wants to be called Saturday or Sunday or even Friday nights."
bad,"I worked here when it was Convergys and they did not treat thier employees right at all. The job level there is very stressful and demanding, they would make you work liong 10 hour shifts and demand overtime."
bad,"Working staff is not good at all, through out my journey i observed miss use of powers by TL. As well process manager including HR. No one want to be a defaulter , but they make you a defaulter if you find that you are right , the way they give feedback to the employees is just like a teacher shouting very loudly at his student - @Process Manage & HR, all the designated people working have a ego problem and have lotslotssand lots of attitude of their designation ..there is very much to say but can't explain it in words , in short only when there is visit on the floor of clients and any higher authority i feel to share all the concerns with them but it is not possible , all the staff is attached and they support a lot to each other and then they start to tourcher you ,they try to highlight issue against you throught mails , just to show good place to work with because of such issues , everything thig happen on the floor lots of integrity is done but it is not highlight for eg. Some agent carry cell on the floor."
bad,"La parte più piacevole l'ambiente giovanile mentre la parte più difficile è stato accettare il trasferimento a Cagliari."
bad,"Call centers suck. I enjoyed the work because of the people, not the job nor company. We were constantly changing philosophy. We in management were never quite off the clock. Those not in management make less than $12 an hour to take a hundred calls from angry people a day. That's about all I have to say."
bad,"This company constantly pushes you to meet outstanding sales goals. Regardless of if a customer actually needed better services or equipment, you were supposed to pitch a sale on every call. Customers were terrible too."
bad,"Job was very stressful. And not enough training. Not good explanation when you ask questions. Staff acted if you asked a question, you know the answer"
bad,Grateful for the opportunity. Conveniently located near i4. Environment was not the greatest and structure could have been a little more organized. Overall ok.
bad,Colleagues are the only reason people enjoy. Very strict and no time for life outside work. For how much you do and what toy get paid is unevenly balanced
bad,"very much so a highschool. but scheduling FOR SOME DEPARTMENTS are very flexible, others you will never have much of a set schedule. lunch and breaks are fairly short, but can be moved around."
bad,"This place is a revolving door. There is always a new face. They have fired almost all employees that started with them in the begining. Avoid at all cost they do not value their employees, you are a number that is all."
bad,"No supportive management time management on phones changes all the time, I have learned alot here about the contract working for, it will help me further my employment options"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Upper management adds to the high school drama atmosphere in the company. "
bad,"My time at concentrix was pretty hectic. I'm not sure if it was cause of the clients ever changing demands, or poor management. Most likely a mix of both. While working there there was always a lack of timely updates of information related to our job. Like known issues, system related updates, availability or loss of tools, etc, The people managing our teams are obviously overwork and less informed about most situations we encountered on the floor."
bad,I spent 20 years at Convergys which was recent acquired by Concentrix. The move has not been smooth as we have not made most of the adjustments to the new company and are doing same as always.
bad,I worked for Anthem Insurance and would receive inbound calls from providers and members. The company recently got bought out and switched names and the policies changed. None of the team leads are ever on the same page and will each tell you different information that contradicts what the other person told you. The calls come in back to back and they have unrealistic expectations for average call time. You basically spend all day getting yelled at by elderly people who are having problems understanding their insurance and providers who think they know more than you about the insurance or medical claims. You don't get paid nearly enough for what you have to deal with.
bad,"I personally did not have a good time working for this company. Since this was a call center, you are being timed for how long your calls are, and how you treat the customer verbally. The customers at time would curse me out. Not a good experience."
bad,This was a drastic pay cut for me. I worked this job because my unemployment had run out. It was very stressful in that you were required to upsale. I was happy when I found another position.
bad,"They move certain people up (like I did floor support and helped answer other agents questions) don’t get a raise for it, they will suspend you off floorsupport for any little thing there is. Management is ridiculous, they don’t care about anything, the OMs just sit in their cubicle or offices and chat amongst themselves then snap at agents who do the same. They will threaten your status, if you are moved up, constantly. If you scheduled overtime and ask for it to be taken off your schedule due to no longer being able to do that overtime, kiss your great attendance goodbye because if you leave with overtime scheduled you’ll earn an attendance point and it’s ridiculously hard to earn those points back and lower it back down. This place is not worth the time of day."
bad,"You can't have a personal life work at Concentrix, because the management never provides a roster in advance."
bad,RNR activities were exciting. Agents were all friendly and happy. Team Leaders always taking lead to learning. Motivating employees to step up and accept challenge in life.
bad,"I would show up to work and answer calls to help customers who had problems with their iphones, I would do my best to help them fix their issues. the hardest part of the job is dealing with irritate customers when you cannot fix their problem.  The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers with their problems."
bad,There waa a lot going on at that job. No one was professional. I started a job and they would change me mid way to different jobs. Which would leave me confused as i had to remember what company i was speaking for
bad,"Time restrictions must be less, the overall culture is nice. Need very patience to work. Technical support company. More customer-centric than the employee. Must reduce the working time."
bad,"This is the same company, It was just during my time there Concentrix bought out Convergys. Again, lack of training is the worst factor with this company,"
bad,"Company promise you the world and basically do not deliver. "
bad,Too much customer churn.  Job security was always an issue.    Company was great when I started but declined since 2004.  I wish there had been better direction from executive management.
bad,"Their clients are good in giving incentive but not Convergys before the merge. Team Leads are somehow arrogant and so welcoming. But all in all, they have some employee engagement that keeps their employees."
bad,"I am a 34 year old wife and mother that had been a stay at home mom for 6 years...  I was very hopeful that the contract position I was hired for would become a permanent full time position...  I went above and beyond and was the one everyone in my training class looked to for help!  Trainer did great and was very thorough even though half or more of our training class did not take ""having a job"" seriously enough!  We had been advised NO CELL PHONES past the front lobby yet many people still brought their phones in and would sit and peruse social media sites instead of learning the material we were being trained on...  After training we were taken to ""nesting"" which was being given headsets and put on the phones!  Did that for one afternoon and the next day we were put on the floor!  I didn't mind this as I had caught on quickly during training but it seemed to be a struggle for many others!  Never once did anyone discuss our call reviews with any of our training class!  And then our contract ended earlier than expected and the information we had been giving to work the contract we were on was not what they were looking for to be rolled over into another line of business!  Sooo...  if you were in our training class and not bilingual you were not asked to stay on..."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Management is not as good as the other companies, not enough growth distributions and a lot of power trips wherein people with higher positions take advantage of the subordinates."
bad,"When I got the job at Convergys Corp. I had actually applied for a work at home position on the company's website. I was offered this position and thought ""it might be a good thing to work in an office that way there is support when I need it"". The previous statement could not be more wrong in fact after working there for 4 months I now believe it would have been so much better to have turned down the job and waited for a work at home position like I originally applied for. "
bad,"Was excited when I got the job thought it was such a great oppurtunity. "
bad,Very stressful job with very little floor support to help if you have a question hires are hard to work. It is a very stressful and management does not seem to care about what you have to say or is willing to help fix any of the issues. Co-workers can get by with anything.
bad,"Worked there for a year, management made no sense. I answered phones how can I help you, management said that's not how we answer phones we answer I'd be happy to help you. So I started saying I'd be HAPPY to HEEELP you, emphasizing those 2 words, the people on the other line just laughed, asking why I'm saying it like that. I told them and they said they completely understand. Management listened to my calls not realizing I was saying I'd be HAPPY to HEEEELP you, to them they were satisfied. "
bad,It's a job but don't get comfortable. Very black and white as far as scheduling. Minimal opportunity to move up in the top. Number pusher. Just number pushers
bad,the training period depends on the project you get put on. they are not very understanding of any transportation issues if any occur to cause you to be late or unable to make it. they have no consideration when it comes to any medical issues you may have and are not willing to work with you
bad,"This is your typical call center that handles outsourced contracts and only cares about performance metrics, not the quality of the interaction with the customer. Long hours, poor management and little to no benefits are just some of the problems with this place."
bad,"It was very stressful and only thing that matter was the numbers on the report of how many calls we did per month and not giving quality customer service to the members. It was like a zoo, only the strong will survived."
bad,"Work I performed at Convergys for their client was OK. However the 'administrative' side of things was a bit monotonous. There was the opportunity at management discretion to work from home, in exceptional circumstances such as bad weather, so that you didnt lose pay."
bad,Unorganized company to work for. Company structure poor from recruitment to upper management. Treats people terribly and very rarely lives to actually accommodate employees with promised acomidations
bad,"Nothing good to say, so would rather not say anything at all. Would never go back there, and do not recommend others to go there. It was not a positive place"
bad,"Paid orientation."
bad,What I didn’t like about this company is that I was not well organized. Everyone just went to work did not had communication with the team and management was not helpful.
bad,"It was just another typical call centre that had everything wrong with it that you would expect.  After 3 months (which means no benefits) of work they ""lay you off"" due to shortage of work, you try to go back when they're hiring even though you pass all the tests, they pull up your employee file and you've been ""flagged not eligible for re-hire"".  A total of about 25 people in my original class room were eventually fired right after the Christmas holidays.  We were told it was due to shortage of work, but just before Christmas, we saw that 3 training classrooms for various accounts were filled?  The only enjoyable part of the job was helping clients and interacting with your team members.  No work life balance, poor salary, they tell you you're hired for email support then throw you on the phone with no training or coaching to improve.  You get good reviews, and people calling for help specifically from you, yet you still get let go??w"
bad,Depends on the manager  what your work experience with this company is like.  I had a great experience with them until the last manager I had.  I wish i could have stayed with this company but some of the managers do not want to do their job and the advisors suffer for it
bad,"While working there, you would often feel the stress of doing something wrong, like saying one thing wrong to the wrong person, and then you would get fired.  You could never be sick or miss a day; If you did, then they would issue you a strike, that you couldn't get back, and you only had three of them and then you got an occurrence. The whole thing felt very sketchy and the place wasn't very clean despite the bathrooms being closed for cleaning almost all of the time.   The people were nice and supportive, but you were always stressed to be perfect.   Despite all of the negatives, I loved working with the customers and the client, but Concentrix was a bad company to go through."
bad,for people who are starting and looking to earn bigger than the normal initial salary for newbies. they provide good employee compensation packages and medical assistance.
bad,This was my first job out of college and immediately I knew the company was not for me. I started to look for another job immediately after being hired.
bad,Helping with daily prescription mail orders assisting with why customers have not received or trying to determine why a patients insurance has or will no longer cover prescription.
bad,I didn't enjoy the atmosphere was very fast paced and didnt seem to improve on where our work environment was we were all over the place didnt offer much help if calls were escalated
bad,"I would think that customer service would the number one focus for such  huge company but in reality you are constantly being pressured to sell products or at the very least make offers. When I know the customer is neither wanting to buy something or can't  afford it I have a real problem of being expected to sell something to them. The job should always be to take care of the issues or concerns above anything thing else. If I call in for help, the very last thing I need to hear is an offer to make my bill even higher especially when I can't afford what I have. Trying to bribe us with junk I don't even need like candy, shirts, bags and so on is absurd and it does not make being there any better. Very short breaks and lunch is also a big issue for me because I average 2 10 minute breaks and a 20 minute lunch. You will be required to work most weekends through the year so if you like having the weekends off. STAY AWAY."
bad,"Managers always stop by to well wish."
bad,"Since my Manager was great in handling the team members and the process, we did not face much issues. however more than 40 members were asked to leave the company without any prior notice. And also there was no much increment or incentives on Salary."
bad,could not advance to higher position.. nothing ever available.... workplace was very dull.. very repetitive... could not use any of the knowledge I acquired from my degree their
bad,The company did not train well to perform the job they wanted me to do. I asked to be trained more but my supervisor refused to have me be trained anymore.
bad,Working at Convergys felt as if I was back in High School. I've learn to grow within myself no one else will help you reach your goals. the hardest part of the job is not been able to grow as you wish.
bad,Easy if you are used to being bored and do not have many bills. The uncaring management will not bother you if you have zero real life problems. Pick your first schedule carefully because only favs get schedule changes.
bad,"The staff at Convergys is very close knit. You will not be advanced or promoted unless your in the ""club"". They were very unfair in rating employees and based it on how many friends you had within the company and not your performance. One of the worst experiences I've had as an employee. I will not ever return to a BPO such as they are ever again."
bad,"just an ok employer, not a very family friendly employer. driven more on results more than employees.  I would probably not work for them again.  Very critical of employees rather than focusing on improving performance."
bad,There are not many advancement opertunities. Even managers get low pay. Sporadic overtime. Loud work enviroment. Dated equipment. Bouneses even for top perfermors is low. Aura of dont care attitude from employees reflected on score cards.
bad,I loved working here.  I was there for over 8 years until they focused on their customer service business and shut down other projects.  Most people were let go as they consolidated and moved to Ohio.
bad,"When it comes to getting help or knowing how you were doing, it was hard to get time to talk to your manager or get a response from a manger. They have fun company activities. Was hard work for Bank of America when it came to customers not paying their bill. Ok environment to work in."
bad,It has high salary but very poor management. Managers love to power trip. Does not care for the welfare of their employees. Very slow promotion process.
bad,"only suitable for ppl who like hanging outin nights and have the thick skin to listen to the awry customer....Not a place for someone like me."
bad,My job was to provide customer service to clients in need of navigational services.  Customer calls in for assistance of directions or emergency services.
bad,benifits r good pay is awsome really stressfull job learned about computers how to approuch people management sucked but will work woth u. get payed evey 2 wekks
bad,The center was closed down due to the contract being expired and is now under a new contract with a new company so I am unsure if it is even ran the same way as it was before.
bad,the call center is ghetto  they have lots of drama wwill not work with you on hours or days off the call volume is very high  a demanding tmay a few seconds between each call
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Convergys is a company that provide good opportunity  for people who are new to the industry like myself, however the schedule taht they give is not so convinient since they change schedule almost every week"
bad,Terrible place to work.   Spent way too many years in a low earning job where your efforts really aren't rewarded.  Upper management has no real clue about how people work or how to motivate them - you will simply be a body filling a desk.
bad,"Honestly, I had to quit the job. The managers do not care for you as much. Unless you've already had great training on phone calls and what not you will be stuck. The pay is alright with no degree but it can be annoying."
bad,"After over an hour interview/tests, I was told I would be called back for one last test ""next week"" and to ""bug"" the interviewer if I didn't hear back with the date and time (as in, it's good so far, we just need one more test done) - telephone and e-mail went unanswered."
bad,i wouldn't recommend anyone to work here due to lack of management and training. the start off pay wasn't bad but it wasn't any room for pay increase unless you took a different job position and it wasnt offered to everyone.
bad,Loved the job and the people I worked closely with daily. Believe the turn around was due to management not being consistent at times. Starbucks coffee was a plus!
bad,"They are not competitive in pay. If your contract closes in one area of Concentrix, good luck getting a job with another contact in Concentrix. The management is poor and advancement is lacking."
bad,"you will be cursed at, yelled at and demanded to produce however for the adrenaline junkies and people with patience this is for you and you will do great."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend working here. Even though the company is pretty laid back in their dress code and everything, it's still is not the ideal place to work at."
bad,"I took on this job while going to university. I started as a full-time employee in the summer and dropped down to part time once I returned to school in the fall. "
bad,"Because you doing 3rd party tech/customer support you are always being micromanaged for your talk times, a low talk time is more important to them than the customer being helped.  This is my humble opinion."
bad,"It's an outsource call center so the pay and benefits are not that great.  They will work you hard and burn you out.    It is more relaxed than an on-campus call center.  I work on social media, so we can bring on our i-pods and listen to music while we work."
bad,"Typical call center which is based mostly on meeting and maintaining your numbers on the phones.  Overtime can be available but it depends on the project you're on, job security unless you are corporate is not viable."
bad,Very stessful as the majority of called are angry and take out their frustrations with the company on you. Dealing with angry people and not having the authority to fix their issue is very stressful.
bad,"Relocate all jobs to overseas because they are cheaper and did not give a similar chat job in replacement, was a very stressful job, would not recommend"
bad,"It was a dirty workplace. There weren't enough seats so you ended-up moving computers 2-3 times a shift, incredibly frustrating. No way to make more money."
bad,They make it seem a lot more easier than I thought but I would for AT&T U-verse and in Denver U-verse doesn't exist so I was helping with products I could only read about. They shut the center down 6mths after working there and they only told us weeks before. Luckily I was already looking for another job. It was a third party company so what did you expect.
bad,The company is great to work for in terms of training but once you hit the actual floor that is where the rubber meets the road and if you're stats do not improve you will not move up. Most of the time the people there have you start early than what your start time should be and there is really no opportunity for advancement because of the type of call flow that is given.
bad,"I handled trouble shooting issues. customers calling about cable or internet issues. I would have to go through a bunch of steps to see if I could get the issues resolved . Some long phone calls some short phone calls. Happy, frustrated, mad customer on the other end of a phone line."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"My convergys site in AZ is now closed but it was great for awhile. I worked as a Customer Care Specialist for AT&T Customer loyalty Chat department. Due to some of my health issues, I was able to work with my managers to only handle one customer at a time instead of two. However, I was still expected to hit their goals but it required me to work twice as much. I worked 20+ extra hours a week to hit their goals which was great for my paychecks but terrible for having social life outside of work. I was there for 6 months before the company decided to switch managers around due to other managers needing to find other employment. Change can be good for some environments; however, it was done in a very wrong way here. I was placed from one manager who I and my team had worked with and was very fair with everyone, to a manger who gave special treatment to those who met her own requirements. And if you did not meet her own special requirements that were separate from the company's, you were written up or asked to come in for even more additional overtime."
bad,Very hard to reach a Team Leader outside of work hours.  Cannot view work schedules unless signed into system - sometimes OT added without notice (surprise) even when you voluntarily work OT hours that best suits you and your schedule.
bad,The gossip train goes 200 miles per hour at this job. They dont like you taking personal breaks as it cuts down on productivity time. have to be at work 10 min early everyday but dont get paid for it.
bad,you are treated like a robot. whenever there is an emergency you are not allowed to take a leave. when you are sick you still need to go to work. At times you are required to work overtime even if you do not to.
bad,Managers were not very caring for their reps when it came to family issues or your health. I would not re apply to suggest this place to anyone. Less stress once I left.
bad,It's a call centre and you do tech support for the company that outsourced it. It's inbound calls all day. You only have a certain amount of time to complete each call.
bad,"Great training, but very stressful to learn everything and then to retain when you got out of training was very hard. Obviously more people other than me had issues as well sine this location has since shut down."
bad,"Come in bring up your computer to clock in which could take 8 minutes to come up so then you are late clocking in and have to do an Estart adjustment, can't be late back from breaks. Management is a lot to be desired. Workplace very causal, no dress code. Hardest part of the job is going in to work. Most enjoyable is meeting new people.there are no pros"
bad,"They will let you go out of the blue with no warning if they find the slightest reason not to like you. And the way that they do it is kind of sneaky because they switch ""projects"" on you. Which means, throwing you on to another company which differs from the one you started. Then they let you go after that company's ""peak season"" has ended. "
bad,Work schedules are not very flexible. My team lead was hardly ever available to speak to one-on-one. More like I was treated like a number than an actual person
bad,"once trained you are sent on the production floor with not enough information and once you receive help you get conflicting information, poor management, when asked for help they always send you to someone else to only get sent back to management"
bad,An easy job but not the best working environment. Would be better to keep your options open and look for a more positive and professional working environment.
bad,The environment is fun. Management and HR has poor organization. Wouldn’t recommended for someone to apply here first. Only as needed. Mandatory OT has always been required even after being told you’d have a fixed schedule.
bad,They dont care about the customer they just want you to sell to every customer no matter what their situation is. They stay up under you until you sale something. Bad management.
bad,No one even plays ping pong anymore i think they banned it on my floor but its a good job for high school students. Micromanagement everywhere. Its hard to get the schedule you want they will put you in where you fit in or just put you where they need a head count even if you don't know how to work the job
bad,"Had to take and make calls, with recording everything that was done/said on the phone call with the customer. job was to fix the customers phone while using all my tools and deescalating the situation if needed"
bad,"Good, friendly environment, best suited for freshers who can start their career with ease. Management is friendly, but timings should be maintained. Satisfied."
bad,"If you werent good at getting customers to buy new lines or to add direct tv to their accounts, they wouldnt help you.. Just make you feel bad. If you do shoot for a sale and the customer still says no, it counts against you."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Typical day at work is having calls and follow some steps to troobleshoot the different issues.  Fun at first but gets boring quickly. Most wont last a year, no real advancement. pay is low for a callcenter."
bad,Its an easy job there is no denying it. Tho the management is horrible. And its stressfull. It does depend on the contract that you are on that could make or break how you feel about the place
bad,"Not really to much tto say about  this job, the hours sucked and so did management the pay was not wjat i was told didn't really feel welcomed there.."
bad,Poor management and poor caring of employees.  Slacker mentality is encouraged and rewards are often based on chance not on employee quality.  Misleading management.
bad,"Pros"
bad,"terrible management,,  had 6 different supervisors in about 6 months  , no support only bad comment never anything said about the good that you do....."
bad,"As a technical support agent on various lines of business, I found the performance expectations to be very high while the financial compensation was low."
bad,i would not recommend to work here.I haven't learned anything but not to work at a call center. The most enjoyable part of the job is talking to my classmates..
bad,I will not place my opinions about Convergys on this site at this time. I am no longer living in the state of Florida. I have moved back to Syracuse. I will be moving back to Florida in the near future.
bad,"Convergys is a call center with a single focus:  Making the clients happy.  They will do this at any cost.  They don't care about the employees or their families.  To make it worse, the long term employees often boast about how many people they have gotten fired during their time there.  After leaving the company for 3 months to explore another career option, Convergys agreed to allow me to come back as an entry level agent (I have 20+ years in call centers) and work my way back up to the glass ceiling.  My advice:  If you need a job and nothing else is working out for you, Go for it!  But don't stop looking for something decent.  If you are there for a year, you've been there for too long."
bad,all calls will be monitored and you will have weekly reviews of them. You are expected to meet various criteria. They are always adding things to say but do not add compensation .
bad,"I wasn't there very long because in just one short month I grew to hate it there. The training is four weeks long never actually touches on the things we need to know. Training goes over every possible scenario even though you're placed into a specific department, so not every scenario will be applicable. After the four weeks, we had two weeks of nesting, which at that point none of us knew what programs we had to open up and use or how a normal call flow goes. I left before nesting ended. Never looked back."
bad,Looks of impossible time matrixes to fall into. Management was constantly threatening to let you go if you couldn't get metric in line. Bombarded with calls.
bad,I learned many things from there. I came to know the coporate world. How it works. What is the corporate culture. My job profile was CSE Chat process for AT&T customers.
bad,"This place amazed me at its treatment of its staff. Writing up adults when they forget their badge, not allowing people to use the bathroom and when they did they followed you to it. They treated the people there like second class citizens. Most management were jerks, there were 2 managers & 1 trainer that I liked, I hope the rest are somewhere......"
bad,"I enjoyed my job at first because I was learning how to help AT&T customers with their cell phones, troubleshooting problems, adding additional services, and ordering new phones. But they eventually wanted everyone to sell their new products over the phone and that was stressful because a lot of people in that area had been laid off their jobs and weren't interested in the new products. I was eventually let go because I could not meet my quota."
bad,"Busy, hectic, demotivating, tha management is not up to the mark, there are no facilities available for employees, go there if you only want temporary money."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"This job definitely got me through hard times. The people were friendly and the benefits were better than contract work, but holding loyalty to the place would be a terrible mistake. You will find yourself gaining experience in various industries, but opportunities to advance are all safely outside the company itself. I recommend this to anyone fresh out of high school."
bad,Good for job experience. Rigorous performance metrics system is all about the money and led to stressful environment. Metrics intertwined so not always able to meet overall and some had higher weight even when not connected to employee performance. Calls were call after call. High turnover normal to company. Need better job training for employees. No benefits provided.
bad,"The work is not challenging, the training takes a week or 2 maybe 3 depending on the campaign they are running. They are are a company that outsources customer service, so they'll take a contract from AT&T, Apple, LensCrafters and perform their customer service for them essentially so the companies can save money because the companies wouldn't pay someone that little to work for them. I wouldn't recommend this job to anyone, it can be tolerable short term because its easy but the environment is drab, and their is little good to say about it other than it is easy."
bad,I would tell no one about this job. they are every where and they are so unprofessional. to many young people and a lot of fighting............ I wouldn't want no one to work here you wouldn't be going no where if you trying to get a career here .. basely you have no lift
bad,Its a typical call center where you answer phones and up sale every call. Now if you know these calls come from fliers that are sent out and the quality of calls are not that great. Maybe this is why the are no longer in business.
bad,This job was fast paced and extremely stressfull because of the high volume of phone calls and customers calling with requests that were not available but advertised.
bad,"So unorganized, no security, unable to get comfortable, every three months you gotta rearrange your life to fit the work schedule. This company need people in power that's more knowledgeable in leadership role."
bad,"The management wasn't the greatest. They really wasn't team orienated , as well no employee appreciation. I feel they were'nt very organized, the bonus structure kept changing from day one. Took awhile to reciebve first bonus that was promised upon hiring. Very hostile enviroment."
bad,When there is a mistake with your schedule or on your pay and you tell your managment team and they say don’t worry we’ll get it fixed for you but it ends up taking about a month or it goes by the way side hoping that you forget about it and they don’t have to fix there problem so then they don’t have to pay you for that time.
bad,"It's a high volume environment. I did chat services and I was always stressed out. Taking double chats sometimes even 3 at once. You wanna try and keep chats under a handle of 10 min. Saturdays were pretty busy, since those days were launch days for Jordan's. You get prank chatters, which is very annoying. "
bad,"Quick, easy, and cheap customer service labor factory.  Cookie cut model for all companies who use them.  The pay was at minimum, no benefits to offset lack of pay."
bad,"Since I was on 3rd Party Payroll."
bad,"I didn't like the pay it was too low and I did not like the hours and it was not easy to contact management, I don really remember who the manager was."
bad,"the job is pretty easy after a while but the management is very, very poor."
bad,I got along with my supervisor very well. It is okay to work at Convergys if you are not looking for advancement or looking to gain some experience if you are just getting out of school
bad,"Hi All, I worked with Concentrix for more than an year however there was 0% security of Job and due to the highly unprofessional and irresponsible approach of my higher management I had to loose my job and now due to this Its very difficult for me to give reasons to the other organization for sustainability. Every head of persons are agreed their mistake but not ready to fill this gap."
bad,"A typical day would be you on the phone all day, dealing with customers that have been transfer a bunch of times and they are very angry. Its an ok place but i wouldn't work there anymore."
bad,"The culture varies based on the project you work for, but job stability is something to worry about with this company. Once you find a great project to work for, you may really enjoy your job."
bad,It wouldn't be the first place that I would offer to work. The staff in unprofessional. Its more like an high school environment. The HR hasn't handled pay properly since day one. The systems we need to learn the material we cant access. The training has been all over the place. Currently looking for new work.
bad,"If pay was more, more paid vacation, holidays and sick days it would be a good place to work.More parking. Because the only give 30 min for lunch the lunch room could have more then 1 coffee maker and more machines."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,It seems to me they have let a lot of good people go without making much of an effort to find other suitable places for them.  Some people had been there over 25 years.  I think they are only keeping one unit open to help pay the lease they are on the hook for once the lease is up I expect the place to close.  Right now I am working in the only division that is currently operating.
bad,"I worked at Concentrix for almost 2 years and I found that the company lacks good organization and management. Lack of professionalism makes it difficult to go forward in the company, as people are selectively covering each other's faults based on friendship and so on. Plus, for the amount of work we have to do, 13,25$/h is not enough. Most call centres will pay you 15-16$/h and more."
bad,"Work culture is not good,slow growth path,management is not supportive,job security is less,good organization for beginners they can start there career from here a in mnc."
bad,"convergys waa a 24/7 call center and I did not like the fact I had to work om weekends and holidays , if that does not matter than this place may be for you,"
bad,"Convergys is not a great place to work. Employees are constantly in jeopardy of losing their jobs as contracts are constantly lost. They also push you to sale, sale, sale. They only care about their customers (those providing the contracts) not about their employees."
bad,"Fast paced environment, selling is required. Very little training as to what is needed to perform the job. Long waits for supervisor on the phone when customer requested."
bad,This job is very unorganized. There is no room for you to build in the convergy's corporation. They have a point system when you're late that can cost you your job.
bad,"Management was awful, the job itself was bull, I really felt for the customers, cause metrics always trump customer care I give this place a 1 all the way down."
bad,I took inbound calls for Sprint Customer service and I would take payments on the account and sale customer text messages plans. I would renew contracts and help customer with there cell phones
bad,Should get good salary growth opportunity It  was good working overall Nothing more to mention not worked for long periods should bring up new policy Good
bad,This is by far the worst call center I have ever worked at.  Very unprofessional atmosphere as well as low pay and an extensive wait for benefits to be active.
bad,"Start a career to learn the best operation knowledge."
bad,Basically a good company to work with as the TL and the manager are very supportive and understanding.It was a learning curve for me so enjoyed working here.
bad,"All the managers are unfair"
bad,"Great place to work and good work culture , learned a lot at convergys work environment was also great overall great place to work learnt couple of things"
bad,"Management needed more training. More than a few times I had issues come up which after writing me up, were found to be mistakes, and no, they did NOT take away my write ups, though I was found to have not committed any infractions. I even had a meeting with three people from management about the issue, and was told multiple times that they were working on removing my write ups, and that never came to light. Resigned from my position due to lack of competence regarding management."
bad,If you are desperate for a work at home opportunity then this is it. Hours are usually full-time but the support is minimal once you leave training. My manager was definitely not suitable for the position.
bad,There are lots of linient people. But I iust notice the coaching I want to make it more effective. And the schedules of agent must be more appropriate.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,This company could be so much better if the compensation package they give out would match the workload that they would throw upon the employee. There are a lot of metrics to meet yet the salary is not something that would uplift your spirit.
bad,"My location has only recently become a Concentrix property, so most of my experience has been under other owners."
bad,"I loved working with my fellow co-workers, however this did not make up for how un-willing management is to work with any type of situation that is not work-related. I have never felt more like a number on a graph than an actual person at this company. This is a wonderful place to work if you are looking to get a job quickly, but do not look for any advancement or long term opportunity here."
bad,"Did not work for the company for very long so was not able to gain the full grasp of what it had to offer.  As for the job, supervisors had their favorites and if you were not one, no special treats for you."
bad,"overall job is extremely taxing due to the angry customers yet will benefit the regular employee to push themselves and improve on their communication, people skills, and problem solving abilities."
bad,I luje the company just need to pay more. Sometimes they are a little unorganize.  U have saw a few employers fighting. It would be an okay jib if they paid more and had a little more organization.
bad,The company and itself does not appeared to be good in terms of the employee-employer relations. They should address more development for this for the future
bad,This job was not for me. I did not enjoy being screamed at and cursed at by customers I was doing my best to assist. If you can handle this while meeting the company's multiple quotas.
bad,"I enjoyed the break room lots of space and the ping pong table "
bad,"Unprofessional, low wages, racist, homophobic, mundane, horrible hours, forced to work most holidays, just overall sucky.  I would work at McDonalds first."
bad,This job was a lot about who you know.  If you start out excelling they watch you closely assuming you're doing something wrong. It seemed like a lot of politics here.  The people with seniority didn't want a newcomer to succeed. This could have just been a problem with staff and not the company.
bad,"Overall good people. The company treated the employees like they were replaceable, which is not how employees should be treated. Very boring place to work as well."
bad,"Since Concentrix bought the company I was formerly employed by, they attempted to provide a fun place to work by encouraging employees to participate in ""hat day, jack o lantern decorating contests, super bowl parties"" etc.  However, most employees would just prefer a raise or even a small bonus.   You WILL NOT receive a raise at this company.  I was not in management so not sure if they received any type of raise or not; however, I worked for the company for 25 years, and there was no recognition for the faithful and long term employees.    Morale was low.  One manager had favorite employees and it was very obvious.   Although I had the capability to work from home, it was discouraged, due to the fact the it was ""unfair"" to the employees that didn't have a laptop.  It was the company's decision to provide me with a laptop so I don't think I should have been punished for that.   I could have been much more productive at home several days a week, due to sitting in the middle of a contact center, which was very distracting.   Consider working for this company if you are absolutely desperate for employment."
bad,The environment was not all that great. A lot of work for less money and many people were always out which made more work for others. The good thing about it were the coworkers. They made the environment comfortable.
bad,"Offered scheduled modifications for students however the pay was not the best. Management was derived of only tenured or senior employees, Management was underdeveloped and lack organizational structure.."
bad,call center work. a lot is placed on upselling clients other products. yelling by other csr's while on a open mic. able to handle some problems as efficiently
bad,The only good thing about working here are the people are fun to work with. Everything else is terrible. If you get a job don't expect to be paid right.
bad,"I really did not like working for Convergys, but it was a good filler job for a while, and it paid decently for my lack of job experience.  It's difficult to get yelled at all day."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"As usual,same as other call centers the typical working time is graveyard.  Ive learned not trust anybody. Management has been not so fair as there are political issues."
bad,"You are a number here. You are constantly changing teams. You are graded on metrics. It isn't a corporation i would want to work at for a long time, but it's good for a short time."
bad,"The supervisors were very young, and very unprofessional. The trainers did not take their time with each individual employee so that they may advance in their jobs."
bad,The hardest part about this job was having to check your soul at the door. Having to try and sale people thing when they clearly couldn't afford it takes a toll on you. i enjoyed the people i worked with all in all but it was a place where someones bad mood could become contagious.
bad,Convergys has a high turn over rate. The schedules are not fair. Its too much work for the money they pay. They could pay more. Its a 24 hr call center you never know what your schedule will be. You never know how long you will see somebody working there.
bad,"There are only a couple of good things about this company:"
bad,It is a wonderful learning experience. I really was not there long enough before the CEO called everyone in and told us that our job would be ending in two month.  I had begun to like the job and I was learning alot
bad,"Tedious work, spent hours just imputing information. Cubicle work for 8 hrs a day. Good environment with other employees the were great to be around for me."
bad,Long exhaustive hours and no fun. Stressful but had immense opportunity to learn and strive as a team. Gave the confidence to tackle any kind of situation and get positive solution to it.
bad,"Have a challenging environment and everyday there is something new and interesting to learn"
bad,"Good company and need to focus on employee satisfaction level."
bad,This is a high-stress environment as you are dealing with disgruntled customers at all times. These customers have a complaint that they want fixed and you must do your best to appease them.
bad,"Concentrix was earlier IBM Daksh. In terms of positives, the process of getting promoted was pretty dynamic and objective, had lesser of subjectivity or bias. However, on the flip side, being a CRM process, you need to work 24 by 7 and work life balance was pretty bad."
bad,You take a lot of calls a day and your average handle time should be 1 min 30 seconds ands that for a whole 8 hour shift. The bonuses are minimal and not worth the amount of work and all the managers and team leaders don't really do the best job of helping the agents out when an agent needs help. They are more than willing to let you go than keep you even if you are a good agent.
bad,"Its a decent company. Learn goodthings..itsgood company for growth... had a great experience , currently working as a SME in ghis organization"
bad,"low pay and management, when they are on the floor, make it very apparent that they are not interested in helping you."
bad,"I was working on In Life Retention, inbound. Most callers will be angry and demand that you solve their problems or they will leave, but you can't solve their problems because they aren't your department. It involves a lot of liaising with other departments over the phone, but the billing team is the most useless bunch of people ever. They are also supposed to be customer services, but most of them refuse to acknowledge this and won't help customers with any general query, only billing issues. This means that when a customer just has a complaint or query that isn't anything to do with billing, canceling or upgrading then there is no one for them to talk to. Half way through the time I was there, they started calling themselves the consumer care department but many of them missed this memo I think. "
bad,"The salary is lower than the other companies, they don't have much incentive scheme, the work is so stressful. the work is demanding but with less compensation."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,I worked on the Nike contract through Convergys and spend my days speaking with people who had ordered from Nike.com or who were calling to place orders for Nike products.
bad,I loved helping the customers resolve there issues with there phones and other apple products. I learned about all the apple products before they even came out. Management is not good at all they don't care about you they care about there job only.
bad,Performed SAP Business Functional work daily. Worked with a great Team - that has since been dissolved and the work was outsourced.  Team was isolated from the rest of the corporation.
bad,"My experience here has not been the best overall. The account I was hired for was new at this location, and HR was too focused on hiring as many people as possible, they did a poor job at making sure we were trained properly and prepared to start taking calls. The scheduling department is well below par. They would change schedules days before you were to work and PTO was nonexistent. When we were first hired by HR we were promised $12/hour, but it actually depends on the account you're put on. We ended up working for $11.50. This company will hire literally anyone so the work culture was a mixed crowd to say the least. There is not much room for growth, and promotions are based on popularity contest."
bad,"the training was good and the work place itself was great and fun, but the turn over is crazy and the managers had no knowledge of what we were doing on the phones"
bad,I loved resolving technical issue for apple that was the only thing i enjoyed about the job. Management  can careless about your personal problems which i can understand some people like to take advantage of it but at the end of the day everyone is adults there and should be responsible for there own consequences. I got in a accident i came in the next day with something very close to a concussing and huge gash that i had managed bandage up just to make to work. I couldn't bare through work i let them know what happen and they act like they didn't have zero cares causing me to gain unnecessary points. It caused me to lose interest in the management and focus more on the Apple product which was the reason I was there
bad,"Standard call centre experience, however with being an outsourcing company, targets are very important so you will be hounded for anything below target, whether you have control of it or not"
bad,was in the fedex side it was nice. MOn to fri and got major holidays off. the only thing I did not like was that you were on the phones all the time.
bad,Hardest part is that there is no fixed shift and week off's for the associates in concentrix co-workers were good but the management was not good
bad,"Not very organized management. High turnover "
bad,">100% annual turnover: by far the highest that i've experienced in my >30 year career.  my job was threatened constantly.  i was one of the very few agents that quit and was not fired, making being threatened so much stupid on their part."
bad,"This used to be a good place to work, but it has gone downhill lately.   During 2016 they lost 3 contracts from major companies.  With each loss the remaining employees have been pushed harder and harder to preform better, but not given the training or time to do so. With the final contract loss the agents were given a meeting for 5 minutes to be told they were being terminated and that was it.  No empathy at all and no reasons why."
bad,"There isn't much room for growth. This is a revolving door for call centers, there is no empathy for life outside of the job."
bad,"I wasn't here too long to where I can evaluate how good this company was. However, when I was there, my trainer and fellow colleagues were awesome to work with. It made training go by a lot quicker than usual."
bad,"Always new with the rules, they make employees wonder whats next for them. "
bad,Convergys claims to be the number #1 BPO in the Philippines who hires under graduates. High employee retention indicates the things that I don't have to mention.
bad,"I have worked at an inbound phone center for AT&T in the retention department for about one year.   For the previous nine years I worked for Mercedes Benz phone center at Convergys.  I work six hours a day five days a week,trying to help retain costumers who are upset with their bills or services.  I also notate accounts as I help the costumers."
bad,"The company is good and compettive wage wise. The hours are sometimes long or to short, have a lot of hour reductions right now cause in my opinion they hired to many employees at once"
bad,"The company is poorly ran in regards to time keeping and schedule management."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"you don't receive all the hours that you work, they do not honor doctors notes when you are sick."
bad,Convergys had sales above customer service as its motto. It was hard to keep up with sales in a company (comcast) that had soo many service issues. The managers never had good excuses not to help the agents out. Many people were leaving. A call center as organized as convegys (or disorganized) is a great place to learn stress management and communication skills over the phone.
bad,Stop telling people they will earn 15$ an hour and just give them that and your turnover rate will change for the better ... Thats the only bad thing over there 15$ is an empty promise maybe 5% of ppl get it
bad,"Convergys has a very poor work ethic everything is very slack. Very little is kept on top of including fixing system errors and giving good customer satisfaction. Due to myself having a lot of previous knowledge with computers I was able to get used to the system very quick. I was only shown how to fix some problems and I can now do it all myself. I am the type of person that needs to just keep working and what goes on around me isn't a factor, I deal with customers to the best of my ability giving them the best customer satisfaction and experience."
bad,"Management and leaders were unfreindly, "
bad,the place was good to start with. then they start messing around with bonus and pays. good training and the people you work with are decent. hardest bit off the job was meeting your kpis as they where silly and very hard to achieve
bad,never let your employees be in competition. supervisors always blaming employees for their mistakes. don't understand the reasoning of having to be out. even if child/ children sick it counts against you rather you have a doctor's note or not.
bad,"Here at Convergys, I was able to grow and shine as both a representative and an individual. I've worked hard, setting examples, and always improving. I've only been dissatisfied with gaining recommendations, but little to no recognition for my work. The work environment is interesting, however there is a disconnect between the agents and supervisors, and I have been looking for opportunity to no avail."
bad,The company is orientated around the money making aspect and not the needs of the employees they try to find ways to strip your commission and often start people on the sales floor with very little in the way of system training
bad,working in this field was difficult because of the quota and you need to have a long patience specially for talking to the client how to explain your plan and the benefits.In this field you should have a lot of knowledge about your product and plan so that you can convince the customer.
bad,"Working at Minacs is fine , if you enjoyed the juvenile politics of high school.  If you can turn a blind eye to a site manager who sexually harrasses ""certain"" employees, ignore the rate of pay being inconsistent with it's client's rate in the same job, and can conform to a supressed way of life where drama can decide your career, than Minavs is for you.  Merit? Forget it! Everything is covered in icing for the first 50 days, then you get to cut into cake and the worms run out.  Keep your head down and you'll be fine. They're always watching you."
bad,Working for Concentrix has been interesting. The job itself isn't bad. They have good benefits. Your hours can be from 4 am to midnight. Its not a public transportation friendly as far as hours. It is however easy to get to. I don't feel that I can give them a good or bad review because I haven't been working there very long. The people are friendly and helpful.
bad,"If you have bills to pay then Convergys will do, but it's definitely not a place to build a career in. They hire so many people, because of a high turnover rate, that there are sometimes not enough seats. You don't have a designated work station, so you constantly have to move around. Working for the FedEx side I was trained on answering customer calls on packages, but the dotcom portion of training was half assed at best. Once I hit the floor & the dotcom calls came in there was not appropriate help, and it made the job even more stressful."
bad,"The company is very impersonal they do not recognize anyone not in management. Benefits were not recognized by work ethic, performance or reliability."
bad,"process online orders, take bill payments, activate phones, empathize with frustrated customers, verify customers,"
bad,"Working for Convergys was generally pleasant with entertaining co-workers. I was able to learn a lot about phone skills, resolving problems, computer programs, as well as learning to read codes and apply my knowledge to best assist each member. The management is light hearted, fun, and often able to brighten your day however when it came to working out any problems that arose in the work place I found that situations were often not resolved expediently. The hardest part of working with Convergys was the training. It was an 8 week training class where we were given a lot of information that was not clearly able to be understood until experienced. What I enjoyed most was all the incredible people I interacted with that were members, co-workers, managers, and even the occasional visitors from the corporate office."
bad,"Everyone who works there says the exact same thing after they leave .....""you're better off not being there""......everyone....and they all want out but are stuck....great people who are underpaid, under appreciated and undervalued."
bad,"Everyday is just the same. Explaining, discussing and rectifying client's needs. I learned a lot of things, like, good communication with client, learned their culture, how to explain myself /express myself and appreciate what position I had. "
bad,"Just a very negative atmosphere, coworkers loud and cussing on floor, must offer/sale to customer regardless if problem fixed or moved to next level. Many angry customers..."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"It was great at firts, started to fall apart when they changed areas. (Convergys was a call centre for delinquent credit cards and cell accounts)"
bad,I had to work for six days a week but was paid for only five days per week. No hike and no job guarantee.It was back then in 2008  I hope it is grown to be a better organization now.
bad,"Great place to work at, just have to have better management. Great co-workers, now the site is closing and they want us to work from home but lower pay."
bad,answering calls and providing customer service for customers who were in a phone company. had to solve ther problem with bills or charges that were charged to there accounts.
bad,call center environment so it's noisy at times. they shhhh a lot like in elementary. I learned a new skill which can eventually open more opportunities for me at a better company. Management is........... a joke. co-workers? let's just say they hire anyone with a pulse. NO type of testing what so ever. hardest part is dealing with the constant daily drama and them messing up your money(paycheck). most enjoyable part was learning a new skill.
bad,"Company treats employees as numbers that are easy to replace, rate of pay and benefits packages are under par within industry."
bad,"I do not wish to say much of my experience as I believe that this information may possibly be used in future to prevent me from re-applying if I need to, however, I will say that my experience working with Concentrix on this occassion was not a positive one despite my long tenure there."
bad,"workplace is not accessible, we're required to answer almost all types of Google inquiries but we're not compensated well. Although we're getting free food, most of the time the supply is not enough for all employees."
bad,The day starts with pulling up all systems that will be used to conduct business for calls that come in. Not much help when needed  not flexible with family life I enjoy the pay but not challenging enough for me by sitting for hours on end I like to be up and moving
bad,Sat in cubicles and talked to customers about various issues concerning their Directv services. Learned how to handle irate customers and defuse the situation at hand.
bad,"Not a good place to work. Extremely high turn over rate due to lack of proper training and overall employee dissatisfaction. Building in Oshawa is very out of the way and the upkeep of the workplace itself is very poor, broken equipment everywhere and poor cleanliness in restrooms and break areas. Hours are too long, scheduling rarely ever approves days off, sick day policies are ridiculous."
bad,This was a call center so coworkers had to use a phone and computer to do this job. It was to get people to go on vacation using their time share.
bad,This is the worst job ever the supervisor sleeping with the employees let them get away with everything having lunch with them every other day
bad,"I would say overall , I loved my job love being around others with  positive  attitudes.  Enjoyed speaking with the person on the other end of the line...they would make my day very caring on any given day."
bad,Overall a ok situation for those who needed quick work and experience in customer service. The work days were quiet but demanding and goals were do-able. Management was competent but could not compensate for company policies as issues were never readily resolved. Co-workers were uncouth but the environment was not to disturbing.
bad,Answered incoming calls. Learned geography. Management reminded me of the high school cliques. Co-workers were good. The hardest part of the job was the management being so high school. The most enjoyable part of the job was talking to the people that called in.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,the customers that called in were great and they even talk avout there family and what they were doing that day. the employees were another story
bad,"Typical day at work would just to help the customers with activation of their phones or devices and make sells off of those calls."
bad,"Would come into work and would immediately taking calls with very unsatisfied customers but would do whatever I could with the training I had to make them happy and satisfied , I felt at this job I did not learn all things needed to be content in this job., The hardest part of the job was not knowing all the answers to the questions the customers would have I was servicing the Midwest and they handled things different. Honestly the most enjoyable part of the job was the end of the day.."
bad,What you would expect from a call center. Taking inbound calls for Fed ex. Training was more of a social event. Once we got on the floor it was a free for all.
bad,"I've been with this company for about a year and a half and they have yet to reward me for the contributions I have brought the company and the product.  I dislike that the rewards go to perfect attendance, never mind that people have genuine ideas to make try and make the product, policies and procedure even better. "
bad,"Enjoyable job, novice management made the environment challenging.  This is a company where your role continuously changes and uncertainty is always in play.  Unusually high attrition rates."
bad,"Call Center for AT&T telecom for Apple Support."
bad,"Convergys is a call center, with a very fast paced environment and  a wide variety of call types and people. Management non-communicative and unstructured."
bad,"Only work here if you are desperate for money because they hire anyone and don't care what your background or experience is. No raises, no benefits and their training hours are horrible."
bad,"My typical day at work was okay, I would login on the phone systems and take care of Samsung customers who were having issues with their mobile devices and Smart TVs. "
bad,Great job opportunity to learn something new. Great position to learn the call center process and environment. Learned to do so many things with this job. Learned how to understand customers concerns and empathize with the customer.
bad,I have worked here for a couple of months and I see a huge disconnect between management and employee. Please understand there are only a few team leads that are an exception.
bad,I was floor support to over 50 agents at any given time. I was required to know all services and procedures for each scenario. Able to override manager functions and to apply credits or discounts on customer accounts.
bad,"The workplace at Minacs is very mentally draining with a high volume of calls for 9 hours, you have 3 breaks; two of them 15 minutes and one lunch break of a half hour, the management is quite difficult to deal with, if you want to have sundays off for faith, consider it imposible this a life decision 100% neither understood or appreciated. The training modules are out of date which cause set backs while learning but the handouts are helpful, training is heavily based off of mere completion of tests so regardless of understanding you'll get through it answers are read out to the training room in a checklist fashion, many people in your class will quite the first week out of training and slowly but surely your personal life will take a toll from exhaustion, the people are great though, job just has little to no support for personal life balance"
bad,"the hardest part of my job is coming to work at 12mn, having this kind of schedule will make you weary.aside from that this is the time where we get high call volumes, and irate customers.But process wise we get use to it in just a month. getting to talk to different people everyday, you will see reality, you will learn that life is not that easy in other countries as well.but having co-workers as my team have makes my day right, and my our my work easier and relaxing, we try to make it fun so that at the end of each day will all go home with a happy face.what can i say about our management, a lot of us are not happy and satisfied, probably that's the reason why a lot are leaving the company. i enjoy being with my co-workers and having a very understanding and caring team leader that's what motivates to come to work everyday."
bad,"A very fast paced occupation. I was able to gain a lot of information on technology. There was always something to do in this job, never a slow moment."
bad,A lot of pressure. Constantly standing over you while working. No benefits. Long list of work and very little time to do it. Very stressful.
bad,"In general, working in a BPO industry is not that easy. Yes, agents are given the privilege to get high income but then, you'll have to adjust with the schedule and for me, that's the hardest part of all."
bad,I liked the place. I like the 10 weeks of training it was very informational and taught us a lot. I loved the people in my training class.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Enjoyed working with the people and the opportunities that were presented to me. Developed some relationships with nice people and customers.
bad,"High stress environment, constant management overlooking you, daily(sometimes twice a day) coaching, seemed like they want to fire you before they lay you off enjoyed listening to music while working, i learned that some jobs can make make you work too hard, co-wokers were pleasant and helpful"
bad,"This work place is not very well organized. The environment is filthy and not professional. They only care about someone sitting in a seat. The quality of the call or the customer service is not really care about. For those that actually do their job, they are treated badly. They only promote their favorites, not those that are qualified. "
bad,un-designated seating caused many problems as well as lazy employees who do not document or do their jobs properly. i found many times i was fixing other employees mistakes or not helping the customers at all due to restrictions. many unhappy customers.
bad,"Leaned to navigate with 12 systems for uverse and land line accts  "
bad,"- This position was a call center for GM's OnStar service, the day consisted of answering phone calls and providing customer service."
bad,"This company is not very family friendly, favoritism is the only way to move up in this environment. There are no raises or they are extremely hard to get for even a 10 cent raise , with very little opportunity advance."
bad,it an okay job they did want to give mine wedding off at the time when I put it in 3 months a head and plus I told them the day they interviewed me
bad,"I did not like convergys because it was not professional at all. there were a lot of rude people, childish behaviors, and horrible bosses. Their turnover rate is extremely high because they do not set enough  standards and the bosses are not good at all"
bad,"Minacs South Field is not a good place to work, all the people are caught in their personal drama and nonsense. I would suggest that most people avoid the place as it is dictated by peoples emotions and not working toward being a better company."
bad,"There is so much favoritism and unprofessional behavior by the staff, clicks and other things that make it seem like a hostile environment"
bad,"Working at home can be a huge benefit but in the case of working for Convergys it was not."
bad,"They job is easy and the coworkers are fun to work with. If you can talk on the phone, be respectful and follow how you are supposed to do your job it is great. Management is ok. Some are impossible to get along with and others I cant speak highly enough about. The company does not have much care in the world about their employees work/life balance."
bad,short breaks and no back up if you have a rough customer who threatens or verbally attacks. you are just told to not take it personally. hard to do when they say you are this and you are that and i will never take that service again. etc.
bad,"It was a ok place to work. The job it's self wasn't hard. Upper Management sucks. I was in the Michigan location, so if there was a bad snow day were we got inches of snow (Ex:14 inches) they would count that against you. When we had a flood and I couldn't get off my block they wrote me up for that. I had a family emergency, i received the call while at work and I got fired for leaving to get to my family. Minacs has no sympathy for there employees."
bad,"I would recommend that you only obtain this job as a starter job! It is a call center position, however it is not very professional. Your hours of availability has to be flexible; you might come in your whole shift has changed or extended without your consent. the customers are very rude over the phone, so you have to have tough skin being on the phone with this company. They will teach how to have good customer service though."
bad,I would only work here again under extreme circumstances.  Kinda like high school with pay.  Too much drama.
bad,"talk to direct tv customers and fix problems, and take payments"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,The company lacks any idea what culture is or how to motivate employees. Far too much complaint about money from management but bringing in food is no problem. Some managers are good but others are rude and cruel. I no longer work there and would rather be job less than go back.
bad,The account itself is not bad but the HR department is just very disorganized. No information on the benefits until a few days before the deadline. Always messing up the paychecks and people seem to be always lazy.
bad,"It's an nice place to work for. The people are nice. However, If you don't make your stats your fired"
bad,"The management is awful. They're rude and could care less about their agents. The pay is okay and the hours were great. The phone calls wasn't the issue, it was the awful corporation."
bad,"taking medical insurance calls for USA company "
bad,Too much favoritism. Company policies weren't very clear.
bad,I feel we are micromanaged. And was not a good place to work. You were only alotted a certain time limit to go to ladies room
bad,the company is closed now so there is no rating. the company closed all businesses in canada
bad,The company value the customers to the wildest extent but treat the workers like slaves.
bad,In training students were informed that job was professional and had many future job opportunities.  This was definitely not the case.  Typical day at work would be assisting customers with ATT active accounts and setting up new ATT services.  Many calls were related to billing questions and complaints.  I learned several ATT products.  I had many friendly co-workers that I have built future long term friendships with.  The hardest part of my job was not having the help needed for some of the difficult accounts.  The most enjoyable part of my job was interacting with different customers all over the states and offshore accounts.
bad,Inconsistent policies and procedures.  Hazy goals. Very high turnover rate among mid-level management. Contract call center
bad,There is not much that can be said about this job. I joined simply to make some money to pay for college
bad,"Minacs was a very stressful work environment. They were often busy and without enough workers, so almost every week there was required extra hours. Between the commute and the extended working hours there was hardly any time to do anything other than sleep and go to work. I learned a lot about cars and that many people are unhappy. There were quite a few co-workers that would help the new workers where they could, but the overall environment is negative. Many employees were constantly upset with either management or work scheduling. The hardest part was the stress and depression that comes with trying to handle upset and yelling people all day. The only thing I enjoyed was the couple of friends I made while I was there."
bad,"It has a very high turn over rate for a reason, it is a terrible place to work. The human resource department is the absolute worst."
bad,Due to an illness in 2008 I'm unable to remember a lot of what I did on the job but my husband worked there with me.
bad,Its a great job to be at overall. I learned a lot from my job teaching me how to advance to a higher level in skill also responsibility. my co-workers are friendly and have lots of talent. really love that the job is flexible and will work with you through their needs.
bad,"Don't remember much."
bad,"I would answer inbound calls regarding the NFL Sunday Ticket. I learned how to be polite but firm with customers asking for a ""special deal"" or when they were being rude. I wasn't impressed with the management. Our Team Leads would switch a lot, and it was difficult to understand who was in charge. It was all very confusing. I liked my co-workers, many of them were also college students."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Avoid, They suck your blood for the less money they could pay you."
bad,A mostly inbound call center that was run with a corporate vision and not for employees.
bad,This was an okay place to work. They tell you they are going to give you raises and never do.
bad,"Convergys teaming with Stream was a terrible idea on a leadership front.  Our site is mismanaged and totally lacks any leadership and with Convergys coming on board I felt it would change and it never did. They outsourced jobs to overseas for cheaper labor and laid off 150 employees and the management leadership team at the site does not know what they are doing.  The HR office (except one) is a total inept group that they cannot even get payroll or bonuses paid out within 45 to 90 days!!!  They cannot make a decision on their own with having permission - lack of anything in the HR. The main leadership staff keeps getting replaced and cannot keep anybody in their position (its a power struggle). HR leader is a power hungry authoriatative person who thinks she can do whatever and anything without repercussions and if a Team Manager stands up for employees or whats right they are walked out the door.  Leadership sucks and spills down hill to agents who don't want to work there and results in high attrition as they treated terribly. Good employees are hard to find but to actually cause them to leave is even worse, which is why this place in general (not sure elsewhere) is terrible and should be either totally replaced or closed down. Morale is terrible and like mentioned before, starts with the Leadership Team and lack of leadership abilities.  Pay is average and Managers are overworked and over-burdened and every time you turn around the Leadership team is changing things halfway through one change and everyone is lost and confused.  The computer systems are lagging and seldom"
bad,Covergy's is interesting. I really don't believe in talking bad about a job so i won't do so. I'm only writing this because it is required for whatever reason.
bad,training was sufficient but the call volume was extremely high. The ability to work at home was def a plus.
bad,"In my stay at Convergys, I can say that my best learning is the spirit of empathy.  I got to deal with different kinds of customers, irate and soft spoken callers, but the bottom line is you need to serve them and help them with their concerns.  I can also say that I developed my English speaking skills as well as my self esteem because of Convergys. I can say that the management is considerate enough that we were given the HMO benefit upon hiring. With regards to my co-workers, we only got to talk to each other after our shift, but we make the most of it by going out for lunch all together once in a while. The hardest part of the job is when I know that the customer is right and that he/she deserves some compensation, but I can't do it by myself as I don't have the authority and still need to wait for the availability of my Team Leader, thus my average handling time (AHT) suffers.  The most enjoyable part of the job is during the initial training, wherein I got to receive salary while still learning/studying."
bad,"I have  worked in several call centers before coming here, which I loved but closed down... this one is by far the worst I've stepped into let alone worked in. It's a joke! Run by mostly women who let authority go to  their head...my trainer was new and had the worst personality and should not be a trainer. She had an attitude with people like she was a seventh grader. And we didn't learn anything. This location is ghetto and gives the company a bad rep!!!"
bad,I love being a team leader and i love to work for Convergys. Everytime i left i always came back to them.
bad,I was lucky to have a job for almost two years but Convergys has a very high turn over rate due to lack of support for it's employee's.  All they seem to care about is numbers and if people are disconnecting accounts it's not because the employee's cant save them it's due to the competition giving a cheaper rate. They may call one month with no help and call the next month to disconnect due to finding a cheaper provider.
bad,Employees are sufering because they are not told that if the internet is not working up to par that you have to take days off before returning to work They also have issues with there turn over rate. We had 26 employees in October and now we are done to two.
bad,This company was the most unprofessional company I have ever worked for not for long term employment.
bad,I enjoyed my coworkers. They were  friendly and got along well with them.
bad,"Your day consisted of answering phones and addressing the technical issues of the customers.  It was very difficult to deal with because a great deal of them blamed you for the inconsistencies of service.  The training was overall, very lack luster and the floor was very cut throat."
bad,Cashed people out daily and helped with merchandise for the customer.
bad,"Loved the work but never felt appreciated as a employee. As a employee a typical day would be taking incoming calls thourgh-out the day. Handling customer issues with billing, show empathy, follow procedures, listen attentively. etc.. hard part of the job would be based off of the pressure the company places on team leaders and then the team leaders plac a extreme amount of pressure on employees to up sales and stats. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and having really great conversations. Building rappor is my all time favorite."
bad,An OK place to work for with none or minimum place for advancement.
bad,"The pay was terrible and the benefits were average. You really didn't feel appreciate by higher management. The hardest part about working at Convergys was having schedule biding every month, which means your schedule consistently changed."
bad,"Were on the phones for nearly eight hours a day, however no two calls were exactly the same."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,It's not for everyone. You have to be on the phone all the time. You cant do very much when sitting down.
bad,"Very high stress job working with very angry and high risk customer providing tech support for Comcast internet and phone svcs.  Many problems with internal management, wages, and scheduling.  Very difficult to hold company accountable. Work at home agent."
bad,"Management not fair to employees when requesting days off , the same people got the time off every week whom was friends w/ the lady that prepared the time off schedule."
bad,"Training is smooth, but just wait till you get on the call floor, and being nice to customers doesn't mean anything as long as you have good stats, that is literally all Convergys cares about, STATS.  Sanitary conditions are bad as well, management had to send whole class home one day due to FLU outbreak.  I got paid decent but when I can get paid the same and not work at such a craphole, this job is not worth having unless it's this or prostituting for money.  DO NOT WORK HERE!!!"
bad,Management is poor. Flexible hours sometimes. Easy work for the most part if you can meet your stats.
bad,"Fast paced call center. I met some good people working at convergys. The pay was bad, the location was far, they offered home agent position which i ended up doing whaich copensated for the long drive a little. But there were days when i worked at the office, where there would be more employees than workspaces. Some days you would sit around 1/2 the day waiting for a free computer and phone/desk..."
bad,"no focus on continuing education"
bad,"if you seen it on tv,, they took the calls,, Mormons to boflex"
bad,"Enjoyed speaking with persons from all over the Country, helping find products that fit their lifestyle."
bad,"overall not a good job. They dont take any of your personal questions and concerns seriously. They dont take the blame, everyone tells you to go to a different person and everyone has a different answer"
bad,"Depending on the project, your HR could let you go for any small reason."
bad,unrealistic expectations and always threatening you with your job don't care about you as an individual all about numbers
bad,Typicsl day at work consist of fast pace high call volume for billing and cust service issues. that hardest part of the job is multitasking. toggling thru screens while resolving customers request
bad,The worked day consist of coming in not knowing where you will sit to start your shift. Cant find a manger to ask where you need to be sitted. have to clock in for work on someone else computer that is already taking calls for the day.
bad,Scheduling is all over the place. Sometimes you might not even get a dat off. And you have to fight tooth and nail for overtime.
bad,the management was too afraid to go against Comcast to better serve the employees and make them happy. schedules are made two states away and you might as well forget requesting off because it will get denied every single time. the job security sucks because they push you to do sales and fire you if you don't sell things. the benefits and the salary weren't all that great either. if you like people yelling at you constantly and getting nowhere with your concerns then by all means work there but its not for me.
bad,"No consistency from the entire company, lack of tools to perform job properly."
bad,Contract call center work - Taking incoming calls for different clients
bad,"I have learned how to communicate with customers."
bad,not really a great company  it pays the bill but it all depends on who they contract out to   its a call center nothing more  and the attendance policy is out of wack   you wont be seeing them on any fortune 500  
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,customers very nice
bad,"I felt like a drone that was just to take calls and fix the problems with out the help of my manager and when ever I did ask for help, it didn't resolve the issue for the customer."
bad,This company does not fit into my moral beliefs and violates my integrity values I believe in.
bad,"No real leadership here from the team leaders, no one wanted to take an escalation, benefits are terrible, and absolutely no room for advancement"
bad,"A typical day at work was working 12 hours plus mandatory overtime. Some of the TL's were awesome, the co-workers were awesome, the management were not part of the sales floor. The hardest part of the job was if you were talking to a customer and the time went over your break, you lost your break and have to wait till your next one, which was two hours later. Smokers were allowed to take multiple breaks and a lot of people took up smoking so they could get those extra breaks. They over hired and had to let some people go. Company would not work with my school schedule and since I was paying to go to college, I was ultimately terminated from Convergys due to their lack of scheduling and working with others. Only seemed like they wanted workers with no families, school etc. They got rid of the chat as well, so we were no longer allowed to talk to one another."
bad,"Logging onto the system and telephone, co-workers was okay to work with,and saying the mimuim marianda, talking to the costumer, and my co-works."
bad,"I would assist att customers with issues and resolve them, perform upgrades, and offer other services provided by att"
bad,"This job could have been quite unpleasant- it is difficult to work with customers whom are extremely upset with their current service, thanks to the training it taught me how to handle difficult customers, and how to actually turn their frustration into happiness."
bad,Answered warranty and recall questions and concerns.
bad,"At the beginning I enjoyed the training and the people who I would eventually work with. The managers were poor at providing necessary help as they were meant to do. The expectations are way too far for most, and they don't give an effort to help you improve. I learned how to help customers over the phone with their TV, Internet and phones in case something was not working correctly. I loved speaking to customers, especially those who enjoyed the service we provided. We had very short lunch's with no where to travel in time to get any food. Travel would be helpful since the food they provided were mostly snacks and were extremely expensive."
bad,Working there was easy. answering customers calls about little questions. The management sucks. They don't keep their promises. The hardest part was leaving when I had doctors notes and everything but they made me leave anyways.
bad,The company has cut hours and is pushing more work on the staff. The pay is good but the bonus isn't always paid on time. Management is constantly changing.
bad,"Convergys expects perfect attendance, perfect adherence to schedule. The immediate business focus may be changed at given moment. Co-workers were great, the hardest part of the job is satisfying an ever array client needs, goals and expectations."
bad,"Calls generally came in from Northeast America, agents would be expected to handle cable packages for customers regarding billing and technical support. As expected, customers were generally irate, and the poor computer systems at the company only helped a little. In the training class, however, I was not informed of any available benefits. Also, management did not keep reliable contact. I needed to speak to my personal team leader from day 1 and was never able to get in contact with her. The pay was nice, the work was OK, the co-workers seemed to have a bad attitude about the job as well, job was very stressful for me because of the management issue, alongside the computer issues. Teamwork is encouraged, but not evident in the workplace."
bad,a typical day at work----Pressure
bad,A great job for younger individuals but I need more stability and job security.
bad,Not true to the employees with regards to the length of time the initial job was for. We had the understanding that the position was to be full time and ongoing with dedication from all involved. Not the case as they had already planned and arranged for training in India after 4 weeks of our training was completed.
bad,cool place to work nice managers only thing was company closed down and informed us at the last minute
bad,Inbound call from U.S customers.
bad,when i was hired i was told there were many career opportunities to be attained which i have come to terms that there is no such thing within this company.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,A typical day here is being on the phones all day and answering questions regarding benefits of Johnson and Johnson employees.
bad,I had long & short term disability and when I required dental surgery and needed to do short term disability the manager let me go without notice.
bad,"Talked about unlimited possibility to make great money, had no real training on products, all system training. Supervisor who disdained me from the first day. Negative place overall"
bad,"A typical day would start at 7a, call volume is usually steady and increases toward the end of the shift at 3p. The traffic during lunch is usually hectic, and lunch onsite is expensive. The hardest part of the job was selling to angry customers, but the best part of the job was the angry customers (you know exactly what they want)."
bad,"Convergys has a few good things that have kept me working there longer than I want to be and that is: good amount of paid time off ( i earn 4 hours per pay check) good amount of unpaid time off (16 hours every 3 months) and they do try to make employees happy by asking them what to improve on every year in the employee opinion survey. Convergys does not pay their employees well AT ALL. For a customer service rep you start out at 8.50 and you don't usually change from that. You can't request days off in advance, the only way to make sure you're off a certain day is to use paid time off or unpaid time off. Management is a joke... you will know a lot more about your job than they do, in yet they are supposed to coach you on how to do better. Convergys would be a better place to work if they weren't so greedy and paid people what they deserve. Not a lot of people get promotions and the ones who do don't typically deserve them."
bad,"The best work experience ever, you meet so many great people. Overtime is unlimited, down fall is the projects are ending constantly."
bad,Incoming/outgoing calls-first call resolution specialist- responsible for resolving issues from the customer or employers. Creating work orders for the client in regards to maintenance upkeep of the company: etc.
bad,What you should expect if you decide to work here is that you will have 3 weeks of training classroom that was pointless and then for the next two weeks they throw you onto phone calls with irate customers. Very stressful trying to learn the system and help the customer with a problem. Everyday I came to work depressed. I would not recommend this job to anyone unless they are just looking for a temporary job until they find something better.
bad,I don't feel that new employees are taught how to do the position in detail before they are required to reach a quota in the positions they are hired. I don't feel that they have good trainers and they don't give the new employees a chance to learn in a more paced environment.
bad,Not a great place to work. They keep the ones that don't want to stay long term and let go the ones that need and want a job. Looks are something that I notice why they keep people on…no I'm not ugly and disgruntled. The atmosphere (where I worked) was not a place that shows friendliness.
bad,this job is best for younger people. Older people will probably not like fast food work unless they are bored and already have good finances
bad,"Speaking about the Convergy's that was located in Houston, Tx off of the North Freeway (45). I believe that an Employer should always be up front with the employees. There is a problem with a 3rd party company such as Convergy's that should be about to hold there contracts with any Client. I can not tell you how many time that I have work for Sprint and the vendor as lost the contract with Sprint. These third party comany's are all about themselves and their employee. ( not setting goal that can not be reach by your employee just to keep the commission or bonus, but I guess that;s the price you pay for not working for the actually company directly."
bad,"Working here made me feel more like in high school, it was a lot more younger people there that it seemed as if at times they really didnt take their job serious"
bad,"Innotrac will pay you more, the people are better and the whole experence is better."
bad,Expecting perfection all day everyday is tough on the mental health. There are hours and money to be made if you go with Onstar . Advancement is possible . I feel they underpay compared to other call centres.
bad,Alot of potential and the pay and benefits are good but the management scattered.  There might be better management with different accounts but my experience with Goldman Sachs was poor.
bad,Going into the job was not bad until they worry about things that are absurd. The facility director is worried about where agents park and is watching all the time but the place now has bedbugs which have people quitting!! You are forced to work overtime as well during tax season. Being in Payroll is not too bad but stressful when senior support does not know answers to your questions. IImmediate
bad,"Poca attenzione al dipendente, ritmi di lavoro stressanti, permessi o ferie quasi inesistenti, come lavoro temporaneo può andare bene, ma meglio cercare altro!"
bad,"Continuously underpaying for work done. Received a promotion and it took a call to ministry of labour, quitting and 1 1/2 months before receiving any back pay. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"good for fresh grads, lots of learning. lots of allowances for the employees and very happy team mates. good stepping stone in a cruel world of corporate."
bad,"Good fun for some with a competitive mindset and are looking for short term capital gain however, many of the policies disregard loyalty and trust as moreover, my experience included working very hard and being appreciated by managers, however, those who didn't perform were disregarded and treated as if they were simply a proletariat."
bad,"Not so great and not so bad also. No carrier growth and internal politics is more. Only come work and go,no fair work life.work life balance is also not there"
bad,"It was extremely evident that they didn'time care about customers needs, only their own commission checks amd prizes and good AHT (average handle time; which they want ours at 11 min. Which messes it up bad with 2 or 3 long involved calls that aren't making them commission. Therefore the customer leaves ATT bc no idy wamted to help them. frustrated knowing nobody levleafrustratthat nobidy"
bad,If you have a  position that pays a bonus it justifies the hourly pay.  There has been several times where the bonus wasn’t paid in time due to a member of management not signing off on it in adequate time
bad,Concentrix se caracteriza por ser una compañía que busca el crecimiento de su negocio. El ambiente laboral debe mejorar y los líderes necesitan tener una mejor escucha de las necesidades y quejas de sus empleados.
bad,"They were not a very fair company, there was no chance for advancement   ,and the benefits were way to high for what the pay was. My direct supervisor was great to work for."
bad,Concentrix is for ppl who like to get incoming calls constantly with angry customers mad about things we can’t control.. management is terrible they show LOTS of favoritism and always have attitudes. Supervisors wanna be your friend then try to get serious once a manager has got on their case then they get ignorant
bad,sitting around in a chair all day listening to people complain about problems woth their devices is boring theres nothing to keep you happy felt like a prison
bad,"I did work with some great co-workers however kept increasing job requirements without increasing pay. Was being required to upsell products and services with no positive benefits. Bonuses were cut and made unlikely to earn the smaller bonuses, I went from making an average monthly bonus of $800.00 to about $50.00 a month, if that."
bad,"I worked here for a year to get money for school. Got yelled at by people on the phone every day. My depression and anxiety got worse here. The hours were horrible did not work around the bus schedule had to take Lyfts and Ubers at 1:30 AM. Had to work for every holiday aka no family time. "
bad,I heard the location in Charlotte recently changed their name . While I am grateful for certain things from that job like 40hour work week. That was a incredible perk especially Monday- Friday 9-5. And extra pay for working nights.But the place was terribly managed . The pressure by management to rush you off the calls made you feel like a robot. And they lie and tell you it’s a seasonal job with potential to become permanent but they only choose 2 out a class of 30. They don’t even give anyone a heads up either.
bad,"Great to learn and earn experience. Will not increase pay at $13.00/hr, but will allow you to promote to various positions."
bad,"Blanket interviews I got the feeling almost everyone that passed a breathing check and a background check was hired. A lot of young people, high turnover rate."
bad,"You're able to work as many hours as you'd like, and is often needed. You'll have a set schedule, but the schedulers will often change your days off without letting you know. I had Saturdays and Sundays off for medical reasons, and despite having a doctor order for that they changed it anyway, and it was a constant fight."
bad,"Easy attendance policy, low pay and disinterested management. Training is good. It's not a bad starter call center if you're just getting started or need a fresh start before moving on to better opportunities that pay better or like their employees."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"You’ll fall asleep in the training almost every day. It’s like they’re not teaching you anything most of the time, they’re waiting for others to catch up. While most of the people at concentrix are great and help you get through the day, the customers will drive you crazy and the system you work for will drive you crazier. Your callers randomly get a survey to tell the company how the call went, but it doesn’t matter if they like you. It matters if they like the company. So while you may get a 10/10 in all categories, if they wouldn’t recommend the company you get a horrible score and you get yelled at or told off by the “team leaders”. Most of the time they wouldn’t recommend the company because the company is awful. And I understand how mad they are but am told to tell them “I’m sorry you feel that way”. Don’t ever want to have to work here again even thought the people and money aren’t bad with benefits aswell. Oh yeah, and you can’t wear open toed shoes because they have so much carpet fleas and won’t get rid of them."
bad,"Most of my issue working at Concentrix is biased heavily on the terrible client we worked for. Speaking from a management position, the typical inbound CSR is not so bad, however for the type of documentation we worked on and the pile of documents and procedures that needed to be memorized, I believe that working barely above the minimum wage was not suitable and was a constant complaint that I have heard from people working inbound. The upper management and client unfortunately was sub-par at best and and being one of the longest tenured people for the project I work for, I have seen almost all other tenured and good management leave for better opportunities and the only reason I stay is because at the very minimum, the people are enjoyable to be around and work with and without the assistance of my end of management, things would fall apart very quickly, before I leave I at least wanted to ensure there was a suitable replacement but so far all the ones I have considered have moved away from this company."
bad,Not a bad job if your young but paying all your bills working here may be very hard. However single parent household with multiple bills I ended up needing a part time job to fully cover all bills.
bad,"This job is boring, however; it is a basic and easy to learn job. Good for full time hours and over time. Great starter job. Management is hit or miss like any other job. Good job security if you don't call in sick or late often. Made a lot of good friends working there. This is a job for those who are not phone shy."
bad,They were constantly firing people who were working for Amazon. They weren't focused on keeping employees around and this contract ultimately ended. This was not an official Amazon call center.
bad,"Salary not the best. "
bad,Overall the job and training was easy. Worked on the fedex side so calls were mostly tracking a customer pkg. The Management on the other had suck. Leaves out information such as the times were going to work. Never received a schedule for after training until the last day of training andbwas never told that after training you are mandated to work a shift of 1pm to 10pm. The HR department is not willing to work with any employees regarding hrs and never get approved for any days off. They dont care about a work/life balance at all. Treat employees as if you are another number. Dont work in the fedex side until you have no life and plan on just working crazy hrs. Other departments or campaigns are better and work with you more...
bad,"You should only consider applying here if you are able to handle stress, if you are able to multi-task, work quickly, make enough sales, and have a high patience tolerance."
bad,"Ho lavorato per diversi mesi per quest'azienda e devo dire che mi sono trovato molto bene con colleghi e team leader. Ambiente lavorativo piacevole anche se non particolarmente attento al lavoratore (tastiere usurate, schermi piccoli, sedie malconce). Salario buono. Grandissima pecca è la quasi totale mancanza di stabilità e possibilità di crescita lavorativa, l'azienda (come tante altre) pensa solamente ai propri interessi economici e non a valorizzare i talenti. Gli sforzi per raggiungere performance ottime e aiutare tutto il sito non sono stati minimamente considerati. Se volete fare una nuova esperienza nel mondo del customer service per qualche mese con un buon stipendio allora Concentrix può andar bene. Se siete determinati nel fare il meglio e vorreste conquistare con il vostro impegno qualcosa di stabile allora lasciate perdere, sono tempo e fatica sprecati. Considero a ogni modo la mia esperienza molto preziosa, ho conosciuto persone splendide. Totalmente bocciato il management e l'etica aziendale."
bad,"company did not like to pay overtime but demanded extra hours. held instead days in lieu, or paid day off, company would never give you time off...at end of year lieu days would roll off and company would not pay you...end up working for free"
bad,"About this company, they are good for giving a good salary but they are lack for managing their employees especially on the equipment of the said company"
bad,"This is a place that is without a manager it seem, or a HR department. We had to submit our own payroll, our own hours, had to set up our own work information. The training was amazing, however that trainer is no longer there. When I left, a lot of others was leaving as well. Not sure how they are doing anymore."
bad,"The work is extremely easy to do. Many people find that out during their 1st week of new hire training. You get all the benefits you need. Dental, medical, vision, 401K, long term/short term disability, and life insurance"
bad,At the initial stage they will recruit you with good hike.. But they dont give a good appraisal.. too much injustice . Worst cab facilities. Too many restrictions
bad,It’s had it up and down with the place it wasn’t the job it was poor management that a deal breaker.And the place very unorganized and the time was needed and people came to work whenever they wanted too.
bad,"This is a great place to work... if you are 18 and just graduated with no skills and don't mind working in a place that lets infantilism flourish and encourages solipsism. If you don't mind having extremely sophomoric management because you just got out of highschool and don't know adult life yet you'll fit in just fine. All others need not apply, don't exasperate yourself for this job, find somewhere else, you'll be happier for it."
bad,Meh it's okay! I wish they paid more. They do promote from within. It is always nice to work from home. Dont look forward to any raises but you might get a free t-shirt
bad,"A typical day at work is sitting down and logging into a workstation that hopefully works. If not, you may spend a significant amount of time trying to find a working station. Then you proceed to sit down on broken chairs for 8 hours and get yelled at by customers who want free devices, impossible appointments, or who do not want to listen to you. The system, like any call center, is based on statistics and you quickly learn how to function in the system, however meeting the requirements can be difficult and the coaching you get from managers often doesn't help you improve. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"A typical work day consists of high volume calls, little to no assistance. Management does not assist with supervisor calls which leads to extremely angry members. Can be culturally bias in the workplace. The hardest part of the job is handling the calls for rejected claims and management team. This place has a lot of potential for growth and experience but is not a place that you want to base a solid long-term career. The company is currently being bought out by Concentrix and are expected to make new changes soon."
bad,ITs been a while since I worked there I was young and it was decent enough. There where a lot of young people and I do remember things were a little violent.
bad,"Concentrix gives you the opportunity to gain a lot of knowledge in various fields because of the different contracts that are available to work for. During the transition from CCI to Concentrix, I experienced better benefits, an increase in wages, and the ability to sharpen my customer service skills while assisting clients."
bad,"I did my job to the best of my ability, and it was not good enough, as I couldn't sell additional products.  I was there to be a great reservationist, and help people,"
bad,"Convergys mrico-managed their employees, they didn't give the Team Leaders the ability to run a team the way it should have been run to be successful. They didn't value their employees."
bad,"Overall, convergys was just not the job for me. There were not enough opportunities for employees and sitting on the phones all day is just something that i couldnt handle"
bad,"The job is truly not hard. Needs better managers and direction; if it’s all you have, I’d take it but if you have anything else on the table, go there"
bad,Company offered very poor career advancement and expectations were always set to deliver well above 40 hours a week. Felt like you worked in a mine field as you constantly lived under a microscope and always had heavier workloads added without help being given.
bad,"As a Customer Resolutions Specialist, customers specifically wanted to talk to you to end their wireless service.  We had to save consumers from leaving by offering them incentives.  The most heard complaint was lack of service.  We were unable to offer them anything at that point."
bad,"The company is misleading because during the interview they tell you that you can choose your hours.  After you are hired they tell you the hours that you must work.  They threaten you with being written up if you take any days off.  "
bad,"They do not pay out their incentives the way they promise them, VERY UNPROFESSIONAL.  If they do not like you, they have employess(management) that will try to get you out of there. Management only cares about their job, and does not speak up for their employees who are not treated well."
bad,Has become a place of first jobs and is reflected in the culture of large % of employees.  Many shining stars stand out which is easiest just by showing up. Some basic opportunity to advance but not a healthy long term place.
bad,"if you don't have nice things to say you don't say them at all this was my 1st corp world call center position and the atmosphere a people hired is sketchy and lots of foul things go on, right  on company grounds."
bad,I wish I could say something good abt that workplace except the handsome salary they offered me. Employers didn't even value you as humans. The cab services the worst nightmare you will ever have. I have honestly stayed in the office for a total 12 hrs after my 9 hr shift just because they didnt have any cabs in my route. Even the management never cared about the complaints.
bad,"The company has a lot of issues. Let me say this management is never on the same page with one another. The people you work with are great people/ Even management, they simply have no level of professionalism. The company promotes within, only if you are liked. The pay is much to low for the role. The company does not pay their employees. I would NOT recommend my friends and family to this company. Even if they were homeless."
bad,"Excellent and great working,good ambience.Learnt a lot also peaceful atmosphere.Management was supportive and hard working.No work pressure and good work environment"
bad,"Despite being a Comcast IT technician, I would be fired if I didn't convince enough people to buy more Comcast products. I had to give a sales pitch even if I could not currently fix the problem they were calling in for."
bad,"micromanaged every minute of the day"
bad,"While I was there, the training program was the only thing I liked. That was because the trainer I had was an amazing person and made it enjoyable. After that everything broke loose, people kept quitting after about a month on the floor with how stressful it was and how crazy it got. They pushed everyone to make sales over helping the customers a lot of the time."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,The company is a advancement to make money; but the job security isn't there; because if sale goals aren't met then job isn't secure. So it's a short/
bad,"Not that great actually. High metrics standards to be endorsed to production. Though average salary are given to those with experience, there are no allowances. It would also help if training covers almost all aspects in real production."
bad,"Frankly, I don't enjoy working in call centers, but I took this job during a time when I didn't have anything else.  Decent place, if a bit grungy, and decent people.  I just didn't enjoy what I was doing (tech support, and pressure to get sales on each call)."
bad,"Dealing mostly with irate customers on a daily basis regarding their cell phone account charges, many times escalating call to management. Assisting in the activation of their cell phone when possible or referring them to a phone center if problems cannot be resolved over the phone. Management was there to listen and help. I think the company was fairly new and being in a call center did not feel a good team environment. I found it was frustrating at times constantly dealing with upset customers when the complete tower system was being upgraded to newer technology causing billing problems."
bad,"consisted of answering phones and documentation."
bad,This job is good if you have no experience in a call center or with technical support. They do advanced you pretty quick from iOS to Mac+. They do not pay enough imo. Number one reason I'm leaving. Way too strict as well with break time. Try to make you use your break time to go to bathroom. I would recommend to get experience here and then move on with your life. You can literally get a job doing the same thing and get paid more.
bad,"I was a part of the blue cross project and the training helped to understand the key points of insurance . But once on the production floor some training elements did not compare to actively being on the floor. The agents has a lot of responsibility to make sure they are servicing the member effectively including know how use all 14 systems in regards to researching members’ benefits, claims, authorizations, and billing information. At times the call volumes can be overwhelming so that may deter people from socializing once the work day is completed. Some people in higher management doesn’t know how to talk to employees . But the project is no longer which if you looking to keep in insurance job security isn’t there."
bad,"The hardest part of the job would have had to have been the toxic work environment. I believe had the job been less stressful, that I would still have the job."
bad,"I was at the call center for over three years, and through that time I learned that I require more physical activity from my job.  Sitting at a desk for over 10 hours a day was a struggle for me."
bad,This is an ok place to work. They day goes by quick and sometimes it can get stressful but that's life. there is no paid vacation time I dont get to spend any holidays with my family working here. You gets points taken away if you dont drive in the snow to get there.
bad,"Convergys seemed okay when I walked in. The recruiter let me know that sales were a bonus; instead sales seemed to be the most important thing that my manager pushed me into doing. My trainer was amazing and she cared about her trainees, but as soon as we got onto the call floor, our TL/Manager confused us constantly and always had different answers. She pressured us into making sales even when we had an escalated call. The job could go better with more organization and an overhaul of management and culture."
bad,it is a call center where almost every call is someone who is angry and shouting trying to get something free or cancel their subscription. advancement was difficult and quota for sales was near impossible.
bad,"It started really well, however, as most call centers all went downhill. They were adding new type of calls without providing any training for them, most managers did not have a clue on how to resolve calls and operations managers only cared about selling a product unrelated to most of the issues we had on the phones."
bad,The company was more interested in quantity not quality. They eventually lost the project as well as many projects due to the way the company was run.
bad,"The account I was with was definitely awesome. I just can't say the same for the people running it though. I wish they'd concentrate more on their employees' potential than go find faults, lose people and go ramping again. It just really doesn't make sense, does it?"
bad,"My time as an employee of Convergys was short and bitter. Management did a poor job of keeping employees abreast of changes and expected a team that was being converted to have one week of training and be 100% on the floor. The culture was terrible, no compensation was seen by me or fellow colleagues in regards to good stats and surveys."
bad,"you are always made aware that your position could be shipped overseas at any moment.  Although there may not be enough work to require OT you are required to log so much per week, in attempt to show you are needed."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Not fun place payroll was horrible always was an on going issue with my check always had to wait 2 weeks to get it fix constant issue I did love helping the customer
bad,Very tough work to do with Quickbooks. Calls are demanding and you have to know alot. Traing doesny cover all. If you need help it is tough to get. Management is sneaky but they do support you to do good and they base almost everything on customer feedback surverys and if the customer does not like you one more reason to fire you. Good part is pay is decent and benefits.
bad,"Most call center jobs are quick paced and stressful, and this was exactly as you'd expect any call center job to be. You sit in a little cube all day and answer non stop phone calls. There's lots of turn over, so there's always new employees."
bad,"There is plenty of opportunity to learn different aspects of HR. This is a plus for going to other companies but not so much for advancement."
bad,"I liked this job, until I started experiencing technical issues with the software we used to work, and was then unable to continue working. I also did not enjoy that I was never given information about my benefits"
bad,"it you like talking on the phone all day and dealing with rude customers all day this is the job for you.  work hours are great, fixed schedule. opportunity for advancement."
bad,"Not enough compensation for the amount of work required!"
bad,"A typical day starts with you logging in to the computer and taking calls like a regular call center.  It is very loud (cow bells, music, people yelling, talking over the cubicles, etc.). I understand you want to change the momentum; however, you must also keep it professional; customers can hear all this over the phones and it is very difficult to concentrate...especially if you are new and learning the position. Training is very vague. A lot of the learning is on the floor and customers are holding forever to get the answer they need. The hardest part of the job is the schedule and the push to sale, sale, sale."
bad,A lot of calls are coming in everyday. I was under a seasonal account and working on a graveyard shift 5 days a week. Oftentimes we are asked to render an hour OT
bad,I started training but had an issue with my flash drive. I quickly ordered another one and reported it to continue training. My trainer didn't report it until the next day and then I was given the run around for more than a week. Never got back in. It wasn't worth the fight. Then the trainer seemed happy when I told her that she didn't have to worry about me asking again since no one could give me an answer.
bad,"Stressful company to work 4. Mgmt not knowledgable. Many flaws in system making it difficult to effectively do job right. Workers leaving w/anxiety disorders depression, walking out on jobs. Only allowed to use bathroom on breaks and lunch, any other time, it's deducted from your pay."
bad,"work environment was very poor. Managers were lackadaisical, and employees very immature and rude. very hard to work in an environment with everything but actual work going on."
bad,"When I started at Convergys it was a customer service based position, since it has become all about sales. People from all positions, and durations of employment have been fired or quit since this transition. If you do not make effective offers and meet sales goals your future with the company will be threatened and this will be done in front of other employees. If you're desperate for a job, apply. If not, move on. They will hire anyone."
bad,The company has no proper hr policy to abide by. Transparency about salary or the statements are not there. Employee portal is not updated. The statement or the break ups in your pay are not clear
bad,Lot of False promises that they cannot keep up. The process is good enough to learn but career wise you have to spend your whole life there. Good colleagues.
bad,"Common place call center with issued ID numbers and name tags. On-site cafeteria (overpriced) with minimal human options, and even less options for advancement."
bad,If you like not knowing your hours for the week coming on a friday this is for you. The people are great and some of the TLs but others have no issue throwing you under the bus etc a lot of favouritism. Salary isnt great at all no work/life balance. Very unorganised
bad,"Overall the experience working at Convergys was not great at all. The managers say smart things to show that they are in control. Basically they have your job in their hands. It is very complicated to get recognition for being an over-achiever, other than a piece of small paper with candy taped to it. The point system is horrible as well as the morning start, 5 mins to open every single system or the system writes you up even if you are having system issues. The ambulance is always outside because someone passes out maybe it has to do with being FORCED to sit in one place for so long. That place is ran by the devil itself. The members is beyond rude too. I was a top performer and did I get offered a raise? NO."
bad,"I'm too complacent to care right now :( My mother always told me if I didn't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all. I can't think of anything nice right now other than I love the people."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,It was a alright place to work depending on the person if you like people yelling at you on the phone then it was alright. There is alotta good people up there just didnt agree with all the polices
bad,What you do is never enough. You can be doing a awesome job and they will still say it's not good enough. The managers are not that great at managing which is why the turn over rate is so high.
bad,"selon les postes; les managers et les méthodes imposé par les clients; l'ambiance peut changer du tout au tout."
bad,"When I first started working for the company is was a fun place to work and was just good vibes, as the company was bought by a competitor it brought a lot of uneasiness at the workplace"
bad,"Most managers (team leads) lack either team management skills ore product knowledge.  To be fare upper management seems to set unreasonable goals for the team managers to meet and the pressure and drive to meet these goals is passed to the teams.  Upper management will not seem to listen to the team managers in regards to how to help the teams, salary, job satisfaction, and this disparity is also past to the teams.  The co-workers are great and a lot of fun to work with and we try to organize a potluck lunch at least once a month."
bad,"good workplace but below market rate for salary, otherwise nice people to work with."
bad,Do not work here unless its this or nothing . There is never enough support o the floor. You never know if you are going to be let go because of your stats.
bad,"Working with Convergys for 14 years, it is the people that make the job.  There are communication issues that never seem to be addressed. There is little room for advancement and when you do advance it never seems to be for the long term."
bad,The job wasn't bad. The managers were. They had an overly superioristic attitude and did whatever they wanted. When you have a question they would refer you to your neighbor because they had no idea what they were doing and had no answers for any of their employees.
bad,"When I first started they have a 2-3 week training course which is an absolute waste of time . The girl that was training us had been just a regular convergys consultant & talked on & on about her personal life , you really won't get a feel for the job till you're out on the floor . It is so competitive & I was part of the hbo/stars/showtime team but they have it to where you have to try at least 3 times to persuade the caller not to cancel something, a lot of shady people will just add things to a customers package in order to get bonuses. Many of the upper level staff were incredibly immature & some on a power trip . There is good pay & u get to talk to people around the world who call but I would not recommend this job ."
bad,Having a different schedule everyday sometimes just 12 hours apart can chase away your employees. Worst part is most of the time you are given broken rest days..
bad,If you are fresh out of school and want to build a resume this is the place to go.  Don't count on raises.  If you are a seasoned professional... stay away.  This is a pay by minute company.  If you are late getting back from lunch because you were stopped by a  co-worker in need of assistance... Oh well.. no money for you.  A whole new meaning to micro-managing.  Pay is substandard.
bad,"I was a customer service representative, at the AT&T call center. I loved working, and assisting customers with reason for their call. Assisting customers paying their bill over the phones, explanation of their bill and all charges on their bill. When in training, I was taught to do certain things, and when you got out of training, and would do the things you were taught in training you would get written up/fussed at for doing those things. Extensive training was helpful, but I don't think they should have taught us to do things knowing we were going to get in trouble for them once we got out onto the floor taking calls."
bad,To much and all over the place. The people are nice but they are no together and very childish. I would never work there again. not up front about alot of things
bad,Answer estimated of 35 calls a day to activate customers with there Onstar system in any GM Vehicle located in Canada or the US. While answering these calls we will activate and try to sell customers extra months to as our incentive also will help customers with any problems they have.
bad,"It's a call center so it's a lot of sitting and answering calls. Fast paced, high stress, long hours. No sense of fulfillment. Has a high turnover rate."
bad,"I have found this place to be a constant 40 hr a week place and yes a ""constant"" pay check IF you can get through the yearly stress of the ""contract renewal"" stress. I think they put a lot on the employees to have to take on that should be handled at a corporate level and shouldn't put it on the floor level employees to handle such stressors - it makes it harder to handle your calls and job in the mannerisms that are expected. Providing the continuous updates and reminders were good, but not the constant threat of one's job!"
bad,"The atmosphere of the company is good."
bad,"Not a great company to work for. Long hours not a lot of days off. Depending on campaign, very high pressure. Have spent 4 weeks there and am struggling to see a light at the end of the tunnel."
bad,"Its a good working environment but no chance for advancement or pay increases, some of the most friendly people you will ever have the chance of working with"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"used to be a very good company, no job satisfaction now."
bad,"Management was terrible, and didn't care. They only looked out for themselves.if you do work at a convergys or want to work at one, dont work at the one in valdosta. its terrible."
bad,"First let me say, if you're not ready to sale, then don't apply. Customer service is what they make this job out to be but it's not. It's strictly a sales job. When I first started working here it was a nice work environment but there is a lot of favoritism throughout the job. If you're a good seller then this job is good for you; if not don't waste your time. You literally have managers breathing down your neck all the time. There isn't any consistency. You're told one thing one day, the next day it's something different and then you get in trouble for it. By the way, if you fired don't try to apply for unemployment because they're known for fighting it. They tell you you get fired for one thing and you go to the office and they say that's not what was reported as to why you got fired. Again, be careful."
bad,My experience at concentric was very disorganized. They changed policy's every month that never was added into handbook. They only offer 30 days straight for maternity or any injury leave.
bad,"The work wasn't so bad once you graduate from the starting department (Subscriber) but the shifts are always late afternoon until midnight for people low in seniority - and it doesn't matter if you actually can't work a specific day or time, they schedule you for it anyway."
bad,"Job is good for anyone need to make a little above minimum wage , At home positions were available while I was working there . Working at home I felt was a more difficult task due to the fact that in order to get assistance you would need to type to the manager over a chat and the manager would be assisting over 10 people at a time."
bad,"Upon hire you are told you will receive your pharmacy tech license, this is not true. Once you complete training you receive a trainee licence, then you are told that you must pay to have the further licensing when they tell you upon hire they pay for it."
bad,"Working here was another great step up, but still a low class position with very little opportunities for advancement. Overall, cutbacks became too heavy to deal with."
bad,"Assist customers with payments, trouble shooting, billing issues, upgrades, and orders. I also also transferred members in order to add lines and stop cancellations."
bad,"The job required sales of membership/platinum, depositing timeshares and adding protection when vacation was confirmed. The quotas that were required made it stressful and I was advised by my supervisor to lie to the customer about being a former member of RCI so that I could relate my experience to them. That is wrong! There was too much pressure to make sales. When I was hired I was told the requirements but understood that it was offers and not sales that were important."
bad,"I had high hopes working here. There was a ping pong table, a popcorn machine, and great potential. I got a promotion in three months. The job was pretty simple and low stress. However, the culture was terrible and I received no benefits (and had to quit after getting into a car crash because of a points system for attendance). The supervisors were like grown teenagers. Multiple people on my team were caught stealing from the company who contracted us. I hated coming in especially because of the awful schedules."
bad,"I don't have a whole lot of good to say about Convergys. I did have some great trainers that made sure I was fully prepared for the position. "
bad,"Working for Convergyswant the best experience, but it wasnt the worst either.Working there I learned to stay to myself. Management was so professional, hopefully that has changed. Culture it was a little ethnic. Hardest part of the job was to maintain a positive attitude becase the job its self was mentally draining. I absolutely enjoyed nothing about working here."
bad,"The worst management to work with. Does not care about their employees. God forbid they have a personal life. You're expected to be there and be working, can't even go to the washroom without management calling you out in front of other employees. It's disgusting how they treat their employees."
bad,"I worked at Convergys full-time"
bad,"For the most part, working with Concentrix was challenging because there never seemed to be a clear-cut process to carry-out changes and communicate them with employees. Even people on the immediate leadership roles are not provided enough communications so that information on changes can be properly disseminated.  Examples include adjustments of incentives/bonuses without prior discussion, changes of schedules without prior or sufficient notice, broken promises when it comes payout of delayed incentives and the sheer difficulty in getting answers secured when escalating agents' issues."
bad,"management issue "
bad,"Resonable people to work for, just typical call center contract job. Very disorganized, managers are constantly hastled by their bosses. just all aruond bad experience"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,fun and energetic management is poor and they play a lot of favoritism. doesn't go off of seniority. they move you ahead when you not ready force change
bad,"Was a very unprofessional atmosphere, unprofessional personal relationships between workers and management , favortism, no growth opportunities no benefits"
bad,"Ottimo lavoro di team."
bad,"Concentrix was more concerned with the needs of their client not their employees. They also had MANY issues with payroll and with policy & procedure. There was no recourse for the employees, otherwise, it would be a great place to work."
bad,the hardest part of the job was the schedule. I had rotating shift so I had a hard time balancing life and work. But I enjoed working in Convergys because of my workmates and workplace culture.
bad,Very fun down to earth work environment. plenty of opportunities to grow with the company. great teamwork. Great learning experience about Nike.
bad,"you will experience lot of applicants applying for CSR position, midshift, you have to finish work and send report before end of day, extend more hours"
bad,"While this job is not that hard and it is fairly good payed (taking into consideration work that you have to do) it is not suitable for somebody who wants to learn and progress. People are relaxed and friendly which helps a lot to adjust to the place. Training was not so good, transparency in company does not exist (by my standards) and there is poor organisation of work there."
bad,"In terms of contact centre work, I would say it is one of the worst I have ever worked at. The fact it is an outsourcing company makes it a lot worse as they have targets to meet from PayPal themselves. But not to speak too negatively, it is a contact centre and most seem to give bad results from long term workers, as it gets very repetitive."
bad,Job had very flexible hours. Great people and a lot of support for questions on the floor. Upper management made too many changes and flipped jobs around as more of a trial and error. Had a problem with supervisors quitting on a whim and having the sales team run the company more than upper management.
bad,"Fun workplace with great people and management. However sales is their main focus, above customer satisfaction and pitching the sale is a must. Breaks are timed and very short. I myself was not comfortable with this and moved on quite quickly.  You may not have the same experience. Hope this helps."
bad,Overall not a career- type position. My team leader and team was great but upper management was not kind to employees. Morale was usually low and people would leave in the middle of a shift nearly every day.
bad,"My first full time job; and it was awful. The part of convergys I worked for was under AT&T. We would help customers with there bills and not much else. For basically everything else you would have to transfer them to a different department, you would then get in trouble for transferring if you do it to much. The issue comes with business accounts, unified/combined bills, Technical issues, Orders placed through Opus, Cancellation and Retention, etc... You had to transfer for those and so many more. An ATT customer can spend hours just holding, because of ATT's segregation. You would then have to push Directv and a tablet onto the customer or else your job is under threat. Not to mention that the HR department functions soley on rumors and hear/say.  Careful who you talk to, and what you say. To leave off on a postive note, my co-workers were wonderful, just fantastic people. I enjoyed all of my managers except for the one from OTT. The people were great, some of the customers too! However, the upper managment was more focused on numbers than humans, the work was easy, but tedious; and all it took was a rumor to put my head on the chopping block. Definitely an easy job with great co-workers, just go in with very low expectations about the way things function."
bad,I really enjoyed working at Minacs with the people. The staff and management were always good to me however i felt like they chose favorites. The abuse from the dealerships was never taken into consideration especially when staff were taking time off for stress leave which i found was not fair. Bathrooms were very unhygenic to the point where the ministry of health should of went in. Over all the work place environment was very comforting.
bad,"Great job, nice people, good pay for what you do. I'd say for $11 an hour that it is a good job if you like to sit there and take calls all day the only issue is training can take 3 weeks before going on the floor."
bad,"Mandatory over times almost everyday. Mandatory rest day overtime. Problems with the salary. Problems with the new management, they dont know how to take care of their people."
bad,"Lack of leadership, which gets worse and worse at higher levels. Managed by people who have never actually performed the jobs or received the training of the staff they are expected to manage and coach. Failure in the communication chain to take any advice or feedback from first line employees actually interacting with customers. Compensation is not competitive, but supposedly bolstered by bonuses that are rarely paid out due to system issues and dis-qualifiers. Advancement forfeits bonuses and is discouraged."
bad,"Convergys could care less about there employees.  They looked at us as a dime a dozen."
bad,"When dealing with the supervisors as well as customers at Convergys, I was able to fine tune the way I react to somewhat stressful situations. It taught me how to ignore someone's tone of voice or change in attitude and just continue to do my job rather than to let the negativity affect my own attitude."
bad,"You would highly develop your people skills and customer care approach. A day at Concentrix, Belfast is quite stressful, demanding and not so much pay back in regards to payrise, career development , R& R or any job benefits."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"It's a fair place to work if you like talking on phones all day. Overall, the company and higher up's are very unorganized. They have a way of making announcements and updates at the last minute. The way the job is structured, the pay should be higher but they do give raises every 3 months. They are also non flexible especially if you have children, family emergencies, or attending school. The Team leaders and Performance coaches were okay. I didn't have any issues with them and always kept it professional. By the time I left the place, I built professional relationships with all of my teammates and most importantly, I connected with them."
bad,"Poor help from higher up once on the floor, benefits were working from home with a set schedule and paid training.  Hardest part was putting in notes before ending your current call or the next one came in which was very quick."
bad,"my review says it all management wasnt organized too many corrupted managers and supervisers  the job was easy, I loved doing customer service but, wasnt happy with management if we complained we could have gottn fired"
bad,"Job overall was fairly decent. If I had to choose to work there for a lifetime, I would not enjoy it. Hours was okay. And pay was also. I enjoyed my coworkers the most."
bad,Convergys no longer cares about their customers and only cares about meeting the sales goals. The management does nothing but make sure your'e attempting to sell tv service when youre supposed to be assisting with cellphone accounts.
bad,"A typical day at work is very loud, obnoxious and distracting. My training classmates have caused me to search for new jobs. The management does their job as far as I can see, but the people in my training class are very disrespectful, childish, immature, loud and obnoxious and I felt like I was back in high school. A fellow coworker and I had to stoop to the level of high school by making a sign and taping it to our chair to get the attention of the trainer because our trainer wouldn't acknowledge our hands being raised, when the trainer would acknowledge the people yelling her name across the room. I am an adult and choose not to work in this type of environment. I am choosing to resign and go back to my warehouse field as a supervisor. The sad thing is, I really like what I am doing at Minacs. I love the job itself, but the coworkers make it extremely hard and VERY uncomfortable to work in.I am a committed worker, I drive 73 miles one way to work at minacs, but I will be putting in my 2 weeks notice on this Monday coming up, being I have another job lined up already."
bad,working at concentrix is great company the work you do is great. the con's are having trouble getting a full paycheck. and also vacation time you don't earn a lot .
bad,"Working here brought me valuable work experience, but due to the poor pay and stresses from the work and conditions in which you work, has led to a more stressful home environment. I would not recommend this place to anyone seeking a chance to grow or reach a higher goal. Being told to lie to consumers and all around operate outside basic ethical behavior by supervisors, as well as very poor compensation for the amount of work performed. has led me to seeking other employment."
bad,Working here was a good experience. I was able to refine my customer service skills. It was an eye opening experience. An opportunity with a lasting impact.
bad,The trainers were nice but point system sucks and if you don't pass a test they let you go. I liked it. I talked to customers for Directv and went over their bills with them.
bad,its ok but sometimes you feel like you do not get paid enough for what is required of you. its nice to experience but get out if you dont enjoy being on the phone all the time
bad,"Management cared about its employees, but only because they knew how hard the job was, who we were serving, and when we were preforming our jobs. Poor hours and schedules that wouldn't flex made things very difficult."
bad,"After a few years of working alongside some excellent people, my time has come to fly the nest so hoping to find a new challenge...."
bad,I did not like working here as it is a lot like APAC. They hire anyone and do not care what those people know. I thought it would be a good expierence to get into higher end Technical Support positions but I could not stand working here. No one knew what they were doing (including the supervisors.) They underpaid my entire team the first two paychecks and they didn't seems to have eagerness to fix it.
bad,Management doesnt help you if you are struggling they just make you feel bad about what your doing. When hired they promise yo all this money in bonuses but dont tell you that you have to score pretty close to perfect on all stats so the smallest slip gets you nothing. So frustrating to work there
bad,Job requires a lot of sitting and good listening skills as well as a good knowledge of the systems. The Team Leaders are understanding. Job is fairly easy as long as you know how to talk on the phone.
bad,"The treatment is like your a toddler and you can not have ANYTHING on your desk.  You can not put up reminders as you can not have anything to write with and your constantly under they eyes of people who tell you how to do your job but have never or rarely ever took a phone call or a chat.  There is never enough people to help with your question and the team leads refuse to take a supervisor call but tell non supervisors to do it."
bad,"Solely focusing on the actual job role itself, actionfraud at concentrix is great and really interesting, but the hassle from HR isn't worth it. From forcing an entire workforce to sign new contracts and restart their probation for no reason, to taking promised bank holidays away less than 3 weeks before they are due, to blatant transphobia, to sacking people for struggling with the job when no one was given any coaching in over 6 months, it's a horrible environment. The only thing that makes it worth staying is your co-workers."
bad,"There was a lot of inappropriate behavior between managers and agents. It was an extremely unprofessional environment, computers and/or materials needed for work were not suitable: they were always broken. Overtime was added to my schedule unwillingly after already working a 12 hour day with scheduled overtime. (this was not mandatory overtime). The list goes on."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"My day at work is great I love talking to people I'm a very patient smiling very energetic person. I have learned if you get a out rate person, just listening and saying I understand what you saying means a lot."
bad,Convergys is a very unpredictable they blame every management decision they make on there contract owners when it is actually them making the decisions. Very unpredictable hours on a weekly basis and at times hours change during days off and they do not call you to inform you about these changes. They also approve vacation days then without notice with withdraw these days the day before even if it is scheduled after a day off so you have no access to there internal scheduling system . the hardest part of this job is not actually handling the daily calls its from constantly being disrespected by management authorities they don't treat employees with respect unless you get high sales then you can get away with dong whatever you want on
bad,"Last worked here in 2013. Had been there appox. 6months, Left to accept a Gov't term position which paid a lot more (who wouldn't do that, really?)"
bad,great coworkers bad management easy job sh*tty environment this place would be great if the treated employees as investments instead of recyclables waiting on  garbage day
bad,"- HR Benefits is delayed on updates and you has to make thorough follow-up."
bad,"A typical day at Minacs is very busy. And loud. I learned a lot of great customer service skills while employed there, however the job its self isn't one i recommend as a long term career for anyone. It's great if you need to make money of course. You start out making 11.60/hour then after 6 months move to 12.40/hour. You get medical benefits after 6 months and dental benefits after 12 months. The hardest part of the job is not having a mental breakdown. Regular shifts there are 9 and a half hours. And that's because the breaks and lunches aren't paid. Talking on the phone to rude people all day really take it's toll on you."
bad,"Convergys is suppose to be a very good company to work for. From what I understood there are room for advancement providing you meet certain criteria within your initial job task. Human Resources are very organized when taking you through the hiring process. It all depends on the company's client program you elect to join, which can be either favorable or unfavorable."
bad,Minacs is a very busy organization who would rather send you out the door than help you to better yourself. Their employee turn around rate is exceptionally high and I can imagine their inability to keep employees is because of the work environment.  Staff are asked to work exceptionally long hours with little to no room for error.
bad,"I enjoy the work just not the politics of the business"
bad,"This Back office postion has allowed me to grow in areas such as Leadership devoplment, communication skills, and oranizational skills."
bad,Convergy's Philippines is a leading call center company in the Philippines. It is productive and fun with people who I was working with. The boss are so approachable to their people. The only thing that I could complain is the time of work. We need to work at night time always and our body clock changed.
bad,"I worked for this company under Humana healthcare. The environment is professional but the people you work with aren't. They come to work in sweatpants, and sit at their desk with blankets. Altercations are often, because co-workers don't care if you are on the phone, they will sit next to you cursing loudly, laughing, and doing whatever else while you are on a call. The point system is ridiculous. the points accumulate in increments of 0.25....if you are 1 minute late you get 0.25 points, if you are one hour late you get 0.25 points. If you call out sick it is a whole point. if you need time off, you an request it, but once your 5 hours of PTO (paid time off are gone) you will take the point. If you leave 3 hours into your shift it is a whole point. if you leave 3 hours before your shift is over you receive 0.75, 2 hours early =0.50 1 hour early 0.25"
bad,"typical day was taking calls, having system issues and losign pay since it's paid by the minute and the system wouldnt track it. losing about 5-15 minutes of pay a day."
bad,"It's an okay place to work to get the experience of being a call center representative. A lot of the workers are fresh out of high school and are very immature. If you are currently enrolled in school, the will not work around it. Depending on your department, there will be mandatory hours to complete. I would complete a year or a year and a half if you can make it and get out of there. Worse place. Very poor management."
bad,Phone calls back to back and customers rude. Hard to get help once on the floor.Training is great! Prepare you for the best and worst customes
bad,"A typical day at work includes answering phones for customers, light troubleshooting and dealing with a whole lot of bs from management. Training teaches you how to use the program we use but leaves a lot of holes for you to figure out on your own. The most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers and the worst is the favoritism from management."
bad,"The hardest part of the job is being uncertain of what the health care professional 's impression or assessment of me during each call.  It may be a satisfying call for me but the customer satisfaction still depends on the health care professional on how they view the call.   Delighting them is one thing but resolving the issue is another thing.  Another factor is that, there are different types of callers like the drivers, emotional, analytic.  I have to evaluate the type of caller that i speak with so i can adjust and please to the caller's type."
bad,"Although there is awalys employment available and possible moving up within the company, it has a high burn out rate due to the intense pressure and unreolistic expectations fro management. the call volumes were intense and caused many good people to go to other companies"
bad,"I've never worked at a company before where I felt as though I was jumping from crisis to crisis like I did with Concentrix. No consistency in management, people coming and going all the time. Little employee recognition and lower than average pay for the type of work, even for the Phoenix area. Always rumors of big changes for the better right around the corner that never seem to materialize. It's a fast growing company, but I think maybe the Tempe office is growing too fast and has a lack of leadership."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend hiring on since al they do is hire 100's of people and at the end of the enrollment period, they summarily start the process of letting people go."
bad,"customer solutions representative, tech support answering phones and assisting customers with resolving"
bad,"During training we would spend the day going over the job requirements.  We also practiced within the class and a couple of days ""on the floor,"" watching the employees work."
bad,"I worked from home in hopes to make things easier for myself and my family, and it made the situation more stressful for me since I continuously had health problems"
bad,love that they have ping pog an spin the will for agent wen there are doing there best. show that they care an appreciate our work
bad,"Working there you really felt like you were part of a team, but that is about the only thing you felt positively. At first they get you on the phones to answer calls and help customers. Then they tell you, you care too much and that you need to do less, but keep the callers happy. If you excelled too much they assumed that you were doing badly at your job so you had to balance this fine line of doing just enough, but not too much. A typical work day consisted of taking phone calls for 8hrs, with absolutely no break in between calls. I would not recommend the job to someone as a permanent place of employment, but just as a filler for someone who may be desperate."
bad,Good support from supervisors and managers as you begin your work there. Very fast paced environment and mentally exhausting though.
bad,"Every year, when client contracts are up, the departments terminate their  more senior employees. Unfortunately, Convergys' client (organizations/companies) do not renew their contracts each year with Convergys."
bad,"A typical day at this job was walking in to work lugging a backpack on your shoulders carrying everything that you will need for this day. I would sit down at my desk and pull anything out that I needed right away. I went though weeks of training to learn the multitude of things needed to perform my job and still didn't feel as if I knew all that I needed to know. I was placed on the phones working with customers who wanted to make changes to their tv service. The management was sometimes easily capable of locating but other times were away from their desks. Floor support was your access to leaving if you were unable to stay at work due to an illness or an emergency. Nine times out of ten you were told to remain in your seat and return to your calls if needed to leave due to sickness. You would be in a group chat with your team and team leader (management) but if not found at their desk, your best resource was the others on your team. My co-workers whom I was the closest with which were my team members were very helpful when it was possible. Taking calls back to back and doing everything to listen to the customer didn't provide much help for your team members when it was needed though. The hardest part of the job was keeping stats up at all times. If you took a break and went one or two minutes over due to a line at the bathroom then your stats would go down. If you were late coming back from lunch due to all of the microwaves being taken up with a line for each of them then your stats would go down. If you left your seat with no break or lunch period allowed but needed a bathroom"
bad,Working for minacs was ok. There was not much room for advancement and no stable management. I would work for the company again.
bad,"A typical day at work involved supervising my floor customer service reps and helping them resolve problems and answer questions that they had."
bad,Supervision was very incomplete and inefficient.  Poor attitudes among co-workers. Co-workers very uncooperative with providing task related assistance.
bad,"I worked for them for 3 years. Had a great time and worked long hours and hard for them, they shut down, fired everyone, and even though i was one of the last people to leave and they told me if they start up again i was going to be a first person to call back, i got called for interview 3 times and no response from them, not even a thanks and not even a call to let me know anything. I really needed a job and they put me out. They arent condsiderate at all. I am a  good receptionist and customer service rep. They miss out."
bad,Job promises benefits and job advancement but do everything they can to keep you in your position. Pay is decent if you happen to get paid on time and the correct amount.
bad,"fun place to work,decent environment managers are good good hours, decent pay. work life balance is not the best. recommendthis place"
bad,"Management is not as professional as they should be."
bad,Intense work invironment.  Out of a class of 30 new hires.  I lasted less than 3 months.  I was the 3 from last still working at that point.
bad,The company has no clue what they are doing. HR is a joke they don't care I tried to be their for the agents while the rest of my team couldn't care. They did mass layoffs all the time there was no job security for any one
bad,Never enjoyed working for this company. Didn't receive much assistance from the managers. Pay did not match the required work expected of you.

bad,"it was very flexible when being absent, not much pay. I was part time there most of the time. the job was not stressful. it was ok for college students. very little pay"
bad,There was three weeks worth of training that did not help with what the job details.
bad,"Collect on 3 party debt."
bad,"I've work for this company for almost two years. The training is great and people are nice."
bad,Local management is unethical and treat agents horrible. I have had to watch countless agents be yelled at like they were 2 year olds. If they don't like you they will get you to quit before they fire you so they don't have to pay unemployment. They also rig the commission reports so people they like get their awesome commission but the ones that EARNED it but they don't like can not get it.
bad,"A typical day was back to back calls with mostly unsatisfied customers. I learned how to trouble shoot phones. Management was always busy, Co works helped a lot, The hardest part of the job was the the trouble shooting."
bad,"Being a collections rep. at convergys, a typical day at work would be answering inbound calls regarding cable bills. although the calls are inbound what makes the job so stressful is trying to meet company quotes as well as try to give the customer the best customer service experience, but its hard when you are trying to take payments, listen to you customer ,as well as get constant pop ups and hollering from TL's telling you your call is over 4 minutes."
bad,customers and management suck its a decent way to earn money by doing nothing
bad,"Learn alote as a part of trade finance /BFSI domain."
bad,"They have terrible management. They don't value you as an individual, they treat you like just a number. They advertise job security, but then after a few months the project got shut down and the majority of us were not offered other positions. The people there were nice though."
bad,"Fun at work. Good team work and team mates. Unfortunately rotational shift which include 10:30 pm to 07:30 am. Wherein they have buffer time of 1 hr, that is half an hour before loggin and half an hour before log out."
bad,"The Organization was unstructured, it has a high turnover rate reflecting the organization poor leadership.  The organization had medical benefits and great bonus."
bad,"I worked for Minacs for about 6 months before finding a profession in my field. During these six months , I can not say that I was overly impressed with any part of Minacs. "
bad,"Trainers will tell you in training that you do not have to worry about selling that if you don't sell that it is OK, that is not true."
bad,The management does not understand individual's issues rather think only about company's financial aspect and over see the minor aspect that if an employee is not happy the full efforts can not be given.
bad,"Serious management issues, no due process and no real respect for employees - they come and go every day, and if you leave there will always be someone else to replace you, so no one really cares. On the other hand, really easy to get into, pays perfectly fine and if you can handle the frustration, it's pretty much impossible to get fired."
bad,This is the most ghetto job I've ever worked at. They hire ANYONE the team leaders are cool it's pretty hard to get fired from this job. You have to love change because something changes everyday it's like Highschool assigned seats but you don't get the same seat everyday so you sit where someone else left their trash.
bad,"Inbound calls sales"
bad,"Training is great but it can be a bit overwhelming because there is so much that you have to learn. I loved my manager he was always helpful but a lot of the other managers were extremly hateful! On top of that the enviorment was awul it! I had somebody try to fight me because I did not want to attend their pizza party on my off day. Not every body up there is completly awul though i did meet some really amazing people who i am still friends with now that I don't work there. The hardest part of the job is dealing with those immature people that want to make your job hard. I also have high blood pressure and have to take water pills so I make frequent trips to the restroom. I had been communicating with my manager about this to see what I needed to do to get everything taken care o so that I didn't get in trouble for it and beore he got back to me I was being pulled into the site directors office, on a late friday night, being told that if I didnt get them a drs note by the next day I worked ,which was sunday I would be terminated. My doctors office is closed on weekends. The only reason they did not terminate me is because the next time I came to work I informed my site director that I quit taking my medicine and that the reason I was put on it was because my blood pressure was so high that I was at risk of having a stroke so instead o terminating me he took away my breaks. I did enjoy talking with some of the customers though, There were some really amazing customers that touched my heart. I was not happy about the way things ended at Convergys. They have a program where if"

bad,"This company has no concern for end customer's satisfaction, only their own script and their own agenda. Unfair and unethical practices with employees and customers. Supervisors and managers with little or no experience."
bad,"i really didnt like this job.they dont work with your life outside of work as far as doctor appointments and the fact that you have kids, or school  and may need to come in late or not come in due to emergency.they are based off a point system."
bad,"Horrible working conditions, computers and headsets not cleaned, multiple ear infections as well as pneumonia working for the company"
bad,"Inconsistent, Lack of structure, Love my colleagues. Love Helping and teaching others."
bad,Too much confusion. Cannot find no one to help you when a problem occurs.
bad,"The experience was quite humbling. I like dealing with the customers. However, more needs to be done with management. One month they want you to sell, sell, sell and they are quick to write people up and fire people who do not sell. On the other hand they want you to take care of the customer but do not provide you with all of the necessary tools to do so. I call it more of a micromanagement malpractice and hearing from past coworkers Management there is terrible. Other than that. They do provide mediocre benefits. I tried to go to the doctor one time though and they would not take my health plan and it was one of the most expensive ones too. Waste of benefits. Also, The incentives for selling the products and the compensation is bare minimal maybe 3-5% commission at most. There is a chance to make a lot of money there is you are an amazing salesperson but if you are one who just wants to resolve issues do not waste your time applying. When I see a posting for Convergys and my friends ask me if its a good place to work I say its good for temporary employment. Also, its not much room to advance within the company. The wages are terrible too most you could make there is 10.50 an hour as a tenured agent but at the one in Charlotte you can make up to 15 an hour. Heard the one in Charlotte was more professional but the one in Hickory needs way more work done to it. Better yet needs to be tore down from the top down instead of from the bottom up."
bad,The job requirements were simple but finding a solution to a customers issue was more of a task. Felt like there wasn't enough training to prepare you for what was expected.
bad,"I went into this position with high spirits, and all that I've accomplished is hating my job. During training, they make you think that you are going to be part of a close-knit team, but once you get out on the floor, you find that it's the opposite. Sure, the management working there are very nice, but they don't do much to try to improve your work skills. The team leads that are supposed to coach you and help you with your progress on the floor avoid you pretty much. In all the time I've worked there, I have not had a single coaching, and whenever I had one scheduled, it was either cancelled or overlooked. Not to mention that the vast majority of the calls received are patients calling to scream at you because their drugs are being held up by either the doctor, insurance, or pharmacy themselves. But of course, everything is your fault, and you can't get upset or try to defend yourselves."
bad,"This was an ok place to work. We got paid a little less then those working on the same project at different centers. Our leadership was never relay on the same page. Advancement was pretty easy to come by. The reason I really didn't like this place is that they are closing down the center and gave us only 60 days to find new jobs, and knew this was closing down long before we were told. They are putting almost 400 people out of work, and still have the audacity to ask us to do overtime."
bad,On a typical day representatives handle hundreds of call depending on the customers needs. Some calls require a little empathy but on certain days you would not get no calls for a couple hours due to the system updating.
bad,"Minacs is a good company for those that need a job not a career.  Management does not care about their workers. "
bad,"Despite having been part of two top performing projects at Convergys, both were ultimately shut down and outsourced to other sites nationally and internationally."
bad,Maintained specific performance requirements without allowing time to adequately resolve concerns.
bad,"One of the biggest challenges:The location paid the lowest wage for customer service in that immediate business district.  We couldn't compete to draw in top talent."
bad,"Convergys is like a high school, or mainly for high school people. They fight like childish people. And some of the team leads talk about the workers when they think that they're not around. I would only recommend working there if your extreme need of money."
bad,"Worst management mostly, a few gems. they promote people who may have technical base but don't now how to deal with a team. Care absolutely NOTHING about employees & treated as wage slaves.But still with all this flaws have a great time due to some people you meet here are great, I have made many friends.Technically a lot of things u can learn ."
bad,"Typical day consists of non-stop calls, on slow days there's maybe 2 minutes in between calls, summer is slower. You get hounded about every little thing you do and say, unless of course they ""like"" you or you're a kiss-up. Many of the TLs I liked but quite a few seem like they come to work just to write people up. I learned that I don't want to work in a call center again. We have no assigned desks so if the person before you was sick you'll be too, or if they left their food and crumbs you have to clean it or find a new seat, that is if you can find a working phone and computer at the same desk. There are many nice customers, but I have been yelled and disrespected on numerous occasions and all I can do is take it and help them. They say no scripts, but that's bs, there's a set call flow and ways to say what you're supposed to say. If someone calls and asks ""Hey, quick question, do you take discover card?"" they want one answer and to go, but you still have to go through this whole spiel and call flow asking their name and and try to chat it up with them, or else be criticized on it. But in the mean time all you've done is irritate someone with a simple question. So that to me is a script. My coworkers were the best part, that is until some of them got promoted & 20 and 22 year old let the power get to their heads and try to write you up for any and every little thing you do just because they can. Some team leader were all about their team, then others were all about making themselves look good & would walk around more so to find things to get you in trouble for, but take forever"

bad,"Typical day at work was logging into the phones to start the shift and logging off at the end. dealt with customer cellphone related issues in a courteous, clear, and helpful manner resolving all issues."
bad,• Answering inbound calls for the Post Office to track and confirm customer's packages.
bad,"At Convergys I worked full-time as a customer service agent on an AT&T project they have and was completely stressed out the whole time. I'm not too sure how they do things on other projects/departments but as soon as I started working there I realized why they have such a high turnover rate. The work environment is horrible and the actual job responsibilities is stressful. Sometimes I would find myself in need of a supervisor for help but would find out that they're missing. Most of the people they hire are of low-quality and in desperate need of a job. Many are ghetto and are (what I call) ""hoodrats"". Some of them are nice and talkative but I often times found myself a witness to many arguments and threats as if I worked at a BK on the northside. Some of the supervisors are the same except they've picked up on a few shortcuts and ways to go undetected."
bad,"Aditya Birla is a good company to start. Gives you access to different campaigns to work for, preferred insurance rates and basic health/dental. That is about it. The management for my location is mostly interested in the monthly/yearly bonus. Not very professional, are not part of the company to help but jumping to criticize. There is a gap between employees and management which no one is trying to mend."
bad,good pay in a college town but low pay considering the type of work being done. the call center cycled through employees (annual attrition of over 400%). Reps who can take it have a decent chance to advance.
bad,"It’s not a bad place to work, but if you’re ambitious and have goals to advance this may not be the place.  The jobs are stagnant and there’s not much room to grow as attrition is high.  The managers and upper management were great there.  Ultimately it wasn’t for me.  The campaign I worked for had unmanageable performance requirements.  It seemed the tenured agents( who had higher performance requirements) were pushed out as they didn’t meet requirements so there was a need for new training classes constantly but never a need for advancement of agents into supervisory roles due to not having a large enough staff for new supervisors"
bad,"As a call center, I went in with my eyes open that it's not an easy job. However, the management and confusion surrounding employee policies made this job very difficult to handle. If you have to balance children, or any other extenuating circumstance that may make difficult to do a flex schedule, know that it will be very difficult. They make promises at hiring they sometimes cannot deliver and only one HR employee for the entire building who also is busy with other locations. It pays well and you will get hours but it is not for everyone."
bad,"I worked here for 4 yrs. 2.5 yrs were great but then it got worse everyday. Management doesn't know how to talk, they are rude, demeaning and insulting. If you have a self respect then it's not the right place for you."
bad,"Recently it got easier to make bonus but the pressure is constantly on to make sales, doesn't matter what the customer needs or wants as long as you sell something. Shift patterns are horrendous and although you're meant to know your shifts 3 weeks in advance it has happened several times in the 2 years I've been there that they weren't published or changed last minute. Always asking for overtime but won't pay you more for it."
bad,"There are managers (really only one) that felt they were overly important, always reminding you that they were in management and could make life difficult. Very much a bully and inappropriate."
bad,"offer staff same discounts as EE staff & allow more time off from phones to train on new products & offers which would improve sales & bonuses Also there appeared to be a CLICK within the management team where certain people rose through the company & did little work, refused to take managers calls when asked telling me to ask what the customer expected & offering creditor refunds rather that taking the call"
bad,"I work at the GM Tech center.. been with this company almost 2 years. And there are 3 big issues with it...."
bad,There is the claim they understand mental health issues. The work isn't hard but the people in charge don't care about the damage it does to your motivation and people skills.
bad,There seems to be a need to suck-up to managers to be considered for a promotion. Work performance is acknowledged but if you call out certain improper work practices (professionally and using the right venue) it can be taken against you.
bad,"I don't know how else to say it, but here goes. They'll tell you it's a great job, but they lie. It's terrible. The only good thing about it is the pay. The customers are rude, the management doesn't care, and the floor support hardly ever supports."
bad,"Aswering 30-40 calls a day with irate customers. I learned that even if people could not pay their bills we were instructed to try to upsell to entertainment options. Management changed hands quite often and one particular manager insisted on playing vulgar rap music at a high volume making it hard to hear the customer, I even had customers complain. If you did not meet your upsell quota daily you were threatened with your job.Getting to know my customers and felow employees"
bad,"Decided to try since it was incredibly close to me. The problems became apparent just as soon as I started “training”. Zero order in the classroom. You spend the first week learning more about the client’s history than the actual troubleshooting process you’re responsible for. Also, the hiring managers blatantly lie about pay incentives. I was told you get a bonus for successful troubleshooting over the phone. It turns out that it’s a team effort and that bonus only happens if the whole floor is able to hit a quota. Massive yikes."
bad,"Oh boy where to start.....training class and trainer herself were very fun and informative, great floor support in nesting, then you go to the main floor where it all goes south..no floor support, unfair customer surveys where you get the blame for customers hating on the company, customers who don’t know an iPhone from their rear ends, quality dept who always has something to pick on you about even when you’re doing well, equipment constantly breaking down, answers to customers inquiries not always easy to find.....frankly I’m about done with this place, looking for other work"

bad,"Really need to value their employees, Did not like the ending of the program and what it defines. The most enjoyable moment was the co- workers and working as a team together to get the job done,"
bad,If you have a disability they are supportive here.  This is a call centre environment it is a stepping stone company if you want to work for a major call centre.
bad,I believe that I learned alot at this job. I learn how to really keep to myself and it's ok to ask for help when needed with out being judge. I learned team work will really make a dream work.
bad,I use to work at Convergys now CNX. I am not so appreciative with how management deal with people with disabilities. All my sick leaves are backed up with medical documents yet they tagged me as non- rehireable.
bad,"During my time it started out pretty great."
bad,They hired 50 agents in Nov - Dec for an account and in April after tax season was over we were all terminated. Said they didn't have postions. They promised my whole team and training class were would be kept on after season but EVERYONE was let go with either two days notice or end of shift notice that you are unemployed.
bad,The co workers are great people to be around but the turnover rate is so high you can't make friends. It's hard to plan with your family because the work schedule changed every 3 to 4 months.
bad,Was only in training and never completed.  All co-trainers were very nice and friendly.  Trainer was very helpful and knowledgeable in his field.  Very friendly atmosphere.
bad,"You are an inbound call agent for OnStar, primarily, though Toronto Star is also on site, but hired based on need. Learned to handle subscriptions, and account features. Management is handled by both Concentrix and OnStar. Some crew day events, like potlucks... The hardest part of the job is having your job rely on the computers, so when there are technical issues, you must advocate for the company before the customer to maintain their loyalty, and handling at least 100 customers a day per agent. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you place the customer on hold or when there is training."
bad,"unorganized work environment, lack of communication in leadership, fast paced work environment, lack of good food options, sparactic schedules and goal metrics"
bad,"St Louis Convergys In Hazelwood is trash high school all over , mangers has attidues , don't fix your points , can't be late or that's .5 points never again"
bad,"While the training for my department came from an excellent teacher, and I felt well prepared to start my job, there was a roulette approach not only to the schedule, which changed so frequently it was almost impossible to maintain a sleep schedule, but also the management for teams. "
bad,The managers there like to treat the facility and staff as if it were a daycare... they tell us what not to do and turn right around and do it... The people in charge are always are yelling while you're hosting a professional conversation on the phone or leaving a voice mail. They will belittle you and make you feel as if you are less than simply because you are just an agent.
bad,"Working as an agent at Convergys wasn't very interesting and I rarely left feeling like I had had a good day at work. My direct managers were pretty awesome, but not everyone was quite so lucky. Pay wasn't super great, but it was enough for the time I was there."
bad,"Never Liked the work environment. In the interview, they say that there will be no sales. there will only be incoming calls. But when you start taking calls, they put a lot of sales pressure."
bad,You better know your material! Sales incentive is whack unless you have the right pitch or work in another dept and work overtime for those sales depts.
bad,The management here is not the best.Checks are cut short if at all. Operations Manager talk to you any way and does not care if you get paid or not. No sick days.
bad,"I liked this job because we could engage with our classmates and it was a work from home job. If they make an error in your check, they will take so long to respond and give you the run around like I am going through right now. I worked on a thrusday and they put down that i didn't work on that day. I've went through everyone and I still don't have an accurate response about my pay and its been 4 weeks. So until this day I'm getting the run around about a day that I've worked and the trainer still hasn't responded to me so yeah be careful with this job because if they miss a day you will be waiting a long time for them to correct your check."
bad,Alright place to work. Need better management and trainers. But overall alright. The team leads are not very professional. They need to have classes on how to be a team lead and managers as well.
bad,"if you dont plan on staying here forever and need a stepping stone to build you experience., this is a great place to be. Looking at this job as your career, this isnt the job for you. AT ALL!!!"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"No career growth, maybe its just the account that I was in. People stay bec of the people not bec of what their earning but the environment itself. Crab mentality management."
bad,Highly unlikely to refer to peoplei know. They strive in just filling seat. They lack employee engagement. The employees are not filtered based on work experience
bad,"I need a job that I do not have to worry about losing everyday. I like to take time with my customers. Make sure I was giving them the right information. That takes time. The job is too stressful. Micro managed. You are constantly evaluated through daily stats and listened in calls. I worried everyday about my job to the point that it effected health and moral. I have never had a job so demanding."
bad,"This job is only about body count and statistics for Convergys, to what end I don't know. There is no concern whatsoever for the companies they hold contracts with. It's all about numbers. Everything is micromanaged. If it walks and breathes and can hold a phone it's hired. I think the type of people they hire are the cause of much of the problems they have. People do not matter. Employees are cattle. I don't think they have to worry about perks or benefits, most people aren't there long enough to get them. The good people won't stay due to the general environment. As for the folks that don't care at all, there's a new batch every week. I unfortunately was desperate for work so I'm stuck til I can find a job that wants a responsible, qualified person without an ongoing  criminal record. Sadly for this area this is one of the higher paying jobs with benefits, but in the long run it's not worth it for anyone who really enjoys working. It's not enough you have to talk to angry people for 8 solid hours, the company strives to make the environment unbearable. You only have value if you show up. And that is your only value as an employee. If you don't, its just one more seat they need to fill. I've seen people walk out or not show up for a week. They don't even notice until their numbers start dropping in a particular area. I've yet to hear anyone ask about someone missing, they just tell the rest they have to work harder to make the numbers look better."
bad,was a good place to work minus the enviorment. much like high school. training is a breeze but once you make it to the floor the team leader will expect more.
bad,"the workplace is very uptight. and it doesnt help with the customers that are a bit difficult. other than that it's a good shop! but that it's what you want to hear, yet its not the truth. and i say that as what i really wanted to say that that workplace is a bit toxic and i wouldnt recommend going there"
bad,I was too much negative energy and no consideration. I enjoy the customer and being able to help. and it made you come to work to make money and leave and make sure my job is complete.
bad,Convergys is good to get started with work from home I do not recommend long term employment with them. They train well but the positions they put you in con be stressful due to the lack of communication you received from management. I learned alot but was happy to move on to something else.
bad,"The site I worked at was shut down within three years of Convergys' purchase of Stream. Many incentives and benefits were severely reduced or removed completely."
bad,We were only given fifteen minute break in the morning and fifteen minute break in the afternoon. We can use this time to refresh ourselves or get some water/drinks.
bad,The job itself is easy just very mind stimulating (not in a good way) The worse part is getting yelled and cursed at over the phone for something you had nothing to do with.
bad,"Taking inbound calls for OnStar, and following call flow for customer dispositions "
bad,"They run on contacts, and those contacts were slowing pulling out. I was laid off, which is not a big deal. But the lack of communication with the employees, and lying to the employees to keep them was not okay."
bad,"poor management"
bad,"Coming in and working day to day is just fine. Just like a lot of jobs today they lure you in with benefits then when you try to use one they get all up in arms and upset. "
bad,Just wasn't for me.  To much sitting in one place.  Hrs were flexible.  View of the highway wasn't very nice. Supervisors were friendly.  Break room was huge.
bad,Convergys is only concerned with you coming to work and doing what they say and when they say. They will not try and work with employees who try to go to school and better themselves. They do not care about unexpected life issues that may occur. I was let go from Convergys after I was in a car accident and was ordered by my doctor to stay out from work and to not drive because of the medications I was prescribed. I let them know the situation immediately and my team leader at the time said she would let the managers know because it would make me exceed points of attendance. when I was cleared to return to work they allowed me to work hours and then told me I was being let go and that I could leave.
bad,"training is horrible and unorganized. Leads are not very helpful it's definitely a learn it yourself job. You'll get in trouble for things never taught to you lol but other than that its easy job and great place to work on customer service skills. You may even learn a thing or two about taxes lol they have a blind leading blind kinda sucks but if you can manage learning it all yourself then you'll be fine, eventually. "
bad,"Typical day is 11 hours long with 2 x 30 minute breaks and 2 x 15 minutes. No compassion for employees. Managers are all managers due to the fact they have a friend of senior authority... as they saying goes, its not what you know its who you know."
bad,"Job had ups and downs during the time I was there. Sometimes felt very valued and others very uncared for. Wage is just above minimum, enough to make ends meet"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"If your able to get into system, you will deal with about 150 calls a day repeating the same thing to each customer you deal with. Meanwhile they nitpick the females for dress code while the MALE team leads are walking around with sagging pants."
bad,"it was a fun experience but i dont recommend this company to others"
bad,Need better management; better work environment; safer environment; Better pay for associates that work at home. and more affordable benefits for them
bad,This job is full of drama. Employees having affairs with supervisors. Everyone here is so young its too much drama. HR do not get the checks right. You will not like this job at all
bad,Management is horrendous and disorganized. Pay is atrocious. Benefits are a joke. People I work with are phenomenal but everything else there is subpar.
bad,"The company handles Foreign products, it is good, but limited to career advancement. Some Management people doesn't have good work ethics and needs to be seen by the higher management. Employee benefits should also be given emphasis since, most of the employees doesn't have enough education and need to be back up."
bad,"Hours very, your days off are fixed, management picks favorites, they push sales more than customer service, mandatory overtime, hour lunch, it is a secure job"
bad,"I was sales and retentions for ATT through convergys, they had multiple departments open and close during the time I was there, they go on periodic firing binges when they are looking for a reason to get rid of you."
bad,A lot of complaining from employees. Everything is scrutinized to the tee. Not much fun things go on so employees can have a good experience at work. Pay is stagnant.
bad,When I started there it was absolutely a great place to work with but throughout the years of being there it went from going in and helping to nothing
bad,"Productive , good environment , friendly people . "
bad,the management has favorites. They dont work well with your life schedule. I had a pay day come and they shorted me 38 hours. Just need to have more stability.
bad,"I think concentrix was a company that lacked stability. There where multiple times i was unpaid or my pay was shorted, and when asking management they always seemed un concerned about assisting me. Overall a shady company that did not appear to care about employee concerns."
bad,Too much workload too little income. Company is good but doesn't have much regards to its employees which is contrary to what they are advertising. Working environment is too stressing.
bad,Constant change. contracts are always ending so have to learn a new line of business. I  believe this one way they could keep salaries low. Constant shift bids. Too many weekends and holidays. call flow could be non stop. I ran to 1 upper management person after they left the company who made this comment. Sometimes we treated you like cattle. (take that to the bank)
bad,"the higher management tend to put a lot of pressure of you to complete calls in 2 minutes or less . not enough focus on customers , the job seemed  rushed"
bad,Good place to start my career and I have learnt many skills. Work culture and environment was good. Team coordination was amazing. Great place to work here.
bad,"It was a work from home position that was temporary and did not exceed my expectations. Consumers were unpleasant and needy and I wanted a bigger challenge, I was bored fairly quickly."
bad,Job security is not there priority. This being a third party BPO they dont care for employee retention and they will just throw out employees when they dont need you
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,I really don't remember I know the managers sucked they had poor management skills and they didn't care about there employees if a customer was mad they would still force you to literally sell more stuff instead of trying to fix there problem
bad,"Does not appreciate people who go above and beyond to add value to the company. Is not fully transparent to its customers, its staff, and its management. Very greedy, does not really care about their employees. All are disposable and can be replaced! No desire to learn more about the specifics of a job and what it entails. Everyone covers their own *ss with disregard of who else might be impacted."
bad,Its a joy to work with the customers but I'm not to fond with working with the employers they are very unprofessional which is one reason I'm looking for another job
bad,"Its a fun place to work, and if your into sales its easy to do. When you get hired they pay for all the weeks they need to put you through training.they do have some good benefits. it just depends on what department you are in."
bad,"Intend to build a career in an organization that can help me to explore myself fully and realize my potential. Willing to work as a key player in challenging and creative environment."
bad,"This is a good place to start off your customer service career. Inbound call center, lots of calls. Great training provided. Not sure of chance to advance though, high turn over."
bad,"Decent people but bad policies. Healthcare very expensive, no raises after 10 years. Only way to make more money is take a contract that pays higher. Very hard to make bonuses. Solid work if meet performance guidelines."
bad,"When I worked there was a new manager who fancied herself a psychologist and I agreed with her passion for helping poeple help themselves, but there was a high level of detachment from the staff because of the turn over rate.  It was sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy though as it discouraged new employees from totally committing to the new job environment."
bad,"A typical outsourced service corporation.  Quantity instead of quality.  No individualization.  Relaxed environment,  Good benefits and competitive compensation."
bad,"I was grateful for the opportunity to add further experience to my resume. However, I felt they misrepresented who they were and what they were about."
bad,They did not provide us the proper tools to be successful in helping the consumers with their issues. Always had our systems shutting down on us in the middle of the work day.
bad,"The workplace is somewhat toxic and getting worse due to the issues with the current security policy. The Team Leaders are either apathetic or dismissive of the needs of the people working under them, and the higher level staff on-site are even worse. The management aren't bad people, but they are more loyal to the company than to their employees. "
bad,"Concentrix is an okay place to work, it is a very fair work environment there. I have learned how to build problem solving skills and how to be a team player more and more everyday. I love my schedule and the ability to use my better judgement on a day to day basis. Management is tough but usually fair, and the co workers are understanding and easy to talk to. The hardest part of the job is saying goodbye.The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexibility of my work schedule."
bad,"Very rigid work environment- you work crazy schedules, you only get a 30 minute lunch break. They use a point system for everything.  Very stressful and the pay is low."
bad,"Convergys hires anyone but not many seem to last. While it's certainly nice to get paid slightly above minimum wage for training, the training itself doesn't really prepare you for the actual calls and most people are left with a lot of anxiety and clueless on how to help customers."
bad,"I had learn alot while doing work with Concentrix."
bad,When I started training they had a specific way to find info for a customer. A month in they change the system so it is easier but didn't help employees transition to new system. Then they change their call flow and way to verify customer right after I got out of training
bad,The company provides healthy and safe environment for girls. it has pick and drop facilties. the food was hygienic. the higher authority was well behaved.
bad,"It is full of political pun. Sarcastic people showing no respect to co-workers. Management related issues are there. Ops manager, asistant manager, sme's and agents work together in a same floor. Where in the world Operation Manager sit with agents and look into their work this proves no work privacy."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I started at this company a few weeks ago. Two weeks of training, not bad. The trainer I had was awesome! Week three, we were still in training in a random room with a random trainer (changed every day). We were told we have to wait until we get our licenses."
bad,"Convergys gives new meaning to ""Fast paced"" While it can be extremely stressful it comes with very nice pay and benefits. Change is constant but for the most part everyone works together to overcome obstacles."
bad,It has a high turnover.  The employees do not feel a since of job security.There is always a chance you wil be out of of work and not chance that you will not get the correct time slots that you would like
bad,This is a work at home position. The pay sucks for the work that you do.  The calls are non stop all day long with little room to breath in between calls. The fact that you work from home makes it hard to get in touch with other departments such as human resources.
bad,The work at Convergys in not bad. You deal with customers to solve their problems. The politics at Convergys is ridicules.  They write you up for everything.  They have so many metrics that must be met They treat the employee's like children in school.  You have to put everything you own in a locker and can have nothing at your desk but a drink and a coat that you have to throw under the desk. The time off is not fair either.  You can only schedule a vacation day a month in advance and there is never any UTO available.  Makes it hard to schedule a life when you are so limited to getting time off to make appointments and actually keep them without getting a point against you at work because you need to go to a Dr's appointment.
bad,"Micro-Management, Constant Workforce turnover, etc. job paid very well for no experience and was not too difficult decent job"
bad,it was very interesting the different phone calls you would get . People would be lost or just need directions some where.
bad,"A typical work day is usually busy. I learned to multitask ,and work with different personalities .The management is decent there could be some improvements. The hardest part of the job is not having access to systems that agents need."
bad,while working at Convergys I learned of computer networking and deployment. While furthering my knowledge of customer service.
bad,My program has ended  and we are able to relocate to other locations even in other states ...The job is time consuming if you have a family.. can move up in the company the opportunity is available
bad,I worked on the Amazon.com project as a temp employee. The management was all over you and set unfair expectations. We weren't trusted and treated like criminals. It was a very stressful place to work.
bad,"nessun bonus."
bad,"It is a good company but salary wise it is not satisfying especially in these days ."
bad,would clock on and instantly take phone calls. the call center was so loud it was very difficult to hear the customers. managers were very destructive with their trainings. felt like I didn't receive enough or the right training for the position that I was in.
bad,"i didnt work long in this company cause of health and personal issues. "
bad,The training need work in certain areas and the threats to employees from customers was not preferred. I barely knew my manager but the job overall was fine.
bad,"In the beginning you think this job will be amazing, great pay, bonuses, lots of colorful characters... My teacher should not have taught, the whole learning process they used to teach is flawed and very discouraging once you get to the floor."
bad,"been working there for only 3 months and this is most unhappiest ive ever been, managers only care about staff, long shift hours and no social life, ideal if you just need a job but questionable about the progression."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I was a team player and was shown the value of being a team player. Regretting the RIF, as I was doing well at it, and the available positions to me to go to were backwards of career progression plan. Since leaving I have had no follow up on issues of shortened pay or any responses to inquiries about coming back to another contract. "
bad,I am always friendly teaching from student. And I sure I Export the job placement to student very well. I am always finish my work.
bad,"Every single paycheck was delayed ""due to payroll"" issues. The people were great to work with. The campaign I was on did not send any product samples so we were the only class on the floor without any first hand product knowledge. Management was incredibly friendly and personable. "
bad,"If you want to get into the IT field and having a hard time finding that first job, then Convergys is for you. What you learn in the training classroom they offer will be somewhat useful when you get to the floor and start taking phone calls and/or chats. That is if you can handle the volume and constant tool issues on a daily basis. Starting pay is OK, but don't expect a cost of living increases or pay raises during your employment with Convergys. What you start at is what will remain a constant, unless you decide to apply for a supervisor position, then pay goes up a little but with twice the work."
bad,"I worked for SiriusXM and the job itself was easy I loved it a lot. However, the coworkers did not make you feel welcomed as a new hire. They showed little interest in trying to help us. It felt like high school all over again because all they really did was stare and gossip even while on the floor."
bad,"Great products , great colleagues, the worst management I've eve come across. There is no logic in their choices /promotions , contracts for the same job are different they try to pay less with every chance they get"
bad,The job is very easy.  The pay was horrible and there is also no job autonomy.  The co-workers were great though.  The job is boring.
bad,"Its difficult to know where to start here. The young management mean well but they lack experience. Training is minimal- no where near enough to prepare you for the complicated systems needed  in the job. They promise good money but you start on $9.00 , If you can sell (no matter how, I heard some people forgetting to tell the customer the truth , the whole truth and nothing but..) you will be one of the top earners. To survive here you need a thick skin - and need to be able to sell- SELL - SELL.You do make money from getting a good survey report. But  don't, count on they didn't even set up our survey system until several weeks into joining the sales floor. Once you are out on the sales floor they promise to give you help with some of the tricky questions - don;t count on  it.."
bad,"convergys is an ok place to work if you barely have anything to do, you will have no life, you are guaranteed ur hours, commission is good if you sell equipments, and bundles, also loyalty is on point, very hard to get a day off, system is complicated when it comes to a day off"
bad,We were required to taking in a lot of calls but the compensation was not really good enough. I have learned a lot in Convergys they really train their employees to be competent.
bad,They weren't helpful. Since I were temporary it seemed like they didn't care about our productivity or cared at all. Sometimes the day went by quick but other then that I wouldn't work there again.
bad,"During my employment, the project was struggling due to failed leadership.  We had an extremely high turnover rate, and I recall many times in which our customers suffered due to a lack of personnel.  Management gave contradictory commands, and could often be found slacking off.  I remember feeling like the project was doomed to fail, and our contract would not be renewed."
bad,It was great to help small business overcome technical problems with Intuit Quickbooks Online.  At times it was stressful because my job was depending just on customers good surveys.
bad,"At the start of your Converges journey it is very bright and fun. The staff and management give their support and all is well. "
bad,"It is a good temporary job, but not one to build a career with. Depending on the project, you may be able to get free satellite service.  Be able to handle irate customers"
bad,depending on your attitude with being able to give your all to one company is a lot to ask for your first time actually working at a franchise. however being nice does do pay well.
bad,"After my two week training at Convergy's, I was ready to start making calls. It wasn't too long before I found out that the breaks were so short. The management got very impatient with me after only two days of being on the field. My coworkers were all fairly nice but I couldn't deal with sitting for so long. I prefer to be up and moving. After a couple of months it had gotten pretty tiresome and I was ready to move on."
bad,"Working for Netflix client is fun, however the management within Minacs is unorganized and makes it extremely difficult to advance within the company."
bad,"A typical day is kind of a toss up between really satisfying and really unsatisfying. I learned valuable skills in talking to customers and being able to help them with what they needed. My manager was pretty nice up until I made a mistake--and then he called me out on it in front of the rest of my coworkers. My coworkers were nice. The hardest part of the job is leaving your work, at work, and not carrying it home with you. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping the customers resolve their technological challenges."
bad,The role is that of telesales. It was a platform for work while i came over to England but i am not wishing to find differnet job role and employment
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Convergys is decent company to start at when you need to find work when none is available.  The starting pay is adequate for someone that is starting their working experience after high school, but it is not a place to continue your career once you have found your calling.  Even their staff is paid less than the employees they manage."
bad,"All I can say is it was one of my first call center job so they did give me a good start. I always say your co-workers help make the day go by, and make your work place just little ease to work."
bad,"While the workers and team leaders are all supportive and hope to create a fun working environment, it still came down to being just another call center. "
bad,"not the best job in the world, i felt like a number and not a person. the place had us packed in like sardines and they were not understanding or accommodating with anytrhing."
bad,You sit all day and deal with rude and sometimes kind people. Good for people who like repetition and doing the same thing every day all day. They mess with your schedule without asking your either.
bad,"very unsocial hours"
bad,"Nicknamed Club Convergys.  High volume turn-around.  Too many young people wanting to play instead of work.  WAY too much noise.  Actual call center rooms are not cleaned by janitors so, if you are not able to sit at the same computer every day then you are always cleaning up after everyone else.  And you almost NEVER get to sit at the same computer.  Company likes to change call rules with no notice."
bad,"Trainers and coaches were great. The nesting Team leader kept saying how easy going she was, but then would flame on us in email and verbal feedback. When some of us had ISP issues with their Avaya phone system. we were told to resign. Did not back us as they said they would. Turned very cold by third week."
bad,"Taking inbound and making outbound call, follow ups, internal sales. Team leads were okay.and enjoyed working with my co workers."
bad,"Very young culture. No true expectations, you come in and go out with a headache. Call volume depends on area of work. Management has little expierence and the most enjoyable function is talking to everyone"
bad,"While working at Convergys can feel like your working with family, it has drastically changed. New hires are very ghetto and lack professionalism, while this impacts performance the stress to improve is overwhelming and it seems like no one wants to accept that performance is lacking due to the new culture and such poor wages ($9-10/ hr). Job security was a major plus especially if you worked hard, but now it seems like everyone's foot is almost out the door and the they are cutting the flexibility for those who have other jobs and children. It's not the place it used to be. It can also be very unethical as they have agents doing management roles, but still having them as 'regular' agents on paper, so they still pay them regular wages."
bad,"When I started the company just opened in the Hickory area. Everything was unorganized and the managers play favorites. Training was about 2 months. After training when you get to work you find an empty cubical and sign in and log in to all the programs you need to do your job. Some log in and passwords were never given to me. Even when I ask a few times, I was always told it's on it's way and then never here anything. After working for a few months I left on maternity leave. When I came back about a month and a half later they put me back into training and I had to start all over again. Before I left I was told I will go back to my shift and start were I left off, which was on first shift. I didn't mind the training because it was useful. After my training they put me on a new team and night shift, then later they told me I was going to my old team and on day shift then they switched it again. Even though I was put into a great team with a team leader who actually cares to help me better myself in my job, the part I hated was they promised me something and did the opposite."
bad,"Minacs is a third party call centre which had wonderful CSR's who where willing to go that extra mile for their clients.  They were open to coaching, training and keeping the morale of the department high."
bad,A typical day working a convergys is answering calls and being on the phone all day assisting customers with their problems.
bad,"You will never get anywhere in this job unless you are besties with some of management.  When I worked there back in 2012 there was a lot of discrimination.  Odd to say but non-straight people got the promotion and it didn't matter how long one was there nor the stats you made for the company.."
bad,I liked this job. It was dull at moments and crazy at others but I liked the fact that it was different every call. I never met my boss and couldn't have told you anything about the person who was in charge of me. It was also hard to meet people so don't expect to make long lasting friends.
bad,"The employees made the job fun, management should've been on one accord. Company has potential to elevate though!"
bad,A typical day at work consist of clocking in to the phones and having that be the only communication you receive all day. Never speaking to the person next to you. The beap that comes in when a customer is on the line begins to make you very anxious after hearing it over 100 times. Mentally draining. The compensation isnt worth all the problems you have to deal with daily.
bad,"Aditya Birla Minacs is a call center, open 24 hours of the day all year round. I was part of the Emergency Team and am still a certified Emergency Medical Dispatcher. There is no typical work day, every day is different and every day there is a chance you'll take a call you've never taken before. My co-workers were all very knowledgeable and helpful. The hardest part was hanging up on people you couldn't help because of system errors. You are there to help, so when you can't it's difficult. The best part of the job was knowing that every single day, you helped someone that couldn't help themselves. There is great satisfaction in helping others and I got to experience that every single day."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"company is USA based. provided quotes to customers, and called back after customer had time to review. performed at high leve cold calling ."
bad,"First of all, you have to scan your security badge to enter the building.  And then you usally say hi to the security guard.  and then you go to your computer station where you are assigned to work.  You can clock in five minutes early before your shift.  When you clock into work, you have to set up a ton of programs, and then you start taking calls.  Your first break is usually fifteen minutes.  Then you have your lunch break which is thirty minutes.  And then, last of all, you have your last break which is fifteen minutes."
bad,"This call center offers many good things. A high salary, full time, medical, dental, 401K. What they do not tell you about the job is that you will be cussed out on a daily basis by customers the company has ticked off. You cannot use the restroom unless you are on break or lunch. The managers will undermine you with customers simply because they do not want to be on the phones. Management does not care if you wind up staying hours past the time your shift ends because you needed help dealing with a call, they just make you handle it weather or not you have the authority to do what the customer wants."
bad,"Calls to walgreens get routed to call center first which make people angry since they think they're actually speaking to someone inside actual pharmacy, not true. Took out of state calls then customers would ask for directions which obviously cant provide since were not in the same city or state as them. Pretty deceiving to Walgeens customers."
bad,"Working there the atmosphere was fun, very laid back.The pay and benefits were very good. However they have a high turn over rate because they do not show value for their employees. They get rid of their employees for any little thing"
bad,"Work day is typical, on the phones eight hours a day customer service. I've learned how to multi-task. Hardest part of the job was trying to upsell one of AT&T products."
bad,A typical day at work is be there 10 minutes ahead of time ifyou punch in one minute late you get a point against you.  What I learned there are very nice and friendly people on the other line just need to take the time with them andtalk to them. Management does not care how sick you are.My co-wokers were like my family because spent more time with them than my own family. The hardest part of my job istaking a lot of bull forpeople who dont care. The most enjoyable part of my jobs was helping out the customer and them telling us they appreciate all the help we could give them and our time enjoyed my job very much.
bad,dress code isn't enforced. People are rude. a lot of employee personal issues brung into the workplace.
bad,Bad job. Pay was good but terrible job. Did not like....the only good part was the people who I worked with.
bad,"this company does not care for the welfare of their employees, when it comes to have a day off to go to the doctors we are treated like school kids and we have to bring in a doctors note."
bad,"Job was good, did not enjoy schedule work was 6-6, never a set schedule, and traffic there and back just stunk."
bad,"pesima, explotacion laboral. Poca promocion. Mucha rotacion de personal."
bad,"management is poor, very unprofessional and condescending and rude demeanor towards employees, bonus is rarely or never reached due to guidelines. Management is the reason for high turnover rate they just don't value their employees its that simple"
bad,"Over all, not a bad company to work for.  Due to economic downturn and changes in the overall structure and relationship between partners, agents are no longer able to make what was possible just 4 years ago. ( I will actually make less this year then last.) It is how ever a very stable job.) Changes were necessary to remain profitable and keep the stock holders happy.  I could get on a soapbox about that but will refrain at this time. "
bad,"Incoming calls for the United States Postal Service, problem solving, data entry, identifying customers needs very fast and efficiently. The hardest part of the job was accepting the negative callers comments. Great benefits, I learned that data entry is fun and being able to assist customers in getting there questions resolved."
bad,"Answered phones,resolved customer issues and scheduled appointments."
bad,There's not much room for advancement. The management is horrible. 
bad,It's a job were you gain experience. I learned more about customer service. It was a good environment because if you needed help or need to know how to do something different your co-workers were very helpful.
bad,The atmosphere at this company was not comforting. The company was not well managed. The hardest part of the job was to be understanding when a customer would get upset at you or the company.
bad,"A day at Convergys consist of me taking anywhere from 270 to 360 calls a day with strict scheduled breaks. Its not a challenging job but thats a downfall to me. My time so far here at Convergys has been a learning experiance about myself and others. I learned very helpful listening skills and a lot about differt type of callers and how to deal with them in a perfessional manor. The most challenging part of my job would be adjusting to short interactions with customers, not being able to connect and form a bond/relationship because of calls only lasting 65 secs. The most enjoyable part of my job would have to be the people there, my coworkers. Of course all your coworkers being perfect is next to impossible but the vast majority have been nothing but helpful and a joy to be around. The management is not what I would exspect from a company that wants so much of you but as long as you get you job done and keep your numbers in line life is good."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"The company is wonderful depending on the site. I worked for the site in Pocatello, Idaho and Jacksonville, Fl. By far, Idaho is a winner. Idaho site is professional but fun and the management team was awesome, whereas Jacksonville, Fl was totally opposite. Though my team leader was the most professional person in the building, management was awful. They told you one thing but did another, unprofessional and so much more that I can go on about. They do have advancement opportunities no matter how long you've been there. They say you have to wait 6 months but if you are an over achiever, you can advance a lot sooner."
bad,ok boring and human resources sucks. answerings calls was every min till breaks nd lunches. management is pretty bad they cant answer any questions.
bad,this company is ok to work with if you get to know the right people. if you just go to work every day with out interaction with other employees and management you will just be another number to them. great benefits poor management
bad,"Convergys over all is a good company to work for. I love my job, but I dont care too much for how some managers operate the site. There is room for advancement"
bad,I learn new things everyday at my job. My co-workers are as helpful as they can be. The hardest part of my job is telling the customers something they don't wanna hear. In this line of business the customer is almost never right. I really enjoy speaking with people from all over. Some calls you even get to have a good laugh with the customers!
bad,Nice and relax environment with a multicultural staff but even now pay is extremely low and do not provide benefits
bad,"The recruiters told me that this was a call center job but mostly I would be 'tracking packages and telling people their zip codes'. 98% of my calls I am dealing with lost packages, damaged mail, customers angry at their letter carriers, and basically getting screamed at for no good reason. Resources given to you by the client are useless and are no more than what anyone can find online themselves. I'm into month 2 and I go home every night and apply to as many other jobs as possible. I would rather clean the building then answer their phones another day."
bad,"Taking back to back calls from customers about DirecTV products. The place was very much unorganized and ever changing. We were all learning together basically. Management was nice, some not so much. Hardest part of the job was the high school environment. Very childish employees, no restraint or self control. Enjoyable part was the co-workers and helping people."
bad,"A typical day would include receiving phone calls and being able to answer any questions a customer may have about a product, then selling the product to said customer, then trying to up-sale said sale. I learned about how to orate without offending people of all ages, races, and ethnicities. Hardest part was when people called to order something and started yelling at you for them not reading or listening to all information presented. Most enjoyable part was being able to satisfy customers and feel accomplished every day."
bad,"Phone call to settle customer complaints,new service. A lot of computer skills , how to help install new equipment on phone. There is a high turn over on management and a rotation of managers ever 6 - 8 weeks.. Nothing was constant. High turn over in co-workers. Trying to get problems resolved when customers did not under stand system. Lunch,breaks and going home."
bad,at time of leaving they were more interested in releasing people then working with them.
bad,"Not the worst job in the world but the worst job I've ever had. On a positive note, it isn't a minimum wage job. The commission or monthly bonus checks rarely exist. If you don't meet your target, you don't get a bonus nor do you keep your job. Besides the percentage goals, the work environment is not as stressful but that may have been the call center I worked for or even the people I chose to befriend. Lots of overtime offered. There were incentives once-upon-a-time such as Visa gift cards, department store gift cards but all of that stopped before I resigned. Lunches will sometimes be cut short depending on call volume and staffing."
bad,"This is a really good job for college students, so I was told. I was told that they would work around my school schedule, but once I was hired I was pretty much told I had to get in where I fit in. Management doesn't really appreciate or respect their employees much either. If you like being lied to, or working in a gossip-filled work environment then this is the place for you."
bad,First I’d like to start off saying this job can be good however it’s takes a while and it’s not a job for people who suffer with anxiety. The rate of pay is defiantly a dollar or two lower than the amount of work I was doing. Job is very basic and can very much make you sick of it fast. Benefits are not bad but don’t expect something crazy. Security Was probably the best part about the job.
bad,"1. Better place for students to work in these company."
bad,Was an ok place to work. Very stressful with having to be in your seat all day with a head set. Could only move around on breaks. however bennifts and coworkers were a great perk.
bad,"Ok, yes. You get more than minimum wage, barely. The only positive thing I can say is when I couldn't get daycare for my child they provided me with split shifts. That was great. However, it is a shift bid system that doesn't get honoured. They will tell you that you are part of the bid, and even when you get high stats and promised the shifts you earned, they will take them away over and over again. I couldn't take that anymore. I would not recommend this to a friend unless you're willing to work evenings and weekends only forever."
bad,"It was a call center, worked for Booking.com. Had to accept the offer as there was no tourism in Egypt at that time. Very stressful job, I wouldn`t recommend it to any one but under graduate or fresh graduate people."
bad,The working situation wasn't all that bad but once they fired me due to their system malfunctions and their lack of communication back to me. Not to mention I have never recieved my w2 form had recieved a revised one with no info.  And when going through the process to get my w2 found well I got the run around and still no w2! So what do ya do
bad,"It's a so so company"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,As it comes to over time they re work the schedual so they never have to pay over time. They do not see anything in a persons personal life as important i myself told them i need time off to marry my wife they refused on all levelesof managment saying its a vacation and wont aprove of any time off
bad,"agradable fue el trabajo en el lugar, sin duda alguna volveria a trabajar en la empresa"
bad,"Concentrix is a great place if the only thing you want is guaranteed, steady full time hours. If you want anything else, such as good management, employee recognition, or a positive atmosphere please look elsewhere for employment."
bad,"I worked at Concentrix when it was Convergy's so most of my information is outdated. When I started there, it was advertised as a customer services position but it quickly moved to sales and sales was the focus."
bad,"Too relaxed, the atmosphere and clothing worn was very unprofessional. A lot of the employees had their “clicks” amongst each other. Not for me, not my cup of tea."
bad,It is an ok place to work. Hours are all sorts . Pay was okay. Management doesn't seem to care about you personally just care about  good and bad survey
bad,"Too many rule changes since it isn't unionized, can change how the incentive works on a dime and it's very boring job, the only good thing is the coworkers are cool and nice people"
bad,"you have to know people there to keep your job specially if your black  or white you get to keep your job, but if your hispanic managers are very selective,  i'm only speaking about the Greenville, NC"
bad,"Concentrix is a stressful workplace like most call centers. You will be dealing with quite a few angry customers, lying through your teeth to them about company policies, and the equipment you use barely works, and is constantly changing. The extreme security measures banning coats, technology, paper, and writing utensils especially makes the job difficult, and leaves you with nothing to do half the time."
bad,"Working as a Technical Support Engineer will ensure that you learn a lot while on the Job. Direct management of TSEs is good, but upper management would rather use people and have them burn out than retain good employees."
bad,"Management was very poor; they went through 3 different Ops Managers in my year of being there, they changed people schedules around without their acknowledgments. This is the lowest paying call center I've ever encountered (they start you off with 10.00/hr). The only good thing taken from this was my experience in learning how to use the call flow, take calls while assisting people, and learning to maneuver through different applications on the PC. I was able to ""get my feet wet"" as a new comer."
bad,I enjoyed my time there they had cool prizes and gives aways but the strictness of the managemnt just took all the fun out the place. Raises were based off attendance.
bad,"Low pay,  management that sucks and unrealistic stats placed by the client (so you hardly can get incentives unless you're immortal). A lot of surprise mandatory OT and the workforce literally has a microphone in the middle of the floor to monitor and say everything you are breaking. Applying for a leave was easy to be fair though. HMO was fine.  Not good or bad. "
bad,As much as I enjoyed the work I was doing i seemed that many of the employees were threatened by new people working in the department and were engaged in too many office politics
bad,This job drained me. They require you to complete all your assigned tasks and if their are any additional tasks that had not been completed you and your team would stay late to make sure tasks were done before the next day shift.
bad,"This company has a ok working/life balance, the management style is ok, salary is lower than average, and the job, although not hard, is time consuming and not always good."
bad,The compensation even for there longtime employees is abyssal and shameful. The lack of care and empathy. The staff is there just to do a job and you can tell
bad,It's a fun and engaging environment. I can say that i eastablished a good relationship with my team mates and the people around me especially with my managers.
bad,"Convergys proved to be the ideal job initially. After many company changes within a short time chaos came about and the company seem to not regain its balance. Unexpected lay offs began with little to no information on reasons being. I can not speak for the company as a whole but the Valdosta,Ga Convergys was not performing at it's full potential."
bad,Not enough money great experience tho I had i great time. The food was okay the managers were nice but not the customers most of the time. Too early to be getting called names for nothing
bad,I enjoyted working with the team memebers learning different people and thier lifestyles making new friends and maintaing the goals that hadf to be reached
bad,"I've worked for Concentrix since 2012, there have been ups and downs. It is always reactive, rarely proactive responses to anything. Sr management rarely gives feedback on positive work, they always highlight the negative.  "
bad,"Contract Employee."
bad,I learned to have to communicate to other people through phone calls and face to face communication with co-intern. I'm staying for 6 months on my training and I'm happy to be part of the team.
bad,"An extremely fast paced environment asking for unrealistic call mandates including time of call, information provided per call and communication between customer and their clients"
bad,"It's a good company to get your feet wet in starting a career path but not a place for a lifetime career. Also, agents a lot of the time make more money than the managers."
bad,"Nice atmosphere bt I want to increase  my self.in this company i improve my soft skills,and behaviour.here growth is bt I want go my field that's why I leave my job"
bad,"You help customers with their cell phone service & bills, as well as sell phone & TV service. They have good incentive bonuses if you are good at selling."
bad,It is unfortunate that company expectations did not match the project goal. Metrics were changed without reasonable consideration of clients client satisfaction.
bad,"upper management is shady and cryptic, incentive program changed a good 6 times in 5 years, I went from a 900-1200 bonus every month to a 150$ bonus for the same work completed, AT&T sucked the company dry and destroyed a job that used to be fun and competitive"
bad,A typical day at work would be we would contact customers regarding their Sirius XM satellite radio. Management is ok. the most enjoyable part of the job was the other employees that you would work with. you are together so much that they are like family.
bad,"Though an relaxed urban work culture, they are very disorganized and inappropriate. This is a very entry level opportunity and a way to get a title on your resume"
bad,"Convergys was a difficult job, to say the least. Very often employees will have to deal with very angry customers, who will tend to take frustrations out on the Customer Service Representatives. However, the most difficult part of the job, in my opinion, was meeting sales goals. It was challenging to take a call from a customer who is upset that their internet or TV is not working, and try to get them to upgrade."
bad,Convergys has more than one account where you can grow from. It is helpful if you have never worked in a call center. The hardest part of the job is not being able to mute the phone while being on the phone with an irrate customer.
bad,Good environment. People were friendly and helpful. Didn’t like the 30 minutes lunches and sometimes we were thrown to the wolves if we didn’t know everything
bad,Convergys its self is not a bad place to work. The management sucks and they could careless about you being sick. They need better management and security.
bad,"I started as a temporary agent. I got hired on permanently and worked for there for two years. Within those two years, I saw numerous instances where credit wasn't given to those who were actually completing the work. The management team rarely changes and are often not open to new ideas."
bad,My direct supervisor was great but beyond that all of upper management was unreliable. They changed hours of work to negatively effect the majority of employees without care for the effects. There were numerous break-ins in the apartment and they refused to release security footage to the police. The work wasn't challenging but the site fell because management didn't remove employees who abused their positions for months on end.
bad,The managers were fantastic but it seemed like every project I switched to always closed within a year or under of my employment there. Very frustrating.
bad,"Its stressful, very competitive. It had good pay and Paid time off and benefits. and 401k and life Insurance.. Mangers are okay, not really helpful at all."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Daily work will be normal, learned how to handle a team and ecofriendly people, and lack of systems issues, Friday fun activities and pub cultural times and even peace full place to work ..."
bad,"Total lack in professionalism amongst staff, both in management and in frontline roles. "
bad,"When I was there it was under the Minacs company name and they tell you in the interview that there is room for growth, but in reality you get stuck in a level 1 position your whole time there. There were benefits and vacation time, but the pay wasn't good for the work that we did."
bad,"This organization will hire anyone with basic computer and customer service  skills. This a benefit for recent high school graduates or retired individuals,but i would not advised people in between that age group to apply unless the position you are seeking is in management."
bad,"Work environment was awesome, multicultural and friendly people around, time to catch up, I knew from the first moment what I was required for."
bad,"Outbound customer service associate for the Lotus software program.  "
bad,Working with this company was very fun but also challenging. Being trained to do so many different jobs for customers was stressful and sometime systems weren't always working. most of the customers were nice but sometimes people were difficult.
bad,Convergys is a good company . I'm currently a SME there and I would like to relocate be better my opportunity with the company. I feel that growth is always good.
bad,"Worked at Convergys for seven months. Lack of professionalism, poor environment, alot of broken promises for advancement. Tied to the phone for seven point five hours per day."
bad,"Call center environment for OnStar *General Motors"
bad,"Overall, my experience at Convergys was not a great one. The work itself is fine (providing navigation and minutes to customers) and on rare occasions enjoyable, however your ability to carryout your tasks will be constantly interrupted by technical errors about 30% of the time. Furthermore, the attendance policy as well as weather or not you receive paid-time off, unpaid-time off, etc. is purely based on a strict point system with no exceptions. This also determines weather or not you are allowed to advance in the company. The stressful and generally unclean working environment coupled with the occasional mandatory overtime and inability to effectively complete certain tasks are the sole reasons why I would not recommend this position to a friend or anyone attending college."
bad,"Lacked many basic things such as stable timetables, rotation etc. The work and hours are not worth working there as I felt I could do same hours with same stress levels somewhere else and get better pay and career progression"
bad,"Compensation and benefits aren't attractive specially for a family man like. Yet again, gotta work for a living. "
bad,This is a good job for a young person who is starting out with their first job to get customer service experience.  It is a tough work environment to someone who is not a people person.
bad,"Honestly the most unprofessional,disorganized place I have ever worked for. Management is immature,chatty, contradiction. Pay is good and they offer time. Good for a short time job/experience."
bad,You make a decent amount of money and have can call out and get vacation hours easily but the environment is just depressing eventually everyday you just feel miserable
bad,Training is too short and management do not communicate policies are with employees.   The company is great when it come to email and chat support job but needs help on the phone support side.
bad,"Horrible management team, unprofessional, bad communication, not resourceful, no work attire enforced, training is lengthy not learning anything."
bad,"A typical day at Convergy's would start with me coming into work at 5:35 a.m preparing for my shift that started at 5:45 a.m. I would take calls for six hours and have two fifteen minute breaks in between. As far I was concerned I was doing great at my job. One day I was pulled to the side and realesed from my job with no warning. I was not given any warnings of what I was doing wrong, or compensation. I am a college student who has rent to pay, insurance, phone, and a car payment to make. I can not be without a job."
bad,"-I learned how to manage calls."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"One of the less professional call centers I have worked in. I don't typically like speaking negatively about a former employer, however this review is required for my account and I believe in honesty."
bad,Convergys is just like any other generic call center. The pay is pretty alright but the hours are long. It's really easy to get hired so you see all types of people there. They have a very high turn over rate and don't seem to value their employees.
bad,"The training process was well taught and I had learned how to maneuver through over ten computer systems at a time. I would take calls in high volume and would be friendly over the phone while giving instructions on how to resolve an issue on the guests vehicle. I was able to approach all negative situations in a positive way and resolved all issues in a timely manner with a friendly personality. My co-workers were friendly, but all complained about the job and the management was very poor. Paychecks were consistently late or not the right amount and HR was very slow with correcting mistakes. I did however like my early time schedule and only worked Monday through Friday."
bad,"My review is that I felt unimportant to them. They told us we were a dime a dozen and if we quit or got fired they could have someone ready to replace us in a month or less. "
bad,The work schedule was not what I expected. Work schedule change daily and without notice. Work most weekend never really had time to spend with family and plan trips
bad,I worked for convergys for nearly a year was not a suitable job for myself as your good work was never appreciated an would not let employees apply for holidays but demanded a lot of over time which wasn't a problem just never got payed for doing overtime some months
bad,"You really need to come into this job with an open mind. it probably isn't the best for someone with kids, they aren't very flexible. other then that they have great insurance."
bad,"My overall experience was alright. The people are fun however, there are some you have to watch they will get you fired. Another thing is the time clock was at your desk which means in the morning its a good thing because you're right there to clock in. However on 15 min breaks, by the time you clock out and get in the break room, you have 5 mins left which. Same for lunch, but worse because everyone is trying to go at once. As far as the pay goes, there is always reasons or problems concerning the commission that you're suppose to get. For the whole month, you have made sales and the following month, they will tell you you're not getting it for some strange reason or another."
bad,Very bad working hours for students. I come to understand that working at Convergys is almost impossible if you are a student. I used to work there 3 years ago and Im unaware if the situation has changed its coarse.
bad,"I enjoyed working at Minacs, we would talk to Americans all day about their issues with the iOS products. "
bad,"Convergys is a great company but the management is not that great. I feel like with all the tasks given to us, we're not better compensated."
bad,"Only been there a couple weeks and I already want to quit. If you don't mind customers yelling at you, recorded calls, metrics with every call, and pressure to sell then it's the job for you!"
bad,The culture at Convergys can be very rigid. One must maintain their focus when trying to advance with this company. Good pay grade for current HS and university students. I made a pretty good amount of money to be a part time student.
bad,"There is no dress code for this company along with the fact the noise is incredible with the noise makers, bull horns and general drill instructor type lead management."
bad,"De dag begint meestal met een commando om gelijk aan de telefoon te gaan zitten en alles op te starten. Pauzes en breaks moesten altijd aangevraagd worden van te voren. Bij problemen nemen de leidinggevende geen verantwoordelijkheid en ben je op jezelf aangewezen. "
bad,"The company itself, Convergys is a nice place to work, but when you get put into your assignment, you get specialized training that is not enough. Doing tech support for AT&T is a daunting enough task, but without effective training or real time support, you are left to struggle and learn the hard way. If you can learn complex things quickly, you will do fairly well, but it wont be pleasant. You are judged on things beyond your control. If you pick up the phone and it is a complex issue that takes a long time, you are criticized for as. There are also surveys that you must score perfectly on. If they praise you for your hard work and this say anything about someone else or the company as a whole and give less than a 10/10, you are to blame for that. I've never seen such a high turnover at a place of business before."
bad,"multiple times they forced overtime work and if you did not work it you were punished, room for advancement was very small and commission pay was very weak for the amount of work that was required"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I enjoyed working for Convergys for a while. The work environment was nice, everyone got along and did their part and more. The company had great people. Then policies changes, half the managers left for different companies and the support system dwindled drastically. The job just started to add on to the initial description making it harder to do, to where the pay wasn't enough to compensate, which was a result of me leaving the company to expand my knowledge in different areas of customer service with great benefits/compensation."
bad,"A typical day at work was really simple and easy as far as performing my job was concerned.  Co-workers were wonderful and I got along with every one of them.  Upper management wasn't interested in the needs of the people they supervised.  "
bad,Take inbound phone calls to assist customers.  Troubleshoot customer IT issues over the phone. Upgrade customer services.
bad,"This job was very stress full, hectic expect alot, i was working full time and also i am a stay home mother, they are not flexible, attendance policy really poor, less pay and great expectations."
bad,"Convergy's is an inbound call center that handles many different clients. Each center is different, with different rules and regulations depending on the client served. The Convergy's I was employed had extremely poor management, often with miscommunication between upper and lower management, and between Team leads and Agents. Often times Agents were directed to do something completely contrary to policy which was laid out very cleanly and with little room for interpretation, and then expected to pay the price for their deviation from said policy. While wonderful for gaining an introduction into the tech support field and helping to launch my own career path forward, it is not a place I would recommend making a long lasting career choice."
bad,"8 hrs of the same work. Management can be childish. make sure if you get a arrangement with days off its in writing. "
bad,this job may start out fun but after about a month you start to see that everything you do is at a disadvantage. That's a quick summary.
bad,"Stressful job, but then again, I suppose you could say that about any customer support businesses."
bad,"I worked for Netflix under Minacs. I'm one of the few that was able to make it from agent to Team Leader. During this journey, I saw the highest of high and the lowest of the low. Management was TERRIBLE. They were LAZY and wanted the Team Leads to do any and everything under the sun so that they would not have to do it. I watched management come and go. Very inconsistent. No benefits for Team Leaders. Everything is about the agents. So if youre looking to stay an agent, then fine. If you want to move up, turn away. This isn't the place for you. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers who will literally kill you if they could over a 7.99 service. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you get two 15 minute breaks and a 30 minute lunch........that is the only enjoyable part of the job. If you want to work for Netflix....DO NOT GO THROUGH MINACS. There are so many grey areas when it comes to company policies. Nobody knows for sure what's right and what's wrong. HR barely takes action on complaints."
bad,"it;s a call center those who have worked in one knows the drill "
bad,"This company have its cons & pro; however the truth of character was discovered. Having to remain professional in the duration of mild to moderate anger and frustration from the sub-it gave me the opportunity to relate, make them feel comfortable and confident in me, and ensure that every moment matters."
bad,"Challenging customer service postion. If you are patient, detail oriented and love helping and talking to people, this is the job for you."
bad,"This is making me post more about same thing, This company is a work and go. You will not be here long."
bad,Concentrix is a company that is in need of management skills. They do not reward employees for over achievment. The more you earn at Concentrix the better the chances are that you will be let go. I did enjoy my job responsibilities while working in Retention services for Mercedes Benz Mbrace ( a contracted vendor) but my earnings exceeded what they were comfortable with.
bad,At Convergys when one person did something that wasn't in line they changed the rules for everybody. The team leads would change on the regular so the rules were always enforced differently.
bad,"As a former employee in Oshawa this is a good place to start out or work until you find something better.  Your co-workers are what make it tolerable, and Management is not bad.  The company itself is poorly run and constantly under the watch of GM.  The On-Star customers can be great at times, and horrible at other times - and this could just be the sales people.  When I was there Minacs decided to take away one paid break, and close down half of the floor. Other issues were going through the GM Picket line, plus the poor location of the building."
bad,"The management will always say what is required of them to ensure that they are in good appearance but will never take the action they say they will."
bad,Get to gain a lot of knowledge as direct communication with escalation engineer and technical adviser.
bad,"Manage sales goals on a weekly basis to ensure productivity"
bad,managers would not help you if you were new. They were mean they do not try to work with you at all. They would pick and choose who they want to nice to.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"•	Provide customer service over the phone, explain billing, set up appointment for repairs or installation, and troubleshoot equipment issues, troubleshooting internet connections, troubleshooting dish issues, up sale DirecTV products and bundles."
bad,"a typical day at work was hard, trying to take calls and listen to customers on the phone with the music blasting through the speakers made it almost impossible to hear my customers. Management wasn't very well organized. My Team Lead/supervisor or the one who was suppose to help us with our calls was never around.  Went to training for 7 days to learn the products but didn't have a trainer, so when it came time to go to he production floor we as a group were clueless as to what we were suppose to do. When I asked for more product knowledge everyone seemed to act like I was speaking another language. That is until it came time to take a call and I didn't have that product knowledge I would get yelled at."
bad,"perfect for young adults, not older and mature adults, its customer service environment, but to much young people to take this place serious"
bad,The company is horrible to work for. They have different rules for different people. It is full of drama and is completely unprofessional. I love people and helping others but this job will suck the life out of any and everyone. I would not recommend anyone to work for them.
bad,"Enjoyed the co-workers, after few years it was time for a change and found a much better job"
bad,"Inbound customer service for prescription drug plans, fast paced with high call volume. Dealt with multiple programs while writing notes verbatim and still solving customer issues. Management was professional, teammates were very involved. Typing notes verbatim as well as solving the issues of the customer was challenging, and difficult but a very helpful lesson. I enjoyed helping senior citizens get their medication."
bad,"Poor products to sell, no raise in years. Fun place to work,big turn around as far as employees. On special occasions we have a cook"
bad,"very unprofessional and unorganized. dirty, poorly kept, and mold on the ceiling tiles"
bad,"Talking with customers all the time, learned how to make my customer relax and happy at the end of the call."
bad,"A typical day consisted of about 32 phone calls, with little to no time in between them. I learned, once again, how much I hate call center work. Management was difficult, but co-workers were fine. The hardest part of the job was doing eight jobs at once while talking to up to two people at a time, and the most enjoyable part of the job was helping others on calls."
bad,Did not like the work hours. The management micro manage. You will you like feeling like a drone.
bad,I lived about an hour away and my car broke down and wasnt able to get back and forth to work.
bad,this company is a meat grinder there just there to rotate people in and out
bad,The managers did not act like managers. Most times if you needed to resolve an issue you would have to contact a offsite manager.
bad,"don't work here unless you plan on having no life outside of working for Convergys/Directv. The job is simple,but it feels like you are working with a bunch of elementary educated children. Drama, awful lots of drama. The customers are easy to handle,its the management and people that you work with who the make the job living he double l.The tell you its a customer service job upfront,but its really a sales job where you have to make goal or be fired. they push selling ""upgrades"" but if you have a day or two where you don't preform as well you lose your upgrades and don't get paid for all the hard work you put in the week before."
bad,takes patience
bad,Was not very happy there. Does not back up what they tell you about shifts you will work.
bad,"When I first worked for Convergys, it was as a call center rep for the Yahoo Websites. I liked this position. The pay was ok, I got along great with my co-workers and the management and I was able to attend classes part time; however, Yahoo pulled out of Convergys and I was forced to move to the Sprint side. This was a bit of a blow for me because it meant I was forced to drop out of my class to get the appropriate training. The calls on the Sprint side were a bit faster than they were at Yahoo, but I learned to cope and even like the pace. Management was a bit more difficult on the Sprint side. It often felt that all they cared about was numbers both in adherence and in sales rather than actual customer service or the employees themselves."
bad,"My over all review of Convergys is that it was a good place to start a career; however, not a good place for advancement."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"A lot of salary disputes, incentive scheme always change, agents were not informed whether they hit it or not, mandatory ot's. Unpaid hour-two huddles."
bad,"It is nice company, however there are some issue like low salary, cab facility, no free meal."
bad,Seriously the place is ok for a year or 2 but there is room for advancement. Stay focus and do your job . The management is ok but have no system for the employees too grow or carry a good work experience
bad,"Work environment seems to have low moral"
bad,"stress of call centre jobs depends the contact you work for. i worked for rogers 'care'. rogers has different sections, in Care we handle calls for cable,cell phones and internet and we get paid $13 but people in another contract 'Humana', they have less stressful work but getting 12.50. it is totally unfair and it is really hard to learn tools for rogers as it is not user friendly and we need to use 2 computer screen to work for rogers."
bad,Upper management need to change or they will not have anyone left in the building. Actual job is fun and engaging and the pay is not bad for Chatham. promotions are also quite frequent if you show the effort.
bad,"Co workers are.good management is horrible. Managemebt doesnt give a F about how hard you work, they may cherry pick on your mistakes and show you the doors any time. The HRs are irresponsible and not friendly at all. The salary is good and facilities are good as well."
bad,"Know your Rights when being separated, they will lock the computer  and you get NOTHING and they try and take your PTO from you.  Be careful I had to Contact the CORPORATE  AND PRESIDENT'S OFFICE."
bad,"Trabalhávamos para a SulAmerica, atendendo clientes de vida e previdência."
bad,My experience during training was very amazing. But during the time that I was endorsed to the floor I didn’t enjoy.  I can’t feel the working environment.
bad,"Well, Concentrix took over the old company name Minacs and while we were under the Minacs USA the company was managed better but now I see a lot of room for improvement. I've been with the company for 19 years and it's time for me apply my skills I've learned over the years."
bad,"I was drawn to Concentrix for working with a well-known company and doing something I loved. Unfortunately, they lost that contract and basically told us we would have to work for another, less desirable contract. Not only that, but this also caused us to miss work for 1-2 months between contracts and put many employees in a difficult situation. Once on another client, for tax preparation support, there was chaos and little help. Even though this was the case, I was promoted twice and promised a $1 raise. Never received that or retro pay. Speaking of pay, they definitely have a problem with payroll. There have been times they didn't pay 1/2 the company because of some error and then they double paid everyone and then later made us pay them back. It was so confusing and really strange coming from a company with so many employees. I was told they only have ""3 people staffing payroll"" so requests were continually ignored or delayed and we were supposed to accept that as a valid reason. "
bad,"After three years spent at Concentrix, I can confidently say the time is wasted. The days all blend together; clock in, get yelled at all day, don't have any time between calls, get yelled at by management and ""floor support,"" and then repeat the next day. Every team lead plays favorites. Timecard fraud is okay so long as you're buddy-buddy with the operations managers."
bad,"Reviews about management being ghetto is spot on.  It's shocking most managers cannot set a good example to their staff.  Really crude and high school level behavior.  I can tell you straight up that your average agent is more professional than the average manager."
bad,"Peace of mind isn't worth it. The job itself is really easy, but the stress is highly anxiety inducing.  I worked there for two and a half months before I went out on medical leave for several weeks, then came back to quit."
bad,"Taking in 40-80 calls a day about Internet, Cable and Phone issues of American clients was exciting, fun but rather toxic. I understand the nature of work being a technical support rep. There are a lot of targets to be passed in a month that's why it's so pressured. Overall it was a good experience."
bad,The job itself was not that difficult. The managers tried to work with their employees that were going to school but most of the time they were late to school because of their job.
bad,I would not recommend this job to anyone but their were perks. Concentrix will only promote to a certain level and will only promote certain people. I made good money but was a very stressful position.
bad,you need a lot of energy working here because of the many phone calls and stress. you will also experience the lack of sleep and it is very to take a leave while working here
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"After the intense learning procedure, we had the opportunity to learn about the management of Convergys and the reason why we were there, customer service for AT&T."
bad,Just not organizeda to work there.no growth for me at this company. I graduated 1st in my class. I've been offered a promotion but with no pay raise. Managers are so rude
bad,I handled calls. I answered questions and concerns of the clients. I made sure they were all set and got all the information they needed. I also worked on the computer system for H&R Block.
bad,It truly was an chance to learn insurance reimbursemnet but the processing part of the job was not made clear to me. Nor was the support available when questions arose.
bad,Good place but to much favoritism but was fun offered prizes for sales the people were great.. there was no sick leave had mandatory over time every day
bad,Managers are rude.  Talk about everyone. There is a lot of drama.   Dont woorrrrk theeeerrrrreeee everr go somewhere else.  They dont like to inform employees on bonuses.
bad,There is not much to say about this since this is a really good company. It is just that the account specific to this site is extremely vast but it is hard to deal every day
bad,"Stressful job that can be rewarding if you have tough skin, and knack for management or sales. Terrible work/life balance. Each action at work is tracked, timed and archived."
bad,"A small grow during first year but after 13 months you start to get bored and frustrated"
bad,"brief morning meeting, head to phones to take calls for 8.5 hours with 3 breaks throughout the day"
bad,Convergys is a difficult company to work for.  They are very demanding with what they expect.  And when I was hired I was told different expectations than what was actually expected of me later.
bad,"I enjoyed my working along side my co-workers and helping customers, but as a regular customer service representative you are limited on what you can do to help...therefore I felt that I was not challenged enough!"
bad,"they said that they could work with my school schedule then refused to"
bad,great for students and part time would not recommend for someone who has a changing schedule they are not willing to change start times once you set up schedule
bad,I worked for Concentrix in Atlanta and they were completely unorganized.I was an employee who came to work on time made the necessary metrics that was needed and was left out to dry when they decided to close down our site.
bad,"Upper management will stop watering your garden if you are not making them look good or letting them steal your ideas. The whole site is managed by issuing documentation and fear of being fired. Rather than provide additional training; they would rather rush through and then write up people until they can be fired or give up and quit. They expect Team Leaders to build relationships with agents and then fire them after they fail to meet ridiculous metrics after 6 weeks, even if they improved. That's the hardest part, telling someone  that has a family, that you have worked with that has shown improvement that their employment is being terminated because they made a simple mistake like saying ""could have"" instead of ""I can"". When I refused to do it, I was left to whither and die, in hopes their threats would drive me to quit as well.  Stay far away from this dying garden."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"convergys trained everyone for a project and decided to close 3 locations in utah and lay off over 100 employees. some employees have been with the company over 16 years. everyone did receive 60 day notice. the next closet office is in murray. i wouldnt recommend working for convergys. they barely have any advancements available. they over work all tls, no time off is allowed unless you fight and fight. cant do anything on the floor between calls. you some times have 3 to 30 mins between calls depending on how busy it is. the people who work here are awesome. its like we are a big family. just wish they would treat employees like adults and not children."
bad,Most of the time there is favoritism and a lot of rackets while trying to make sales or assist a customer. Many times you are supposed to have a break but the leaders never let you unless its lunch.
bad,"Concentrix can be a good place to work if you are a single person. They add hours onto your schedule without asking and also you have to work up to your hours that you want, if not you are stuck with the hours that are very inconvenient."
bad,"-Fluctuating shifts every two weeks."
bad,I enjoyed the shift schedule. The management was poor and managers weren't very friendly and helpful. My team mates though are very accommodating and helpful.
bad,Been Working here 7 months and already getting ready to quit policy changed you have to work for your vacation days no PTO days no grace days all of it you worked for taken away because of new policy with company merging from Minacs to Concentrix. Plenty of favoritism no growth for the ones that really work hard and deserve promotions.
bad,"However, if you are a high-touch person, this would not be for you. This position requires maintaining metrics, while working with customers.  The job varies with the client, so be sure to stay in your field of expertise. Had I been more astute, I might have explored other client options at the time."
bad,"The people that you work around was very helpful and had a lot of onions. The job is based on your sales per quarter and if your sales are and continue to be low, you possibly be terminated. This job is for some but  not for all."
bad,"sitting behind a computer all day dealing with customers who are most of the time upset to pay or complain about something gets old really fast. On top of everything, you have an unreasonable sales quota to make when dealing with irate customers most of which are always past due and can't afford anyway."
bad,"It is a good company to work for; however, the compensation is not that good and for a permanent company your job is contingent on them to keep a contract. The company also does not offer competitive insurance, nor do they off reviews and pay raises."
bad,The company has too many salary disputes. Low salary offered considering the workload and the metrics they are trying to set for the agents.
bad,"Like most call center jobs , you go you work and talk a lot and go home. There is not much to it. Again i dont want to burn any bridges so i will no comment on my daily routine or the type of work.."
bad,"The thing about working in a call centre is that it's mentally exhausting, you never know who is going to be on the other end or how mad they are. As much as they can be dealt with the workplace causes a lot of anxiety. We are also forced into 44 hour weeks during peak seasons which is not good for someone with chronic pain."
bad,"This was call center work, the scheduling was to random. You chose a shift block that covered 11 hours of a day, you shift could start at any point in that 11 hours. Many of the shift bids did not provide paired days off which resulted in people getting burnt out easily. The management team was great and easy to talk to though, if there was a problem they would try to help get things back on track."
bad,Working here was a true nightmare. I could work a 6 hour shift and the company would add 2 or 3 extra hours required on to your shift because we were so understaff . I would only be allowed to take a 10 minute break which was very hard for me. This work place was VERY unprofessional. The pay was the only reason I worked so long. You could put in your rightfully deserved pto months in advance and the managers would decline it.
bad,"What mattered was production though I do give them credit for trying to help out by giving out ""swag"". I am sure they could do better though."
bad,"answer calls from customers relating to cellphone ordering or billing issues"
bad,"Convergys provides Comcast phone support for small/medium sized businesses."
bad,the most enjoyable part of the job is I met new friends but the most hardest part is we have always have mandatory overtime
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I love what I do and I love my immediate manager. Being recently brought into the Convergys world through a merger/buy-out of a previous company I expected to have mixed reviews under new management but I did not expect the sheer lack of care for their employees despite many attempts to convince of otherwise. It's bad when people can't even get paid on time (not just one or two, entire departments) - for a company of over 100,000 people, that's not only unheard of but just plain unacceptable."
bad,I have worked for convergys since leaving the armed forces. The longer I have been with the company the more I have seen the ways that the company mis treats its staff and only thinks of its self.
bad,If you are looking to make money this is the place to do it but if you have a life and a family you have a seclude and they will not work with you what so ever
bad,"Taking calls, and assisting customers, with issues they have. Trying to do so in a timely manner. Co-workers were nice and were the best part of the whole job. Problem is they change rules and how things go constantly. For instance your taught one thing this week, and its completely useless or changed the next. Also sitting all day and answering phones is not my cup of tea. I prefer movement and face to face interaction."
bad,I would arrive to work early enough to eat breakfast in the cafe. We took phone calls for the first three hours then took a break and got back on the phones.
bad,I learned how to answer and help people fast with the best customer service. Management I don't have much of a comment. Co-workers were amazing fun and good people to talk too. Hardest part of the job would be when the customers would scream at you if they were in a panic. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to when you make someone's day with a simple comment.
bad,Very unorganized. No team leadership. Terrible hours. If you just need a check this is the job for you. Easy to get hired. Wish I had an assigned seat instead of spending so much time tryng to find a seat.
bad,"Best plat form for freshers, They can easily learn many things like communication skill, and lot of things are there to learn."
bad,A lot of the management have their favourites and if you're not one of them don't expect any favours. Very sales focused and felt a lot of pressure every day in work. Not an environment i'm comfortale working in everyday. Break times are good and if you have any personal issues they are very understanding.
bad,"I worked for Convergys for a month before being terminated for call avoidance. I worked in the Hazelwood, MO location and it was so ghetto and unprofessional I wasn't even upset that I got fired. While they do give you pretty good pay, benefits, and overtime you probably won't even be there long enough to get the good stuff! They have a very high turn over rate that's why they're always hiring! Training classes last from 3-4 weeks but their ""trainers"" do not teach you what you really need to know when you get out on the phones. The trainers give you a general idea or the basics of what should happen but they basically tell you once you get out there you're clueless and you're on your own because nobody is going to help you if need be. This job is like going back to high school all over again. Even the trainers and managers act like petty children towards people. They don't calm down fights they just let them keep going and then gossip about it and that's just crazy. I'd only been there a month and witnessed so many disputes between co-workers, it's not even funny! They will hire anybody off the street just to fill those chairs up! Maybe if they took the time out to hire people that actually had some real prior experience they wouldn't be so desperate for help."
bad,"Although there are benefits available, the environment is very discouraging and pushing for numbers rather than needs of the customer first. I would not recommend working here if you can avoid it."
bad,Management was always away from there desk. co-workers are fun to work with. learned how to handle how high stress call center life.
bad,One of the worst places to work. Dead end job with no advancement chances. Horrible management team. Very rude and disrespectful.
bad,"Management will say anything to keep you happy, but does not follow through with their promises a lot of the time, as long as you remember to get everything E-mailed or written then its a great place to work."
bad,go place to work. good pay. People and staff working there is good cooperative and helpful
bad,Convergy's is so unorganized and unprofessional. To much drama.
bad,"Call center job was good but management, especially in HR and ER; had all kinds of trouble giving information regarding benefits. Team leaders and trainers often got their wires crossed having what to use for complex problems, often resulting in failures to communicate. The customers who called in rarely make a day go by well and are often disrespectful so this job takes a special breed of patient people. The center does have comfortable environment with regards to heating and cooling but overall, this job is not for the impatient job seeker."
bad,Actual job is not too bad. Training isn't what it needs to be and the help once you get into Transition isn't good at all. Especially once you get a Team Leader that doesn't care to help you or support you. Pretty sure it'll vary from person to person.
bad,Good environment but management was not professional enough. Management would threaten you for any little thing you did wrong and they expected you to always be perfect when you just start off. They didn't give enough time to grow.
bad,the job was ok it was just the environment was filthy and most of the higher staff was ..........
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"When I first started working here, it was an atypical technical support position with a company culture that seemed focused on that.  This was relevant to me due to my previous experience in the USAF with technical support.  However, this has changed as clients became more interested with trying to secure a profit through sales instead of service."
bad,"very nice people work on the call center floor"
bad,I loved the training but after that it is frustrating because people disrespect you when you didn't make the bill or you weren't even involved in what they did. Once I started working in convergy's I got sick often and they didn't want to help me remove my points from my absences. They only removed them to people that sucked up to them or just because their calls were awesome in the score. They don't appreciate your work ethic. They don't care how hard you try because to them you are just someone that can be replaced in a blink of an eye. Also if you get fired they fire you in front of everyone they basically put you in the spot. Not only that the security walks you out like if you are a criminal.
bad,Good place to work but unorganized. Would have been able to assist customers better and provide them with better customer service if management and support staff were easily available.  Staff was good to work with but could have been better.
bad,"staying on the phone 2 breaks and a lunch"
bad,"I have no comment to give, regarding this. Overall, it was a nice place t work at."
bad,"Convergys certainly showed me more than I knew BEFORE stepping foot in the company. Waking up at 3 AM to ensure i made it to work by 6:00am was tough, definitley took its toll on me in the end. Managment was mostly a competition (so it seemed) wasnt the worst but everyday was a My-Team-NEEDS-to-make-me-look-good type of managment. Co-workers were beyond amazing due to the fact we all dealt with rude patients and all had something in common. we mostly got along great. Handle time for this position was unrealistic, 90 seconds per call was just NOT possible. Rushing Patients off the phone to reach that perfect handle time is NOT customer service. Friendly environment, unrealistic expectations."
bad,"A typical day is clocking in with your badge, sitting down, and simply answering calls. Customers yell at you and disrespect you all the time, you must be nice. There is no talking back. The enjoyable part of the job is the paid training, the rest of the job is simply horrible. a Schedule change from full time to part time takes about a month, because all of the scheduling is done through a 3rd party."
bad,"In working for Convergys I learned a lot about phone systems, banking, and other computer systems. I enjoyed talking to the customers and getting to know the people and helping them with their problems. I found that the hardest part of the job was having to tell the customer that they were out of luck and there was nothing the company would or could do for them. I do not believe in that kind of policy and in having that as a byline, it destroyed a lot of business. The management of the company it's self was not run properly, it was trying to take on way too many contracts and did not have the staff or the resources to competently fill those contracts with the best customer care and get he job done. In the individual environment with the co-workers it was great, they were friendly and they were dealing with the same frustrations I was dealing with. All in all I do not think I will ever go back to work for Convergys again."
bad,Policy changes from one minute to the next. Cannot count on having a job when you get to work.
bad,"The company was very easy to advance in, however, I sat at a desk all day and talked to time share holders on the phone. On the slower days, all my day consisted of was sitting at my desk, busy days consisted of sitting at my desk while talking to people. I wasn't with the company extremely long because I accepted another job. The co-workers were friendly, and management was motivating. I just really prefer a fast paced environment, where I can challenge myself and always be busy."
bad,"Company is big on Sales. If you can't make sales, they terminate you. However, the pay and benefits are superb and they offer sales training."
bad,It was a stressful place to work. I learned all about satellite dish and it function. My co-workers was very encouraging to one another.  The hardest job part of the job was sales. I really enjoyed talking to peoples from all over the country.
bad,"When I first arrived at work I would have to go through the whole department to find a place to sit, which by the way was hard because we were always over crowded. Then once I found a computer to sit at, I would log on to all the programs. Once I had everything up and running I would start taking inbound phone calls. Most the days would go by smooth.  "
bad,"As a company, this is very hit and miss for anything besides the short-term. Your work experience is very dependent on your direct supervisor, who may or may not be scheduled while you're there during a work week. The problem there is that your supervisor is likely to change 3 or so times over the course of a year, and it only takes 1 to ruin it for you. My first 2 were wonderful, my third one was a good but incompetent who could not file paperwork properly."
bad,I did have fun with my co-workers and the supervisors were great but I didn't want to sit behind a desk and answer phones.
bad,"The job itself is a good job with great benefit opportunities, but the employee environment between both the entry and management levels was not professional at all."
bad,"Customer Service and answering phone calls is okay, however, pushing AT&T products down the customer's throat often made customers angry to the point of hanging up. If you do not offer, or make a very small attempt to, you risk losing your job. I just did not have the personality to do telemarketing very well."
bad,"Pretty easy job overall, but difficult to keep up with the management's constantly changing protocols. Not a lot of room for development. Of the many call centers in Austin, this is one of the lowest paying."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"My career with Concentrix was very short due to better opportunities. Concentrix was an interesting company to work for, verify lax in their rules. The cafeteria had great food."
bad,"Good benefits and atmosphere at Convergys, until the company was sold to Concentrix."
bad,"Within my project, we take incoming calls and sometimes the calls come back to back. There is plenty of support with the problem calls, in which I am one of the ones who help. It's a relaxed atmosphere. The best part of the job  is the coworkers."
bad,"Convergys is a job. I do not have much more to say. My experience with the company was not a very positive one. They were not very compassionate, or understanding, and they do not value their employees as well as they should. I missed a couple of days due to illness, and it became extremely apparent as I was being escorted from the building that I was extremely replaceable."
bad,"Working for a huge corporate was never easy , but it was always good to part of a great team with great support from our seniors who were there to help us"
bad,I used to enjoy going to work ALOT but then was lied to about my status and there were things that should have been taken into consideration that were not in making their determination.   Also felt it was very rude to be walked out in front of other employees as they lined up to eat their Holiday Lunch.
bad,"I didn't make it out of the training class. We were instructed to use self-taught online modules. The trainer didn't explain the material once. I never knew where, what, when, why, or how -- we played games instead of training. There was no control over the classroom. We were given no handouts to study and you couldn't take notes as paper was not allow in the classroom. If you didn't retain the information you read in a flip video or from a self-taught course, too bad! The trainer was absolutely useless. I made it 7 days. I feel really sorry for the individuals going through training at this facility."
bad,It was not the job for me and I definitely think phone are a struggle to work with. The pay was good for start and it was a safe environment to be aroud
bad,"Stressful place of work, management not really willing to work with you. I think this job is mentally draining, and don’t trally get that much time for breaks."
bad,"The typical call center companinmtms to anyone who has worked in one  it really depends on the account your on.  I am on the spectrum cable account, and it is absolutely miserable.  Would not recommend it to anyone. Non stop back to back calls from angry people who hate the company.  Computers and software are junk crashing constantly adding even more stress to an already stressful job.  The incentives are a joke and not even worth the stress it takes to maybe make an extra 20 bucks a month of your lucky.  It will take probably 3 months to get that 20 bucks. The insurance benefits offer are a joke.  Convergys’s may not be a bad company but being on the spectrum account is a bad job you should run away from."
bad,"Good place to work if you can handle stress well. Company itself is not bad but the client contract sets pretty unrealistic expectations on the staff, expecting them to handle multiple customers at once all while maintaining the companies handle time, which at times is near to impossible. Was given false information upon entering the job, which was later cleared up. Not a lot of room to advance, been with the company a few months and have already gone as far as I can go."
bad,I didn't enjoy the atmosphere was very fast paced and didnt seem to improve on where our work environment was we were all over the place didnt offer much help if calls were escalated
bad,It's a really easy job and they hire anybody. All you're doing is taking customer calls and helping them fix their cable connections. But it's boring too. If your okay with sitting at a desk all day for 8-10hrs then this job may be for you. But if you like to be up and moving at work this job would get old very fast. But the environment and vibe is just like any other job... so its always best to just stay to yourself.
bad,"Although great security in terms of job, the work culture is frustrating. Employees do not have enough respect for woman. It pays you enough in terms of allowance and performance."
bad,There is minimal training for employees working on the various accounts.  It is almost impossible to help customers when you have minimal knowledge of the products.
bad,Strict workplace requiring more production than pay received. Questionable management practices. Somewhat unorganized processes. I felt like there was favoritism in the job place related to advancement opportunities.
bad,The only good thing about the job was working from home. the hardest part was getting a day of vacation scheduled. since i worked from home it was a relaxed environment.
bad,Convergys is a very focused company that tries thier best to meed their cliant's expectations while still giving excellent customere service. The customers are always treated with respect.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"a typical day of work is good but the management is very unhelpful, every TL is bothered about the their own team, instead of the whole entire team. no special incentives and less pay for the work"
bad,"worked at concentrix for around 6 months and it was hands down the most terrible working experience of my life. terrible employee treatment, constantly harassing you to finish your calls and documenting faster even if you are still within your allotted time. short on pay checks, would have to speak with supervisor almost every pay day who would look at my hours worked and say ""oh I don't know why but looks like your pay is a couple hours short"". just a very unorganized place to work, do not recommend at all. hope this helped, wish I read something like before I applied."
bad,"This was an to place to work, very high volume of calls, made you work mandatory overtime. The management was ok, their turnover rate was VERY high to say the least"
bad,If you were doing a good job the supervisor would try and find a reason to not let you get the best raise you deserve. They would always change your customer script and deduct if you did not change right away
bad,"A very negative environment, however, a good supervisor helped get through the days. The job itself required knowing a lot of information and problem solving which I did enjoy very much, yet, it was difficult finding authority to correct issues with benefit employees that I dealt with and the company I worked for showed very little empathy at times."
bad,"I had the opportunity to work from home for the first time. It was not as exciting as one may think. Overall, the company was decent. However, it was tough to get in contact with my supervisor at times."
bad,"Noisy work environment.  Staff constantly pushing sales. Even to broke people. If you are a sales type person who pushes things to buy, even to people who cant afford it. This is the place for you."
bad,"This company was run into the ground by management who was using drugs on site, stealing from company and cheating people on hours worked. It became a hectic everyday environment."
bad,"Don't really fill comfortable with the job to secretive. I loved the the people I worked with and the management was excellent, but some of the customers where shady."
bad,The company has a high turn around for employees as the job requirements are far more than the pay scale. I learned how to deal with escalated situations and also worked with dealerships.
bad,"Working at convergys brought me to realize sales is not for me. I do love the customer service aspect of it, just can not grasp sales. When I could not do so they made me feel useless to the company. So I have decided that I will try and find a customer service job that does not include pressuring for sales."
bad,Sit at desk with phone and answer phone calls from providers whether a patient has coverage through BCBS and what those coverages applied to a procedure or etc.
bad,Concentrix being very professional experience with people of high quality and experience. Work Environment  is very easy and employees are very friendly.
bad,Not bad. You can get help from the colleagues. Seniors are supportive someyimes. Management is  unreachable. Management never try to solce or understand the problems of employee.
bad,Would not recommend this company to anyone. They were terrible to work for. Did not have proper management or training and scheduling was always changing daily.
bad,"The environment was more of a call center than a NOC. Although they want to feel like engineers. Very laid back, We did receive the appropriate training. However there were situations that they could have expanded on. The amazing thing is that they hired us just to lay us off six months later. Our jobs are going over seas"
bad,"As a work from home call center agent, it was extremely frustrating when the system would go down and it took IT forever to get into the system and repair it. Difficult to reach out to management with questions. Very high call volume and very few breaks."
bad,"shift work"
bad,"The place is vibrant, good environment, it's fun, the people are nice. but the company does not provide you clear information which you have asked. it's alright!"
bad,"Really miser in regards to employee development and benefits. Employees are not treated well. No concession in regards to helping in any career development, learnings. Cost Cutting involved in every aspect including basic hygiene to your working hours. Even leaving 10 minutes early will mark u half day for that. Literally give peanuts in regards to salary increment."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"WORK EXPERIENCE"
bad,Job get check correctly ever they are always saying things about any little thing just go do your job and leave. nut overall it not that bad of a company I just wouldn't work for them again.
bad,"This is a good job money wise and I loved working with the customer. It was the enviornment and the way things went in the building. Management is poor, they lack professionalism."
bad,Overall rating is 3. Shift is ok. You can balance time with work and family. Not happy with benefits and work load. Very good relationship between management and agents.
bad,"Customer Financial Service Supervisor"
bad,The building needs to be thoroughly cleaned and rid of pests. More time in training and better trainers are needed. Position is not stable and information about scheduled pay increases are not given to help you learn how to make more money.
bad,"Enjoyed talking to the customers but didn't like the fact we had to try to upset no matter what the customer was calling for. You are given the tools to do your job, but they do time how long it takes you to do it no matter the problem."
bad,"Im more  of a face pace worker, this job wasnt for me and the pay was not too good. They also didnt have good training. It may be a good placement for someone who enjoy's sitting all day."
bad,The job would be more better if was paid more.  I think that we have to deal with a lot of unnecessary stuff with customers. It can be stressful at time.
bad,"Convergys has a good professional environment but after starting family my night shift is difficult fo manage with a kid."
bad,"Nice environment, clean, sunny."
bad,"I quit this company after training due to the fact that they don't provide anything. The pay is extremely low for all the work we had to do. They trick you into believing your going to handle technical issues, only to find out you will be selling mostly."
bad,Management was not helpful. Hardest part of the job was the lack of communication. Dress code was horrible. Policy standards were never met. Supervisors were lovely yet lack information.
bad,"An ok environment, unprofessional management. Enjoyed the company i worked for, the schedules are not set and i did not like that. Also the attendance had no grace period. Minimum Parking"
bad,"There are many different accounts or projects to work on at Convergys. In this job, the employee is constantly working with the public in a customer service setting.Whether you like this type of work depends a lot on your personality."
bad,"Pressured to sell vacation time"
bad,this is a work place for eighteen and nineteen year olds. pregnant women also. The really isn't room for advancement with this company although they do promise there is.
bad,"work place was very relaxed, sometimes a little too relaxed. not enough pay for the job functions and the good work hour were impossible to get, the bid system was awful"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"typical day starts with you loading your systems and getting ready to take on a very high level cue of calls. I learned how important self care and breathing is with this job because the people calling in, for the most part, just needed punching bags and someone to unload all THEIR problems on.  Management was alright, as long as everything looked good on paper.  The workplace itself was fine, we didn't have a really cool looking environment liked you'd see on TV or even in a movie when they try to portray all those cool and hip looking work places.  Hardest part I'd have to say was when you just felt like you seriously just needed a minuet to take a breath but you had floor walkers/ Team Leaders breathing down your neck to get back to taking calls ASAP.  Most fun I ever had was pot lucks and meetings you could just have a moment and not feel like you were losing your sanity."
bad,never has schedules on time or consistently. training  was decent but very rarely did the floor help know much more than anyone else. wouldn't recommend it
bad,Can't stand for graveyard shift. And I don't have background as technical support since this is my first call center experience. The salary is very good bu no time for family
bad,The project I was on is no longer there. You'll be taking inbound calls for other companies that have a contract with Convergys. The management was overbearing and didn't really seem to care about the individual employee.
bad,Typical day at concentrix was getting all the phone calls out the queue. I learned how to order medications and deal with prescriptions for the patients. Management had bad services in my opinion. The workplace was never professional. Hardest part of the job was trying to focus on the customers and getting them the medicine they needed. I never had an enjoyable moment at this job.
bad,This was a place to get customer service experience. This company will hire for entry level positions. They pay is low considering the cost of living of the economy.
bad,Easy to get hired if you have a clean record and can pass background check.  Didn't like how management would change productivity standards and switch up commission structure.  Extremely high turnaround.
bad,"Convergys is still very much around, though the programs do not last very long in Jacksonville. "
bad,"schedule should be more conforming to adults.the environment is to hectic, not enough benefits to offer.like a college campus"
bad,"I was a Customer Service Rep for Directv. It was my first job as a Customer Service Rep. It had its ups and downs as all companies do. They tried to make it fun for you to do well by having competitions each week. That was a lot of fun. If you like to do this type of customer service, you would like it. The pay wasn't the greatest, but they may have improved that since I worked there."
bad,"Man ist gerne zur Arbeit gegangen, allerdings nicht weil man wusste, dass man am Ende des Monats mit einem guten Gefühl aufs Konto gucken konnte, sondern weil das Arbeitsklima in dieser Firma das ist, was am besten funktioniert. "
bad,workplace so unprofessional. atmosphere seem like high school. team leads did whatever they wanted to. representatives fighting and arguing constantly.
bad,"I think for anyone who has worked there long enough has learned to love the job. I have nothing wrong with that,but they definitely wanted me to make the company my life & i just couldnt do that at the time. Plus i had gotten sick."
bad,It was okay everyone is really inviting the job itself is really easy and manageable. The training is nice helpful and to the point I enjoyed my brief time with the company
bad,"I really don't have an opinion about this company. I was very young when I started. im not sure if its even open."
bad,"this job is very unorganized and I didn't like the fact that my schedule was changing at any given moment. If someone asked me whether I recommend this job or not, the answer is no."
bad,The job was a work from home position in which I really enjoyed.  It allowed me to feel more comfortable with solving the problems of stressed clients during the height of the tax season.
bad,"basic fast food job. come in, go to the same location every single time. work to keep the clock at the fast food window time down and from blinking, while also properly making the food and keeping the customers happy."
bad,Good experience. Minacs is a good place to gain experience. There quality assurance team makes sure customer service is the top priority.
bad,"Convergys is a great company to work for great people, decent benefits and workplace but coming from a physical labor background it wasn't my cup of tea."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Agent growth path is very limited, does not have salary growth what they show growth is not sufficient for employee that is why attrition rate is high and stability rate is poor"
bad,It was fun of laughs but not professional. Fast paced. Calls come in back to back no break in between. Scheduling was not consistent and the hours changed each day.
bad,"im happy working on this company for almost 6 years and I learn how to improve my skills in this job , also I learned how to trained my co - workers regarding for cleanliness"
bad,"This is a nice job. It's a face paced environment. Very easy to catch up on. Customers are pleasant. Coworkers are pleasant. Advance,met is nice."
bad,"A typical day at work would consist of giving the subscriber directions, selling minutes for their car phone or data for the wi-fi.  I may receive a few calls for Emergencies or a supervisor.  I learned I could work in call center taking calls and give good customer service. The most enjoyable part would be talking with the subscribers."
bad,While working here I was still trying to move and gain some money for my time in college. Ive been here for about two years and its time to leave. Nothing for employee retention. They will just find more people.
bad,This was my first job. I was 18. They paid above the state minimum wage so I can't necessarily complain.
bad,Worst place to work. No work life balance. Will make you work for long without any benefits. Colleagues are always for a chance to pull you down
bad,"Kept up good relationship between Dealerships and Customer, set up appointments, studied up on cases through computer."
bad,"Salary is prorated to 10 days instead of the previous 15 day pay."
bad,"So far I know a lot of people couldn't handle this job since it is a stressful and busy environment but I am managing to stick through it. They should provide better and longer training. It felt that everything moved too quickly and that we didn't have enough time to practice. You have to learn everything quickly at their own pace not even your own. You have to be very knowledgeable and be confident on the phone and all calls are monitored. Some customers are rude and it could be very hurtful at times. The TLs are useless and rude sometimes when I needed help. Some act like they don't care if you are mentally stressed at work. The hours are way too long to work and being on the phone for that long can be irritating. And we don't get paid for breaks/lunches. I would say this job is only temporary. Overall, the best part is that the co-workers are all friendly."
bad,"respond promptly to customer inquiries handle and resolve customer complaints"
bad,"Customers are very irate"
bad,I didn't like the team leader they weren't very helpful it wasn't the best experience in my life blah blah blah if you work there good luck
bad,"This is a fast paced environment. It's a call center that handles high volume calls. Coworkers are amazing but management is aggressive and doesn't listen very well. Not a very open environment, very little chance to excel or move up."
bad,Convergys was ok to work for but for the customer service position they emphasized sales to much. If you are not a natural born sales person this is probably not the job for you
bad,"Working for Minacs was not my best experience. They have a very high turnover rate and it is exhibited daily. They have little regards for employee needs, but why should they, alot of the employees they hire do not respect their job or the customer."
bad,"Easy place to get your foot in the door...not too many requirements. Training for H&R block product support, however, is too short (2 weeks) could have been executed a lot better."
bad,"Convergys was a call center, can't expect much. But depending on your ""team"" was dependent upon how well you performed. It was awful, honestly being transferred from team to team."
bad,"Its a call center environment.  Be prepared to put up with irate customers and a very demanding work pace.  Most days there is little to no pause between incoming calls.  Management in our call center was pretty lousy.  They were more concerned with filling seats than anything.  Recognition was generally not forthcoming for good agents, and bad / toxic agents were all to prevalent in the call center."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"Cooperative learning of marketing, data analysis and customer service processes. Practice in personnel management and leadership training."
bad,"I don't like feeling stuck and not able to get up and move around, so this job wasn't really for me, but I do also like doing things on the computer so I did find some of my job enjoyable, also was able to help people understand their bills"
bad,"This is a fast paced workplace, especially during the busy season there is always work to do. Co-workers definitely help you make it through the day by being willing to assist you and answer questions you may have."
bad,You feel as though you are a number rather than an actual individual working for this company. Employee needs/ fair pay is at the bottom of their priorities.
bad,"It's a call center, if you want to make 12/hr to answer phones and deal with a mixture of impatient angry and very friendly people that's what you will get here. If you are looking for a company that believes in rewarding hard work and promoting people who deserve it, this is not the place to be. If you get on a TL's (Team Leader/manager) bad side and this TL is friends with a higher up, kiss your job goodbye. Getting on their bad side could be as easy as not partaking in the gossip they bring. It is very very high school. I had a lot of good memories here because of the people I worked with, without a college degree in an entry level job 12 an hour is pretty good. However, I wanted to advance my career and put in a lot of extra effort to have it overlooked. They got rid of the TL's that cared about their employees and tried to advance you and some got tired of the cr*p and left. Without them the job was not worth it."
bad,"Interesting work. I learned a lot and appreciate the training efforts made. However, the pay and benefits offered are less than the job is worth. Also, it's a very 1984 work environment where you are electronically monitored every second of every day. Staff is continuously rated and shift selection depends on ratings. This puts pressure on you if you are not naturally suited to the situation. As with any job that deals with the public, especially considering telephone anonymity,  you get calls from impatient, rude and hostile people. If you're not used to that, it can be very unsettling. While efforts are made to provide technical support to staff, it is primitive, disorganized and incomplete. Tricks of the trade are often learned by asking each other which means some get important information and some don't. All-in-all, if you are well suited to the job, it can be fine. If you struggle with some aspects, you will stress out and fail."
bad,Management there could have been better.  It was all about the numbers and sometimes were more concerned with the numbers than you as a person.  Very poor management with lack of empathy.
bad,"This can be a work from home based opportunity if one needs that style of work.  Work at home jobs are hard to come by, pay is minimal with this company."
bad,The company it's self is not a bad company to work for. Just do not like how repetitive it is. Very boring job. Sit there for 8 hours a day on the phone talking to unhappy customers.
bad,"ok place to work for would not recommend anyone to work there however."
bad,Call Center environment a lot of the manage are caring about their employees had a good experience while working with company.
bad,"A typical day at Convergys for me consisted of answering calls. The part that I liked least about this position was all the down time. We were not very busy and could only receive calls. There was nothing else to do. I like to stay busy at work, or as busy as I can. The part I liked the most was that we were able to move around and meet other people within the company."
bad,"Working at Convergys had its ups and downs. I can definitely say that the best parts of the job were the co workers, Operation Managers, Team Leaders, and the benefits. The hardest part of the job was figuring out the customer's wants, interests, and needs. And because it was the DirecTV project getting exactly what the customer wanted was not always an option. They wanted specific channels when there are set channel lineups. Or to get the newest, up to date equipment when they either needed the Protection Plan to be eligible for new equipment. What I did learn is some very good selling skills. A requirement of the job was to sell the movie channels. Such as HBO, Cinemax, Starz, and Showtime. So from trying to sell those on people and learning more about the channels made me figure out what things were more likely to convince people to try them out for some time."
bad,"Management was terrible with helping others, my co-workers were the only positive thing going in there I didn't like it"
bad,"Never know what your schedule is now that new company took over. New department development with little to no training for new department, not a enjoyable work environment. When Stream Intl was the company I was hired for, I could provide better feed back then Convergys."
bad,"If you can handle the job itself, not to bad. Its just a frustrating job to be yelled at 8 hours a day with the very occasional nice person."
bad,"Working from home is awesome, I love it.  Listening to customer talk ugly or down to you is not good, or not being able to help some of customer when really needed."
bad,"The company treats their employees like statistics instead of people, the customers treat the representatives like dirt and the technology is old and constantly refuses to cooperate. However, this job teaches alot about patience in the work place as well as dealing with irate or unhappy customers."
bad,Overall company was okay to work for but company needs to pay more all duties requested from employees. Companies should follow through with pay outs and bonuses.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I enjoyed working with the other agents on my team, and my boss was nice. I didn't like the fact that they were very disorganized most of the time, and were not flexible with any schedules"
bad,">shifting schedule of work"
bad,"A typical day at work is challenging  and the best part is i love challenges, when my manager assign me a work. I come front and accept the work load with confidence and i am proud to say so far i was succeeded in completing the work with in the time frame. Co-workers are great and they are friendly too, but some are not may be professional jealousy, i used to break my work load in to simple which makes me better and i enjoy a lot while working."
bad,"on this company i learned how to manage and treat customers very well , but on total  company dont care of career opportunity"
bad,"While the pay is good (for bilingual)  and job itself is not that difficult, the management is awful. It is a very unorganized and unprofessional setting, with low employee morale."
bad,This job required patience and listening which I was able to provide with all the customers.
bad,"When arriving at work it would take a long time just to load up every system needed to do the job. Throughout the day I would need about 6 different systems open to do my job properly. I was cross trained to assist members in other states rather than just the state I was originally trained in, which caused me to have even more systems open. We had 3 different desk tops to switch between just to check one email account and had to switch to a different desktop to check my break schedule."
bad,Fast paced working environment with a variety of clients and employees. Five weeks of training to help prepare you. Definitely need computer experience.
bad,Served as a Customer Service agent and answered incoming calls from customers with questions regarding their insurance benefits.  Contacted providers daily to check on status of eligibility and worked closely with claims and other specialty departments.
bad,no comment  about this job at all except unprofessional in all aspects of the word. i did not enjoy working here at. other than that i have no futher comments about working for convergys on mcalpine rd.
bad,"Prepared complete and accurate work and update customer files."
bad,Did not like the fact that I was in a cubicle and not working with customers in person.
bad,"Convergys is a very fast paced environment and there are a lot of old tools used to answer health care professional's questions about high dollar claims for an American medical insurance company."
bad,The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers who thought that their TV was life itself.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the employees I was able to work with .
bad,"This company would rather you pursue a career with them, so they do not work with school schedules."
bad,"answering incoming phone calls"
bad,consist of helping customers while taking phone calls paying bills and working with computer.
bad,"A very stressful work environment.  Too demanding and always changing requirements, so one never knew what was expected."
bad,"I am responsible for leading not only my team that directly reports to me but also the entire team of 50+ people. I coach my team to meet certain metrics daily. I create energy on the sales floor by having games with incentives. I have reporting responsibilities such as payroll, figuring compensation and other metric reporting. I am involved with internal daily meetings and meetings with the client. I have fantastic co-workers who are supportive of one another. The most enjoyable part of my job is helping my team to succeed and consistently have the highest performing team. The hardest part of this job is the lack of communication from upper management. This of course creates a negative trickle down effect. I have learned countless things in this position, many intangibles that I am very grateful for."
bad,Me and my brother both worked for the company in different sectors and both concluded that the company is not interested in providing quality customer service but is more worried about doing the bare minimum and making a quick buck.
bad,they have a nice work enviorment but they are not flexible if you get a situation like loosing your day care
bad,This was an ok job to have as a college student. They worked with your school schedule.
bad,"Only fun part was seeing friends at work and the work itself was but because no matter how hard you work, nothing is appreciated by the management. Pay for sales were horrible."
bad,Convergy's is a good place to get call center experience if its your first time working at a call center it lets you know what not to tolerate at your next job
bad,I didn't like not being able to solve all problems and not being able to ask if they wanted to speak with a manager.
bad,"The very first day went like this, We were told to show up that morning at a specific building. When we had shown up there was no training room. It had also been brought to our attention, that HR over staffed the training class i was in, almost by half. So many had to find out that day if they were still on the same project. We moved from building to building at least three times to find an available training room. About half the day, wandering. Mind you its December, and of course snowing. Training was an overall positive experience, however in hindsight, even AT&T had agreed our training class (the 1st) had  less  hands on preparation that had been deemed necessary. It seemed like a waste of time to devote one to two days to play name games. The transition was rough, upon graduation. I had issues with having four team leads in the span of one year. With employee turnover, comes inconsistency, there were continuing issues with managers. First team lead accidentally coached me twice mistakenly on the same phone call. Third Coach had messed up my schedule, at least once a week for about four months. To correct any attendance inconsistencies/ mistake was quick and easy. A job requirement none seem to care fully about or do.My largest and most unfair headache was just beginning i had forgot to clock in. The computer usually does it. But didnt since i had left my computer logged in overnight to avoid slow reboot.  I hadn't realized until my first break. I went up to another team lead to fix it, mine was hardly ever there. He knew i was there on the phones taking calls by 9 am, had"
bad,"A typical work day consists of answering inbound calls, helping customers troubleshoot devices, handle account and billing issues. The hardest part of the job was when u could not completely satisfy the customer with things they requested; i.e. adding movie selections which was not something CSR's could handle."
bad,Received inbound calls pertaining to mobile telephone devices. Assisted with filing service requests for poor coverage. Performed basic troubleshooting of mobile device. Explained processes and procedures for misapplied payments. Processed name and address changes. Processed cell phone payments. Provided customers with self help options. Assisted customers with upgrades and accessory purchases. Focused on providing world class customer service.
bad,The work environment was not professional. The job is a great for someone looking to gain call center experience.
bad,"Many changes, confusing information, discussing how Convergys works would cover proprietary information."
bad,"very fast paste."
bad,job was a joke but it was a paycheck. They tell you how and when to walk through the door when to go to the bathroom where to sit. It is just a place to draw a check
bad,I have the ability to practice some of the skills I learn in class which is helpful. Co-workers make the day go by quickly and make the nature of the job tolerable. The most challenging aspect of the job is consistently producing results with an ever changing plan and goals
bad,In the beginning I was very excited to be able to continue working for DIRECTV but with one of their third party vendors and the ability to work at home which gave me the ability to be home for the kids. The thing that I really didn't like was being lied to. When I signed up I informed Convergys that I would be relocating to the state of California in a couple of months. They ensured me no problem that I could start my training in my current state and all I would need to do was to have my team leader request time off to allow me to move. They also informed me all that I had to do was to retest the internet to ensure it was fast enough. So I went thru training at the end I asked my team leader to request time off for me which she processed the request however in the meantime one of my fellow co-workers informed me that she knew that I would not be able to continue employment with Convergys in the state of California. I asked my team leader about this and finally she informed me that no I would not be able to continue my employment with Convergys in California. I believe that they should have been upfront with me in the beginning then I could have looked for a job which would have allowed me to still work in California.
bad,"It was a call center"
bad,They hire to fire you! The atmosphere has a ghetto feel. The dress code is nightlife.
bad,"The work place was amazing, every one is hard working and well mannered people. The job wasn't so hard, there was no hard parts in it for me as Im easy going with computers and finding good ways how to speak with the customer."
bad,High Call volume throughout the day. Learned how to multi-task while talking with customer's. The hardest part of the job is not having enough time in the day to complete assignments.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,I would answer phone calls from customers regarding their accounts. I did billing and set up appointments.
bad,"I had a great learning experience with working for convergys, dealing with customers in every different mood possible and knowing how to handle the situations in a well professional manner is the best skill I learned at any past job I had."
bad,This place has a high turn over rate for a work place. They are supposed to be about customer service however from the time the customer gets on the phone to the end of the call you work and strive to do nothing but learn how you can sale a specific item to the customer. This call center is a very stressful environment. If they do not believe you are trying to meet sales goals some supervisors will have someone sit with you who will try to talk to you the entire time on a call while you are still trying to hear what the customer is saying. I recall a customer getting upset because they heard the woman sitting with me telling me what to say. If they can not get your sales rate up there has been incidents where they did fire their employees no matter how hard those employees tried.
bad,While working for convergys I was a recievables management representative. Worked for about 4 years never got my bonus or raise. Would not go back.
bad,Unprofessional work environment.  No raises.  Harassment.  No respect for others.
bad,I loved Convergys because of the people that worked there! As far as the compay..they're OK!
bad,Not for people who are uncomfortable with being FORCED to do sales over every phone call
bad,did not take care of veteran employees. Poor management practices.
bad,"Pay was mediocre, systems were too buggy and training was very uninformative.  They pushed for upselling, completely ignoring customer service, but gave no tools or tips to facilitate the former. Also, your job depends almost entirely on how much you sell, but your pay is almost completely based on your hourly (commission is pennies to the dollar)."
bad,It is a great atmosphere but overall the place is crowded. The training does not teach you all what you should know before you get on the floor and answer phones. I learned that it is best to have experience on the phones before working here. They give you training but it is not adequate in my opinion to prepare you.
bad,"•	Handled incoming customer calls with the intent of providing customer satisfaction and retention with monitoring commercial and residential account"
bad,"The company is really reliable at offering full time hours however they lack any sort of understanding for students. The site is very unorganized, and lacks a lot of professionalism. Operation managers are seen yelling at other employees instead of having one on one meetings. "
bad,I give if two stars it is not a career it is no room for advancement it very unprofessional the benefits leave or not good they think that it has 12 points that you can take off is good to many people where fired over this it is not a good place to work they have a 100% turn over rate thats not good
bad,If you like sitting on the phone and talking to customers all day this is the perfect job for you.
bad,Clock in and none stop calls from your clock in time till clock out time but very east calls time goes by fast.
bad,It was an ok job. I loved helping the customers. The hardest part about the job was making sure you never took what the customers said to you personal.
bad,Only worked for converys a few months.
bad,There is always something new to learn about computer issues.
bad,I enjoy the job. In training I learned a lot about the products and not enough about the different systems that I have to multitask through daily. Once I was able to get the systems down I was ok.
bad,The job was very easy although they didn't pay enough and sometimes the coworkers were hard to get along with.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"This company will mentally, physically, and emotionally drain you. The pay is satisfying."
bad,"they never came thru w/ anything they said they would, bonuses, extra hrs"
bad,this is a typical call center environment. the management is awful and there is little to no room for advancement.
bad,Not very rewarding and very demanding for minimum wage
bad,"I learned to start my day with what (prayer) because each day was different. You quickly had to put your day in order, because of task and deadlines you may be faced with. I think the hardest part was not fully resolving my customers and my associates issue. I get great joy when I help someone resolve there issue."
bad,"Highly competitive for motivation but was driven entirely on metrics instead of customer satisfaction. This led to clients being pushed off the call after the allotted time, regardless of resolution. Eventually, the client had to choose another supplier of technical support as their customers were unhappy."
bad,A typical day at work is screaming customers and having to remind you TL three time to do one thing. No one ever wants to help. Management has no professionalism. The job itself is not hard at all. With that being I don't enjoy anything about that job.
bad,angry customers this job is stressful dealing with angry customers all day
bad,I love talking on the telephone to customers and making sure I handle their business.
bad,This job was very stressful since I was a full time student and had to work full time hours.
bad,"With the amount of people that they employee and the turnover, its not really a place to work and grow and career path."
bad,"independent atmosphere,"
bad,"Anyone can walk into a call center and do the job at hand, but not everyone can do it well. The work produced is not stressfull or demanding. It is a call center job, so it's hard to stay positive in a job that may be gone in 2 months and it is not rewarding."
bad,"I started out the temp position with a great boss. I was later transferred to a different boss who was awful, wouldn't even let us use the bathroom. When I had contacted HR about this, they did nothing. I then requested to be put on a different team and was told they only do that for very good reasons. Apparently, mine was not good enough. I was praised by my previous boss, but this one never once said anything nice about my work. If they are willing to let people like him work there and also be complacent and not do anything about it then I don't believe you should work there at all. You're better off doing fast food."
bad,"They don't let you advance, They were very unorganized with commission and how they run the programs was just a bad experience.  I would not recommend anyone work here unless they are looking for a few years of a temporary position."
bad,Convergys was a stressful environment where the clients yelled and made fun of my job.  I felt that training was poor as well.  A typical day was taxing and stressful.
bad,"A typical day at work was about 10 hrs because of mandatory overtime..I learned that most telephone agents are stressed by the amount of constant change, learning, and difficult clients.. The staff and management are mostly great people trying to make good of bad situations..The salary is too low and the decor and amenities are well below acceptable standards..The hard part was having to work holidays.."
bad,"Working for CVG prior to buyout by Synnex was generally enjoyable. Decent benefits, good immediate management. No perks such as stock options, bonuses, etc. but good salary. At times unstable work environment; information at executive level not shared effectively with gen'l level employees as to expectations, changes, etc."
bad,"A typical work day looks like, numerous phone calls both inbound and outbound. Immense customer service skills used daily. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,Loved the work sceen and management but was left out cold after tax season and if you are looking for a way to make a living this is not the company for you I was hired only for 3 weeks and was judged by just three weeks while others who continued to have jobs works for months
bad,"I was the first class to be crossed trained on all 3 sides of the Anthem project. Since the training was a combo class they decided to cut the amount of time the new classes gets in training by one week. Now that may not seem like a lot of time to the people who has to look and teach the systems, but to someone who has not experienced the multi system way of business they require then that week is cruller."
bad,"Used to be excited to go to work however after being in the company for 6 months the workplace is a nightmare, some people in management actually have no people skills and can’t relate to you as a human. Forced to sell products to customers that they don’t need or use, don’t be given the correct systems or given some control over your job everything must be done a certain way. Management only love you if you make the sales if they don’t it makes you think If you weren’t there would anyone even notice. Hours are unsociable."
bad,It's a very good job people are friendly and very helpful as training for a work-at-home position as well as a management was very good and helpful even though you are working from home you still have help at your hands.
bad,"Convergys is a fast paced multitasking environment. As a customer service representative I was trained, not on actually troubleshooting the customers issues, but in the billing software. Most of your learning is done on the actual calls and by communicating with your colleagues. Knowledge does not get passed down to you and it will show. After asking management about an issue, at times they probably won't know what to do and will do anything to just keep the customer calm. Even if that doesn't lead to actually fixing the issue. Again the job itself is great and has a lot of benefits, but who they appoint important roles in management needs to improve."
bad,"The system will not allow you anything, so if you need to flex time or time off it will not be approved and even if you were to bring a Doctors note it might not be approved anyhow, we get 2 weeks vacation per/year and you are told you can split those days if you don't want to take the whole week, 3 of my fellow coworkers were able to take single vacation day here and there but I and the rest were denied our Vacation day because apparently it would block the whole week so no one could take that week as a vacation, just a small and not brilliant example of how unfair you will be treated"
bad,"Too many shift bids. I cant deal with all the changing of different shifts. I have a family, and would like to keep my shift the way I need it to be. ok"
bad,Tenía muy buena paga pero eran muy esclavista y exigentes no te daban un respiro.
bad,be prepared to work at fast paced and competitive environment.They training is thorough and helpful.and the great thing is that dont expect you to fully remember everything you learned in training
bad,"A typical day at work consists of speaking to different customers and worrying about if this will be your last shift. The management is HORRIBLE especially in Valdosta, GA. They only care about themselves and they will only attempt to help their favorites. Your schedule can change ""based on call center needs"". If you are a student, your education will have to come in 2nd place to this job. If you are a sick and have a doctor's note, you will still receive a point for your tardy or absence. If you become sick at work, you may have to finish your shift or take appoint to leave. This is the easiest, most stressful job ever. The only good part about working here is the free DirecTV service and the pay. Other than that, DO NOT APPLY! This is the only job that cares more about replacing you than working with you."
bad,"a typical day was coming in and answering generated calls daily I learned about new products and services offerd by at&t. The management was team was not the best, I did not like coming in on this job it was hectic trying to learn how the system was set up and the sales structure for the company. I got along with all the employees."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,a typical  customer service agent. nice atmosphere and management.
bad,"A typical day, was answering phone calls, and dealing with customers and helping them with there reason for calling."
bad,"A typical day at work was providing customer service for cell phone users, answering the same questions all over again, taking payments, connecting and disconnecting services. I learned how to be even more patient.  Management was competent but not willing to help when needed. Co-workers were fun and cooperative.  The hardest part of the job was when a customer called disputing a bill.  The only enjoyable part of the job was the good friends I got from it."
bad,It just all around wasn't a good job for me. Everybody who I worked with was very nice and supportive so you'll make friends but actually being on the phones was a nightmare. I used to describe it as sitting on your butt all day feeling out of control. I got really depressed working there and my friends are the only reason I stayed as long as I did.
bad,"Received 100s of calls and reviewed cell phone accounts and made plan and phone upgrades, minor tech issues I learned how building a rapport for a top rated phone company is very valuable for not only the customer but for the company as well. Happy customers, happy business happy people. The hardest part of my job would have to have been the management. Not quite up to par, so much favoritism show amoungst so many people"
bad,"did the training but never made it to the floor. Lunch breaks were good, clean bathrooms, clean cafateria/lunch room, Great trainers"
bad,"My typical day of work consists of a great deal of energy, excellent communication, persuasion,and optimistic views."
bad,The work environment was very professional. I learned internet repair and management was efficient.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"At this job i have learned so much. The first call center i've ever worked for. I started out in customer service and thats where i learned my basics. I learned how to work under pressure, deal with irrate customers, make good judgement when making a financial decision. Two years of doing that i was promoted to a supervisor postion where i worked under my Team Lead and managed 12 agents. I printed out reports, ran queries, watched adherence and answered work related questions. One year after that i was promoted to the Quality department ""Contact Assesor"" where i listen to recorded calls and evaluate them to ensure the agents are following company policies and procedures. Provide feedback of evaluations and attend monthly calibrations with Team Managers/Quality Manager. "
bad,I liked the opportunity that was given and it help me build a better resume.
bad,This company is fine but we need to be offered pay advancement. You do not get raises working here.
bad,good co-workers very supportive.
bad,"This is a good temporary job, but don't count on anything permanent. Plus they go back on their word a lot as to when new opportunities will start. It's frustrating."
bad,"This job is not something you want to stay at forever. Unless you’re higher up in the food chain, this job can be the opposite of heaven. I work for the FEDEX side and to be completely honest, it’s a very easy job. It can just be very stressful sometimes because if you are good at what you do, you have to work for other people too. And not get paid for it. I think that’s the worst part."
bad,"The position was a typical position in a call center, the management cares about you (in a non-sales department) and there is plenty of room for advancement if you are willing to work for it. The best part of this job was the people you work with and the relationships you make in your time there."
bad,Unless your 21 and younger looking for some okay money with no bills this isn’t the job for you . But to each is to own so if you like drama and occasional fights then go ahead
bad,The company's turnover rate was horrible with the campaign I worked for causing them to pull the contract from them. Not sure if they were managed incorrectly or if they just needed to downsize.
bad,I helped AT&T customers with their issues. I learned how to deescalate the situation when customers were upset. Management was nice and helpful. They taught us to upsell.
bad,"They shut down multiple ""projects"" and put a ton of people out of work. It was a typical call center, follow the lines and make your pitch. No reason to really provide personal feedback to the ""customers"""
bad,"The hardest part of this job was speaking to unruly customers and not being able to assist them only with the rules the call center had which never helped the customer, as far as, I was concerned. "
bad,Great people. horrible Management. The job that was being asked was not hard. The problem was management was not on one accord. There was always something being changed in the middle of the month or even the middle of the week.
bad,"Great customer service and floor support team, lots of people need help and bother you during a call, constantly getting phone calls, short breaks, and staff is unprofessional. Lots of people and long hours."
bad,The work environment within Convergys is both fast-paced and rewarding. There are many great stories within the company of improvement and advancement. There seems to be a very high push towards the sales aspect of the job but it is not to be a deciding factor as there are teams of dedicated individuals who help you succeed within the company.
bad,I worked here for 7 years and enjoy the people I work directly with/for.  However the business as a whole seems to not particularly care about the employees them selves. With strict performance rules minimal advancement and less wage increases it's hard to justify staying at the company.
bad,The company was decent to work for but had some flaws. Had flaws keeping up with current news and events dealing with directv. Though they did have great perks and benefits it was a hard environment to stay happy in.
bad,via phone with customers about their services and answer any questions they may have company is not organize management team sucks but loved my coworkers
bad,"This job is very very easy. You sit and answer phone calls all day and assist customers with their problems.The thing is though is now you must get DirecTV sales and you must Add a line to an account on every call and they are really changing for the worse. Instead of being about assisting the customer, it's all about sales. On top of that your schedule changes at least 6 times every couple of days, so you never really now what time to be there, and you have to watch your back because some people will purposely befriend you to stalk your social media and use what you post to try and get you demoted and or fired. Also your stats and surveys are vital. The best part of this place and maybe the only reason I put up with it is the real friends you can make."
bad,"it was a good experience, it made me more experienced in some of the areas in life that i did not really know about, i would recommend it to other people"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,I hated having to be on the phone all day. I wouldn't recommend this job if you are not a people person. They are very strict and messy.. it was so much shenanigans going on there.. glad I not there anymore
bad,I would have like to be trained better and to have had my managers and team leaders be more proficient with me on several situations when it came to the customers so that I could had help them better. I love being able to help and please my customers. The work area was clean and I loved the overtime
bad,"It was a cool job Only thing is it ran by a point system. No matter what the situation may be I your late, miss a day or have to leave early it's automatically some type of points. Also you have to be very flexible with hours sometimes you have mandatory overtime and also your schedule I different every week."
bad,This is a nice paycheck for a job. Not to difficult. The problems you will find is a lot of the management is corrupt. You either get on their good side or you will find yourselves in their crosshairs until they find a reason to terminate you. They will indeed find a reason and it can be any reason they want. Other than the management and floor managers who in most cases have no clue how to properly handle a account or customer the team leaders are generally good.
bad,"This company pays well and provide stability and great benefits, but high stressed. Management could be improved less micromanagement. "
bad,I would take calls for health insurance. Most of the callers where friendly and understanding. The management were good I liked my manager. We would always have fun together no problems.
bad,"•	Handled billing and feature plan changes for wireless customers"
bad,Easy transition from training to the main floor. Expect a high call volume daily. Co-workers are very friendly and willing to assist new employees when they can.
bad,Convergy's is a call center that deals with comcast. A product that is not in the area I was trying to help or sell too. Customers called and complained all the time about services being out or charges on their bill. The management was great and willing to work with you but you can only take so much of angry people yelling at you all day. They do offer great benefits though.
bad,"productive place to work, needs to be more professional and organized but over all the work is easy and it pays well"
bad,"•	Helping passengers to get in and out of the vehicle if required"
bad,"They said that they were there for the workers and as it turned out they were only concerned about how much you could sell. Out of 44 people that I met and knew who went to work for the company, only 6 still work there."
bad,"handling customer calls from customers of cingular wireless and trouble shooting phones, taking bill payments, changing addresses, and various other issues that were going on during the day to day lives of the customers."
bad,Typically we take 60-80 calls a day that consist of billing inquiries and tech support. Any issues we cannot solve from the call center setting we forward to Technicians.
bad,"I learned a lot about customer service both times I worked for Convergys. I also learned more about computers. The managers were very laid back. The most enjoyable part of the job are the co-workers. There are some really good people working there. The worst part was being a third part to another company so your hands are tied in a lot of areas. Also, I do not feel their training is adequate as a lot of time is wasted just sitting there when you could be learning something. Then, the majority of the people don't know what theiy are doing."
bad,"Started working there last November , pretty decent job and it’s easy to get use to. Thought I’d be there for years .. until I was told that the contract I was working for wasn’t making enough money & was closing so I’m out of job in 2 months. Other than that, some of the management is helpful. Just sucks we couldn’t continue."
bad,"Ok company I was treated very very unfairly in the end . I started my Convergys career in the Longview call center , and was able to transfer to a brand new Dallas sight that had just opened. In Dallas I was given the opportunity to become a supervisor I and will always appreciate that chance"
bad,"Easy job to learn, and is something that practically anybody could be good at if given their best effort. Great benefits, and decent pay, and gives opportunities to move up the work force ladder."
bad,typical day of work consist of the everyday taking call..a lil conversating but no time because work was a must. we often had team meetings but it was pleasant in the least bit. overall a good company to work for just boring not exciting enough
bad,"At this work place the envorment is well and they treat you with respect, but the training needs to be more than what they teach you. They basically throw you out to the sharks and they will terminate with bad surveys even though you are using all your tools and doing everything you can. The management can be great but the way they work is not what i reccommend."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
bad,"I worked there for 8years , Workers were like a family, .great training, great advancement. However No overtime and no support , overworked and under appreciated..program management was not supportive and required to do more than what was job description"
bad,"The work environment is very healthy in convergys, so much of enthusiasm and  competition is there, very cool place to work, employee enjoy a lot while working in convergys."
bad,"Convergys is just the beginning phase to the cooperate work life. It's more of a college environment, meaning lots of micro managing because of the younger crowd. The benefits were fine. The job definitely has its pro's and cons."
bad,"I loved working at convergys, but as soon as i was in my accident, i didnt get any support from my management. on a day to day basis the job was amazing, the atmosphere was always at its best. my management didnt give me the best of support as i was quite young and didnt really know what i was letting myself in for.. my co-workers were amazing too.. the hardest part of this job was leaving it.."
bad,great start for a work at home position some managers are ok others not so much.
bad,"Very busy days, great pressure with customers calling in with issues technical and billing . Poor management leadership. Ongoing learning with wireless applications changes occured daily. Good report with fellow workers . The hardest part of the job was having to take numerous calls in the shortest time, Customer satisfaction was the most enjoyable"
bad,Majority of the managers are super cool and laid back. Even the site director is cool. The only bad thing I would say is the mandatory overtime and the my are so pushy for sales instead of customer service.
bad,"Good office and best series and everything best benefit hr department and all member "
good,Even with the wah teams they played favoritism. Pto was a joke and it was difficult just to get it since you literally had to tell them weeks in advance. God forbid you're sick for to many days if you have no Pto hrs you have to just get unpaid off time and that's only if they approve it. Only the favorite employees were able to pick their schedule or get any good schedules. It was also a split shift schedule that changed on a weekly basis.
good,"Mandatory overtime is a must"
good,"Poor Work, Life Balance.  Minimal pay, with increasing job demand and meeting metrics.  There is a lot of job dissatisfaction among the employees, most just staying there until they find another job."
good,"Arbetsuppgifterna med att hjälpa människor att boka hotell världen över var spännande, stimulerande och roligt. Däremot var arbetsförhållandena dåliga, uppskattning från ledare lika med noll, likaså arbetstryggheten, Jag hade trots allt en ganska rolig tid där men kan inte rekommendera företaget"
good,"This company provides customer service for a big corporation, and the turnover rate of employees is astounding. You will get paid pretty well if you can manage to turn yourself into a salesman, but you have to have that customer service attitude to keep the job. I learned how to do my job as a CSR here and will always be greatful for the opportunity to work there. Especially as it helped me get a better paying job."
good,My schedule was never consistent. I couldn't make it flexible enough to where I could include my school hours. There were also a lot of people acting unprofessional.
good,"Helping customer.....ok company"
good,"Low pay, difficult tasks, impossible to attain performance metrics.  I worked on the AT&T U-Verse contract.  In my role as a support engineer, I had to follow a device which AT&T set up to resolve customer issues, even if I knew how to fix the problem without going through the device.  It's some sort of an engine which correlates with a database.  The tool would go down all the time and we would be unable to use it.  It didn't make a difference the tool would go down, the issue(s) had to be resolved within 15 minutes.  If you don't use the complicated tool to resolve the issue than you are not in ""Compliance"" which changes all the time."
good,"there is no room for advancement in this company. They also can't exercise their policies on employees consistently, ALOT of double standard."
good,I was recently fired due to attendanc.......Back in august my car went out so I missed some days I ended up paying a family friend 300 to get me back and forth to work.....They made me miss days and made me late several times....I lefy all yhe superivisors know thinking they would understand. They was training me for a csr2 position and they knew how I felt about my job.....Still I was fired....Now prior to my car breaking down and ehen I was able to purchase a new one my attendance was on point but yet I was still fired for that screw up from august 10 yo september 10 a month exactly...But hey look how they treat their customers so the way they treat their employees dont surprise me one bit.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"It was good to talk to people across the United States through the incoming calls. I enjoyed tracking packages, scheduling pickups and ordering supplies. I learned that the 911 system in the US has given many rural customers a different address, and two addresses was bound to cause some confusion for package delivery personnel! I liked being able to set in with two other people and have a conference call with management, letting them know about various areas where call flow/computer programs could be improved. My coworkers were fun to be with. The hardest part of the job was that my scheduled changed continually. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I was able to solve problems for the customers and help them receive their packages"
good,I learned how to listen to customers and satisfy. This job was fairly easy it was a call center with sprint pcs has a client. There was bonuses sometimes. They had little advancement and a high turnover rate.
good,I think the company is okay But I don't think it's a good job for long term..
good,"No cab facility for employees even for a night shift."
good,"Salary is quite low and there is no sick pay. Training and support is very basic. The culture is not particularly professional, this role is best suited to young or first time applicants."
good,"no advancement "
good,"It's not terrible if you need 40 hours a week for work at minimum wage or slightly higher."
good,No job security and no good salary. Management will throw you out no matter how much experience you have in past with the same company. So better find a good company to work or regret later. Thanks
good,If you like to sit around and make money this is the job for you. I personally like to be on the go so it’s not for me. Also if you like being screamed at by people on the phone and not being able to even say even I’m sorry I don’t feel like I need to be Yelled at or anything than this is the job for you as well.  My time at concentrix was okie at the beginning the end was just horrible the one team leader doesn’t do anything you ask her for help she acts as if your bothering  her. Lots of hours which also if okiwnother than I would like to see my children at some point while they are still young. As far as advancement they tell you and tell you there is room to move up but good luck a lot of people don’t make it past the training.
good,I worked with Concentrix when the Spectrum mobile launched back in July of 2018. They kept it very quiet until recently and told us our Spectrum mobile account will be closing. They wanted to relocate us to a different account with lower benefits and pay and more sales enforced. Dead end job with poor management.
good,"A typical workday can be very stressful, that comes with the type of call center it is. I did learn how to multitask better. This particular site, management is not helpful or respectful. They don't take work problems that you may have seriously. The environment is like being back in high school, there is a lot of gossip and childness on the floor. I worked there for a year and a half never received the benefits I was told I would get. They wouldn't take medical problems seriously.  The hardest part of the job is the job itself, Great for anyone who handles stress well. Personally, I did not enjoy this job, it's wasn't a great workplace for me. I liked working as an onstar representative, did not like the site environment."
good,"Please note that this is the Concentrix before. I don't know about the current one, but when I was working with the company, it was my first call center job. I only liked the training part. That's it. Trainers here are superb. I didn't like the management. There was favoritism going on and as well as power tripping. I learned a lot though, especially when it comes to technical stuff."
good,"Your job is to answer phones - that's it!  "
good,"Its a job but not a career.  You learn a lot, mostly is on the fly. "
good,Como contratis no es una buena compania... le falta estabilidad
good,The equipment is old and outdated. The chairs made me have to get back pain physical therapy. The place is dirty and loud. There is no room for any type of advancements.
good,"Training was fast paced had to learn on the floor taking calls. When I started the floor was packed, turnover is unbelievably high favoritism abounds communications consists of accusations of not meeting expectations HR rules are ignored for certain people. Work here as a bridge to a better job."
good,"The job itself is great. They provide sufficient training and a decent nesting period. The on site staff is great, but the number of vital things that are out of your control (ie: schedule, OT) makes the job stressful for some."
good,Management was good.I learned many new things.problem means harder part was getting leaves.On Friday they arranged fun Friday for us & also Food festival arranged in cafeteria.
good,No social life with having to work unsociable hours. Great banter in work but this was over shadowed by the work hours. Always working weekends until 8pm.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Needs to pay agents more..also give incentives..management is horrible and very unorganized! If you’ve been there for awhile there’s no guaranteed raise. Benefits are a joke.
good,Convergys is not a place I would recommend to just anybody. It is poorly managed at the moment. They have been requiring mandatory overtime . The way they do their stats isn't fair
good,It's okay.. Not that great.. It was good earlier.. Very less benefits. Can do much better one they have proper leadership.. Shift timings are awful.. Pay isn't that good either
good,"Below average salary, but benefits are average, Good for entry-level customer service / technical support role to jump start professional career in IT, Sales, or Customer Service."
good,the most enjoyable part is when we get to participate in the events. I learned that even if you are already part of the mangement learn to be more considerate to your agents. Hardest part of the job is that you were not able to manage your work-life balance because you are already exhausted because of long work hours
good,"This company has been the worst employment I have ever had, this job is very disorganized, and never really kept their word when it came to hours."
good,i dont like that fact that u have to bid on an schedule and the tl show favoriteism i mean but if you stay to yourself you wont get caught up in any drma
good,"Buen lugar para empezar vida laboral.Ambiente laboral bueno, aprendi trabajo en equipo y managment"
good,"False hope for advancement , Bonus never paid. In the month of January 2015 there was 48% of the staff in the building there for over two months. Would not recommend for along time."
good,"Aditya Birla minacs is a Good exposure for all the freshers to learn and a get a god exposure about a MNC"
good,"go in, clock in, take in frustration from customers"
good,When I first started at Convergy's it was my first telecommunication job. I had a great trainer and team leader and I really enjoyed working for the company and on the project.  That all change my second year with convergys. The benefits changed and they were worth nothing and would provide any real coverage.  When we changed to a new project and we were promised that we wouldn't be sent home. The training lasted two weeks and we didn't have access to the systems until the end of the second week.  The hard part of my job was trying to work with HR which is off site and contracted through another company.  The requirement to keep your job were very complicated and training was never provide to help us improve.
good,"The job was easy, it was the lack of respect for the management and rules by others that made this job impossible to work. I was there for a short time but three fights broke out on the call center floor, arguments you name it. Its hard to stay focus and engaged with your customers when you have foolishness going around on a daily. My manager was new to the company and she was on the same level as we were. It wasn't the best experience."
good,"very high turn over rate.  in speaking to a nc desc agrees and can't understand why.  The average age is 21 - 23.  Too much playing on the floor ( call center).  Using profanity and having inappropriate conversations. The team leads (young) sometimes engage in inappropriate actions and conversations as well.  They work on a point system.  11 points gets you terminated.  When going to the restroom outside your scheduled break or lunch thats a partial point, going to lunch or break, being just 1 minute late, this is another partial point.  Even going to a doctors appointment is a point.  I must say that I have never worked under these types of circumstances in my life.  "
good,"The job itself is fine but some of the supervisors micro manage when it is not necessary. The pay is not competitive, they took away chances of bonuses to even increase your pay."
good,"Hard to stay positive with management yelling in the back ground while on the phone and trying to get customer happy and then try to sell them a new phone, internet and tv"
good,"Typical day at convergys will consist of answering phones all day, not expected to take any unscheduled breaks. Dealing with rude co-workers, people who we have to tell customers that are ""supervisors"" who are really just regular agents like us. Team Leaders who say they are willing to help and than will turn you down the minute you ask for it. Unlimited overtime but all type of stipulations to the hours."
good,"The work itself was the only enjoyable aspect of working for Convergys. Management was amazingly dishonest and disingenuous. (On one occasion the project manager came around and promised us overtime pay if we would stay ½ hour past our normal shift for the week. The company then found a clever way not to pay the overtime) Convergys relies primarily on NEGATIVE reinforcement but they claim otherwise. The overriding characteristic of management seems to be hard heartedness. The majority of them seem to enjoy degrading employees, especially in front of others during meetings. Many in management are very immature and often result to insulting an employee they do not like. Those who show compassion will have difficulty advancing."
good,"High stress job, multi tasking is a must, no room for advancement or pay increase"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Managers aren't aware of how or what job they are doing let alone be able to help agents. Very stressful environment, terrible health insurance. Good starter job to train in customer service."
good,they would tell you a different job description and they will uptrain you to the point that you are doing everything already in one go. there will be no increase despite that
good,"Had fun till they closed. Wish they didn't close. This review requirement is to demanding. Had more fun at Converges.W Hy "
good,"I worked for the Turbotax Product Support, This was a horrible company. I didn't enjoy it at all. We trained for one week and was  thrown on to the floor after ONLY ONE WEEK. We were given sources to find our information but its like .... MORE TRAINING PLEASE. LOL."
good,"Plan vacations for members that tend to put you down or freely say we are second class. Management would frequently change what is acceptable vs. what was not. Too many inconsistencies. The goal for RCI is to ""ramp up"" for the busy months and to let go as many they can."
good,"Convergys was a very relaxed and fun, but at the same time very stressful place to work. If offered a non-customer service position I would go back to work there."
good,Current program will be dissolved however emolyees will be reprofile to another account. I am looking for a company that provides good benefit and opportunity to grow professionally and personally. A company that boosts employee's morale and promotes people first.
good,"Convergys is the type of place you walk into and instantly get bad vibes. I had my interview, thought ""oh this is a great place to work for"" until I got hired. As soon as you're hired you are basically doomed."
good,"This company is a call center and have very strict rules regarding staying at your desk.  There is favoritism that is extremely obvious and if you don't play the right game you are not going to advance in the company.  If you need to learn something new, you may get a 10 minute training lesson on the subject and then go back to your desk and expect to know what you are doing.  There are a couple of managers there that have true ethics and will not fall from policy."
good,It's a job. I needed a job and they hired me. Pay is not commensurate with my experience. Learned new skill set. Current manger is great. Time keeping is too intrusive.
good,"Was able to learn a lot from this company. Unfortunately they are not the best place to work for extended periods of time.  I was able to move up fairly quickly, if that's what you're interested in."
good,Too many issues with the project I worked on and management wouldn't assist with the customer. It was all about the bottom line and the average handle time on the phone instead of addressing the issue at hand.
good,"Troubleshooting computers made me very happy! Often, it can take time to pinpoint the issue before you can resolve it. It was key to be able to see the problem and fix it in 22 minutes or less. I also worked 2 yrs to get a day shift so I could be available evenings and weekends for my elderly mother only to lose it to a shift bid."
good,"The typical work day was come in sign into your phone, and take calls."
good,"Initially when I started working for the company, I loved working there but since being there, I see entirely too much favoritism and many of the team leads do not know the job that well. They consistently have to go to the senior representatives for guidance and direction."
good,"Working there was decent, hours are hard to be flexible with, computer always have issues, barely can find tech support. no time for breaks. can get very stressful."
good,A good job for people who are just starting out in the call center field. It will give you a lot of experience on the phone talking with doctor offices and patients.
good,"Answered calls in high call environments, assisted customers with billing, upgrades, etc.I learned to listen 70%  to the customers and 30% taklking with customers, the hardest part of my job is or was not being able to assist customers because they  have the highest package for cable.."
good,"Convergys is a 3rd party employed by Directv and ATT, and primary revenue is earned by how many bodies they have working on the phone every second of every day. You're only a number and every second not on a phone is simply lost money to them, regardless of if legitimate cause or not. They do not encourage long-term employment or career growth."
good,"Good job but future security is not guarinteed,and also increament  not possible promotion not possible its not a life time job..."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Convergys is not a good place to work no flexibility in timings and work is very tough to manage and they will treat like a labors.Management is very much biased.
good,"This was a temp assignment. Convergys lost the contract for ATT so, you were either give a date as a last day for the entire group. And you had the option to try and get hired for another project."
good,"I was hired under false pretenses, be sure to clarify everything during your interview. I was hired in july 2016 and laid off jan 2017 because program closed and had to many points to transfer to a different program they used me to there advantage and than laid me off"
good,"typical day consists of trudging to work and hoping you find a computer to use, then trying to get logged in before you are docked a quarter of a day for being 1 minute late, then trying to meet ridiculous apple metrics, then finding out your schedule has been changed yet again, so the plans you made for 2 weeks from now are not going to happen unless you take an occurrence or happen to get approved for some PTO. all in all, if it's the last place you have available, take it, otherwise, go somewhere, anywhere, else."
good,I am not a fan of this company. You do get 40 hours a week but when you first start you work the 4pm to 1am shift and this was very hard for me with being a single mother.
good,Good pay and benefits but with all the back to back calls & rude providers/members we have to deal with on a daily basis it's hard on your mental health. Would love to stay but do not like being told one thing and then management doing another.
good,The pay at this company is low for the work you do compared to in-house customer service companies.  You are required to manage to multiple different KPI and often times they can be completely at odds with eachother.   Management doesn't get much training in management.  Sometimes you get people who are great and sometimes you don't and you feel stuck.  This company would do well with an on going development plan to help move people up to the next level.    Hardest part of the job is letting people go for things that are uncontrollable like internet issues or illness.  Most Enjoyable part is when you get to see people exceed and move up towards their goal.
good,"Very stressful work environment. Training was very good, but after your done with training your expected to pretty much know how to work the computers like its been your life.  They kept changing my ""team"" which in part changed what shift I was on which conflicted many times with doctors appointments.  Was a very disappointing work experience."
good,Managers and Supervisors are not trained on the job we do. It hurts employees. the pay is low the hours are long. minacs training lacks. employees lack customer service skills.
good,This company was ok. There is always an opportunity for people to get a kick start in a new field. They hire a variety of people.
good,"If you aren't really close with the management then chances are you aren't going to do very well. "
good,job security is not always promised. there are no or very little values with this company. doesn't work with any schedule besides the one they give you
good,"A Good place to work"
good,"A typical day at work for me started at 9:55 AM, the daily routine was pretty much consistent day after day. By the time I clocked in I would have to be sure to have all of my systems up and functioning properly ready to take the first call. On occasion we would have team meetings and we would then learn anything new that the company would like for us to know and also discuss if we were having difficulties with anything and how we could help one another out. Management was okay, not the best but okay. My co-workers are what made my job enjoyable to go to everyday, most times people were full of laughs, and encouragement. The hardest part of the job is knowing that you will never have a consistent schedule, every week you have a different off day so you can never just make plans and set things in stone week after week. The most enjoyable part of the job was my role, which included helping others in need, being able to teach others, and encourage others."
good,"I never ever worked somewhere that caused me so many issues.. At times yes Convergys wasn't such a bad place to work but I don't recommend it to anyone, some of the people including the management have no idea what's going on other then numbers are dropping, I was pulled into meeting all the time so my phone time was always off or other numbers were dropping, if one little thing wa wrong you were in trouble. I had to fight with a lot of stress and depression because nothing was ever good enough for those people, later they spread rumors around about me and another co worker."
good,Answered calls from perturbed customers regarding delivery of their newspaper.  Signed new customers to yearly or short term suscriptions and renewals
good,"My typical day is checking all software is running smoothly, if not then paper documentation takes place. I review sales performance for all sales representatives and provide daily, weekly and monthly feedback to ensure that all policy and procedure is met. "
good,assist members and providers with information. we transfer calls that do not involve with medicare advantage plans.
good,"This company is the worst I've ever worked for. Management is awful, and theres such a high turnover (with good reason) that no one seems to know whats going on at any point. They micro manage to such a ridiculous point, that we were actually told NOT to time out our system to go to the bathroom UNLESS IT WAS A SCHEDULED BREAK. What? "
good,"Fun place to work, no advancements. Co worker are great. Hardest part is working with customers that are angry"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"No work life balance, poor benefits and negative corporate culture, pay is very low in comparison to similar jobs in the area"
good,"Job was fast paced, very stressful at times, no job security, you were just a number to this company. You had to follow call scripts and company guidelines and watch your call times"
good,"Call center, inbound calls 40 or more depending on the day. Learned to adapt to the high volume of calls.  Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to assist the customer and solve their call issue."
good,The workplace and the job was good but was not an enthusiastic one.
good,Depending on the Client and the current MO determined how the work was. 
good,"I worked there for serveral years, first in basic customer service and then in investigative soulitions, then after a short time was trained to be an account manager. I enjoyed the people I got to help and speak to daily. I enjoyed my co-workers and are stilll great friends today. I am sad that Capital One decided to outsource and that the department closed."
good,I love my job because I get to serve customers everyday. I go into work and talk on the phone for 10 hours a day and help customers solve their problems. The management is okay because the turnover rate is crazy. You may have one team leader one day and the next day they are no longer there. The hardest part of my job is to make sales when people do not want to hear what you are saying. I make good money on the sales that i make but I hate shoving services down customers throat. if you do not make sales you will get fired. i belive that if you are a customers service representative you should help the customer first and sale later.
good,There's a lot to deal with. It can be kind of hard working for two different company's that do things a little differently and are not together as far as being organized and giving us accurate information to share with members. Makes it a little frustrating.
good,A typical day was to log into your work station and log call after call.
good,"Company is prefered for carrier starting guys, not for freshers. Most of the teams are seating side by side, we can learn multiple technologies from different teams."
good,Interacting with senior leadership on a daily basis to achieve and maintain excellent customer service while delivering the best customer experience.  Making the necessary changes to operating procedures to meet business goals.  Working directly with the customer to address any questions or concerns. Assisted the  director of operations.
good,This was a nice place to start moving up in the work force. I would say my time here has helped me get better jobs but while you're there you really have to out your life and mental health on hold if anything happens while you work there.
good,I worked there when it was convergys worked for a yr as soon as it got taken over by this company everybody got fired I left on my own no raises  n the bonus are only from 75$ to 120$
good,"I worked for more than a year & was amongst the best performers but would like say that I had to work like a slave with the worst management & the worst process (jio)."
good,"answered calls, provided directions, explained the hands free calling service in the car, the WiFi service in the car, vehicle diagnostics and assisting with emergency services"
good,"The management is not well organized. During training and hiring you are told conflicting things then when you actually start doing the job. Your hours will vary and hardly ever change. The days off they give you is random, and if you receive a graveyard shift the only way to get a different shift is to switch with someone. So if no one want to switch then your stuck. They don’t drug test, but a lot of companies don’t. All in all just an ok place to work.place is for 18-20 years olds"
good,"The program that I was on was terminated, they said the program was not making enough money for the company, the sales goals kept going up every year and I felt they were unrealistic. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with my fellow employees, they made my day."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I got the experience I needed to move on. They are infested with bedbugs and refuse to clear it up. Management are all bullies. So if you need experience go there get it and get out.
good,There was an entry was that had 3 fights of stairs.  The only way you were unable to use the ground level entrance was to have a Dr's note.  There were a few people that needed the ground level entrance but they were unable to go to the Dr. as they could not afford it.
good,"My experience there was the worst, it started from the interview. The training was 6 weeks, the trainee was uneducated about the business. All she did was play games and come to class high. It took other trainers to teach us half of what we know. Transition was not great at al, we all learned everything on our own. Because of that we received bad surveys, coaching, and ad hoq’s. Everyone in the building in the top department knew we had not been fully trained. To be honest we have a job fair every week and everyone’s doing part time that comes in. The majority of them are drug addicts or strippers needing money for the day or week. The whole set up is ridiculous, the best agents receive the worst treatment. The team leads are useless, they don’t help, you would be lucky to get them on the phone, when needed. If you want a job just to make it until you get the job you need just try it out, but I’m not making no promises. You have to park A WHOLE ENTIRE MILE UP THE STREET IF YPU COME IN AT 7AM. Oh and you work like a robot there."
good,"long term pros to this company are far and few between. this is good for a short term position. this was supposed to be a 6 month job while i found better work, it has now been 6 years"
good,During training it’s great but once on the floor it’s sale sale sale. Team leads don’t help with an issue unless it’s closing a sale. Job runs rampant with lesbians hitting on you and also men if you’re a woman. It’s a job not a dating playground. When it comes to bonus payouts for some reason they are never right. Remember this job has a high turnover rate for a reason it’s not as great as it appears
good,Started as a great place in the outbound portion however it teaches you bad habits and does not at all prepare you for your transition to the inbound side. The call queue was insane and if calls were not dispositioned correctly it was very easy to fall behind.
good,It was a cool company. Very Strict and cut throat. Management was terrible. They always promoted the wrong people. They would make you jump through all these hoops to just reject you. They would basically use you.
good,I had never worked in a call center before and I hopefully will never again.  Static environment - poor leadership- I honesty do not know about other call centers but this one left me weary.
good,My Job was gutted from technical support to selling someone else to do said support that was not trained and i was much better than at doing.  Left because they froze wages and were swtiching us to sales
good,It was stressful on the mental part. Sitting for hours at a time and having to take nonstop phone calls where you could get cussed out but you just never know what to expect from each customer.
good,"place is fun chilled out environment, management is not good , expect you to take breaks at inappropriate times, normal day involves taking calls and dealing with customers in the best possible way"
good,They promise one on one training but never follow through. they look for reasons to get rid of you. poor management. They have no dedication to seasoned employees. Compared to others then
good,just go to the job and handle your business and then go home. There are a lot of people working there some with and without the same positive work methods. Mind your business and do your work.
good,The culture has deminshed but we have a new site director who is trying to turn it around. Has potential if we can get the right type of staff in place.
good,I liked working here but it didn't pay enough. Everyone was very nice and fun to be around. The Supervisors and managers were all fun to work with. They always had some type of game going to make the job fun.
good,Convergys is very unprofessional.  The team leaders don’t really care. Their HR manager is never there. The project I work on is paid the least when it does the most work. Convergys is just now trying to implement their policies after the policies were not clearly being followed. The atmosphere there is terrible. There is always  drama
good,"Working at Convergys is an ok Job, I am appreciative of the opportunities I embarked upon. I am not pleased with the work ethic of some of the management team. Its only what you make it."
good,"The pay is not good high enough for what all services are required with now being apart of AT&T such as (Directv services and the sales of mobility as well) We are provided in cases incentivites for meeting goals then found out that it all gets taxed at the end of the year. The point system for attendace is terrible due to there aren't sick days to take, paid vacation time, and allowed 12 pts for the year. The metric system used seems to be off and goals to meet are sometimes bizzare considering the department I work in (CLG.) I must say that there are a  few people that are excellent accents to the company and take the time out to help when in need."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"It look to me that management favored Haitians or Jamaicans as employees and advancements... Culture limits if you are not dark skin you will be in a very small  minority group."
good,I was a customer service rep on the phone I help the customers with the services provided for them and if I could not help them I transfer them to somebody that could that was my job that's what I did for this company.
good,The only reason I stayed in this company because of the location. 15 minutes away from my grandfather's house that is why I can save money for transportation. I can't say much now with regards to the management because it has been years since I left the company.
good,"This was one of the worst companies I worked for. This company has no FMLA regulations, I had FMLA problems and this company does not work with you when you have family problems. This company doesn't care if you are having any kind of problems, you reach the points level and you are done. At Convergys you are just a number."
good,"Super easy job and decent pay. A few of my immediate managers were amazing, but higher up the food chain was another story. Very political environment as far as promotions go. High school drama all around."
good,The room for growth is limited. It is unprofessional. I will say it is okay for a young person trying to get experience but not for a older adult trying to make a living. If they paid better I would still be there and if the environment wasn't so unprofessional. I enjoyed being on the phone and talking to the pharmacist because most of them are professional and your not getting yelled at all day. If you can deal with unprofessional co-workers than this might work for you. As I stated above for someone just needing a job for experience in a call center go for it! Always good to put on a resume. Oh yeah my trainer was good Gordon a little dry but he knows what he knows his stuff.
good,"this was far from being a decent job, you are paid pretty much minimum wage for work that other companies pay a lot higher salary for. I would definetly not recomend"
good,Average. Not too good as  a company. Good enough for a call center. Vocab training is good. Microsoft process training is good. Trainer are friendly and encouraging
good,"This company only cares about themselves, not their employees. Their management is poor, their systems constantly shut down in the middle of a call or sometimes won't log in at all and then the employees are reprimanded for the company's mistake. The training is not put together well. There's alot of confusion as to what is the right information and what is wrong."
good,"It used to be an IBM company however , acquired by Concentrix, most of the benefits has changed , if it won't be because of the people I worked with , I may have resigned a long time ago."
good,The environment is extremely stressful if you are a Critical Situation Manager. Benefits are too expensive and the pay is too low for the amount of work.
good,"Working at a call center is not for everybody and it definitely was not for me. Between the rude customers and the uninspired management staff, the employees felt isolated and alone most of the time."
good,"Almost all customers calling in are not happy.  It is your job to resolve their problems and make them happy within the company's guidelines.  Very difficult to do."
good,"Management needs more training. A lot of favoritism at this job, and a lot of gossip amongst coworkers. I would not try to go back or recommend to anyone."
good,"hectic work and long hours"
good,"It used to be a great place but not any more, decent transport, pathetic medical assistance and other benefits"
good,"One of the companies that need to work alot to give their employee the best place to work , salary is way below the min wages"
good,I learned how to use they're walk through system.Also how to keep a customer on the line & make sure they're satisfied. A lot of office drama. And very little opportunity to move positions.
good,Management have poor management skills and the company do not take care of their employees. this company Doesn't care about their employees will being.
good,"I enjoyed my job for the most part, the last few months were extremely stressful."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Convergys has some good benefits including tuition reimbursement. Work environment can be unprofessional. There is little opportunity for advancement.
good,"Minacs was great for the first few months for me. I did not have a team lead when I started and when one was finally assigned she was a person I could not stand. After she came in all teams had to sit together in assigned seating rows and she was always standing over your shoulder or watching your screen to make sure you are doing the correct things. The main annoyance outside of the clear lack of trust on how we are doing our jobs is, the lead was not trained in the area we were working in which thus meant she had no idea of if we were doing our jobs correctly or not."
good,Great opportunity if you have hit rock bottom and just need a check to get by. Do not look for any chance to advance. Turn over rate is high. Worked there for 3 years with no raise. Overtime is available.
good,This job was really hard to get in to because of the lack of caring from management and the company itself since it's outsourced.
good,"The work environment is OK, for this company. The only down fall that I would give them, is not holding up to their word. I mean, they tell you that if you have a family emergency or your car breaks down. that they will work with you. They do not work with you, and they are never their when you need them. The management team is only their on weekdays, and non-existent on weekends."
good,Technically very strong job profile. Good team work. N day Shifts is the hardest part of the job. Bad Management. Team Outings and dinners at regular time interval.
good,"I would not recomend working at convergys/ stream. most of the employees are ghetto, unprofessional and unorganized. the security staff is pretty nice but upper management is horrible"
good,"Not a bad place to work, management was on the same accord and very knowledgeable about the company and its goals. The pay wasn't that good, but i left work everyday with my sanity!"
good,"Working for Convergys was a learning experience every day. The people were outstanding, but the third party company that paid the bills and benefits had their own rules on how long a person should be working in one position  or location at a time. Too many restrictions on how well or advanced I needed to do my job to the best of my abilities. If the third party company was a different sponsor, I would still be employed. Convergys is a great place to work for as long as their third party company is more people oriented as well as profit minded."
good,"Management treats their favorites with benefits and flexibility, but get on the wrong side and you're likely to be terminated for any reason they can find.  Once in management you are treated horribly and expected to work as many hours as it takes to get unreasonable expectations completed. "
good,"Trainer didn't have experience taking calls and was not up to date on the material she was teaching us.  When we started on the floor taking calls it was extremely stressful due to lack of training.  The company treated employees like a number, replaceable.  They did not expect their employees to have lives."
good,Inside sales. They were not organized and most team leads had no idea what they were doing. They made a lot of changes to ensure that you did not get commission or any incentives. They also would mess up your over time or your check and it would take for ever to get it fixed.
good,This has to be by far the dirtiest place i have ever worked and I worked construction.
good,"I have worked for this company in Tamarac, Florida. They change your schedule every other day, they mess up your hours then take weeks to compensate you correctly. I will never and have never."
good,Pay is too low for stuff that you need to deal with day to day with the poor management and no accountability.
good,No advancement for ppl who deserve it. I liked it when I came aboard the turn rate is extremely high and they cut the hrs a lot.
good,We always worked long hours which is good for pay but have to go home to sleep to wake up the next day to come in to work.
good,"It is an okay job and it pays well. Yet, personally people there are not very nice and is not very positive."
good,Convergys takes incoming calls from subcontracted companies clients. It's your job to pretend to work for the subcontracted company and comply with their needs. Convergys itself simply provides a decent workplace environment with computers and headsets. In general the people who work there are very nice.
good,this was a relations job with customers that allows you to build confidence when handling customer service complaints and problems. Great experience.
good,Poor Health and Dental care. Bad Management services if you needed help it would take a manager forever to resolve an issue or to help if you needed help with a situation.
good,The job wants you to work work work work and they do not want to pay. They are taking their business to other countries that way they can pay cheaper rates to their workers. I will never work for Convergys again.
good,"There were no typical days here. Each day was different then the next regarding the rules of the company and the rules of what we needed to achieve personally. The management did not handle things very well. Hardly received performance reviews and they were never on the production floor when a problem came about. The co-workers were great, very up beat and energetic. The most enjoyable part of the job would have to be the team work. My ""team"" consisted of around 15 people and it was great having help from those people to make me better at my job."
good,"Extremely short breaks, horrible working hours. They refuse to work around your schedule and set unrealistic sales goals."
good,They don’t really prepare you.  It feels like they prepare themselves for your departure.   The morale is extremely low and the turnover rate is extremely high.
good,"This place fits the entire Customer service stereotype, from peers to superiors, nobody seems to know what is really going on. You have no say in your hours regardless of your skill or tenure. Alot of broken promises from management. You could ask for support or guidance but get a different answer from every person you reach out to and for every person there is to reach out to there is also a person who's job it is to point out your every mistake. Micromanaging at its finest with none of it being positive. Not an employee friendly job and not worth the extra 2 dollars you couldnt get at your last hourly call center"
good,"Got a long way to go to build the culture or a perfect work life balanced place - No appreciation for the hard work that is put   by any employee."
good,"Paid less as compared to the job they are providing."
good,Its ok I got hit with wrong timing of events in my life it was an ok job. I wanted to stay but wrong timely in my life. They don't work very well with you
good,"great opportunity. Regardless of management experience, all the skills I earned helped me and equipped me with all the needed knowledge to survive in home based jobs."
good,"Little to no chance to advance and no concern for life outside of work, single parents beware they typically will not work with you or if they do its short lived and you are judged based on your need to miss work"
good,It feels as if this company treats you a number. If you meet the stat requirements then this job is satisfied. There isn't anything else to it. Your well being means nothing to them. There only concern is the stat requirements they need to appease satisfy their client
good,"If you love talking on the phone then this job is great for you, management will push you to SALES! Policies are strictly followed. Overall its not a bad job if you like sitting and talking on the phone."
good,"The claims analyst position has constant pressure to do more; even though you are doing your very best all the time. The have unrealistic expectations, and whoever quoted the fee for claims processing clearly did not know what they were doing. No matter what you produce, it's not enough. Also, day team is so rigidly watched you feel like a child. No talking, no drinking, no eating, only work. work, work, without question or relief. "
good,Working here it is okay. Some days it can be very stressful. The pay is decent. The management could be better. I wouldn't leave this job if I didn't have too. But I am now pregnant and my health is not taking into consideration. This job doesn't care what you are going through or about your health.
good,"When I was working with the first manager I had, the job was great!  I had great support and was free to ask questions.  However, they changed managers on me and the new one, I believe, felt I was presenting competion  for her position.  She found fault with everything I did and caused me to be let go.  I objected, and appealed to high up with no positive result."
good,"It's a call center.  Need I say more?"
good,"As far as Convergys flexibility goes, they could be more  considerate of single parents and hours that are being requested at the time of hiring.  They wouldn't be flexible with me as far as my school and home schedule was and were very nonchalant about my situation."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,If you like the constant change of your work life then its a good place for you. They do work with you but are sneaky about some of the stuff they do.
good,I actually enjoyed working here since it was convenient for me to travel from my place to their site but what made me decide to go was not because of the not so competitive pay or the work hours but because of the people who are supposed to be the leaders or mentors but are acting unprofessionally.
good,The managers dont care if something comes up in your personal life and you have to miss work. Better hope you dont have kids and they go to daycare cause they'll schedule you to work even if you told them you couldnt.
good,Convergys is an okay place to work.. It just wasnt the job for me. People are nice. Flexiable hours. Was an okay job. Just very stressful customers and having to do some of what was required through there clients was stupid.
good,there were some things that were ok about Convergys but the most off the time way they chop and change department is way to much i changed from 1 department to another more that 7 times in 4 months their was not thought and basic training they did not train you that well
good,"This job was in Edmonton, was Customer service rep for incoming "
good,You are hired as an inbound Customer service representative. Then once you are on the floor taking calls they start putting sales requirements on you in order for you to keep your job.
good,"At CVG it's a must that you learn to adapt quickly to changes. The process that was discussed today may not be the same for tomorrow or the following days. "
good,"pay and benefits where great, Management seemed a little over worked. I would have loved to continue working with them but due to mental health problems it is not suitable for me."
good,"I started working for turbotax when I came to this job. After it ended, I transferred to Cigna. This job is very stressful and I think we deserve more pay for all that we do."
good,"The company was pretty controlling. Could only take a break when your were scheduled. Not allowed to have a drink at your station, supervisors were hard to locate when you needed them."
good,"while working there, was difficult to know what management wanted.  You were talked to about taking too many calls (about 15-20 a day) and then talked to about not enough calls for the day."
good,"I was at Convergys for a while and did a bunch of stuff - an understatement."
good,it was a great and fun palce to work i worked ther 7.5 years befor they closed the center otherwise i would still be there. My team leader and ops manger were great they understood and worked with you if you needed someone to talk to.
good,"The campaign I was working on was acquired by Concentrix in the middle of my employment and at the same time, they were merging with Minacs. The constant changes and lack of clear communication was difficult to deal with. I resigned during the transition. I assume these kinks were worked out with time."
good,"Training I received was not that great. The instructor preferred to play games instead of answering questions.  Insurance was not great, not even good, but was available. Payment for work was poor. Could not get decent schedule. Supervisor said she was there to help but spent her time gossiping with other supervisors instead of helping team."
good,"pressure to perform sales or you are threatened with job loss, very rare to get weekend off. if you need a day off you have to agree to work the weekend example if you need tues off.... you cant work weds instead you have to work on your cheduled wekend day off"
good,"The people who work here for the most are very nice and helpful when you need help with a customer on the phone, and don't have the answer yourself. However when you first sign up, and in the interview they tell you that there is no selling involved in the job and then a week in to training they tell you need to generate so many leads for the sales guys as part of your job, which really annoys me because I don't like to sell things and if I knew that was part of the job I wouldn't have taken it. Also bottom line its just not a place you can work long term especially if advancement and getting ahead is important to you because there is no room for that at this company."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Typical call center, pay is lower than competitors in area.  Good for entry position, but no long term structures for career advancements.  Management is poor, and the good ones aren't treated any differently to the poor ones.  Worst part of the job is the training is terrible."
good,"Overall, if you are more technical this is a good place to work. Company relies on customer survey responses for job performance. If you receive a survey result that is negative about the product, you are still accountable even if it is not about your service."
good,Job Work/Life Balance is not that good. I had health problems because of it. They don't prioritize the employee's health condition. Medical certificates are not validated.
good,"A typical day at Concentrix is stressful and draining. Although I love what I do I think that management here is very poor. They are not very knowledge about processing claims. I understand that their role is to manage but you can't be successful in managing when you're not knowledgeable about what those you're responsible for managing really does. In other words, you can't lead me anywhere you have not been. There is no professionalism. This company doesn't look out for it's employees like it should. If the employees are not priority then clients will be even less of a priority."
good,"Totally expected the high paced customer service call center environment but training was awful due to multiple issues with the software and software support team.   The software issues detracted from the training and once out of training it was a learn on the job situation.   Also learned that trainer was a temp employee who was also frustrated at software issues but attempted to prepare us for role of c/s rep as much as they could."
good,everything can change at the drop of a hat. You can walk in and drastic changes would be written on easels. You may not even notice if you walk in the wrong door. If they don't get enough people to voluntarily commit to overtime mandatory overtime is out into place. that is usually the cast on weekends or holidays. No one wants to work. We are told that if we make certain sales goals by a certain time we will get a bonus. If not enough of us make those numbers none of us get the bonus. Floor management lacks people skills and treat people like dogs. they make noise that can be heard by customers and distract from our professionalism. the environment in the center is like a zoo.
good,if you're looking for a temporary job then this is a good one. They have problems with management and aren't really flexible with real life problems. But they do offer overtime and sometimes its unlimited as well as some theme months
good,"You get paid fairly. It's an easy job, with no real complaints other than the management and working hours. You change shifts every three months, and it's just annoying."
good,"They stress the bonus but it is taken out from your taxes"
good,"The job was fun."
good,"management is horrible, crazy hours (only good if you need the money and dont have a social life) friendly co-workers. some nice team leaders. Work is draining though."
good,Convergys was a work at home position and provided some options to have a fairly easy workday. Transitioning from a work at home position to daily home life was easier
good,empresa com ambiente e cultura fortes mais que possui areas a serem melhoradas
good,Answered phone calls for time share owners. Trade time shares with others so the time share owners could visit different places. Very stressful work place
good,They were all about numbers and stats. This was for the At&t dept at convergys. They would fire people for long handle times things of that nature. Learned many customer service skills and communication skills.
good,There was so many screens you had to pull up and also had to have different passwords for each screen. There was all these federal guidelines we had to go by but didnt show it in our pay.
good,"Great campaign at the start, but went downhill rapidly.  Majority of the managers haven't got a clue and the night shift atmosphere has had the life drained out of it!"
good,"I would  accept incoming calls about sprint customer phones. Most calls were about programming phones, tech support, and their bills. There were a lot of calls that were successful and also a lot of disgruntled customer."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"This is a great starter job if you do not have a college degree or have a sorted background."
good,The job environment was nice however the management did not make sure training was proper for the types of troubleshooting that needed to be done. They don't care for any issues if it's not revolving around the company. I think k with better training classes better pay with different new training certifications it would make the job better. More advancement with in the job and a different structure for the survey's and how the performance merit goes.
good,"providing technical support assistance to Dell customers."
good,Too much stress on the account joined. The environment is also not that good as too many people are not being nice to each other. Mostly you have to work longer as there are limited people working on the site.
good,Good job if your fresh out of high school and don't plan on being there for no longer than 6 months not a job anyone would want to retire from........
good,not sure how a typical day was never actually made it to the floor i was employed for the training period. Due to some family sickness I had to resign from this job. During my training I did manage to get a couple sales.
good,"A Typical day at work starts early in the morning generally with a team meeting about the predicted amount of calls and if VGH( Voluntary Go Home) is available, With the additional 1 hr of trouble shooting the system after so if you do not take VGH you either get told to go home or get gossiped about because the company does not make money if you are not taking call. Supervisors gossip about co workers and The higher up bosses call you an unfit millennial if you are not there for longer then 6 months."
good,"make sure dont work for a company, who u r their numbers to fill it in,as an requirement"
good,When you're off they call you about work. Its predominantly african americans and not cultured enough. No real management. No organization and its 3rd party so you have to do everything the client says.
good,"this job sucks, I hated all the supervisors no set schedule, short breaks, restroom usage monitored and supervised, the only good thing about working here is the free ice machine and the free tampons in the bathroom. no room to live a normal life working here, too many call, feels like slavery"
good,definitely not the greatest atmosphere but its a job that is decent. management isn't really supportive and training is lacking. there was a great lunch room.
good,"•	Assisted supervisor with daily operation."
good,"extremely busy call center , management sometimes ill-equipped, hardest part of the job was being in a queue and no break whatsoever between calls, not enough time to note accounts, enjoyable part was co-workers"
good,Excellent place for people who do not like change and have no ambition of advancement. I worked for two separate projects within the company and was offered a leadership position without any compensation.
good,"Convergy's was a very demanding job.  Having to help already upset people fix problems.  On top of that, we had to try to upsell the customer with additional products.  As for job advancement, the politics were CRAZY.  People that really deserved the jobs were overlooked for ""friends"" of the hiring manager."
good,"When I worked at Converges, I used to come in when the call center would open which was 8 o'clock in the morning and work 12 hr shifts. All I did at the call center was take calls for Atnt and Directv, the calls would be a mixture of retention calls, sales calls and canceling services. The hardest part about my job was working 12 hr shifts six days a week. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping customers."
good,"Answering phones that are watch/listened and time. have to use ""their way"" of talk or can get into trouble. Not good training, did enjoy talking to clients though but they can get rude if they feel that you don't know your stuff."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"this was a sales position that I assisted customers with the purchase and set up of new television services. This was a very fast energetic environment that allowed us to carry over that same excitement to the customers when closing a new account. I simply answered questions for the customers about the programming available, while making polite suggestions on how to personalize their services."
good,"Managers do not care to help, Hectic Environment. No real general sense of whats going on lol Everyone is a chicken with their head cut off. Not professional once youre an employee."
good,"Always trained for techinal rep,right after training with billing. Very high call volume sadly no teamleader to help. Have to get use to adult channels and conversation"
good,"If you get sick, they are not accommodating. They restrict your work growth with any setback. if you ever go on a leave, they do not let you back to your position you worked so hard for. Very disappointing. They just ""forgot"" to pay me once and I had to fight to get paid, they wanted me to wait till the next pay period."
good,"Learned to use multiple data bases at one time."
good,Flexible start times. I learned a great deal about computer tech support and application. Management is not open door and lack transparency. The work culture is open and friendly. The most difficult part of the job is receiving support from upper management. The most enjoyable part is bonuses.
good,"The break rooms are atrocious. The had cable at one point of time, but currently it is off. The television sits there turned off. half of management aren't aware of the procedure. They only look and sound professional when the client is in the building. No encouragement to the employees. Management is not consistent."
good,"I did not like this job at all, first your work schedule would change on a weekly basis never stayed the same, then you are required to sell on every call this is mandatory and if you didn't you would get in trouble. Not a good place to work."
good,"This was a call center, so we constantly got bashed with calls, breaks were limited and management wasn't really helpful when you asked for help."
good,"Good training program but horrible HR and operations manager oversight. Quality of new recruits is next to none, which in turn causes turnover and poor customer satisfaction."
good,"Unresolved pay dispute since August,  just decided to resigned since management was not been helpful to resolved the issue. And there's bond."
good,Worked at Watertown Convergys for 18 months. Advancement opportunities are non existent. Low pay considering type of work. I enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,"If you have  family emergencies,  this will not be the job for you.  They don't even except doctors note less then 3 days of absence. They pay well but you have to be there everyday"
good,"Ive learned many fine experiences, provided training for employees and fun working environment. The company is located near my home so there is no problem with transportation."
good,"When I first started at Concentrix I loved it, everyone was easy going and I loved going to work. A couple months after I started I had developed serious heart problems that were hindering my everyday life. There were days I couldn't even breathe and get out of bed. Concentrix did not like that at all. Then my grandfather passed away, something they didn't like me taking off work for either. On my day off while on vacation with my family my boss called me from his personal phone on his day off to basically throw it in my face that I had missed so much. Everyday missed I had a doctors note for or was grieving with my family. But that didn't matter, it was either quit or go to one more doctors appointment and get fired. So word of advice to ANYONE don't apply there if you know you won't be there every single day. With or without an excuse."
good,"Friendly environment with good cafeteria food. The most enjoyable part of the job is, they give great incentives. The co-workers are great I enjoy going to work."
good,Convergys did limited training and did not take the time to help their agents understand the proper ways of the way there software works.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Numbing and annoyingly painful work. Not a good client to represent from a customer service/employee side. It's a very unclean and un-kept work environment. The bathrooms, the carpet, the dust, the lighting. It's frustrating because it has potential to be a really great place... corporate just creates unbearable work standards. I think Minacs has so much it could grow into but right now it is not a workplace I'd recommend to anyone."
good,"Worked for Convergys for four years at Charlotte location off Harris Blvd. They work you like a dog, counting every minute you spend on the phone and off, expecting overtime when it meets their needs. This is a typical call center environment. Some managers are good , some leave much to be desired. With each new year, new hires were paid less money starting out but they do pay a commission on sales. Not a very positive environment to work, poor training overall but they did offer a decent compensation/benefits package. If you do not meet the goals they set, expect a pink slip and the front door. My advice, look elsewhere for a job."
good,"This company is really not great. They come in and buy up smaller companies and then force corporate culture on a bunch of game testers. "
good,"Not enough training and too much expected.  9.00 per hour and support was poor.  things changed daily. I really enjoyed being able to help customers, but was scolded for spending time with them."
good,"This is call center at its finest. Hours change, shortened lunches and system issues. Product flaws and irrate calls. What more can I say?"
good,"Personally, I only applied to work at Convergys because I needed a job fast and I knew that they weren't very difficult to get hired on with. They are a call center that features different projects for groups to work on, and my group was AT&T Technical Chat Support."
good,"They will draw you in saying it's easy to be promoted and great benefits, NOT TRUE. Managers are DRAMA QUEENS and gossip more than agents. I would not recommend this job to anyone who's looking for a ""long-term"" type of job."
good,"A typical day at work for me was pretty hectic theres no room for advancement and the pay cap is not enough to live on.Regardless of that fact I give 100% everyday,"
good,Management is the worst. They are never there until something serious happens. They show  favoritism to those they want. Replace management and you got a great company. Also payroll suck!!! If there is even a payroll.
good,"Assist and educate Customer Service Professionals."
good,I worked as a merchandiser i learned skills such as customer service. Management was not pleasant but coworkers were great
good,I wouldn't recommend the company to others. The salary is low and they don't keep there word on days to work or hours also they were a little disorganized.
good,All calls are inbound and some are just for help not to upgrade. Work environment is casual and relaxed but standards are high to get sales. The hardest part of the job is customer care.
good,I have worked there for over 8 years now and have done many things in the company. Recently the program I am working for in the company is closing and Convergys is doing a horrible time making it easy to deal with. They tell you one thing and then do another. They have nothing but broken promises. No room for advancement in the company. I would have to say though that my co workers are the nicest people to work with.
good,Convergys is a fun work place. I loved working as a team. There are numerous positions that you can apply for. Convergys allow you the opportunity to interact with people all over the world.
good,I have the obtained ability to defuse a situation by handling any situation with care and being attentive to their needs.
good,"dress code best part or the job "
good,Convergys is a great company to work for if your a college student or retiree. If you have a family then the money isn't too good. This company contracts with many business. In my area we worked with AT&T. I have to say working for tech support there was a timed amount that you can talk to a customer. Let's face it some times it takes time to fix a problem. The training offered was OK. My training group was push through. We did get floor training where team leaders would assist us. It's not like you would be thrown out to the wolves.  The employees where a diverse group which was great. Kept things interesting. The customer service side of the job was OK.
good,If you are just starting out in the customer service field Convergys is a great place to start but is not designed to a career.  Advancement is based on who you know not performance and the benefits are horrible.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"answer questions about the security systems for the customer and help them fix any problems with the system, and if not dispatch a tech"
good,"very unstable job environment, poor leadership, the job consisted of many phone calls from customers receiving bad/old information"
good,my day at work is just work its like we can not have a time to breath other then taking a break. i learned that our customer do care about the customer service we give as a team.my co-workers is helpful when we need each other at all time.the hardest part of my job is nothing at all. the most enjoyable part of my job is hearing my calls and to see mt team leader caring for me and what i do to help my customers. i just feel like our hours are so selfish to people who have kids and they dont care about our personal life not at all.
good,"Not many answers knowledge base board changes w/o notice, not very much assistance when necessary to reach out to supervisor or team leads"
good,"management is silly, the is a group of friends, all management and if your not in that group then you will advance nowhere, but your next job, cheers"
good,"Call center rep. "
good,It was a stressful place to work.  What I confirmed was that there are many different types of people in this world.  When you work with so many people you learn to deal with different characters.  The hardest part was staying calm.  The most enjoyable was hearing the gratitude of the people when you were able to help them.
good,typical call centre environmentadequate place of employment some worthwhile challenges some engaging with other departments
good,Working in a fast pace call center. handling customers request. working out any payment arrangement needed for the customer to be able to make payments toward account.
good,"convergys is a job that if you are in school, it would be a good job.  to make it as an career is  very far fetched."
good,The job was good but the pressure was a lot for a call center. The training staff that I had was good but the turnover rate is a lot as well.
good,Stuck behind a desk all evening but overall a easy job. I was first introduced to the Windows 8 operating system. Very little interaction with co-workers.
good,"It is a great start to build experience, however the enviroment of the job feels like highschool and unpleasant."
good,"Simple day at work is when I see my friends/colleagues, we are receiving phone calls everyday. I learned a lot in Convergys Philippines, especially on how to give a good quality of service to our clients, on how to negotiate and pursue our clients to make their responsibilities between our conversation and also how to prolong our patience since that most of the day, we are getting irate customers. Regarding my co-workers, they are friendly, they are good to be with and also, we are helping each other in our team."
good,"•what you learned"
good,"Sale to the customers benefit to get them on their dream vacation. "
good,A typical day at work started with trying to clock in 5 minutes before because being exactly on time was not acceptable. I learned that sometimes you get awesome managers and sometimes you don't and with convergys you didn't have the right to talk to your superiors about your concerns they had no interest in listening. The most enjoyable part of my job was hearing how excited the customers got when you actually fixed their problem that they've been calling about for months.
good,"I've stayed at Convergys so long because of the agents. I care about the people that work there, and that's why I keep showing up. "
good,"Not the best place to work, very unpleasant staff and a substantial amount of conflict."
good,"I have wonderful stats from my customers because I am able to help them. Sales are the hardest part of the job, but it's absolutely wonderful to hear I've been able to help make their day better"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I work crazy hours such as 4:30-1:00 am so I hardly get to see my daughter go down for bed and I hardly ever get to see my husband and I am always tired when I get off work that I cant even go straight to sleep so most of the time I have to stay up and i never go to bed till 4:00 in the morning, I will say that even though I'm doing the same thing over and over again I do love talking to my customers most of the time! The only bad thing is we have to offer and try to sell to everyone on every call and my thing is if they cant afford their phone bill now as it is...how can they afford anything else? Most of my co workers are pretty awesome but some of them refuse to help you what so ever! I have learned that working in that kind of environment you have to be able to have a lot of patience and deal with a lot of ""politics"". And by the time I get paid, (which is every 2 weeks,) after taxes I only make almost $600 (if I am lucky because that's a good check w/o overtime) if I work everyday."
good,"I learned how to sell life insurance and what it takes. Outbound calling wasn't the best, there was often no one to call or anything to do."
good,Taking calls from Directv customers pertaining to there service.
good,"It was a call center. The supervisors were extremely professional and helpful, accommodating for needs on a regular basis. Short-notice flexed start times and low pay, however, contributed to the high turnover rate."
good,Typical day you take over 50 calls a day. Extremely fast paced and ever changing. I learned how to become a customer service rep. Manangement wasnt always the best and not as knowledgable as you would like. The hardest part of the day was taking so many calls and not having the proper support. Co-Worker were very supportive and always there to help. Most enjoyable part of the day was being able to take a break and clear my mind from all the calls and customer complaints.
good,"•	Support customer on technical issues with Microsoft office products."
good,"A typical day at Convergys consist of signing in your work station, review any changes made to your schedule, read any new info about our employer, sign into the phone and start taking calls. I learned a lot of new things like; how shipments are handle, the ins and outs of how delivery's are made, using a new system to track orders etc... The management I feel had a lot of growing to do they did not relate to the employees like they should. My co-workers made it a joy to come to work everyday they would help you anyway they could to help you do a better job. The most challenging part of my job was dealing with irate customers I understood how they felt I just couldn't understand why they needed to use fowl language to get their point across.  "
good,"Poor leadership qualities in management. A nice pay for limited work, but overtime, weekend and holidays are required, "
good,"Multi-national, high technology company upgrading network infrastructure including switches, routers, and firewalls. Good equipment to work on with lots of hands-on. Don't expect alot of formal training."
good,"just do your job and you will succeed... you may be put on a different project, if project ends they will try very hard to find you a new project."
good,A typical day at work would be logging into the computer systems to get on the phone to start taking Customer Service phone calls for vision insurance. Convergys is a place with nice people and a friendly atmosphere however job security is a big deal as well as stability; Your work schedule changes on a weekly basis and is never consistent and they are constantly hiring more and more people but there is no where for them to go. There would be days I'd come into work and not be able to start working because there wasn't a seat available for me to sit.
good,"Stressful at times. Hours are flexible, but never the same. Learned you can't do the job performance they expect due to outdated computers and phone systems. Poor management of people in positions that are not management material. People that I was able to get to know were helpful and made the overall job pleasant. Most people that work there are friendly, but turnover is high, due to poor training for position. The most difficult part of the job was feeling harassed on a daily basis from management. Calls being monitored constantly and coached on your Agent handle time on a regular basis. Makes no difference that their equipment was due in part to not being able to perform your job at 100%. For the amount of angry callers, poor training and management the $9.00 per hour was way below what the pay should be. The job was not physical, but mentally could wear you down. With poor phone systems it was difficult to understand callers most times. Computers would freeze up and cause delays in being able to assist callers in timely manner."
good,"Convergys was a training based environment, where they were constantly updating your customer service and troubleshooting skills. Surprisingly, they had great benefits and they had a system where you could earn 1 day off per every 80 hours that you worked. The atmosphere felt like a college with a horrible dress code, but most people were very knowledgeable about the product and their positions. The floor management was the best."
good,"co workers help each other with problem solving, always learn new things & feel that you have accomplished something when you go home at the end of the day"
good,Convergys was a great place to work.
good,A typical day would consist of answering inbound calls from DIRECTV customer. They would call for various reasons from billing questions to technical issues.
good,"My day started around 8:00am. Calls began to come in. The customers are usually angry or upset about their servive or their bill and they are very rude and sometime there is nothing you can say or do will satisffy the customer. I learned they were not angry at me but at the company and they told you that constantly but yet there were very rude. If you were weak in a certain area Management promised to help but it never came and you were left on your own. The co-workers were wonderful to work with if they could help they always did. To hear the customers saying so much negative things about the company(DOOR TO DOOR SALESMAN ARE HURTING THIS COMPANY). When I was able to help customers, I enjoyed working there, but there has to be some inprovemnt regarding how customer get there first impresion of the company before we are intertwined with them, and if this is corrected the customer service for this company will be improved."
good,I worked for Convergy's for about 6 months. We where told throughout our training that we are not salesmen but where there to help customers with their AT&T accounts. I was constantly being told that I needed to sell more and talk about packages we offer even if it didn't suit the customers needs.
good,I enjoyed working at Convergy's. Sue to it being so far away from home & I didnt have a vehicle at the time; I was forced to give that job up.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,This is a fun place to work with coworkers. The company is looking for a person to meet call center goals.
good,"Convergys did not encourage good technicians and customer service reps to stay with them.They were more concerned with taining people and them letting them go to work elsewhere. However, they had a moderately advanced technical data-base which kept growing via contribution and experience from their employees."
good,its a good place to work if u need quick money but all they care about is there selves they don't help you if u have any personal issues and there is no place for advancement place is a gossip filled drama place and it all depends on who u know if u want to get anywhere in that company
good,The people are good...the work is complex and artificially difficult. High stress with high demands for the pay given/ This is contract work which can change or end without notice
good,"Stringently professional place to work."
good,So much pressure in phone calls because I have to speak continuously 8hours and there is no sufficient idle in between calls and because of pressure I can't continue there
good,work life balance is promoted but it is not feasible for workers to have this as the work schedule demands a lot from the operations team and it takes a big toll on the shoulder of the agents as well as team leaders who most often get planned leaves denied.
good,"This job is definitely not for the weak hearted. It is a high stress job that causes anxiety and/or depression. Literally, the site had the EMTs there frequently. I even had them called for me once. If dealing with crazy customers, insensitive and incompetent management, busted equipment, unrealistic goals, and over the top rules isn’t your thing STAY AWAY!!"
good,Totally underpaid for the work we do their. They treat there employees as disposable. There is a high turn around in employees. The benefit only kick in after a year.
good,almost all the accounts are toxic and really hard to survive. Good thing is my tl and OM are good people that's why I stayed. But the work you are force to do RDOT. And the goals are impossible. Not gonna recommend this company. Your life will never be balanced when you stay in this company.
good,"It was the ideal fit when I started , I was promoted in about year ,  however some contracts are seasonal and alot of movement within the organization not alot of stability"
good,"My manager was more than relaxed which is good and bad. In my project, things too were very relaxed but in others it wasn't. The whole infrastructure was not working very well and the salary was just far too low. People were nice though ."
good,"It was a job, nothing more nothing less. Felt tied to the desk. Loved it at first, but everything went downhill fast. Very high emplyee turn over rate. Not too many people stay. Theres a reason for that."
good,"The atmosphere is very competitive. You either have to suck up to management or make your number's just right to advance to the next tier, and even then some of the employee's that have worse numbers can easily obtain the next tier you were to advance to. The equipment always had some sort of problems. The overall objective of the job is to send callers to another person after ten to fifteen minutes and hope the customer doesn't get upset and score you bad."
good,"Sales, customer service, sales, data entry, taking notes on every call"
good,Pay good just bad work environment. They didn't work around your schedule only get a 30 minute lunch break but your way is great and you can get overtime
good,"you can excel in a short amount of time as long as you apply yourself every day. If you lose focus too often, you will struggle to succeed. Opportunity for advancement and incentives. Diverse group of employees. Dedicated operations team."
good,"Any call center job dealing with patients and medication will give you a headache daily like this job did me. Loved the people and staff, I was trained properly."
good,"I would never bad mouth a former employer, but there are many things that Concentrix could do to help them excel as a company and it feels as though they don’t have the interest in learning about them."
good,"Empresa legal, deixa seus funcionários a vontade referente a vestimenta, porém tem salário baixo, pouca mobilidade de horário, e muita panelinha."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,So when I was working here I was diagnosed with social anxiety... after doctors appointments and bring put on a new medication I took 3 days off for myself I went back to work with a doctor note just in case any questions were asked. After that on a daily basis I was having a hard time with my team leads and management. They make me feel uncomfortable and have only made my mental state worse since returning to work. They make it out to be a problem that I was diagnosed with a mental illness and i do not feel comfortable to work in that building. They watch my every move almost like their waiting kn me to do one thing wrong to fire me. Managment has not once asked if I was okay or even offered to maybe accommodate my scedule. The place is a joke and such a toxic work environment. The work perks are not as good as they tell you as well with how they scedule and give away vacation. Favouritism is deffinely a thing in that building.
good,"I have worked at this location for 12 years. I’ve witnessed that most people advance in their career if your within the click of the right people. The pay is not up to the cost of living. I have never had an issue with my management. I’ve tried advancing, but was always told that I needed more experience. I don’t agree with that because not everyone has the same experience when hiring into the company. We all have to learn and not everyone learns in the same prospective."
good,"Management picked on several people"
good,The account given to me was easy as a beginner but the management needs to improve their system. They will make you feel that you are not allowed to take leaves or be sick.
good,"This job can be really good, or really bad. It's atmosphere is that of a high school. However, if you go to work, and do your job as you are supposed to, you shouldn't have any issue striving here. Management, its not that they don't care, its that they are so overwhelmed they rarely have time to help employees, On and all, its a great job. Also, the pay should definitely be higher simply because of the torment we go through with the customers."
good,The job is ok! The pay sucks but the company is great... I enjoy working there however I feel that they can change their attendance policy! But other than that I love it!
good,"It was cool when I first started but as I continued, I realized I hated the structure. Management for the turbo tax department is just ridiculous, a seasonal job that lies to you about your schedule, pay, ect."
good,"A typical day consisted of clocking in and taking calls from customers to provide them with troubleshooting steps for their cable boxes and satellite dishes, setting up appointments for someone to come out to look at the dishes, and cable boxes.once changing to the other location for onstar, i would then set up directions to be sent to customers vehicles."
good,"Pros was being able to work at home and not have to leave the house. Saved on gas money and take out food. Cons is the pay is low compared to other companies, schedule was all over the place and they didnt offer alot of help. I will say that they hire for multiple companies so it could have just been the company that I was assigned to. They dont allow you to pick the jobs you are interested in you take what they offer or they just wont offer anything else."
good,very easy going can wear bussiness casual type of work very fast pace i love how its a family setting and everyone gets along concentrix is great and i love it
good,"This place is good if you like to work from home, its ok if you use it as a part time job and also good for stay at home moms. often times they closet he accounts and move you to other accounts with little to no notice."
good,The company is good to work for as an entry into the call center world. There is not much guidance after the initial training. Also the management is not available when there are questions that need to be addressed. They did try and make up for it by providing an area for employees to de-stress with a ping pong table.
good,"While working for the company does not seem to be different from any other call center job. The coworkers tend to be nice people, but the directives from above tend to conflict with reality."
good,"Convergys is a good starter place to break into the job industry, however its not somewhere to stay for long. "
good,I didn't get paid enough for where I live. It was hard to go to work because management didn't care about you. And I never got moved up. There weren't many opportunities to move up. Rarely offered.
good,"If you are needing to polish your inside sales skills, this would be a great platform to do so.  These jobs are not designed to be a job to retire from.  You are required to sit at a computer station in an open office setting.  The pay is very low.  You can not support your family with the starting pay with this company.  The company is not set up to accommodate standing stations or adjustable stations. The stations are not assigned.  The supervisors for the most part are not professional.  Fortunately, I did have a great supervisor while I was there.  If you are someone who wants to get some great customer service experience and you are computer literate, this company is a good start.  The hours are set for night hours usually not leaving before 12 midnight.  The company needs to invest in some insurance options that are affordable for the employees and their hourly pay scale."
good,"Great training, great team building. Can be very exhausting mentally and very little incentives. There were opportunities to advance but the financial incentive to advance was non existent, in fact, it was less pay to advance."
good,Basically it is very stressful for me to work at a call center because you sit in front of a computer the whole day dealing with raging customers. After a point it becomes very monotonous to work there. salary and other bonus benefits are good but you need to maintain a certain record in order to get it.
good,"Company is ok to work for."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Doesn't recognise employees skills and are underestimated and paid less than normal wages."
good,"It was an okay place to work at, besides the work attendance policy and the hours they had. They didn’t really work with the employees on that and didn’t mind their work ethic."
good,"answering phone calls for Sprint cellular services"
good,"Your day started off with calls from some nice and not so nice customers needing help with billing, tech support,trouble shooting , and sending out tech for what i could not handle and trying to sales something."
good,whenever i would go to management for any issues i had they would never do anything about the problem they would just tell us to ignore it and if we didnt like that they would move us to another team
good,"Its good place for people who are lacking experience in a customer service position. The pay is above minimum wage. Management needs work. If you don't have a vehicle or someone who isn't 100 percent reliable don't apply. "
good,My manager was great and my team was fun but the work feels too dead-end. It is hard to concentrate on a meagre bonus when the pay as you go department are making hundreds more from less calls.
good,"I enjoy the type of work I do and my immediate supervisor was wonderful.  The company had tremendous growth but they would not add more staff in Farmington Hills as they are moving payroll to SC this year.  My supervisor and I had to work long hours to get the payroll done for 8,000 employees.  There was no work-life balance. There was never any praise for work well done either which does not help to motivate you.  Concentrix expects us to be available every minute of the day via Skype which makes it hard to get the work done."
good,"I donot recommend this job if you cant multitask and are not dependable. You have to show up at your scheduled time and adhere to your schedule to the minute. It is also kept very cold in"
good,Management showed no personal care when my father passed away. The company made constant changes with the skill. I stopped caring and therefore was released from my position.
good,"The hours for this company are non-negotiable. There is no flexability. You either show up or get a point on your record. Too many points, regardless of the reason, and you're let go."
good,"Management, I could be a better place if you got treated like humans. The money is good espically with the over time but it’s hard sometimes . Really hard"
good,"Der Zusammenhalt unter den Dumpinglöhnern ist gut, jeder bekommt das gleiche Geld wie der andere, somit wird darüber gelacht."
good,"Confer with customers by telephone to provide information about products or services, take or enter orders, cancel accounts, or obtain details of complaints. Ensure service delivered to our customers meets contractual Key Performance Indicator Track, document and retrieve information in call tracking database"
good,"Respect for all team work able to meet deadlines as a productive department. Great management team, able to balance work as well as when life happens."
good,"I enjoyed the opportunity to help people but the tools given were not of much use. This in itself was the downfall for me."
good,"When I started there a typical day was to complete admin tasks at the start of the day and then I would monitor my agents to make sure we are providing the best customer service possible for the customer's calling in. "
good,different managers/supervisors had different standards and expectations. Little reward for being outstanding. Customers had unreal expectations and management caved in
good,The job itself was great. The management is horrible and people in higher roles have no idea how to communicate. There is a lack of communication and it makes your job very unclear.
good,"The job environment was a call center, the scheduling was not fit for a single parent. There were some immaturity in employees and management. Also a lot of favoritism."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Im sad to leave but i have to.  The experience was overwhelming and im honored ro be part of this company. Somehow it was the management and the people that pushed me to my end.
good,I have  a lots work experience in concentrix  company but there he te not helping. Nature so I have leave  thats job there are so many so creacaly issue in work place.
good,"I worked at a highly professional company, dealing with various serious matters such as the customers' bank inquiries from a major bank, HSBC.  I'm always being pressured and put into a position of having to empathize with my customers and show them the bank cares about their matter and that we as a bank could help. I had to keep the reputation of HSBC at its utmost best and that included my posture, my tone, how clear i speak and my devotion to the bank as every detail could change the customer's thought of HSBC entirely."
good,Hours are changed and bid on constantly nothing is consistent. They will find ways to write you up and get rid of you if they feel they need to. Management is wishy washy cant trust anyone dont get personal with anyone.
good,They do good at training for the job you are going to perform. But when you get on the floor they don't prepare you for some of the communication skills need for the job
good,"I went into Convergy's with an open mind but I realized during the first week how unprofessional and unfulfilling their training is. They should train a LOT more on the programs an employee will use while they're taking calls on the floor. I feel like 3 weeks is an adequate amount of time to train new hires on memerizing the opening statement and programs; however, the way they are teaching and presenting the materials currently is completely wrong and needs to be reworked and most importantly REVITALIZED. "
good,convergys was very educational and fast paced it gave me an opportunity to work with people from all different cultures and groups. very social atmosphere.
good,"The work load has become heavier and the work-life balance has become extinct. The career advancement plan is not clear to employees. "
good,"This job came in handy when I needed to find a job in a matter of days, the training class lasted for 8 weeks, and then there was an additional 2 weeks training on the floor, working there gave me great experiences."
good,"this job is okay. "
good,"When I first started with this company we had fun, we were laughing and having fun the customer experience was number one and training was held to a higher standard. I feel bad for anyone that starts now they changed training from 8 weeks for 5 days, which is no where near enough time to learn the basics and how to handle an upset customer with vehicle concerns. Some of the team managers are great they are honest with you and do not beat around the bush, it's the managers that are above them that have the real problem, they turn a blind eye to everything that goes on. They praise you with a ballon if your good and nothing if your bad it is insulting as everyone deserves to be lifted up. The post signs about what you could have if you didn't miss days they call you out for being in the bathroom longer than three minutes. Basic human rights, they never praise what is done well they focus on the negatives, you can be working 60 hour weeks and they will find what you did wrong. The pay is bad for this kind of work many people leave and go to competitors to do the same work for more money. Do not settle if you do not have to. The hr lady is. Joke, they underpaid me half my cheque one week and she didn't believe me and sent me away to find someone else, she has no idea what goes on and doesn't care. She doesn't know anyone's names and she spends here time when she is in walking around. Honestly this is a job, it's not the worst but it is near close to it. They hire so many people because the turn over is high and by spending a week working there you feel the negative energy. Everything"
good,"At the time they were working for AT&T and DirecTV, which is the main client that I worked for. The work pace is fast, those who cannot keep up or left behind, those who want to move forward are faced with many obstacles as there's not room for much advancement. Compensation is fine at the supervisor level, for the first year however I would recommend asking for a $2 raise afterwards as a stress can become overwhelming, when you're working in a sales based environment based on a bill paying Department. My experience won't be yours as they do not have AT&T or DirecTV anymore, but this is how it was when I was there."
good,Being on the phones was not fun. My ears hurt from the head set and the benefits were few. I would not recommend. My trainer didn't seem to care about us and wasn't doing their job half of the time. The floor was stressful and not fun.
good,"i enjoyed my work there "
good,"The management is absolutely terrible. The lack of professionalism is ridiculous . It is extremely unorganized and the environment is uncomfortable. The job itself is fine, if upper management were less worried about being spiteful & vindictive and more focused on the employees who make up this company it would likely be more successful in keeping employees."
good,too much drama and the management is very unprofessional . the pay is ok but for what you have to deal with it should be more. once the management gets better so will the job
good,It was not an environment I found to conducive to a harmonious feeling of life work balance for me. The tone was negative and had very low employee moral.
good,Good place to work if you are desperate for jobs. Need to improve benefits and the wages are average for a entry level customer service job. Will be good option if you want to gain experience for other jobs in future.
good,"- stressful sometimes"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Loved the people I worked with they made going to work daily bearable. Unrealistic goals on being on the phone with customers and helping at the same time.
good,"Because you have a lot of knowledge about your business, it's easy to forget that not everyone knows what your business is about. Avoid saying ""We"" in the beginning sentence: Start off with your company's name and immediately follow it with what your business does --- for example, write ""John Smith Vending is dedicated to servicing our customers with a wide array of vending machines and products."""
good,It's an ok job if your productive and come to work on time like any other job. But they surprise you with new rules and regulations that doesn't benefit the workers
good,"A paycheck ti'll you ratings drop and insane point system on absence and away from desk as to go to the rest room. No guarantee a cubicle avail at start time, walk all over call center looking until someone leaves and you get a tardy."
good,"Great ""stepping stone"" job. Good place to figure out your career path, if you are unsure. You will figure out where you will want to go, after you spend some time here."
good,"Concentrix was alright to work for, for what is was. A work from home job. I was on the iOS campaign and dealt with while entitled people who wanted their phone fixed and would argue with you about the troubleshooting step."
good,"Provided customers information and assisted them with questions they may have , customers needs empathy, understanding, kindness, had several calls daily with the same questions and provided the same answers to all, I enjoy providing them the information to help them get their information."
good,"I actually like working here. and the job. The people are nice, but the consistency in schedules, advancement options are not there. Management does have favoritism. To get a raise you have to move up, and there are 1500 people here. Constantly getting moved to different departments. Its very frustrating.  To get benefits is nearly impossible."
good,"I was work in Concentrix company as a team leader in IT asset management"
good,"I have nothing negative to say about the company... It is more so the management and team leaders at the south Ga location. The level of patient and respect for regular employees are minimal. there quick to terminate you. During training system do not work very long. when you get out on the floor you will lack skills to do your job and they will hold u accountable that not fair. There are some coaches and trainers team leaders who really cares and will help u . Majority is there to get a check and leave attitudes are very prevalent , I was laid off over giving at customer what they ask for !!!!! Because i did not read that a sports package came with that programming i was let go. mind u never been late, written up, stay at goal. that was this former manager who is now fired hmm mm. To my understanding rumor has it me and three other top agents on my team was let go due to that manager and my team leader was beefing over a woman.... I still can work there now i choose not too i feel disrespected to much unprofessional mess at that site"
good,"Everything is fine, my  collegues and tl are good... i love working in convergys i got a lot of  incentives and freebies. The management is very supportive in making sure that we hit the target"
good,"Training is good at Convergys, the benefits are a key feature of being employed here. They also provide full time hours and mandatory overtime quite often."
good,"Ambiance de centre d'appels. Au UK, pas de droit du travail. Des semaines à rallonge pour le même salaire. "
good,process kept on changing. management should check the number of workloads being asked. they should not ask for over times every day and give employees the benefit they deserve.
good,When I first started with Convergys in 2002 the Lake Mary site had mostly tech support programs and they had an internal technical school where you could learn a technical skill like build a pc or set up a server and the final project was building your own pc which you got to keep. Every class had something you took with you at the end. Some years later the site went to mostly customer service programs and they took away the technical school. My starting pay in 2002 was $8/hour which was decent for the time but when I was laid off in 2016 the starting wage was around $10/hour which really changed the quality of the people that were hired. A lot of the my colleagues left to other call centers in the area that paid more.
good,This was a good place to work in 4 years ago. It was a great culture up until a few months before I left. It was a fast paces place where you were always busy. Which was good.
good,"This is a great job for someone that doesn't have small children, and that has a of room for flexibility. However, you can grow with the company, they are very good at promoting within."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with. It was a friendly and fun atmosphere and I actually enjoyed going into work each morning."
good,"No training available.  Training manager does not know what the agents are trying to do.  Only concerned with  selling more hardware which pays not commission, only  profit for the company"
good,"Felt that training was lacking to support role. Never felt comfortable with any level of training, some be incongruent with common sense. The level of security reduced morale."
good,"place was a great place to learn new skills and grow but the place and job itself seemed to childish, I felt like I was back in high school half of the time.."
good,"everything is good but WFM is not good its bounded their(inbound agent) lunch break, management is very poor they did not think about level-1 position people, anyway this is my first job in concentrix so i thankful for that and please checked with your HR's behavior and management too."
good,"Situated outside Gourock on the hills high above Clyde, the company claims to be special."
good,"I have learned about credit cards, how the interest works, how not pay your bills affect your credit.The hardest thing is dealing with very rude customers."
good,"If you will would like to apply you have to make sure you are set with savings and back up medical plans. Most of the employees even they worked in the company for 10 years, you can hear them complaining about the medical insurance and had no savings for the past 10 years working in the company. Even if they were already promoted as a teamleader. You can here them say their earnings were not still worthed. When it comes to workload it seems never ending even if you logged out on time. You will have to extend because the target is so hard to meet on time."
good,"A typical day was stressful but rewarding. The end result was customer satisfaction and solving problems. Beyond the technical knowledge; I learned many ways of interacting with people in different ways, and how to respond to different personality types. In my years there I saw many management types and also saw that the successful managers adapted to their employees in the same way I reacted to customers. "
good,"I dont have a good review for Convergys in St. Louis, Mo. They are a horrible company to work for. They are not considerate to their employees personal situations and they don't pay well at all."
good,"Totally understandable fact is when you are working, you are ought to work until you achieve your targets but this company makes people work even during their weekoffs, does not allow them to take leaves for whatsoever reason and also in the name of DEFICIT, fool employees into working more. They believe in company's growth and not employee's growth."
good,Account is complicated with short training and no full time training in hard selling. Transition training is inefficient classroom trng if too far from ojt  created a lot of dissatisfaction to agent as well as the customer.
good,"This is a big player in the Philippine BPO, Very stiff, doesn't reach out/engage with the employees very much. Doesn't have enough incentives for their employees."
good,"Typical day starts with targets with TLs set expectations. Quality is a must with customer reviews and comments. Sales is always important. Manned hours and average handling time is very critical and tough to achieve."
good,"Managers are expected to give their lives to the company with no gratitide from their leadership."
good,The company provide great work experience. Most of things that i learned is focus on communication skills which was my weakest point before i entered Convergys. It did help me a lot to outgrow my difficulties
good,"Job can be very tedious and stressful if you allow customers to get under your skin, however if you can communicate effectively and can be empathetic you will be able to deescalate most calls without needing a supervisor to assist! "
good,"less compensation, but nice workplace station. irregularities in terms of offs. less benefits. It will change your lifestyles. because of the daily and weekly schedules."
good,"This is a out source business company where it can be very difficult to balance family life.  There is not that many opportunities for  advancement.  They do have regular incentives.  There are no raises, you have to works overtime to  supplement your income and keep up with the cost of living  obtain this benefit."
good,Overall it would be a good start for a first time jpob decent pay structure with benefits.  As an experience individual it really depends on what contract you work on.  My first Contract was with X company and loved it.  They signed a contract with X companies competitor and I started to hate going to work.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I felt selling over a chat program fairly advanced for a company. It was quite challenging to do two three plays phone, internet and cable at one time!"
good,"There was no room to advance. If you advanced with added work and responsibilities you was not compensated for it. The company has good training for what bthe job entails but, you was never  compensated for doing more than what your job entails."
good,"I still am employed here. Currently looking for another job as we speak. But my experience for the past year and a half has been terrible. Management is terrible. They hire way to many family members. Once someone becomes a team leader trainer, any management after being a regular agent, the power goes to their head. Haven't met a team leader yet where it hasn't. They would rather you put your life in danger to be at work then be safe. You cant use the pto that you earn without a months notice. You get coached if you frequently have to use the restroom. Management has their favorites they stick too. Everyone else doesn't matter. The job title and duties are ridiculous.  You dont get paid near enough for the stuff you do. Terrible terrible place."
good,"When joined concentrix, thought it will be a nice place to work in. But later on realised that they keep on shifting people from one process to another, so due to which growth is less expected. Further, job security is less."
good,"Training was not bad at first.  Once we got into training it became obvious that there would be selling involved.  I had stated that I did not want any selling and was told that it would be very minimal. Once training was over we were turned loose without anyone to help with any questions we might have, Like the blind leading the blind."
good,My team was awesome and supportive. Manager was always there for you same as with the coach/trainer. Only down point about the company is that development is praised and offered but it is all an illusion. Also the higher management doesn't really care about the team/contract. Distant and cold people on top. They call themselves fanatical about their employees but that's only on a poster.
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is after shift sometimes we eat with my team mates before we got home to release the stress
good,"Only suited to survive people,  there will not be any growth,  by gaining this work experience u cannot even get any knowledge"
good,"the enjoyable part of job is job training , i learnt many things while i was woking there , i enjoyed the training and did hard work in job , "
good,"Convergys is a great place for employment when you are looking for something quick and easy for little money. You work day in and day out. Must work weekends and holidays. Also must be available to work until midnight every other week. Great for college students needing to get by. They do not offer part time. You are constantly being recorded for quality assurance and is pretty easy to get by. Overall, an okay place to work...Could use some work here and there."
good,"nice people need more pay but overall it a good place. convergy should look into growing more as a company it looks like it will be around for a long time to come, hope they start to hire within."
good,"It's a very stressful place to work.  Some people do very well there and some don't.  There is forced overtime, which I did not like.  I found that different team leads had different rules.  The teams that had the highest scores were the ones with the fewest rules.  A typical day included call after call after call, especially when there were several people out for the day (at least 60 people were out every day.)  Co-workers on your team would be very good to work with but people off your team seldom offered even a hello.  I did not find it difficult to deal with irate customers but a lot of team members would become very stressed and cry.  I enjoyed talking with people from all parts of the US."
good,"you answer calls coming in all day shifts can be as long as 10 hours"
good,the job was an instant hire but was not what originally thought. the call floor was not as clean as it should be and computers were constantly having issues. alot of those in leadership positions were not always availiable.
good,There was a recent change in clients that convergys had so about 60% or more employee's were forced to find other places of employment until 10/31/16. There wasn't a focus of flexibility or attempting to keep the workers that they already had. The typical day consists of answering phone calls for customers and helping them with their issues.
good,"A typical day at work , was like coming to work with family to have fun enjoy time together and make money . working at this company i learned how to talk to customers , hold my temper and speak with kindness even when you dont mean to. I Absolutley Loved my managers they were what kept us going from the beginning to the of our shift to the end ."
good,"lots of work not equal to pay"
good,"Lots of calls with angry unpleasant customers, you learn to deal with grumpy and angry customers, get different information from different managers, lack of information."
good,"Its a Job, and its a great place to work if you don't have small kids. the scheld is deficult but again its a JOB."
good,unprofessional. THEY WILL HIRE ANYONE!! Human Resources & management gossip. Its very ummm....ghetto. Training wasnt very much hands on....once we got on the floor my wave had no clue wtf was going on. Pay is low.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Management micromanages everything you do. Convergys always changes the requirements of calls on a weekly bases so they can't all be on the same page.
good,Taking call for Directv and learning on how to setup orders and selling packages and adding them on. Learned how to take payments do orders and other things. Management could have been better but ok for that time frame. Co-works there were very friendly have become life long friends. The hardest part was provided acceptance of the product when providing the client if they passed the credit report. The most enjoyable part of my job was the TV's out on the production floor where they would play music or on weekends sports.
good,"With Supervisors they were a big help when I was still in Convergys especially with my last Supervisor. He sees to it that we are given the best support so we can achieve much of our goals and meet  more than what we learned in training. Have learned a lot especially in the billing side as from my previous work with Teletech, billing is not included in our account. Have a good and friendly relationship with Colleagues. Hardest part of the job is when you think that you were able to satisfy the customer's needs and then the rate is not fair enough. Enjoyable part is when you meet different kinds of people. You will see the different characters that each person has. You should be able to cope up with all those people because its your job to help not realizing if this person is an irate one or not."
good,it is a very secure job with room for advancement and is always changing they provide full benefits dental and health along with vision
good,El trabajo es muy complicado y no brindan la asesoría necesaria para cumplir con las metas que se solicitan.
good,"A typical day consist of receiving calls for Netflix and assisting them. What I learned is that I have a lot more patience than what I expected. You can take up to 70-100 calls a day. Management was not the best. The communication was off and there was a time when we went 6 months without a team lead and 3 month without a team manager. The Co-Workers were okay, it was definitely a high school environment so it had its pros and cons. The hardest part was giving the customer a great customer service experience while getting a lot of negative push back. The part I liked most was assisting customers that were willing to learn and be assisted; those customers were a pleasure to assist."
good,Concentrix is a job for teenagers with no responisbilites if you have a life and you trying to build it around concentrix you will fall hard because there is no job stability there no loyalty to there employees
good,"Promotions were not based on performance, instead you took a test to be on the tier 2 team and if you passed you got on the team, otherwise you stayed on as tier 1."
good,"A typical day of work at Convergys involves a full day of phone and computer work. It's not difficult work, you just have to know what information to relay to the customer. Management seemed to always be an issue as team leaders were constantly being switched and laid off, because of this it felt as though there was a lack of stability. Co-workers were easygoing, although there seemed to be a surprising amount of personal issues dragged into the office, compromising the professional work environment. The hardest part of the job was trying to get assistance with an issue or question. The most enjoyable part was being able to help customers and learning to be proficient with customer service."
good,"The growth within the company is limited. Management is terrible no direction to lead within the company, not enough resources"
good,"A typical day at work would start off with me coming in at eight in the morning and then having coffee, I would be schedule to actually begin my shift at nine. Before then I would make sure I had everything that I needed. Once I started my shift, depending on what day of the month it was, or whether we had problems with our systems, the calls would either come in swiftly or very slowly.  Our customers were awesome and dealing with them was quite easy. I have learned how to perfect my customer service skills through taking numerous of phones throughout the day with all kinds of people in different avenues, especially when It came to dealing with our irate customers, I took full pride in having them calm by the time we were done. Management was good, but it could have been way better. The hardest part of the job was not being able to solve any problem for our customers that was out of our control, the most enjoyable was having them be satisfied with the call even if there wasn't a solution to the particular problem they were calling about. Coworkers were great, I have some that became really close friends."
good,"as with any company the main purpose is to make a profit.  This company will do so even at the expense of their employees.  one sign of a good company is its Attrition rate.  This company has a high Attrition rate due to stress not created by the job itself, but by the work environment."
good,You'll able to enjoy the company of your colleague. Enjoy the team building of your company. You will expand your communication skills
good,I didn't mind the workplace and fast pace environment. It's management that I didn't like and was very disorganized and unprofessional.
good,"I have been lucky enough to work with people who have allowed me to grow, by allowing me to learn from own mistakes. I was lucky enough to have one manager who took me from being a very shy , having no faith in myself , to being able to run a queue of 75 people on my own. "
good,I enjoyed the people from almost all departments.  I didn't like the fact that I had to work with so many people with hard criminal records  nor the constant police visits to arrest employees.
good,Very fun atmosphere however very unprofessional and no sense of direction. Training class was very difficult /teaching method. The most enjoyable part of my employment at Convergys was my classmates whom was very supportive we handled difficult tasks amongst each other and pushed each other to succeed. However commission was not paid out for sales made until after 90 days of employment.
good,"I didn't really enjoy working here, due to the rude managers and lack of benefits. The schedule was not flexible to adjust for school. Although the job was not the best i gain a lot of my experience in customer service."
good,"My time at LBM although i always hit commission as I was on pre to post (calling payg and aiming to get them on contract) I absolutely hated the place 10-15 new starters every week says it all, the managers just swore at everyone and tried to get people to go on unpaid holidays as they had too many employees. if someone was struggling it didn't look like there was any additional training for that said person and it looked like they just got rid if target was missed"
good,Great incentive and pay. not very flexible with shifts. Coworkers are friendly and helpful. Training is always informative.
good,Did not receive further training or certification after one year as promised however it was a generally stress free environment and the team leaders were supportive. Enjoyed working at Convergys and would have stayed had I not relocated to another state.
good,"Convergys was a descent place to work, You can make great money which was a bonus. BUT the working conditions were what would kill you. other than having to sell I liked it,"
good,The Human Resource part of Convergys was bought out by NGA in 2009.  I have been with both companies a total of 7 years and recently resigned.  I enjoyed the  people I worked with but the change in policies such as raises etc took away the morale within the company. I hope that changes at some point so people will stay longer and be more content.
good,"After 15 years in a computer career, I got into sales and marketing. When I wanted  to return to the computer field, Convergys allowed me to  move in as a Cisco contract agent and move back into the role of senior technical specialist and grow."
good,"made outbound calls, received inbound calls, answered billing questions. researched billing issues and customers ads on yp,com to assure they were correct."
good,"This is a difficult job made more difficult by the corporate culture within the building. Goals and expectation changed constantly, communication was inconsistent. This being said upon leaving this employer I feel that there is no job too difficult for me to learn. Compensation was reasonable as an agent but once you were promoted into a supervisory or training role you earned far less than as a performing agent."
good,Were tasked with calling many thousand Telebank clients to sell them a product we were not trained or educated on. Poorly executed and team was disbanded and Riff'd within 18 months.
good,This was a job that caused issues because the software that they were using at the time i Worked there did not meet all the customers needs.
good,"poor enviorment, poor management and not enough enthusiam in the work place. Not people friendly call center. poor quality"
good,I would answer the phone. answer customers questions. I would help customers troubleshoot. my co-workers were ok. the best part is that they would give the employees free food.
good,"In this company i learned the value of Team spirit. While the stakeholders and the companies management where not improving the work and life quality. The teams and team managers built an enjoyable work environment."
good,"This call center could use improvement. They are a 3rd party for Sprint but don't inherit all of the guidelines that Sprint has. The confusion of Sprints requirements and Concentrix's requirements made it complicated to be confident in your work. The customers aren't the worst but the specific positioning and scripting they want you to use is. Each call had a specific entry, you had to ensure your showing empathy and sympathy even when its unnecessary, and last you had to use a specifically long and complicated closing statement on EVERY call. I was a supervisor at the Bremerton site and was promoted with no training in order to maintain my own team they way they wanted me to. I have worked in plenty of different call centers and was able to show that I know what I was doing, but without being able to do what they want me to (because they did not provide me access to software I needed to complete tasks for at least a month of being a supervisor) I was unable to please every MGR in the site. It made everything more stressful and I was always scared that I could lose my job(especially since sprint could fire anyone they wanted for no reason at all). Take this job only if you are in desperate need of work."
good,Busy environment and very competitive.  Periodically attend meetings and classes to improve and implement new features.  At the end of the day most employees had a productive one.
good,Convergys is a good place to find a position with options to learn about the business world
good,"Minacs is a place that is easy to get in to but its not all they show it up to be. Things are not always as they seem. "
good,"I would only recommend working here to build your resume as it is not a place to start a career. They do promote with in but their training program does not prepare those in individuals to be effective on their jobs. when I finished the entry level training, I consistently pursued experienced colleagues for assistance on situations they did not prepare me for. I had three manager who were always too busy to help me so I found my own way to receive growth through others. by time I left the job I knew everything my position offered. "
good,Wasn't really something I was as interested in or excelled in. I prefer working with someone in person
good,un organized i feel like a have to worry about the security of my job the changes come without warning and they don't like to compensate  schedules for events such as school or any other activity not dealing with the job
good,I like the fact that I can still work with customers and provide satisfaction for successfully troubleshooting customer issues. The company does not have the best work environment with the lack of communication between coworkers and supervisors. I believe for a company to be successful everyone needs to put in a hundred percent to provide first call resolution to our customers. In order for there to be first call resolution in a case that the customer needs to be an agent and/or supervisor should be readily available or available within a timely fashion.
good,It was very interesting working for this company.  You have to have a lot of patience.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,The good thing about Convergys is that it has taught me how to work in a call center environment.  They have been relatively good to me.
good,"A learning experience if you never worked in a call center before, co workers are nice , management are ok."
good,the most enjoyable part of myu job was speaking to customers and being around my coworkers
good,The people here are amazing. I started in 2011 and showed them what I could do. I was quickly promoted. Never being in a call center prior to this I was shocked at how stressful the work could be. Thankfully I have been blessed with a great sense of humor. I have been the number one rated manager for over a year now and the folks that are on my team show me how satisfied they are through their performance.
good,You can learn here and meet people of different diverse background. Learn new things here
good,If your trying to get into customer service then this is the job for you
good,A typical day can be busy and fast pace.  Have great co-workers. The hardest part is keeping up with the new technology.
good,"A typical work day at Convergys-Humana Project is very hectic. Sometimes the system crashes or has glitches and we are told to work around which is pretty complicated when conversing with the members. Most of the time we are contacting members who already has their medications refilled so we have to apologize for the inconvenience. "
good,"I'm glad they hire anyone because it gave me experience in a call center environment but like I said they HIRE ANYONE. "
good,"After 12 years of loyal service my job was off-shored.  Under new management, loyalty and hard work was disregarded.  Happiest day of my life when I received my notice."
good,"I have no idea how this.company has stayed in business this long. The Jacksonville, fl location is a horrible place to work. The senior management cares nothing for the little people or everyday workers"
good,This is a great job to have while you are in school or working to accomplish your ultimate career dreams. Definitely not a job to retire from .
good,"troubleshooting cx phones"
good,A nice place to gain some experience in customer service. There isn't a lot of continuity with management. There are opportunities to move up but not sure if it's worth it.
good,"days went by slow"
good,"No longer happy with company politics, Company used to stand up for its employees no longer does"
good,One of the largest call center's here in the Philippines however because of their numbers ( Employee numbers ) they were not able to cater both the employee welfare and the account itself.
good,The schedules are terrible..it changes often and your most likely to work nights and holidays. So if you have children and family this is not the job for you. Also it is technical support so you will deal with a lot of unfriendly customers.
good,"I would come into work and get straight on my phone. I learned how to provide world class customer service. The management worked well with you and tried to do what they could to assist with any questions or concerns floor agents had. My co workers were all working close together so we would have one another for help, because the job was a learning process. The hardest part about the job was the inconsistency with the company. There was always change and you could never feel like you had job security. Then again i did enjoy the people that i had around me."
good,"Working for an outsource company there are many issues regarding long term employment.  Work hours change based on what the client wants.  No raises, always changing work schedule, and no opportunities to move up in the company."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,The pay is decent but the work place is hectic filled with kids. The company is pretty disorganized. The benefits are ok and they have tons of overtime. This is an ok job.
good,"Incoming calls from Western Union cliets and offices, to set up money transfers, general information, etc."
good,"Have to maintain a high status in order to stay employed. Fun employees. And you have to be great with people, even the angry ones."
good,"When I first started to work at Convergys, I loved working there.  The environment was wonderful, my supervisor was awesome, and it was enjoyable going to work every day.  Unfortunately, things didn't stay that way.  After a few months, they changed things around and work became more of a chore.  At about the 8 month mark, I was totally miserable.  They didn't give pay raises but they kept adding more responsibilities on the agents that were taking the calls.  The supervisor that I had at the end was hard to get along with and most of the time, I felt like I could do nothing right.  If you had medical problems that needed special arrangements for, you had to jump through hoops to get what you needed."
good,"I had to leave here for stress reasons, they demand so much and almost have there disciplinary action programs setup so you WILL fall short and get fired, of course this is only my opinion and I am entitled to my opinion"
good,A typical day at work taking inbound calls to assist customers needs. Working in a call center environment I learned to meet the company's expectations in providing the customer with outstanding service. Hardest part about the job is management wasn't very knowledgeable in helping assist team members with problems regarding customers accounts. Most enjoyable part about the job is hearing from customers on how helpful my service was.
good,"Typical day at work; receive incoming calls for technical support, and inquires"
good,Do not consider single with children who have illness.  It all about work and not parents who has child with a serious illness.
good,"My review of this job, is that it was a good job;but it was sort of hard to advance with in the company."
good,Convergys is a Good Job for a young adult only because of the pay. Easy job made hard by management. Great hour lunch. bad with scheduling. Not a long time job. The job security sucks. They Hire to fire.
good,If you like the call center job and taking 600-700 calls a day this is the job for you. Not enough pay for the type of work your doing.
good,"up to 30 inbound calls daily involving sales, scheduling, and technical support"
good,"I worked here for 8 months which is 7 months longer than those that were in my training class. Where I worked was a Sales location(we sold internet, phone, and cable services). During training we were told that the sales weren't important and not to stress over it. Once we started taking calls and were placed on the call floor it was nothing but sales. That is actually how you advance in the company. They look at your sales and your attendance. Management was okay but were only willing to help employees with a ""green call"" (able to sell all three services). I eventually quit because I was so stressed over my sales rate not being high enough. I had been wrote up twice for it and two more times left before I would be fired. Its great if you can sell unwanted services to someone, but I just wasn't comfortable pushing those services on people."
good,"Work at home opportunity, system issues on the company side make it difficult.  No raises."
good,"No raises, schedule always changing with no notice.  Loads of turn over."
good,worked on phones for 8 hours a day. co-workers were really nice to work with. hardest part of the job was to sell to customers who were angry about their accounts. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers with their accounts that were messed up and took ownership of the issue and corrected the issue.
good,"The hours working are great. the system issues and it costing you time on calls was the largest problems. for a contract that they have not had even a year, not meeting the severice requirments as per their contract with the group. I did not feel that their was going to be a second year. Once the system seemed like it was fixed it would go down again a few days or a little while later. From my posion 3 teirs up manager comes in and after 30 mins of talking I got the understanding that the job there the contract was not going to be renewed with Convergys."
good,• Answer inbound telephone inquires from service providers and customers for Eye Med Vision Care
good,"5 years experience with good communication and computer knowledge, previously was working with Aditya Birla Minacs for Parallels Desktop Virtualization as a Technical Support Engineer."
good,This was a gateway job. It gave me the experience I need to handle customer complaints
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,This job is not only stressful but it is very hard to advance with this company!!
good,"due to the high turn over rate, this place is not a very job secured place to work at. No consistences with employers/leaders at all."
good,"my job was secure as long as i did my job but as for everything else such as management, could use some work!"
good,Hardest part of the job was keeping your stats up and pleasing supervisors. Supervisors signed up people for mandatory overtime without any notice. Most enjoyable part of job was being on a team and working together.
good,Had some good and some bad experiences. Was in Nursing School at time and work sometime interfered with school schedule. Wasn't very helpful when it came to school priorities.
good,"The typical day at Convergys is like a box of chocolates, you never know what you are going to get. Either a sweet chocolate surprize that only last for a moment or a chocolate covered sour ball that leave a very bad taste in the mouth for days and weeks at a time. You always remember the bad but there is good in the company. Just have to know where to look on the inside or on the outside."
good,"A typical day at work at Convergys was a little good. Till things were being changed and rules as well. Some of my co-workers lost there job but they were all really great . The management was all changed and each team leader lost there job , so managment wasn't great at all. Hardest part of the job was rude customers calling in. The fun part of the job was that they would give a little stuff to representive who did a good job."
good,"This was not the best job experience. Not enough time to unwind, especially after a difficult call. Barely any sympathy if u are sick, u expected to stay & still preform up to standard. There isn't much incentives as far advancing. Even if you move up you don't get paid any more. Basically I think it was all just sugarcoated to draw you in."
good,Prepare payroll
good,It is a nice place if you want to be out of a job real soon. Lost time and not enough hours in the day to do the work and lots of work.
good,Take inbound calls assisting customers with all of their needs regarding their Bank of America credit card accounts.
good,This company makes it hard for an individual to advance with its main focus on making daily sales instead of training to assist their customers on handling problems with cell phones and u verse tv. The benefits ate good and overall management is not thay great.they only care about their team making the daily sales quota so they look good when they go to their meetings.
good,it was good until they fired me until a souless person ended up being my teamleader
good,Never work here this company was similar to a temp service. It was unstable and your were not compensated for the work done.
good,"good company,with training you have to basicly fake it until u make"
good,when goals were low even if you were meeting your goals they would make it was everyones fault
good,Calls were constant as well as had to deal with constant change. Managers did not work with schedule. Plenty of overtime. Managers didnt allow any excuses.
good,They are not too understanding if you have children.Management is basically children running the place
good,"A typical day at work begins with answering phone calls to assist customer service needs of clients while making sure to promote sales. I learned how to use suggestive selling techniques. Management for this company claims to be under so much pressure that it justifies not following up with workers request and/or allowing a medium for communication. So many 800 numbers for HR concerns. The hardest part of the job is becoming personable with customers, promoting product, and then being let down by service location availability."
good,"Troubleshooting DSL, telephone, and cable connectivity issues open work tickets upselling products"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,From day to day everything changes including the rules. One member of management would tell you something was aceeptable and then the next day you were in a formal discussion with someone else about the exact same behavior. The job itself is easy if you can put up with the people around you.
good,"Convergys isn't a job that I would consider long-term do to the fact they aren't really family oriented. When there's things going on in your own persona; life they aren't really understanding and the management team were very rude and unprofessional. I loved my employees on my team and the benefits were great, After me leaving when my sister got killed and trying to come back my doctor wanted me to go part-time and they were not trying to let me do that and it was only temporary until I got over her death."
good,98% turn over rate with employees
good,"Responsibilities include answering phone calls; accept, arrange, and"
good,There is no stability in this company management is not professional if hired highly suggest to keep a second job because what ever position your working for they can lose the contract at any time
good,"enjoyed the job,the management team was ill prepared daily"
good,They only care about the customers. Unprofessional managers.
good,it was an ok place to work. very stressful and to many policies that are not all let known
good,Working at Convergys was stress free. I had a lot to autonomy with what I did. My co-workers were fun to work with. Unfortunately the job did not challenge me at all.
good,"Things change w/ the times. I hope as far as the people, this place changed too. The pay and benefits were decent for what it was at the time."
good,The company on a whole was ok- they need to take better care of the empoyees- thru ongoing education-they need to rethink thier training process and prepare the employees what they are really going to do.Most people dont have a clue as what is expected of them when they sart taking calls from custoners and therefore leads to a bad experience for the customers that call in
good,Was there for eleven and a half years. Did a lot of changing projects.
good,"Great training staff are so awesome the support u 100% but they can’t train you for everything, definitely need to be able to tell someone no and be able to problem solve quickly and have a lot of confidence. Wasn’t the place for me but may be a good fit for others. Break rooms are amazing lots of activities for staff to interact tons of benefits and perks slightly competitive atmosphere."
good,"Enjoyed working here overall. I liked what I did as a technical support advisor. The company made many mistakes with me though, nobody at the site specifically. I had PTO hours taken away, trouble getting time for kids appointments, and other things."
good,"we have un-necessary work, just keep posting an update on the WhatsApp group. keep sending emails even if it is not required, we forward alert emails to the team who is already in cc"
good,"É uma empresa cujo factor humano não é tido em grande consideração, as equipas de RH disponíveis, pertencentes as empresas de outsourcing, passam a imagem do ""se estas mal ajudar-te""."
good,"Worked in Convergys, it got acquired by Synnex. "
good,"My immediate boss at that time who was also on contract did a good job."
good,"It is a good organization to get a breakthrough and encroach into the work culture of an MNC."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Training was awesome due to our trainer. Once on the floor, that's when the good experience dropped from a 5  to 1. TL's are very rude; HR don't listen1"
good,A typical day at work would be taking about 250  inbound calls and assisting customer with directions to  their destinations.  Management is not helpful for the team leads act like they don't really want to help you.  Your schedule can change even within the same week without real time to  make adjustments for your personal life. The hardest part of the job is being around team leads who micromanage everything you do!
good,"One positive point is that the hiring process is really fast."
good,"I worked for Concentrix for a few weeks. Through them I worked for Intuit for the end of tax season. I had put in an application to work on another assignment, but before the application was processed, they processed my termination. The only reason I even knew about that was that I couldn't log in to my work day account to see about getting the pay stub for what apparently was my final paycheck with them, and I couldn't log in to my work email to find out if I had received a response about my next assignment. I called the help desk, and that's when they told me that I was terminated. I contacted the manager that the help desk said that I should contact about this issue (which was not the last manager that I knew about, apparently after the last day I worked but before for I was terminated the managers had been switched 2 more times. That made my 5th in a 3 week period.) I got an email back from this manager in which they forwarded my email and CC'd yet another person. A few days later, I emailed the manager again to see if there was any update of information, and I received a mailer daemon notice. I used another of my email accounts to see if I would get another mailer daemon notice which would tell me that an email server might be down. Instead I received a response telling me that they would try to forward that previous email to the person that they did days before. I never received another communication. If you decide to work for them, have a back up just in case they drop you, and don't expect any answers as to why when they do. Before they just dropped me like that, I thought"
good,"No room for advancement, hired at maximum cap for hourly pay, no bonus or increase YOY.  Workplace culture lacks motivation, management team is awol if you require assistance"
good,Empresa vende uma imagem que lá dentro é totalmente diferente.
good,"Das Arbeitsklima war sehr gut, jedoch wurden Leute unrecht gekündigt."
good,"Understanding that quality and compliance are necessary performance measurements, the constant pressure of your"
good,"received inbound calls at a call center for several different projects. also did clerical work off line. the project come and go sometimes with no warning,"
good,"Nothing fantastic, was a customer service representative. Some calls would be great, others you'd get yelled at for hours. About the same as any other, had to leave due to the stressful environment with both the management, coworkers, as well as the daily customers that had to be dealt with."
good,"sales on new smartphones, tablets, ect. Fun environment to work in, daily spiffs and bonuses. A lot of fun company events held on site for staff. Raffles and giveaways"
good,"Overall, before Concentrix took over for Convergys, everything was awesome, I enjoyed coming to work everyday and being able to fill prescriptions and being able to perform the daily tasks required. However what is upsetting with the whole process is the Walgreens project ending, It's unfortunate that the project couldn't have grown and help people develop as pharmacy technicians. Instead of ending every ones employment. I understand business needs have to be met for the big business. What about the little people that put the CEO's there why do the little people get hurt and why doesn't anyone seem to care anymore? It's not ethical or fair and it leaves a very bad taste in a person's mouth. So I would recommend that Concentrix show they are a good employee by not subjecting their employees to lay off status, which is completely avoidable."
good,"I enjoyed working in Convergys because of my work mates and friends,also some of my supervisors, they are giving me the courage and help that i need whenever i feel like giving up because of the pressure that we have at work. I also learned a lot in that company, because of them i was able to gain my confidence in speaking to different types of people.I also learn how to handle objections and how to be patient. Because of the experiences that i had with Convergys i can say that i became a better person."
good,The management were friendly but not working for the employee.  Advancement is challenging and difficult as they do not provide any options for training.
good,A typical day within the role would be answering inbound calls from members of the public who have been victim to fraud or looking for additional advice. Due to the high demand of calls taken on a daily basis work morale is quite low. Managers and employees have tried to boost morale by given raffle prizes etc.
good,Back then we have to comply for a mandatory OT for 30 minutes for 6 months. So agents were exhausteed most of the time. Plus some operation managers are biased only on the teams that they're handling
good,"Working for the company was not easy.  Certain metrics were required and if they were not, you were written up and then after a certain time frame you were put on basically an IEP where they tried to help you reach those goals."
good,"I learned how to handle challenging customers and resolve issues with the resources provided to me."
good,"Very stressful - the customers were not the top priority the sale was.  I was made to sale what I would not buy nor believed in.  You do not have your own desk.  If you go to the bathroom, break or lunch your desk will be taken and your items in the floor.  Management was not appropriate with other associates they were either dating or living with employees on the team they managed."
good,"Still working here, the job is great for learning what call centres and IT support are about if you are a novice. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"This was a call center, which was a consistent job, consistent hours, and always the opportunity to work more, however, you must endure a lot of abuse from customers, which can lead to annoyance of working there."
good,"the account that i was under is great. it's just that, the management, for me, just don't know how to handle their agents (especially the tenured ones). some of us were treated like we can not be appointed as the new SMEs (even temporarily). lack of work stations, yet they still continue to hire newbies."
good,"Concentrix offered great benefits, for a work at home job I feel the compensation was fair. It gave me opportunity to learn about apple products and technical aspects"
good,"Good place to work if your a dedicated worker , over time mangement is lacking communication and my pay is top out and there is no sign of a raise in any future, 15 is top pay there"
good,It's hard to advance your career at Concentrix.  The pay is also very low compared to other call centers.  The managers are okay and they make an effort for employees to enjoy working there.
good,"It's a good place to get experience if you can get on the Apple side of things. Chug away and you'll be able to check off that ""six months to a year"" of customer experience, etc. It's very easy work."
good,"This is a job where you get your 8.5 hr blocks and your days. You come in and they expect you to be on the phones taking back to back calls for 8 hrs."
good,"Not too bad of a job except management, once your on their bad side as in team manager you start receiving excessive unnecessary corrective actions for things and elements out of your control until your pushed to quit or fired. Workplace harassment complaints filed and still yet it’s always your fault"
good,"They do not screen properly and therefore have some pretty shady, and unprofessional people working there. A place for those just starting out and those who have gone through all the other customer service companies in town."
good,"kein Wertschätzung der Mitarbeiter, schlechte Bezahlung für die erforderlichen Kenntnisse  - kein Aufstiegschancen,"
good,hours was changed with mot enough notice. if you work 3-6 band sometimes they have you come in at 2:30 and took a half hour of your lunch  and if it was slow send you home early.
good,Although some days it was a quiet nice place to work other days you couldn't even hear your customer on the phone it was a zoo 1pm-5pm after that it got very quiet and you could focus .
good,"The most difficult part of the job was learning how to assist the customers.  I went through the training but it was hard to know how to navigate. There is a resource tool but many times I did not know where to look for the information. "
good,"A fast pace job for anyone that loves to answer calls and work on the computer. Breaks and lunches are scheduled on time, and I believe you get a discount for working with them. How AWESOME !"
good,Fine company to work for. Have to wait for your benefits for 6 months(1 year for dental). Would only really recommend for younger people or people who really need it
good,"Complete honesty"
good,This job is a piece of work they don't pay you enough for the mental stress that you have to go thought in the video repair department. its a lot that you need to be ready for. they don't really train you a lot something you have to just wing or ask someone that you are sitting next to.this is they type of job you get to pay your bills . some of the team leaders are cool and are willing to work with you but others have their favorites and help who they want to . sad to say it but its true it happened to me . HR or the OM ( operations Mangers ) don't care about you only thing that they care about is that you are on their clock.
good,some of the agents the moved higher up didn't respect other agents and the same for the higher up. when you tell a supervisor or higher up your problems they don't work with you
good,"Typical day would be checking if there are new cases re-opened and making sure they are closed before end of shift, this for me is the hardest part as cases tend to re-open even when solved or closed."
good,"It was a whole new experiece working for convergys. I had a chance to interact with people but via telephone.  Challenging sometimes, since we had to deal very oftern with angry clients."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Comcast customers can be hard to deal with but  ok .T  the job does give great offers for benefits and improvement but it felt as if it wasn't enough.
good,A good job to start your career ..Managers are very supportive. Job advancement is moderate. hard to deal with the horrible customers and high call volumes.
good,I have learned to manage my time and customers accounts. The culture was not professional but it was well rounded for peers and managers i will recommend this to any first time call center reps. The hardest part of the job was to keep angry customers happy when they are upset and couldn't get what they wanted. the most enjoyable part was the challenges between the teams to meet the stats daily.
good,I had fun because the people are non-discriminatory and very welcoming. Workload became harder as he company focused more in performing agents and wanted more from us.
good,"Concentrix Canada Dartmouth has a great location accessible by all methods of transportation (regular)."
good,"convergys dsnt have opportunity to grow, you have to be around the boss circle to grow up. even you do and exepcional work and work really hard for them what really matther is to be liking as..."
good,"Easy job to do and have, but sometimes management makes it harder than it needs to be. The company is constantly changing policies, which some work and some don’t. During my time there I noticed there were issues with how people were punished and how coaching was done. Overall an easy job, easier when you stick to yourself."
good,"You're training is really in depth which is great. You get a lot of time to understand products and practice on the floor with other associated to show you the way. Once you're on your own though it can feel like drowning. You don't have all the handy quick notes that those associates have on their desk top and getting used to typing while talking on the phone about something else can take time to get used to. Sadly, if you don't meet their standards after training then they kinda give you the nudge that this isn't the job for you."
good,"i have a shifting schedule, toxic environment, but fun. I learn to boost up my self confidence, working with the team. I think the hardest part is when instructing an irate customer."
good,"First contract I worked for was awesome, the training class was very informative and helpful, my co-workers were very helpful, the pay was way than expected and didn't have to live pay check to pay check even though my first check I didn't receive until a month after the pay date. It was almost a year contract and great bonuses."
good,"The biggest issue is that emergencies are not acceptable & management doesn't communicate effectively. According to my immediate manager, I was fired...and yet the PR rep emailed me asking why I had been fired. Just wow."
good,"At first, colleagues are great and workplace is fun and pleasant."
good,Jesus take the wheel. Everyone is cut throat. Its all about me mentally. Workplace is not employee friendly. No where to eat after 5 pm. No manager  around when you need them to take escalations call.
good,"You typically work expecting to have an 8-hour schedule but unfortunately, they would dismiss us after 4 hours schedule and paid half of the rate. It would somehow create dismay, especially so that you expect to earn a day rate."
good,"It's a great place to work, but very hard for advancement. Been working for the same wadge for 10 years. Hard to get ahead, when there is little room for advancement. Looking for a change."
good,"While Convergys has the potential to be a great place to work,unless you kiss up to your boss you're never going to advance. And the office politics are at an extreme level. The job itself is pretty easy if you're good with customer service, but the people make this place hard to put up with. Not to mention your hours will constantly change because they can never get shift bid correct. And when you DO move up, expect your hours to get even worse. You may be promised the moon, but don't expect a pebble from any of your team leads."
good,It was difficult to work when you couldn't find a working mac to sign into work. When you provide tech support for Mac's and you are not allowed to fix your own machine.
good,Hi Turnover atmosphere. Did not receive a raise since I've been there. The cubicles where very close together. It was very hard to hear with all the background noise.
good,"Supportive management, supportive marketing and communications to build awareness and drive lead generation and demand.  Impatient on long sales-cycles typical of large scale CX programs.  Poor integration of sales strategy between analytics unit and contact management outsource side of the business."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Let me start by saying that my experience is many years old and may not reflect the current culture of this company anymore. I have no way of knowing. At the time that I work there the company had just signed their largest client, and the work required extensive training and Licensing in order to even make it out of the training class. We were brought on to fill a need during their very busiest time of year, so there was always, always plenty of overtime available. It began to get very chaotic after a couple of months because there was such a high turnover. And then we suddenly learned that the contract we had all been hired for might not be renewed and we didn't know if there would be other projects that we would be able to work on or if the end of the current project would be the end of our employment."
good,"Work was on a contract and it was told when the contract was completed services will be as well. Working with customers were exciting for me, it was different, most customers were satisfied and polite, some were rude when asked for verification but it was a different experience that I enjoyed. Call centers are hectic, my team leader was great, good effective management and a great disciplinarian and would not hestotate to tell employees they were taking too long lunch hours. Good administration from immediate but the total running was not satisfactory."
good,"Handling most calls are as stressful as some but there are those customers that no matter what you do or say they are still going to be unhappy and you have to learn to deal with them"
good,Typical  day consists of non-stop inbound phone calls from customers. I learned to hone my customer service skills and become very persuasive. Production Management is the best group of people I've ever met and would gladly work for them anytime. However current sight manager is running it into the ground. The workplace culture is very cliquey and you have to know people to get ahead. The hardest part of this job currently is the training it is very inadequate and does not fully prepare you to do the job. Also the trainers and  team leads are just as clueless as the incumbent employees. I did enjoy helping people especially the elderly people who would call in.
good,"None stop calls"
good,clean environment but the working hrs are long and no leaves and every time overtime. No personal time. Employees are good but the seniors are not supporting.
good,"Typical day would be taking payments over the phone and assisting credit card customers with any questions over their bill and determining why a customer was late and how to prevent future late payments. Setting up hardship plans for customers, waiving late fees, managing accounts, looking for misapplied payments etc."
good,it would better if management/team leaders knew how to do just that ...MANAGE.  very unprofessional environment.  the incentives are AMAZING though and that's about it .
good,Convergys did not provide consistent job security on a daily basis. If the program you were working on ended you were not guaranteed consistent employment or even the opportunity for consideration elsewhere. You were fired for inappropriate reasons and their turnaround rates were extremely high.
good,"It's a call center. I didn't really enjoy it. It did help me get something to bring in, but not enough to survive for the need of my family. It's okay"
good,"Customer service rep who moved up to escalation specialist. I loved resolving customer issues, but once they started focusing on sales ,the job became much less likable. In order to advance, you had to sell or upsale products. I did not feel comfortable selling or upselling to upset customers, thus i did not go far."
good,"I liked my co-workers.  The job was not hard, but stressful.  The best part of the job was when the customers appreciated that you helped them.  The worst part was getting yelled at by the customer."
good,"The company sucks... management showos favoritism and if you arent apart of the ""clique"" youre just out of luck. They have a point system which is RIDICULOUS. This is the WORST place to work"
good,N/A
good,Its a typical day assisting consumers with complaints and meeting their needs. Anything else that goes above and beyond is met with reimbursements and compensation.
good,"This company changes very often, different project , and I felt the training was not enough. This was a temporary job for me while going to college, but not a place you want to be for to long."
good,"For the most part the management is great. I only had one manager that was terrible. "
good,"Convergys can be very unprofessional , they show favoritism and are not completely fair with employees in regards to personal situations or the work environment . You can go complain to your team lead or operations manager even to HR and nothing will get done they will wait for something to escalate first before preventing issues with in co workers happening . They say you have a chance of ''advancement'' but you're only liking to grow if you're favorited by team leads / supervisors . You don't always get recognition for doing good on the job ."
good,"This would be a great place to work if they had a union, they do not treat everyone the same.  Some are given the shift they want because they are friends with the scheduler. Some are terminated due to the team lead just not liking them and there is no way to dispute this."
good,The company is a big name in the industry. I have been working here for past almost 10months now. Management is not really upto the mark. Also not very employee centric.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"no tiene buen ambiente de trabajo, no tiene facilidades,"
good,this company gives good training on communication and how to handle situation . 2 months of training is good.The hardest part is most of the time you have to work on night shifts.
good,I enjoy talking with different people i like the people ive met since being at this location.. Security is really nice they will help you if they can.
good,needs improvement on salary and benefits. good job on workplace. management is good balance workplace supervisor and operations manager is approachable
good,"I worked for this company for almost an year at the farmington hills one. this location is exactly like HIGH SCHOOL they have really poor management . i would only recommend this job if you are 24 and UNDER . the mangers of the job are childish as , the rules changed everyday they have people helping other agent who don't know what there doing which isn't helpful if you are a new hire. everyone put on this act when the REAL FCA comes in to see how everyone doing. REAL LIFE JOKES IN HERE. they make you do all this work but won't give you a pay raise. if you do decide to work here just know you going back to high school."
good,"There are not enough ways to describe how bad it really is. Run away, don't even walk. You'll be better off. Ask anyone who has ever been there if you need proof."
good,Co-workers were great to be around and encouraging. Some managers were ok to be around and others were not. Learned how to read a bill and explain it to a customer in an effort to retain the customers business.
good,would not work for them again. Company is run very unprofessionally. They put you in training classes and only let you work for so long on what you just learned before they train you again on something completely different.
good,"customers can be abusive, backwards reward system, no work-life balance, basically no choice of schedule, just a number, ok benefits, first world sweat shop, little organization and support"
good,My time at convergys was good but the management was not helpful but work environment is good as there are lot of people there to learn and eager to find out new thing.
good,We were told there would be more projects available after the holidays but there were none. Everyone was laid off right after Christmas. Tech Support for work at home agents were not kind or effective.
good,"If you just want to have a career and you have your own business to support your family. Then, you can definitely try your luck at this company. There are amazing people working for this company and it was a fun experience for me. But hey, I gotta keep my self afloat."
good,"very long calls, not enough pay for what is required from the job. Very stressful environment, huge lack of communication from managers. Coworkers are not fully trained to handle job."
good,Terrible run the opposite direction there are other jobs with more professionalism that for one know how to speak to employees and also have management that understands the needs of the contract
good,"Concentrix has become a pain to work for lately because of the lack of employee engagement, strict rules and the job itself being incredibly straining"
good,"Young individuals start their career in Convergys with high aspirations, but there is minimal / no  career path options. "
good,"IT, HR, AP, Payroll, Recruiting and other departments are deplorably run by incompetent people...  CNX has grown remarkably in a short time thru acquisition, but their operational departments are in need of serious talent and direction."
good,"As with other call center/BPO companies, all they care about is pleasing clients without even considering the welfare of the people. Overtime is pushed, bathroom breaks are even restricted."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Convergys is a good work place. But I find the management and staff not caring for their employees that much."
good,Job was supposed to be full time and the contract ended within 2 months of starting. Training was not accurate for the job that was preformed. Sink or float position.
good,"It's a good company to work but local (Kolkata) management and hr policies could drag you in an unstable working environment. "
good,"BE ready to work, this can be a cool place to work if you are only about the money and don't mind that being the focus. if you want to move up in a higher position then this would not be for you."
good,"Depending on what department you are working in, depends on the level of stress. It can be a very highly stress job. Very high turnover.  Dealing with members by phone or chat."
good,"I worked at Convergys India full-time (More than a year)"
good,A typical work day would be supervising 20-3- individuals and working on coaching and customer service skills. I learned how to be very patient. The work culture was diverse. I enjoyed teaching my agents and watching them move forward in their careers.
good,Co workers were nice..Managers unprofessional..They need to pay higher. There should be better benefeits and the building is in need of repair. I do not recommend this company for this reason
good,"It's a full time job where most of the options are Fast Food or Customer Service. Unfortunately, you're a number here.  You get all different answers on how to do things and sometimes get to train your own bosses."
good,"I worked at Concentrix for a while and enjoyed myself. Management isn't the strongest. The day goes by fast enough and the pay is decent, allowing for the possibility of commision."
good,I was able to gain full time experience along with confidence in employers. I also was able to learn Salesforce along with 15 other software programs. It was definetely stressful as customers on the phone would show thier various attitudes. The calls were many times back to back.
good,The good about concentrix is they are giving incentives /freebies to their employees. The hardwork that their employees are doing is being well paid off.
good,"Each person had their own cubicle taking inbound calls, we couldn't miss any calls and all calls had to be tracked in the system for those who were Application Assistants. We followed a script so it would make the call faster and easier. As an application assistant you would rarely get a call but if you were a Tier 1 operator you would get calls back to back, maybe 60+ calls a day. The team leaders were sometimes rude and were involved in work drama. Some of them employees were nice but A LOT of them acted as if they were still in high school on at home and not at work. The pay was good and you got paid for training which was only about a week. Sometimes I would get bored sitting all day because I like to move around but its not that bad. This is almost the easiest job you can have."
good,"typical day at work as a software support agent come in and take call and assist customers, alot of time they would have us in the wring que and if we spoke about it we were basically told to deal with basically doing triple the work for the same pay, Management was alright they took care of business but you can tell they really dont care for the employees we are replaceable. the work enviornment is cool the people around you help make it less stressful. The hardest part is being overwhelmed . the most enjoyable part about the job would be my peers."
good,My experience at Convergys was a great opportunity to learn more in the IT field and also improve on my customer service.  It is a great first job but not a lot of room for growth or development.
good,"Not the most exciting place to work , the staff unorganized, policy constantly changing. hourly wages were to low for the work load given. Best part of working here was being able to make friends."
good,Es un ambiente profesional de trabajo con alta presión laboral y de cumplimiento de estándares.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Work day is shift basis"
good,Work environment and other facilities were good in Convergys but they don't provide good salary as per experience. For freshers Convergys is the good place.
good,"I feel like I'm at the club instead of work most of the time; all the yelling out loud when we have chat is something I just can't figure out.  I also don't understand why management feels the need to twerk down the isles, but there is a strict noise requirement when you work from home (which I would prefer).  There are also those days when changes are made, which we are absolutely not aware of and have to hunt for information about how to access it.  Why is the music blasting in the background with no regard for us needing to hear what our customer is saying?!  They are not all yelling at us when we answer the phone.  The training is so out-dated that when you get on the floor, the first thing you tend to do is raise your hand for assistance."
good,"Training was informative, learned to identify what a customers needs were and provide best options available to the customer. Sales for directv was the most difficult part of the job with management constantly pushing for sales."
good,"Everyone seems friendly, it is a very high stress job, no reward, no monetary incentive.  Working from home is the only plus and the coworkers are great.  Pay is below standard, benefits nil...advancement--none to be had.  Extremely high turnover started with 28 agents, 4 remain, most gone in 3 months... lose 1-2 agents per week.  Customers are very volatile and angry and you are expected to take the abuse."
good,"Convergys is nothing special, its not a place you stay at or advance in. The management is all hired from outside and no personality checks are done. HR is practically non existent."
good,"i didnt mind the job itself at all... the people i worked with were always extremely friends, supportive and helpful. in the end it was the fact that the hours were so crazy while i was going through a rough time in my life so it caused me to miss to much time resulting in my employment being terminated.... the job itself is fine but i do however think that the 4-5 10hour in a row work days for months on end at only $11.25 an hour was a bit much.... i felt like all i ever did was work yet you wouldnt know it by the paychecks i was bringing in.... one day i might give it another go...."
good,Learned a lot about credit and it helped me gain some good financial knowledge. Did not like the schedule and the pay was low however you are able to make good bonuses from sales.
good,"i really cant say much more than i wish my time had been longer but , what was offered and how it was offered wasnt as appealing as it should have been"
good,The site manager and other upper management are very open and transparent. but they need to hire more professional people. The pay is competitive but the benefits are expensive
good,The call center is a place where you can embrace change! You have the opportunity to move about the company to different departments giving the ability to learn how departments work together.
good,"Convergy's was the project holder at the time. and it was like a normal phone job. Lousy metrics, hard to handle customers and constantly changing policies. I would recommend working for Capital One, but with Convergy;s it's a dice shoot if the job site looses the project you are out of a job."
good,"Convergys was a nice place to work, I would recommend someone to apply if they enjoy a fun work environment and great individuals to work with! Very easy job, provider customer service through the phones."
good,"This job appears as the perfect work place from the outside, but once you pass your interview, which isn't hard due to the company's high turn around rate, you are thrown into a web of lies and deceit. They do not appear to care about their employees and it seems to be because they hire a variety of people all the time. They are non consistent with policies nor pay. The job does not provide a sense of security."
good,The training for Convergys was educational. The environment was hectic at times but management made life easy. We did have a heavy case load but I was invited to work as an operator which was an honor. I appreciated managements ability to find a good fit for the employees.
good,"I worked here for 14 years​ and there were times that it was a good work place. Lately however it has gone down hill. I left because for me it had become a poisoning work environment​. The managers they have in place have been there far too long and are in need of an upgrade. I also left because of the sales aspect but if you like to sell and are good at selling it can be a good job. Wage wise you'll see little to no increase. Your schedule is based on your performance when it comes to shift bidding. If you can sell they'll leave you be but if you don't sell they will hound you until you do. Every conversation with TL and MO are the same...Sell sell sell...Even if you hit your targets, they'll ask for more. Good luck if you join here."
good,"Not a Place for People with Disabilities, Totally unreasonable in the demands put on people for the amount of pay."
good,Great training. Fun environment. Great learning experience. Close to home. Flexible schedules. Awesome co-workers. Awesome supervises. Lots of parking.
good,"There is just too much to cover, Safe to say as a manager you are taught a model of how to coach and develop your agents, and then some of the management above you does not follow that model."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Convergys is highly process and number driven organization. The hectic and demanding work day keeps you on toes and engaged, although at times you find it over burdening and repetitive (almost every process has two separate and independent tools) and a lot of time is spent drawing parity between both."
good,Organisation gives you a lot of work exposure but the incentives and salary are too less as compared to the market trends. The Human Resource turnover is extremely high.
good,"Convergys is a great place to work. Awesome benefits. Pay is awesome. Overtime is unlimited to agents. "
good,"Very poor manage. No one knows what to do. Poor , very poor leadership. Please don't look to feel supported in difficult situations.  A lot of times i was confused on a call and wasn't able to get any help."
good,if your looking for a promotion after 6months and if you qualify and meet all the KPI then this company is for you for so much in challenges and opportunities with management and customer service relations specially with their front desk and their security team.
good,"I had fun in this company. But as time.goes by,  i realized that tbenefits are not enough. Also, I felt that Im not growing. I wanted to do something related with my field so I will resign once I get a job"
good,"I didn't like the fact that everything we did was based on stats, It was very unorganized and unhealthy, a very stressful job"
good,"work load was acceptable and manageable, and the environment is friendly enough."
good,every day is the same all mattering on where you work at in the building. you answer inbound phone calls and assist customers in their issues. its nice that it is not a 24 hour call center.
good,"They can work better on their management skills and have better benefits for the employees, the company needs to appreciate the value of the employee because they are the foundation of the company."
good,"Customers are generally angry, human resources does everything BY the book, management is lost and disconnected, and you can't have peanuts...  we're all ADULTS...carry your epipen.  Adult workplace with daycare like attitudes"
good,Structure très formatrice et innovante en techniques de marketing et management.
good,"Convergys is good for a short term job, most of the time the management is not the best aside from a few and the co workers as well. There are times you can meet some good people on the floor and also on the phones but the training isn't good you learn everything when you get onto the floor and there are times when you deal with some horrible people on the phones. The benefits are pretty good you have the option to get medical, dental, and eye insurance and that is something I like. the job isn't to hard but the hardest thing to deal with is the co workers and management."
good,"At the beginning of my shift I would sit down, log onto my computer, log on to the dialer and start taking calls.  I learned how to multitask, give direction to people over the phone, and operate the dialer.  Management was very hands off and I was very independent.  My co-workers were all around ( call center ) and very helpful.  The hardest part of the job for me was learning how to take call after call which became the most fun."
good,"Since this company does other companies work, your pay will be a lot lower than if you worked for the company that they represent.  Management is good but some people in that position  have a questionable character."
good,"Convergys started out OK, however as time has gone on it has proven a little less then satisfactory for me. The attendance policy changed recently and if you are a single minute past your shift starting point, you are given a 1/4 point, which is a verbal warning at 5-6 and a review/potential termination at 8. There isn't anything our operating manager can do about it, so because the computer systems are slow you get get a ding on your attendence. "
good,"•	Handles inbound, outbound calls related to client’s product - customer service, inquiry, selling, complaint handling and processing of requests. "
good,Good...i worked there since 2014. Inside the floor..its very nice and enjoyable..evrything is fine.salary is very low..basic take home salary is 6.5k.
good,"It was a good working experience, but the job did make many people really stressed. Many people did not last long in this job. While looking back I would say the job is good, it isn't for everyone. The Managers always seemed to want more from you and it always felt like you were unimportant, even if you did above average like myself."
good,"Typical day at work is usually having calls from clients abroad with their different concerns.  "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,This company gives enough chances for learning and growth. but this company doesn't believe in paying employee much. company is big and you will get verity of process diversity and hardwork.
good,"excellent , but there is a problem within the management , co workers and the team leaders are great , hardest part would be the schedule always split ooff"
good,The job itself is cool but it would be better if they has better Team Leads.The work hours are flexible. During a regular day of work  the time go by much faster because we stayed busy  with calls.
good,"Trainers were really good. But in terms of their management, I can say that it is not good as what I am thinking before I applied on their company. There is always disputes with our pay and incentives are not yet received. We can't maximize our working hours because they don't have enough stations for their agents. In that case, we need to wait for an available station so we can take in calls. Technically, no station means unpaid hours which results to low salary."
good,Drama filled workplace where the managers have no clue what's going on.  The bonus payout program is a joke and they build things up but when you get in there it's like I wad back in high school
good,You experience a high volume of calls each days with customers ranging from pleasant to upsetting. You enter copious amounts of customer data including billing and tech information. You have two 15 minute breaks and one 45 minute lunch. You are given incentives by adding lines to customers phone plans and selling Direct TV packages.
good,"I worked for a new department that was in charge of troubleshooting wifi in General Motors vehicles, resolving data usage conflicts, connecting bluetooth as well as educating customers on features of the car."
good,I did not like the way you dont have control over your time off. i have never worked for a company that makes you put in paid time 5 weeks in advance. i do not like that i cant use my unpaid time on the days i actually need it. you literally have to beg for the time off.
good,"Job was completely monotonous and no scope t show case creativity . Plus there was no job security . When company lost one of its client/process , they asked us to look for a different job ."
good,Management makes it hard to work there. They make it uncomfortable to go to them with issues. They are rude and nasty at best. Constantly making changes to team leads which results in a mess with your personal info.
good,"Was brought on as temporary worker for Census program. Answered calls and dealt with irate customers."
good,"- I learnt a lot about data banking and customer support."
good,Love my co-wokers/team and the fact it has unlimited overtime hours. Very competitive between teams. Plenty of training before you start working.
good,The environment is productive but the daily tasks are stressful. The community with the company is supportive and friendly.
good,It was an ok place to work. The support staff was not all it could have been. Alot of confusion. ATT is a very hard campaign to work for.
good,"a typical day at work their is now work and i just want myself busy. i learned something ow the days that i have no job i feel boring. i have a self control and i manage my time instantly. for my co-workers, i feel nervous because i think they are not sometime approachable. the hardest part of my job is when their is no instruction at all and my enjoyable part of my job is their is part of jowking."
good,"Convergys was a fast paced environment dealing with inbound customer service calls on a Rogers contract.  The days could be stressful in my position because I would do a lot of running around a call centre answering questions to help customer service representatives find appropriate and valued solutions for wireless customers.  "
good,The job pays well but the management does not follow through with anything. Standards change from day to day and from employee to employee. Strong focus on numbers but they are easily accessible. Co-workers are easy to work with and the company does do extras such as company wide contests and a free lunch from time to time.
good,"Great company to start working for if you are fresh to the job scene or looking for work in between careers. There are many things lacking at this company. Pride. Competent management. Holiday pay. Tenured agents that aren't twisted in some way,"
good,"Helped at&t customer with their phones, accounts, or payments. I learned how use multiple systems at the time and multitask with helping  a customer in a timely fashion."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Great Job to start at call center! Needs better management, could use more recognition for employees. Hopefully gets better in time!"
good,"Developed Confidence and how to interact with the foreign Customers and sales skills "
good,I was in a contract with this organization. The workload can be heavy at times but the people are great. I learned a lot from this job in which I figured out what I really wanted to do. Its a call center environment which is not something I want to do. Compensation was the main issue in my reason for leaving.
good,"Convergys tiene un ambiente en el que puedes trabajar en confianza, tenemos libertad de ir vestidos de forma comoda aunque professional."
good,"The rules are impossible to follow. Pay is too low to care for family. They will work with you when you need time changes. The supervision on the floor is remarkable but the big bosses are removed and hard to relate to,"
good,"While I had high hopes when I started there they were quickly transformed into thoughts of negativity. I have never worked somewhere so disorganized in all me experience. My schedule and manager were constantly changing. My skill level and job were based solely on customer surveys where the customer could not be satisfied with the product and that review would reflect negatively on my abilities. There was no dispute process. Overall, I was not happy there and was jobless at the end of the contract because they decided to close the site."
good,"This company does not care for their employees. Everyone is paid the same, they say they give bonuses but every time you meet the standards for it they change so that you will not meet the next month. If you are lucky enough to get the bonus it will take them two months to pay it to you and 99% of the time it is wrong and you need to fight to get it.  Managers are under trained and can not assist. (AT&T plus convergys suck). They want you to work with several products but do not want to pay employees right. When I started we only worked with wireless we made 9.00 hr- plus we received commission from AT&T and monthly bonuses from Convergys . Now we have to deal with Uverse/Wireless/and Directv we make 11.00 hr- we do not get commission anymore ( that was the only perk) and if we are lucky enough we might get a monthly bonus. The health insurance is expensive and not worth it. The sight director is useless and a waste of space. I would not recommend anyone to apply at this company!!!!!"
good,"Building and location are gorgeous. Trainers and recruiters are super nice. Management is unorganized, training materials are outdated and often broken, no raises given at all unless a promotion is given, management prefers to pass the buck and play the blame game instead of actually fix problems. Pay is really good and they offer full, but expensive, benefits."
good,"Kids coming out of highschool, or even still in highschool think that not many places are hiring and are turned to McDonalds. The thing about these guys is that they just hire new people for a short time, and force you out before a year is up, so they dont have to give you benefits. Lucky if you get 10 hours a week there. Management is also little help and usually rude. If this is your first job, i promise it gets better from here by a long shot"
good,"For me, this was a good job to get back on my feet. Starting pay is $11.00 hr. They will hire pretty much anyone. There are a few perks to the job but the training isn't great, lots of communication issues between management and upper management. Not a place to make a career out of. Kinda like being in high school again."
good,"When I was hired, I signed up only for billing for ADSL. As we move along, they started conducting trainings for new lines of business like retention, fiber optics, mobile and technical support which is definitely fine with me just as long as they increase our salary or add benefits but that was not the case. Yes, I learned a lot but the stress  keeps getting higher due to demands here and there from our superiors, targets to hit was poured over our head without considering that we are still on the process of mastering the products  and processes. Management only cares about the numbers and forget about the frontliners."
good,"Not flexible with schedules, Convergys outsources for other companies. So you are working for the middle man. If you have a chance to apply directly with DTV etc I would recommend that"
good,"Busy day coaching, payroll, weekly reports, quality assurance. Excellent relationships built with co-workers. Fun place to work"
good,"fun place but not stable enough they cut your hours out of the no where then lay you off, other then that the job is fun and easy and its great that they are not a scripted company"
good,"It a good place to start but like almost any other job its governed by politics. However if you choose to stay, make sure you become friends with the higher ups. I seen it with my own two eyes."
good,"A typical day consisted of finding a working cubicle and clocking in. At least once a day one of the systems would crash. When you were encountering an issue that you needed help with you would have to raise your hand and wait for a manager or floor helper to assist you. At times you could be waiting over 5 mins. for someone. Most of the day you would have to check your schedule and make sure it didn't change. Almost always you had mandatory overtime. Every six months you would get a new schedule and new points. You received 7.5 points and you would use these points every time you called in. If you had a doctor's appointment on a work day, you weren't able to switch shifts with any one, thus meaning you wither had to request it off or call in. Convergys' HR is a joke. For example, I was told by my team lead to inform and inquire about maternity leave with our HR. I waited 30 mins. to even speak with some one. When I finally got to speak with them, I was scolded for coming to them. They then told me that to request maternity leave I had to log in to a system and complete it that way. I explained that I had never been able to access that system. They did not believe me. After 3 attempts to get in, I was given a number and told to call it for my leave. I called the number and told the person on the other line that I was needing to request maternity leave. The person then kept referring to my leave as a leave of absence not maternity leave. When I told him the dates, he said that I needed to call back within 30 days of the date I wanted to leave. This company is not the best for"
good,"Depending on your manager and how they judge you based soley on your first impression you may or may never get advancement. People that are promoted are not necessarily promoted based on skill all the time. Every few months they have shift bids. You are not guaranteed a shift you like/want unless you maintain better stats than the lower 50%."
good,Being a BPO it is hard to grow and stay but while here was a good job. I just wish our contract would not have ended. But I loved the team I supervised they were like family to me
good,"In the bpo sector . i have do the work as sales executive , my work was solve the problems of customer , delay taking 100 to 150 calls"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"-Answering inbound & making outbound calls"
good,"As far as a job goes, Convergys is pretty straightforward; however, HR does not do an effective job at investigating workplace harassment and violence, creating a hostile work environment, unfortunately."
good,"At Pick N Save I was a deli clerk.  I would prepare customer orders, cook, and clean.  The management was ok and so were my coworkers.  The hardest part of the job was having to get the department ready for inspections.  The most enjoyable part was being able to cook."
good,"I feel that the lack of training and managements inability to care for their employess make it a difficult place to work."
good,assisted customers over the phone with phone repair issues and also setup appointment for techs to resolve the issue. also collected payments
good,"I learned many things there that will better my career in the technical field.The other agents there, not only from Dell, but from other companies in the building are all very friendly. But the management is absolutely horrible. All they care about there are the stats that the agents have to manage, don't really care about the job being done right. If you don't do direct deposit, and you accidentally messed up your address when you put it in, it can take up to 3 months before you see your first paycheck."
good,"The best things about this position are the paid training and the bonuses you receive once you reach Customer Retention level. Not somewhere you want to be for very long, but most people don't stay too long anyway."
good,"The coworkers are awesome and friendly. Its a legitimate work from home company. This company has different projects such as AT&T, Home Depot, and others. I worked the AT&T project. The hardest part of the job was focusing on the sales instead focusing on the customer issues that may be irrate."
good,Until recently it was a fun place to work. However new leadership really changed that and made it not a good place to work anymore.
good,"Good people, but due to it being a call center environment and it being Payment Card Industry certified secure, your activities are tracked, micromanaged, coached, and very restricted. For example, only SiriusXM related websites are allowed to viewed from your desk computer. When I started we were allowed to stream music at our desks via SiriusXm's website and they had televisions with various programming on in the call center, but both have gone away. They seem to be always understaffed and periodically require overtime."
good,it is more of a job for those straight out of HS. Not very professional in the way the organization is ran but little room for growth.
good,"This job is not bad, but on the work floor its, a lot of yelling, makes it difficult to hear customers over the phone. The management is helpful, but the schedules change way too often."
good,The company bought out Stream. Then imposed all kinds meaningless rules and regulations. It made the job less fun and turned it into what could only be explained as a prison. Granted they have a variety of giveaways/events but they are meaningless when they tell you that you cant participate because during the time that it occurs you are to be on the phone with no questions asked.
good,"Productive community, goal oriented, lots of opportunities to move up. Stressful but they have a stress management program you can call to help manage it."
good,"although we worked by ourselves assisting providers on the phone, we also had team members on either side of us to assist when needed."
good,"It isn't the worst place to work in the world, but it is very unorganized and the management staff is not always the friendliest or the most willing to help when you need."
good,A typical day at Convergys was filled with phone calls helping customers lower their Direct TV bill. I did help customers by helping them understand their bill and taking payments over the phone. The hardest part was dealing with the difficult customers and also managers hovering around making sure that you don't say the wrong thing or they wait until the coach you about what you need to work on.
good,"appeler les entreprises et ou particuliers pour vendre "
good,Started off doing customer service. By the end of the contract I was able to move into another positions. One position I held was to work on the SME line for  escalated calls. I also held the position of educating my fellow coworkers on new systems as well as products.
good,"A good first job , friendly co-workers  relaxed atmosphere  be prepared for rude/agitated customers  majority of the callers are friendly"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Learned a lot of different skills by interacting with different management and moving up through the company but hit the max really fast as you move up the salary cap does not change a whole lot.
good,"typical day at Minacs high call volume, I have learned patience also the management team are very nice also if you are young great environment, hardest part asking if you can go to the restroom, I enjoy speaking to my customers"
good,"took inbound customer support calls for a cell phone company.  Learned to provide thorough and exception customer service.  My manager was a great guy who cared and did an excellent job although I feel he was working on his degree to move on, he still seemed to take care of his team, while making them feel cared about in the mean time.  Co-workers were alright, nothing extremely positive or negative to say.  I enjoyed most of my times there, but was ultimately using that as a stepping stone.  The hardest part of that job was trying to help people that didn't have the first clue what they were talking about, or doing with a cell phone in their hand.  Sad but true.  Sometimes there's only so much you can do before needing to meet in person to show someone what to do, and explain in more understandable detail."
good,a typical day at work was coming right in and heading straight to your workspace and taking calls consistently until break time (first break 15 minutes). And repeating the same task until lunch and eventually the end of your shift. extremely robotic.
good,I liked working here because I had a really good supervisor who made the job fun. I worked for a chat project for AT&T and I learned a lot.
good,"Good working environment,and friendly CSRs, but management is lacking in both mangerial and inter-personal skills. The management team I worked with were unprofessional and self-centred, with their main concern being their own improvement and less onus on improving the company's reputation."
good,Come here.  But don't stay.  No security and no appreciation.  Managers don't do much and theres no room for advancement at all.
good,"This company is trying to launch the English side of the DTV account. The point system is ridiculous, you get sent home sick and receive points, you come to work with a doctor or hospital note and still receive points. They don't expect you to have issues that may come up on a day to day bases. like life doesn't through you little challenges."
good,"The best part of the job is you'll never get bored because of the continuous changes and demands of the clientele. However, as an HR practitioner, you need to extend long hours of work to get the job done."
good,jod security is not a plus for convergys they go thru people left and right so noone feels like they can breath there i have mand numerious complaints on my tl none have been addresses
good,"When you first get there you like it but after a while a lot of people don't like it. They say you can move up but I haven't seen it happen. You can be late clocking at a ridiculous time for example say you have to be at work at 9:30 and yuo clock in at 9:30:05 that counts against you. Even if you system is not running as it should you still get docked. On the plus side they do have a really good training period even though its quite long. They also teach you good skills that can be applied to almost anywhere you work especially if you are working in sales. You may also enjoy the people you work with, the co workers really do make Convergys if it wasn't for them people probably wouldn't stay as long as they do."
good,"My normal shift starts at 9:00 am and end at 6:00pm. Daily spiffs and drawings to win gift cards, maintain survey scores. take about 15 to 20 calls per day."
good,This is a good job if you have no life outside of it. If you don't sign up for overtime they add it to your schedule. A very long and tedious 14 day training then 6 weeks of nesting than you are on the production floor.
good,"Convergy's does a criminal background check as well as a drug screening test for all employees, which is paid by the company. There is also 6 weeks of paid training at 9.00 per hour. The training is 8 hours per day 2:00pm to 10:30pm. During training you get two 10 minute breaks and 1 30 minute break for lunch. Once you have completed training you go into transition. At this time depending if you are full or part time your breaks will change. For part time you will work a minimum of 25 hours but you will get mandatory hours that you will not have a chance to deny. During your part time shift you get 1 10 minute break."
good,Very unprofessional. Issues with pay. Management switches up to often. Does not work with scheduling conflicts nor do they sympathize with health issues. Great co-workers. Great incentives to get workers to work over-time.
good,"Fun @ Work is the key motto in our company. As they say All Work & No Fun makes a person's life boring."
good,"Job is basically fine. Handle incoming calls from SiriusXM customers. Handle issues. Collect past due monies. Promote additional channels that the customer may not know."
good,"Convergys was a great place to work when it comes to the pay. I was very much able to keep current on my bills and rent, but it was very stressful as I had to work overtime. With little to no sleep or free time, I was burnt out very quickly and the management did little to nothing to support me. You are but a drone for this company."
good,"Nothing special here."
good,"A typical day at work would be coming in, heading to work station area and start answering phones concerning transferring radio service from old car to new car , I learned how to slow myself down when speaking to customers because most of our inbound calls were from elderly customers, Management was not as organized because if I were to put a request of anything such as new headset , login information not working, etc. I would have to keep requesting until I made sure I got it in that instant, there as no hard part of the job and most enjoyable part of the job was during break-time everyone gets together in the lounge area and has a god 10 minute break ."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"The job itself is wonderful for people who enjoy the line of work. However this branch was absoutely terrible."
good,work from home managed myself doing excellent customer service and sales. achieved numerous awards and was ranked upper tear in sales
good,Pay scale was much lower than other centers in the area. Benefits cost too much for what you are earning. Had very diverse job culture.
good,"I don't know if it is the company, area, or both?. . . But man they used to treat their employees like second rate citizens. . . At one point management locked me and a few other co-workers in when it was time to get off. . . . ."
good,"Decent place to work.  Just decent.  But I would not recommend anyone to work there.  Management is not good.  The ""rules"" are changed in the middle of the ball game.  Schedule changes all the time.  No Work/Life Balance at all."
good,"Great coworkers, management has favoritism. You could be a rockstar in customer service and one month with bad scores and you're fired."
good,I have learned so much from working in Convergys. The only thing that made me leave the company is that I didn't feel well compensated with the total number of skills assigned to us in our new process. I was moved to a different process prior to resigning and I realized that the salary is not worth the job given to us at all
good,"I've worked for Convergys IC, which has only recently been acquired by Convergys. My employer was formerly known as LBM and nothing has changed in the way the business is run. As an outsource telemaketer it has a lower salary/commission scheme than lots of others but better job security and HR processes than most. If you are a top seller and want to progress to team leader then there is scope for that but at that level there are a lot of reports to run as management always want to know about your team's dialler stats in addition to normal performance reporting. Most people hate the job but love the people they work with."
good,You come into work and immediately get on the phone with complaining customers. Some of the managers are amazing and some have it out for you. the co-workers are amazing and that's about it.
good,Being on the phone for eight hours assisting customers.  The workplace was fairly clean and safe.
good,"They do have great benefits but there was always confusion within upper and lower management, especially with the employees. Fast-paced environment. There is favortetism, clicks, and hard work goes unrecognized."
good,Very busy all the time.  The work was very detailed.  It was an ok company to work for.
good,"I learned alot, I met alot of new people who became friends. No regrets."
good,This used to be a great company to work at. Lots of very nice individuals at middle and lower levels of the company.
good,"middle management was kind of aloof in the beginning. my coworkers were friendly for the most part. the hardest part of the job, was the sometimes irate customers. the most enjoyable part of the job was the comradery."
good,My job is filled with caring people. The job I perform is not hard but can be very time-consuming when I have to provide coaching and feedback.
good,This has been my first call center job and I like the call center atmosphere. I work with great people and I have a flexible schedule which allows me to spend more time with my son. However since it is a growing company there are many growing pains. People don't seem to last. I was also lied to about my role  in the company. I was told I was going to do In bound calls but somehow was placed in outbound calls. I don't mind doing the work I just don't appreciate being lied to. The company also need to be more organized. I feel like nobody knows whats going on half of the time.
good,"Customer Service,set appts.  Do confirms of appts, outbound to set appts"
good,"They lied about what we would be doing "
good,"If you are looking for a call center, this is one of them. Lack of management, never having the ability to move  up."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,8 hours on the phone assisting typically angry customers. Hardest part for me is sales. Most enjoyable? Team meetings.
good,"Stream/Convergys is an entry level position workplace. This is not by any means a place to end up or make a career out of."
good,Its good place to work for. where fun is there along with working
good,"Take phone calls from americans about there chrysler vehicle problem. Must have patience and be able to tolerate people yelling at you . Most co-workers are nice , most supervisors are good to deal with ."
good,I took in-bound calls for a company that moved their operations to a Convergys-owned facility in the Philippines. Upper management frequently made decisions that cut lower employees off at the knees. They require us to make bricks but won't provide the water. The job is mindless.
good,"I would provide phone customers service with smart phones that were thought to be warranty defective. Most customers required de-escalation and step by step instructions on reformatting operating software."
good,Answer calls from customers who needed help by either answering general questions or troubleshooting physical problems with equipment.
good,Convergys was not the best job.  Calls were always high because so many people would call out because they were lloking for other jobs or because the didn't want to come back to work.  The main thing I learned was that it not the doctors fault if you medications are not covered at the local pharmacy. The people that worked there were like you were in high school all over again. People would not respect the others that were on call as they were walking by. The hardest  part of the job was to over look the people that worked with you.
good,Work was good but work life balance was not good. Management seemed good.
good,The atmosphere was very unprofessional. There were fighting amoung co-workers on the collections floor.
good,The attendance policy is somewhat harsh and there is little room for career advancement or pay increase. Great job as a stepping stone.
good,"When first starting at Convergys I had a great time.  Not to date myself, but it was a decent starting wage back then.  "
good,I work with amazing co-workers that make my job easier. The hardest part of the job is controlling the work/life balance because the company expects tons of admin work
good,Management not at reliable. Wonderfull colleagues. Going for breaks with co-workers.
good,The job is great if you want to learn customer service and phone skills.
good,"the company itself provides great compensation for their employees. great pay, occasional bonuses. healthcare and alike but it stops there. their saying that the employees needs comes first, is a total lie. they're understaff, inconsiderate and will overwork their employees. job advancement is only available and applicable to bosses pets. management is also poor. calls waiting but not all hands at deck. forced overtimes, delayed breaks during queuing periods."
good,Blue Cross Blue shield members and providers call in to gather benefits on the member.
good,"it was very unorganized, no support from mgmt, no support to help customers, not very good pay"
good,•Clarify customer requirements; probe for and confirm understanding of requirements or problem.
good,This place is a revolving door. Most people quit during training because they get other job offers. They will hire pretty much anyone who applies. Good gig for maybe a college student  or someone just relocating to the area. But they do offer good pay so thats a plus.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Convergys is a difficult place to work. There is mandatory overtime most days and depending on your schedule outside of work it can be very difficult to manage. The pay is very good compared to the rest of the salary's in town and there are a lot of bonus' that you can get.
good,"Good for freshers, but not for career making. shift timings are very to adjust as it keeps on rotating now and then. but i used to learn about how to make customers feel relax while giving solutions and details. my co workers are good. My hardest part of job here is bad cordination of team leaders, partiality."
good,"They need to work on their management team.  It appears to be more of a power play than having managers that truly want their projects to succeed.  They are used to high turnover and it doesn't seem to bother them.  They talk to people as if you were their 5 year old child and no matter how high you go to express your feelings, no one really cares.  The best part of the job is when it is time to go home."
good,TL does the best she can with the constraints of the job. Every day learning new things. Hardest part is the constant changes.
good,Its a nice place to work but there is no loyalty. The managenment and the way the way they treat people is horrible. All they seem to care about is numbers and not the  reps
good,"While not an ideal place to have your career, Convergys can provide you with the training necessary for entering the workforce."
good,"A typical day consist of back to back calls from customers with various issues. I learn to handle each call by interacting with the customer in a friendly manner while helping resolve issues. Management was very helpful in assisting with continuing learning process. The hardest part of the job was making sure you were in goal which could be affected by customers, computer freezing up, and system inaccuracy. The most enjoyable part of the job is engaging with the customer incurring sales while making the customer happy."
good,handlinh 100+ calls per day ok job to work high turn over rate
good,This was a seaonal job very high pressure to sale.  Once you make quota they depend on you to make more a lot of pressure for Uverse Third party vendor.
good,the people I worked with were amazing and extremely friendly
good,"You had to be on the phones at your scheduled time. You have to take every call that comes into your phone, solve the problem, and offer customer company products.  For every 10 products you offered and sold you got a bonus. Management was always pushing you to offer and sell more every day.  The hardest part of the job was not being able to solve every customers issue."
good,Not enough consistency. Poor leadership and lack of communication.
good,The management needs to be completely done over... the employees are over worked with mandatory extra hours but the pay/ compensation keeps everyone coming back. The hardest part of the job is the management not being properly trained and lack interpersonal skills in dealing with their colleagues and sometimes the customer's as well. Being great at the job is not rewarded only the ability to show up on time
good,"Not a great place to work, no room for advancement, poorly ran!"
good,"Basically, the job is okay. The training isn't very long, they don't really work with schedules either, unless you're in college."
good,Concentrix is a great place to work to if ever you need a temporary job . However they are not Flexible with home life.
good,It was a pretty easy job once you got the hang of it. sales goals changed every month. biggest problem is with the scheduling. I lost my job due to my internet not working properly so that was a bummer since it was out of my hands.
good,"The training was atrocious. Everyday we had a new trainer. The trainer didn't know what the previous trainer had done. They threw us to the wolves when making live phone calls. They said they were there to support us, but when we asked for help there was no help."
good,Its not an easy place to be working with. Management doesnt have any plans for a career growth or improvement. Lack of training that will help career growth.
good,"Learnt a lot from this organization, in every aspect. This being my first job, whatever i know its all because of Convergys."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,its mostly all about sells working for this company and its very hard to move up with this project. I been there 2 years so far
good,This place of employment is ok ther hours are great 8 hrs per day 5 days a week so you get your full 40 and its not hard work just dealing with customers over the phone the only down fall would be that due to having over 300 employes you are just a number and can be replaced very easy
good,"This job requires to troubleshoot, billing, and upselling products and services under 7minutes."
good,the program I was on was very difficult but that was one of the reasons why I stayed there as long as I did.  I was really disappointed when the program ended and they did not find anything else for me to do.
good,A typical day at work would be dealing with customers who have issues that many times you cant solve with the resources provided. I learned patience because there were many dissatisfied customers who we were many times coached to lie to. Management seemed absent at all times because they really did not take time to interact with agents at all. My coworkers were stressed most of the time I worked there. The hardest part of the job was the lack of resources and permanent desk space. The most enjoyable part of the job was the training which is probably why only 1 person from my training class actually still works there.
good,I was responsible for answering calls pertaining to customers prescriptions and coverage.  Also transferring the callers to the correct department depending on their needs.The schedule for breaks and clocking in and out is very strict. The management is enjoyable and understanding.
good,"# For 1 month i worked as an HR executive, at that time I had to call up those candidates who wanted to work in call center, and my job was to line up the candidate for the interview."
good,Answer up to 350 calls daily. Its a great place to work if you have no desire to do anything else. Management is ok. I'd refer someone if they asked.
good,Great opportunity for college students and computer literate customer service representives
good,"If you work here you might as well look at yourself as a pawn in a bigger game from day one because each and everyone of us is disposable."
good,Even though it was like highschool i still liked it. The workers were friendly. Management really liked to help out.
good,A global company that provides many employees with an opportunity to earn a competitive wage in the contact center industry.  Great for those who have minimal to no contact center skills.  Limited opportunity for growth and advancement.
good,poor manegment makes it it not so great place to work. very high turn over.
good,"Convergys is a decent place to work. This is a place for people that do not require any provisions with scheduling or other life circumstances. Learning how to be patient with very frustrated and angry customers while maintaining a professional attitude is the one thing I have learned from the training. The hardest part of working here is remembering all of the information and the different avenues to ensure complete customer satisfaction. Working alone but having co-workers there to offer a helping hand is the most enjoyable part of my job here. Expectations set by recruiters were not followed during while in training. Management here is decent but they would benefit from having a more well rounded way of teaching and executing ideas and policies. Overall, Convergys is a solid place to work."
good,"I liked the team I worked and the call center environment worked well for me. However, I don't feel that employees are valued there. I now understand why the turnover rate is so high there."
good,"I didn't care much for min wage during training when they promote a higher wage in job ads for recruitment.  I was okay for a while and did appreciate the recognition that I got.  I was good at my job.  I did get a lot of ""talks"" about going above and beyond for the customer because I ""took too long"".  I'm sorry....isn't that what customer service is about.  I kept ALOT of customers from cancelling their service.  Then I had my first child.  After returning back from mat leave it was VERY difficult to juggle work schedule and daycare schedule.  I found myself having to swap shifts almost every day.  Thank God for understanding co-workers!!  However, I found that this was not very reliable.  After TRYING to talk to TL's, HR & whomever else, they could not grasp what I was telling them and would not accommodate me (nor any other parent in the same situation), and ultimately I had to quit because a JOB will NEVER come before my child.  Gained great customer service/problem solving skills and met some great people.  That's about all that came out of it.  I moved on to much better things as a result anyway."
good,While in this position I assisted customers in many aspects of cellular service.
good,"Basically, you are troubleshooting devices, assisting customers with any troubles that they may have with their cell phones and as well as any billing questions that they may have. I gained IT experience and am now more skilled with computers than I thought I was before. The hardest part of the job really is patience, honestly, some customers can get a little testy or pushy, but it is usually worth trying to help them because you can understand how important it is to have a working cell phone because demands need to be met. "
good,"I wouldnt go back to Convergys, the money was good, but it's not my thing."
good,Convergys had great benefits but there wasn't really good communication and communication is the key word too jobs
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"It was a good company to work for however, they work on a point system that is basically tit-for-tat.  Call volume wise it was always busy and consistent.  I enjoyed answering calls and making the customers day, and hearing that I helped them out.  At the end of the call I could hear they had a smile on their face. "
good,"Co-workers are mostly friendly, management is somewhat clueless. A typical day at work is really boring--not too much to do. "
good,"Convergys is not that bad but has A LOT of room for improvement. They try to make work fun by organizing spirit week in which you can dress up to a different theme everyday (like high school) or set up dress up days for holidays but instead of all of that I would rather have a holiday bonus! Everything about Convergys is very unorganized. To call in sick, you have to call a automated IVR line, sometimes it does not go through and you get counted off for a no-call-no-show."
good,"Minacs overall was just an ok company. A Typical day with the company changed just about everyday. Some were great and some were horrible. I did learn some new customer service skills and time management skills as well. Management was just that, Management. No one ever wanted to hear how we as employees felt. It was this is whats going down and this is how its going to go. The hardest part I would say is not being able to satisfy your customer 100%. The most enjoyable I would say was to come to work and enjoy the team/family."
good,"I loved this job. Technical Support agent was a fine job. I didn't like my schedule, I worked really late shifts and hours. But I enjoyed working and answering and resolving questions for customers."
good,"I believe that in the dept that I worked for, they set the expectations too high. They want you to have a 100% save radius which in my opinion is not possible."
good,Concentrix is a great place to work. Unfortunately there is not a lot of room for advancement.
good,"I was a CSR for GM I came on the training floor blowing the rest of my class away. I made the calls did the dirty work and the the customer what they needed in a very timely matter .I was always top CSR weekly and the team always asked me questions first before speaking with their TL.But there were always conflict with me and another Team Lead. He would tell me i was doing everything wrong. meanwhile the other TLs said i was doing everything right. For this TL i worked too fast and productive so he micro managed me pretty tough. until the day he finally let the truth come out. He felt like I was a threat to his job. cause my teammates listened to me.my work productivity was always maxed but my CHT was too low. so i did whatever he asked to please him and change my CHT. I noticed the days i would be the team slacker everything was balanced enough for him and no complaints would come.but the days my work was shooting numbers through the roof we had to have a talk. i explained to him from a customers point of view you want understanding, fast and accurate especially when dealing with an automobile. He Flat out told me NO your not wasting enough time.. Im sorry when I have a job task at hand I like to be accurate and fast thought that was why I was hired. instead he wanted me to slack and act as if i lacked knowledge so that he could maintane his position in the company. Needless to say my relationship with Minacs didnt last long."
good,work place was okay clean and some incentives very poor management
good,"job starts off nice, but dsat has to stay very low...even if netflix is in the wrong."
good,Responsible to keep track of company's recruitment performance.
good,A typical day at work was vey long and stressful. I learned a lot about the company and their policies. Management was ok at times. My co-workers were awesome. The hardest part of my job was sitting for a long time hearing customers gripes. The most enjoyable part of the job was it all happen in my home. It was a work at home job.
good,"does not listen to there employees, has bad pay for what you do and the pay scale is rude."
good,"Most call centers are somewhat chaotic. The schedules are crazy, the management is crazy. The best part of the job were the benefits. They were pretty good and they weren't too expensive."
good,co needs to hire more people to eliminate 20 - 30 min hold times. co needs to physically expand to provide adequate parking and work space
good,"Days are centered on keeping the energy flowing and motivating agents to reach monthly sales targets through side by sides and coaching and feedback. My co-workers were resourceful, dedicated and friendly. the hardest part of the job was balancing administrative tasks with the demand and urgency to meet client sales and service targets. The people, both management staff and agents were the absolute most enjoyable part of the day. Through the daily stresses and trials there was always someone to offer a word of encouragement. I learned that change is inevitable. I learned that no one should know your team and their numbers better than you. I learned that even the high performers that are consistent still need and desire motivation."
good,help customers that have directv products and services. Knowledge of all directv products.
good,"I took customer service calls for Bell Tv, trouble shooting systems, confirming billing totals and correcting discrepancies, adding and removing tv programing."
good,This job is ok to some point I just have to say this is not a place for growth at all there is a big might out to stay with the job. this is call center so people come in go all day. other then this company pays ok for the time that they keep you. this might it seem as if you are are comming for a place you can call home as job but nevertheless this job has a time on it so be sure that you know how how.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Management hired many young people. No advancement so people tends to quit after a while. No cross-training provided
good,"I worked for Convergys and couldnt stand it at all because its a project called comcast and i worked for them. any time a customer wanted to talk to a supervisor they either on theyre cells, dont wanna talk the call or say theyre not taking calls and walk off so i got mad and stood up and said if I get in trouble by corp. then Im go get a straight attitude and thats what it takes for them to take calls then its not worth it. Then comes the bonuses they say we'll get if we sale other items to the customer and I became top sales producer June and July so were the bonuses!!!!!!!!!!! The convergys in hazelwood, mo is worstier than the Sanford Brown on the corner and they got shut down so convergys needs to go as well"
good,"Too much going on stayed too myself, but too many changes within the company with no change in pay"
good,i disliked working at convergys. i hade many of problems with people and i feel like the hr department didnt follow up on the problems correctly.
good,"Honestly worst training every, we literally played Tetris the whole time. A lot of the team leads, not all, are not that professional, fractranizing and favoring certain individuals."
good,Its a good company to work with if you are looking to get a start at telephone sales and customer service.  Just don't expect to stay at this company longer than a year.  No work life balance.
good,"Regarding my current  job the Good its  a friendly  working  environment ."
good,As I like to do this job but I think hr have to screening people when they took.There have sone poor quality and narrow mentality people working.they might have to change them to change the work culture.
good,"I find that overall the fellow employees and fantastic, the HR department and managment leaves things to be desired, but more so on a upper level, team leads were generally fabtastic"
good,I had informed the company about my scheduling availability prior to accepting the position but it was not relayed to the manager.  I had to submit a written document but was not able to post for new scheduled and was only given a fluctuating schedule
good,love the people that i worked for got on well as a team and met deadlines enjoyed working on a daily basic and dealing with customer enquiries i have gained experience working in a sales environment
good,good for the people who actually want to make their career in customer support and are always ready to work in daily rotational shifts. very competitive
good,Good Experience in Handling Clients and Employees and the Operations innovative new reports which helps to analyse the reports more effectively. Team handling skills..etc
good,"It's a productive company to wok for however, it has it ups and downs. Working @ Concentrix, there are many challenges you will have to prepare yourself to come at any time. there are always last minutes changes and to expect accommodations  is little to none. They have very little care for their employees which make it hard to have a passion for what you do."
good,"Overall I enjoyed working with other staff members, however, I was displeased with management and the lack of opportunities for one to advance in the company."
good,They have good class room training before they move the employee to the production also the trainers are good at their job. the work culture is very good people are friendly
good,There’s just a lot of politics going on. It depends on your Tl. If you will be in Optus account for universal service better be almost perfect or else goodbye.
good,They have very low pay scales and it is not an easy job not sure the pay correlates to the work required. I never get like management was on my side. Always out for the “client”.
good,"The company needs improvement in the management roles but, the people at the company are brilliant but, the salary ain’t enough either. The distance to work is a bit of a pain as it slap bang in the middle of industrial site in Breadbury so you have to cross muddy paths to come into work every day from public transportation."
good,Its interesting especially it is a sales company. you can getban opportunity to get incentives however the environment is very stressfull.Especially some members of the management. However imbso gratefull to my team there beacuse i have a great team leader and co- workers. but the company itself and the process of work its kinda stressfull.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Stay away  unless you cannot find another job. Poor management. Don't treat employees well. Pay is just not worth it. Revoving door for employees. "
good,"Full time work reduces work life balance as the schedules are not so good until you begin to get better at the position. Company was very accommodating for part time students to allow maximum hours and working around school schedule."
good,Stressful. The Management can not speak English that well and has no knowledge of the product. They promote the lackluster ones while the performers are being glued to just being performers.
good,"Tough hours, at least in my time zone, never saw my family it felt like. Pay was lower than my home state, and they did not honor the sick leave my home state has but instead took away the ability to use our vacations spread out over time. Management (training the managers) was definitely lacking, because only 1 or 2 managers in 2 years was worth the spit to polish my shoes."
good,"Use as a song stone to something better,  it is a call center didn't see any one on the floor with more than 3 years of employment. We handled contracts for At&T, but their contracts do change."
good,"An easy enough job to get and keep, but with high turnover and multiple corporate takeovers in a short number of years there wasn't a lot of long-term job security. Advancement was much more about favoritism than ability. Quantity was always pushed over quality, and very different standards were set for US/European centers compared to those set for centers in southeast Asia."
good,"I worked here for just under a year, being hired on shortly before Concentrix bought Convergys, and it hasn't gone the best. They've removed security starting August 31st, and people have been mugged already at other sites. Chilliwack is not a safe town! Cutting costs at the cost of your employee's safety isn't impressive to me. I could go on, but the character limit prevents me."
good,"Mid-Management at Convergys was exceptional.  People oriented while still keeping the goal of the organization a focus. That is can often be a challenge.  Cross training occurred daily, while the team of Talent Acquisitionist were always available to answer questions and help you grow."
good,"Initial work experience was favorable and very enjoyable. As time passed there were few discrepancies in payroll and the workload was not equally segregated. Pressure may be intense towards the end of the month, and the compensation for it is not satisfactory in my opinion."
good,"Never worked for Concentrix, but worked for Convergys, who wasn't that great to work for. Minimal pay, minimal benefits, and unless you were top performing, no way to advance."
good,The pay needs to be higher.rhe hours change form week to week. The work environment is boring.the supervisors don't effectively communicate with the staff
good,"A typical day at work though enhancement in communication skills...."
good,"Work life was great, work at home so a big plus"
good,"Not a very good place to work, a lot of wrong management regarding bonus and motivation actions toward the workers. Otherwise people overthere are in majority very cool to work with."
good,"Empresa que pelo menos no setor que fui designado, possui uma cultura de gestão um tanto quanto ultrapassada"
good,I love working from home. Concentrix is very demanding when it comes to management/leadership. The pay some will say is okay. Keeping up with employees who all work from home can be very challenging. As a manager you are expected to go above and beyond for the company as well as the advisor's. You do get to meet great people along the way. The company has a high turnover rate. Leadership promotions are based on who you know and how friendly you are with people. The Culture of the company is great but lacks in the the recruiting process. Anyone can work there with little or absolutely no experience for such a fast paced company.
good,"It has been a nice company with a bundle of friendly people. I have not learnt much, though, as the nature of work is repetitive. There is no job description so you may be awarded some problematic issues to deal with which is not in compliance with the level of salary. The customers can be nice and understanding but they can be nasty as well."
good,"Environment is ideal for the average high schooler to become introduced to an office environment, but not for the growth of the individual into a career."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"answered all inbound calls"
good,"Initially working with OnStar account was a Job you will never trade for because of the incentives, but when transferred to another LOB all the dreams fell apart, unfortunately. No incentives and the likes.Management ideas are not that impressive at all."
good,"While the overall experience is ok, the management is non communicative, and does not let you know exactly where you stand for growth for with the company.  Sometimes, even seems like you've been set up to fail."
good,Concentrix is a unfair place to work. Employees ares let go due to unfair surveys that grade you on things most of which you have no control of Employees and customers gossip alot of the floor making environment more hostile
good,"The Executives were the best! They never failed to recognize the employees. On the other hand, one department was the complete opposite. Some people from Admin were the absolute worst. Those who bring others down and even destroy someone's reputation. They could certainly ruin the company."
good,"Not bad a bad place to work, BPO company's have high turnarounds"
good,"I worked a few roles here, and each one was more stressful or haphazardly run than the last. I'd not recommend this employer to anyone who wants a lasting and rewarding career. I would recommend it to someone who needs work to bridge a gap between finding a better career."
good,"At first, working there was great. I mert new people everyday and learned a few skills. However the management shows alot of favourtism and it is alot of drama."
good,"A typical day at work is to talk to stupid Americas. I learned how to trouvleshoot and fix  modems, routers and computers. Management sucks due to politics. Workplace culture sucks to same reason. Hardest part of the job is to deal with politics. The most enjoyable part of the job is the team working hard to hit the target through thick and thin then get the job done."
good,I enjoyed working there for the most part troubleshooting cable and of course the customers can be rough so yeah it can get tense. After training you're on your own so if you don't know the answer for a customer prepare to wing it! The only problem I had was I could not change my shift to be home with my daughter being that the ppl I lived with could not watch her or help her with homework and projects and I got off at 12 a.m. so I basically had to resign.
good,"This job seemed okay when I first started and was in training. "
good,Good company with overall benefits I like the work environment but due to family problems I left the company with notice period due to my father expired....
good,"Convergys es un callcenter destinado a dar soporte a firmas en todo el mundo en distintos idiomas. "
good,"They hire anyone who walks in, no experiences needed which means the quality of the coworkers is really low."
good,"Empresa ainda muito nova no mercado brasileiro boa para quem quer iniciar a sua vida profissional, adquirir experiência."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Typical day at work is a normal customer service routine. I didn't learn much besides the information required at training. Management was horrible, they mentioned that they are completely there for you but as soon as you try to get in contact with them or need help with software issues on their platform they completely block you out and if you need a request they'll just procrastinate until the last minute to get it taken care of if they get it taken care of at all. Workplace culture is ok because everyone tries to boost each other up, however when it came to management, there was none of it."
good,"Aetna CEO make 55 Million, Concentrix CEO makes 5.5 Million.  Can the Employees here make over $12 per Hour?  New Year's Day Holiday was cancelled.  Only other holidays are Memorial Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving & Christmas.  PTO (Paid Time Off) is low.  They want you to work Overtime, take no days off and basically live there.  There is no work/life balance, just work.  Then, they micro-manage you to the point that you are denied any raises."
good,"The company itself is very strict when it comes to policy and norms.Just a simple tips there should be a fair treatment with the employees,and maybe work on the Team Leaders that is really agent friendly and knowledgeable with the "
good,"This was a very casual workplace, in which I had to offer technical assistance to customers. I also had to manage to retain customers if they were unsatisfied with the service they were provided. However, I wasn't growing personally or professionally therefore, I chose to left this job."
good,I was a chill relaxed environment. people were somewhat helpful. pay is good. Got to dress how ever you liked. that was a good thing and a bad thing. over all 7/10
good,"The culture leaves a lot to be desired. Never worked in a place where regular workers get different allowances for lunchtime. If the boss gets an hour, everyone should get an hour. Maybe it's my military training. But there was always a separation that made the 'we' and 'team' speech disingenuous. No dress code has seemed to promote unprofessional behavior of various natures since inappropriate dress was rampant."
good,They sometimes 'forget to pay you your bonus' and you have to wait to the next salary payment to 'hopefully' get what you owed. I know people who started and didn't get paid their first salary - they were expected to wait until next salary payment. Also know off people that when shifted to new campaigns they don't receive the proper training
good,The job was good tasts are simple enough to follow and do the pay is good the only cons I would say is make sure you drive cause it can be pain to get. Management can be a pain but be honest with them and they will be honest with you. Progression is not the best the company rarely promotes staff and in my eyes doesn't not always match its company it works for well. This is very apparent with the BT campaign where the follow stats they set out which do not match BT's for staff performance expect staff to work 25% harder than BT staff to get the same wage. The main reason I left was did not agree with the way of deal with customer service and the commute was not ideal for me.
good,The main floor was incredibly loud and a lot of people on main teams slacked off. Floor support was generally unhelpful and the pay was minimum wage with set amounts of hours but variable shift times. The main draw was that large bonuses could be gained by commission but the targets were very difficult to hit and any tiny slip up would strip you of it. The training was okay in terms of basic rules but the systems aren't touched on at all meaning transitioning to be on the floor was incredibly difficult. The only benefits were that almost all the other employees were incredibly friendly people and if the commission was hit you would get quite large payouts at the end of the month.
good,Working experience is nice. Salary is not enough specially when you have a family to provide their needs. Management is a bit okey but they have to be on the side of employee not to the employer.
good,"This job is very stressful , you never know what is going to be on the other end of the phone call. The management does try to provide perks to offset the fact that it is a rough job to do. The better you are at sales the more successful you will be at this job."
good,"Concentrix is a good company, they are very good when it comes to training agents both technical skills and soft skills.  The play is warm as well, people were friendly. Managers were approachable.  What I enjoyed most in Concentrix is the part where how they value the agents psychological well being.  They always make sure they set programs to de-stress, like creating parties and fun filled activities."
good,It always started out very well but when getting to the end it was hard and sometimes conflicting with my school schedule. Some of the managers were not helpful.
good,"I actually miss working here.  All my colleagues were great, it is a fun working environment.  The low pay is the only reason why I left and went to Bank Of America."
good,"The team members (employees) of my team and my team leader were great people, easy to get along with, however, the company was not so kind to their employees, for example my husband had to have knee surgery and they would not let me take the day off to get him to the hospital for the day surgery and to bring him back home, it was extremely difficult to get time off for and type of urgent time off."
good,"For a call-center, not too bad of a place to work. You can move up quickly if you choose that route. The PTO is the best part of the job. Particularly on the Shared program for Convergys, a great job if you are a college student."
good,"Site closed with little notice, and not a whole lot of options to relocate with same to better salary options."
good,I have worked with this organisation for 2.5 year's and the environment of the organisation is so good. This was my first job where I have learned so many good things related to personal growth.
good,I believe everyone has different experiences with every job I do not wish to disclose any information about the duration of my employment at Convergys.
good,"You are only a contract employee. Most the employees will stay contract employees. However, I did gain a lot of customer service & call center experience."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,its not a good place if your looking for professionalism. the management not helpful. fellow co-workers are not useful and are very rude. there is no stability
good,"As it was going through a acquisition processes were not clearly defined which caused a lot of confusion in the system leading to extreme employee dissatisfaction, un-necessary terminations etc.,"
good,"Ok job, hours are alright if you get a fixed shift. Some team leaders take 20 extra minutes while you are on the phone with a customer to answer a question you had. Some treat you lesser if you ask a question, like you're an idiot. Some leaders are great though, just the one i had had her favorites and acted like you should know what you are doing when you haven't had much training.  They cut training classes so you don't have much training before you hit the phone full speed. Really need more than a week on the phone before you get ready to be on your own. Training is nothing like the actual floor. Training doesn't really go into depth on the systems used. My trainer was awesome! But as soon as we went to the floor it wasn't as pleasant."
good,Convergys handled many aspects of a vehicle including mapping locations to their next destination. There was even a proceedure to help with car breakdowns and lock out problems. Even emergency assistance when needed for car theft.
good,"This was my first corporate experience and many years ago. So I don't have much information or inputs about this company. As of today, this company looks to be doing very well ."
good,I love working in the area that I work for. Just don't like if there is no work they give us the opinion to leave early which hurts the pay check. Overall a nice company
good,Take up to 180 phone calls per day to give customers directions and try to up sale the customer to see if they want to buy minutes to have in the vehicle
good,"Highly competitve sales environment but not everyone plays by the rules. Upper management didn't always correct this and showed favoritism. Anyone who spoke up about this, was found to be lacking, or got fed up with the double standard and quit. I belive this was the culture at one particular location, can't speak for all locations."
good,Overall not a bad place. Team does a nice job trying to make it fun to come to work. Some of the clients can be challenging as they try and micromanage without understand their own business.
good,I have to help customer with vehicle issues that sometimes be an emergency. I have to work with supervisors to try and get the customer the assistance they need when sometimes they may not meet the requirements.
good,"Workload and salary is good, especially if you're hitting the metrics, strength in numbers is felt in this company, work culture is a bit tough since the environment CAN be fun but is certainly CHALLENGING since you meet and keep up with a lot of people."
good,You work on a project and they have several different ones. I worked on the DirecTV project. It's busy and requires a lot of patience and understanding as well as clear communication.
good,Convergys was an okay experience all things considered I gained customer service experience and my first steps into corporate America. Convergys was a how to guide and a cautionary experience all at once.
good,"They'll pay you for your work, usually on time.  Its a call centre that requires great flexibility, minimum wage pay, technically legal working conditions.  Lots of opportunities for overtime and certain areas offer truly great incentive bonuses if you're willing and able to give everything you have."
good,Convergys is a good place to work at if your looking for an in-between job. Waiting on your license to switch states? Need a little extra money for Christmas? They love to fire people for the simplest things and promote you without any extra pay. I quit because I was put in a coaching position making the exact same as the people I was coaching and the cubicle life was not for me. This is not a place you work long at but its good if you need an in-between job. Family emergency and need to leave? Could be written up. Not there that day that a fellow coach did something wrong? Well your written up anyways.
good,They expected top notch financial support for customers on financial software for barely above minimum wage. It was enough to make me stay for a while but not enough to recommend to anyone.
good,"Working at Concentrix allowed me further broaden and perfect the  quality and the effective excellence of the customer service skills that i provide to each and every customer. Concentrix has a very friendly atmosphere, each and every agent are willing to help each other reach there goal. Even though i have been there for over two years the growth potential is pretty limited."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,The training doesn't really prepare you for what you have to really do. They should add more effective training to the classes so people can really succeed.
good,"There really was not enough training for the job. I knew nothing about Apple Products but was expected to make sales and tell the costumers about the products, even if I wasn't sure."
good,"If you're desperate and need something quickly, Convergys is a great place to work. They don't really help you out if you suddenly need time off or anything. The turnover rate is high and there's plenty of reasons why."
good,its a decent company to work for for the most part but they do not care about your health or family health at all you can come in with a note from the doctors stating you can't come to work and they will still hold it against your attendance
good,it is an alright company to work for I really do not have much more that  I want to say about this company I am sorry. The teams meetings sucked and so did some of the team leaders the end.
good,"Dealing with angry customers can be hard work but over tie, as you get to know the people you work with, you feel as if they are in a way, your family. This makes the job more easy-going."
good,Is a great call type however if you are not close friends with management it is hard to get promoted. I struggled for many tears to get promoted and with help I did then we changed clients and since the person that helped me is not there anymore I cannot get promoted and am watching  others that are close friends with management with less qualifications get promoted and since I have been there for many years I watched new hires get an instant raise with the new call type and I got nothing other than the feeling of being under appreciated . The value for long time employees is not there.
good,"most enjoyable part of the day is when I interact to customer and provide assistance to them."
good,Poorly managed and no career growth opportunity. Third party client depended organization. No additional perks or benefits. Rotational shifts. Management is very weak and poor and do not encourage good people for good work to be performed.
good,Good place to work if you like call centre work. You will get support if needed but you do need to keep in with your manager as ti makes life a lot easier.
good,"working with others and also the customers was what I looked forward to every work day, I have nothing else to say as I  was not there due to the illness"
good,"Good work atmosphere."
good,I cant say much about the company since their site has closed down since I've been there but i can say that they are hiring for online positions. I don't know in specific what for but i do know that they will hire just about anyone.
good,"Sicher es wird viel verlangt und man hat einen gewissen Druck, den man aushalten muss und die Bezahlung ist auch nicht so gut. Der Lohn ist aber jeden Monat pünktlich auf dem Konto."
good,"no communication between adviors and management"
good,"Training is limited   "
good,The job was OK there's alot of drama going around but if you keep to yourself you should be fine the supervisor are nice but sometimes just a little off
good,Performance based promotions only favorites promoted over people with skills .  A good place to start a career shift work based on productivity only little concern given to needs.
good,"A typical day at work would be busy answering concerns of customers as they call in dealing with billing, technical concerns, and managing the details of their accounts with them. I learned to deal with issues in timely manner. Our management dealt with statistics as they came in, advising us of where we stood within the stats and what was expected on daily basis. I enjoyed the interaction with other employees throughout the day and learnt from interactions they had dealt with  in past week while in team meetings."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Ventas en general es dificil, tomar llamadas y oportunidades de ventas."
good,Very stressful not very much help on the floor. The calls were easy but sometimes things required a manager approval and often times they were nowhere to be found.
good,Convergys is a call center. Day can be fast paced.  It is a good starter job to get use to working but not a good place for career as pay is low and benefits are not the best.
good,My trainers were excellent and really too qualified/intelligent to be stuck in this company. Pay checks are being messed up and upper management does not want to address any issues. Super unorganized and just a mess.
good,Productive .good .and maintained culture but working hours not suttible and according to that no salary.salary package is not so sufficient for surrvival.
good,The hours and pay and benefits were great and the job was easy just reading a script most sups were great not so much for coworkers overall not a bad place just no longer open
good,Convergys did good by the employees sometimes you do have the great benefit of getting dtv services for free so that was really a plus just not enough pay a lot of favoritism
good,"Convergys is the typical call center job that holds no illusion that your day will include very irate customer, strict adherence to schedules, and little advancement opportunities."
good,Call center job.  Very busy and regimented.   Demanding.  They keep lots of metrics on your performance and phone call performance.  Attendance is very important.
good,Same managers are strict and others are real relaxed. The higher up management are cut throat. Once you learn everything apple apple products the job is easy as cake.
good,"Low salary, poor HMO benefits. But we enjoyed their RandR Rewards and Recognition also they always have this fun engagement to make sure employees enjoy while they work"
good,"I absolutely loved the account I was on. As far as actual convergys goes, the company is all over the place. The turn over rate is extremely high. The best part of the job was my coworkers."
good,i just gave the review for this company. i wish i could move past this review but it is required. i didnt like the clarksville location and i would not recommend it
good,"The work environment was great at first. The job was easy enough and had good flow. However, the job can become very dreary after a few months. Working inside an office building with limitations to one area was very taxing on the mind. The workplace culture was not violent or abusive but it started to feel like a weight on my shoulders. The company changed drastically as I continued to work there and that is why I decided to look elsewhere. The most enjoyable part was the Paid time off. I never had that at a job before this company and enjoyed it. I also used it when I was sick and it helped. The hardest thing with working for them was the change the company took. Privileges were abused and taken away, making the company hard to stay."
good,Its good for freshers who can't continue their studies or want to work after completing their school. Managers are cooperative. Overall 2.5 stars to the company.
good,"Convergys is where you you go if you have to have a job or are not able to get any other job.  If you have a pulse, they have a headset for you.  Tons of wasted potential and no motivation to develop it."
good,Management difficult to deal with. Disrespect of employees and do not seem to care if employees come or go. Strict on time management and keeping with schedule.
good,The room for growth here is completely political. You are not compensated for the stress and lack of work/life balance. Do not work here over 2 years.
good,"Clean environment. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Company's management is cooperative."
good,"This company does not have a good pay structure, it is overly managed, very little flexibility with your work schedule.  I worked on the Directv contract and we lost our jobs when AT&T bought them out."
good,"It was okay working there could have be better. Manger isn't so great, no one knows who doing what at what time, I did appreciate all the hours tho. Thanks."
good,Company experience depends on the team you are and the process you work for.I was into a really demotivating team but a good process. other then cafeteria other facilities are good. And really appriciatable CAB facility.
good,"Dynamic and fast-paced work environment, which is expected of a BPO industry. There is constant ramping which is the primarily goal and this results in long hours."
good,"Loved the management and all of my team leads. However, I worked very hard and helped to perfect processes for the department I worked in, and also helped train some of the Training Staff at convergys and still never received sufficient compensation."
good,Very demanding job and yet rewarding. Many departments to work in. Very large call centre. Provide adequate training and break schedule. Can be a hard schedule at times
good,"no job security, unaprochable management, HR is good. not enough money for the things you have to put up with, decent benefits. on a point system so if you do get sick you can loose your job due to absence.."
good,"Well force you to do overtime if they see fit. Depending on the person, it could either be a a blessing or a disguise. If you got the bad end of a shift bid, you would kiss your free time good bye"
good,Job security is a huge problem in this company. Lack of benefits and incentives. Better if HMO will be provided equally in all employees. Sleeping quarters and other facilities for employees are not.properly maintained.
good,"Current department dissolved without giving another position with thee same compensation. There is limited advancement and training to become more successful in your career,"
good,"facility for the lunch is good,but only cab facility they have to provide cab on both sides,As the distance is very  very far."
good,It was quite a rough experience while working here. I learnt a lot but no job satisfaction and no work-life balance here. Good for beginners like me for a while but can't have a future here.
good,Great people to work with hard management to deal with.You have back to back calls that you have to answer. you get two fifteen min breaks and a thirty min lunch. You learn good customer service.
good,The work is not hard but there is often no assistance available for conflicting calls. I don't like the fact that my schedule changes throughout the day. Most of the work is supposed to be done offline and there is not as much offline time available as explained before taking on the job.
good,"Its a good job but you are always on the phone taking call about people needing their phone replaced, also hearing certain customers getting mad cause they are finding out how much the phone is going to cost to get replaced"
good,"Training was informative but as oon as you got on the floor, you were left to sort it out on your own. Team leads were rarely able to assist you if you had an issue."
good,"this company gives good compensation benefits when you have at least one year call center experience;"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Väldigt dåliga arbetsförhållande samt avtal gällande lön, raster, förmåner osv."
good,This is a great starter job but overall this place can become draining due to micro managing. Raises based off attendance rather than performance. Paid time off is minimum approx 4 hrs given every 2 weeks. The longer you work there the shorter the end of the stick you get. For an example someone new comes in and starts off with a better schedule than someone that has been there longer. UTO only given in 2 hr segments regardless if you only use small portion the whole 2 hours will be swiped away. meeting goals only result in a payout of about 100$
good,"I would have rated 4 or 5 stars for Convergys if their Management and Salary / Benefits are okay. "
good,The training provided by the trainer is not up to the mark. The work culture is so ugly that good people can't survive their. The management is extremely worst they are like bunch of fools.dont waste ur time in concentric.
good,Was not willing to help transfer when i moved to toronto. I will not be recommending this to anyone. The pay was not enough for the work that we performed. escalation supervisors were expected to do more work for free.
good,"I liked my job but management became to source of my exiting job. I have always thought about the Idea of sitting behind a desk and being of assistance to the public so, National Cash Advance was that opportunity until management had such of a drive to keep and put customers into these high rank loans, I began to not like my job anymore."
good,"I Joined as Sr Customer Care Officer,Attending to dealer calls pertaining to upgrades, multi-service, new activation's, etc."
good,Overall it was a nice experience to work with concentrix. But salary is less & the canteen is the worst. Rotational shifts are very annoying. Night shift is the best
good,Easy job and good for building for experience. The job can be very repetitive though and fast paced with back to back calls but still simple. Also they provide decent benefits.
good,"staff supporting but not management work pressure and also do not pay as pr work and pressure, they stretch shift in customer service they ask for sales, bad management in well organised"
good,"Call center environments are always tough to work in.  This location is no different.  Toughest part about this company is the hiring cycles, over-hire and then the volume subsides and they start laying everyone off."
good,"The job itself is quite easy. You help customers' with their deposits and locate where their deposit may possibly be if they have yet to receive it a time they were specified to have it available of days. I transfer the calls if it is not related to my department to further assist the customer. The only reason I was unable to work their is because I had to 10 hour shifts at a time and there was no way for me to switch my schedule and have them work with me to balance school and work full time. The most enjoyable part was speaking to the amazing customers and listening to their back stories and have the personal satisfaction that I was able to help them. What I did particularly like about the job is that the coworkers around me were a little unprofessional and did not remain quiet while I was on the phone so it made my customers upset. All in all, the manager are amazing people and very knowledge in their job and they taught me it was okay to ask when I need help. I love them!"
good,"It is a really intense job, constantly under pressure for the huge workflow and the emergency situations, i've learned how to deal under stressing emergency moments reassuring customers and dealing with law enforcement"
good,The environment is nice. Its just that they were not able to give us another account. They have a good training experience and the facilities are clean as well.
good,The managers could use a little more work on going to the associates desk instead of yelling across work station and interrupting customer service while on the phone. Seating could be also better and assigned seats would be preferable. More seating could suffice.
good,"Concentrix handled support for Cisco Small businesses, the location in the U.S. has since been moved overseas. This was a really good place to work to get familiar with wireless devices, switches, cameras, and routers."
good,This job wasn't my favorite very organized. Never knew were or what we were doing. The management had lots of meeting and was never around.
good,"this job is good for you if you dont have children or a social life "
good,"Typical day at work can be challenging at times but always pull threw as there are a lot of support to help you threw the day with your manager, floor walkers or your advisers. "
good,"Very stressful place to work; however, even when the wages are not that high you can make up a good wages due to  high commissions and bonuses."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"The advisors are well paid, and the whole company is real nice, but the IT department is always overloaded with work and with less people that is needed to keep things running."
good,It was a good company to work for I worked form 3 pm -12 am M-F I worked on the contract for cable TV until they lost the contract . the company always held training classes. and that was good.
good,This job has horrible management! The employers don't care about you. The pay is okay. The hours were pretty consistent so that's basically the only thing that was keeping this company running.
good,"answered inbound phone calls, troubleshooted customers troubles. loved working with my co-workers. hardest part was selling to people that already had a problem."
good,the money is quick to get and seems to be easy at first. but the work environment is not to pleasant the systems are EXTREMELY flawed. systems constantly go down making it almost impossible to make calls and the building is always cold in the winter. atleast you get to sit on the job! the management is disorganized too. its to much disorder on the management end of things people will often say things to saying they can/will help you without little to no action taken. or just flat out lie to you about rule/systems etc. that can really make things discouraging. ex. i had to go and tell them about my school schedule 3 times during the scheduled constantly having scheduling issues through the time.
good,I really enjoyed my employment there. The only down fall is that your schedule was based on your performance. The job was very enjoyable and your time there went by fast.
good,"the company itself is usually physical call centers, but the past couple years are moving into the work from home section. The trainers weren't bad, they were not afraid to admit when they didnt know something, i liked the realness of that. The team leads were awesome, you felt like you mattered instead of just another person working for the company. loved it"
good,"I learned that Canada Post customers are rude, nasty and swear and take out their frustrations on the CS person. Not a good time. It wasn't all bad. Good people working and became friends. We truly tried to help customers but were limited in what we could do. People are so mean over the phone.They would not treat you the same if you were there in person. This was the hard part of the job. The good part was a supervisor who sympathised and understood and co workers that also understood. We did have pizza days and our team lead was great.The pay was terrible, for the verbal abuse that we had to take, higher pay would be a nice compensation."
good,"Place closed some years ago. Management was not helpful at all, lack of training and support. You could not even find a seat when you would start your shift."
good,"Sit at a computer, answer incoming calls and helping customers with their problems with television, internet, phones and billing questions. If questions are needed i would chat with my supervisor or a team member to get the customers issues resolved."
good,Very hard to get everyone on the same boat one supervisor ill tell you something is ok then the next will say you cant. Very Hard to balance work and home life. Managment typically does not work with employee if something comes up.
good,"Got knowledge about banking, credit card and sales management.Learnt about USA credit card distribution and management system."
good,The work was good but in this firm you have to work and work there is not a single option for extra activity and for any physical activity. I hope they will do something and work on it..
good,"When you go to the interview process the reruiter is very nice,.professional . You will really think that this place is going to be a great place to work.Then you go to training,they are young and some are unprofessional. When you get to the floor it's a whole other world out there with the team managers and team leaders. They are so unprofessional. Management sucks. If they get rid of the TM and TL the place will be worth working for."
good,A great place for someone to work who is wanting to gain experience and confidence in customer service and interpersonal relationships with colleagues and superiors. It serves as a wonderful stepping stone to other opportunities for furthering one's career goals.
good,Career path is clear with attainable requirement within a given time frame. Healthy working environment and people are professional. The hiring process is easy and fast
good,"Ambiente giovanile ma con alcun prospetto di carriera."
good,"A typical day for me at Concentrix starts at 2:30pm. I work with consumers taking chats, helping them find a product on Nike.com and or making a purchase for a Nike.com product if needed. I Also take my regular breaks and lunch. Once a week I am suppose to get a coaching on the chats that I take and the surveys that I have gotten for them. That does not always happen and when it does I learn but I feel I am not good enough for my job and I am walking on eggshells to keep it. Then management team is silent but deadly and you never know when it your time to go. My coworkers are nice and friendly and we all try to work together to get the job done and making sure we have a good day. The hardest part of my job is trying to communicate with someone that is higher then you on things and what is needed of you and what you have to do to get a higher passion. What's enjoyable about my job is my coworkers and the consumers that we help and feeling there happiness knowing I helped them get that limited shoe or set up a return, exchange for them."
good,this was a great place to start my life in the call center workforce. they taught me a lot about customer service and what I needed to progress in my next call center adventures
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"It was a cool place to work if you like being on the phones all day. This isn't the job for you if you have toddlers at home because HR doesn't care about you or your family. They don't care if you're sick or if it's a family emergency they'll still ask you to come in. The team leaders are so messy, they pick & choose who they show favoritism to. It was always drama on top of drama in that place. You do have people that genuinely care, and wants to see you move around tho."
good,"Concentrix, like many other companies, has its pros and cons.  Overall, it is a nice place to get some solid customer service skills developed and/or improved upon."
good,I was pregnant when I was working fro them and at first they were accommodating but I quit because they were giving me a hard time in the end of my pregnancy. They started saying my doctors appointments were unexcused absences. The pay is good but the stress they put on you isn't worth it.
good,I work for the AT&T part of this company and after training they told us that we were going to be a certain schedule after training was over they gave us a completely different schedule. A couple weeks after hat they said the at&tvpart kf the company was closing and a lot of people were losing their jobs. I locked my self out my computer and asked for help from the manger a lot of times and no one could help me. They only care about themselves and sales. And even if you make sales of your scores are low you don't get that money at all.
good,I worked at convergys for approx 3 years. In that time I worked in two different departments. I found the job to be very mentally draining and frustrating as management demands and customer demands often conflict. Would not work with again.
good,"-Dealing with customers issues, to fix and solve their issues that they"
good,"learned rio system, generic, incentives are good but to select people, its a typical job, cubicles are spacey, often play music on floor, 3 weeks classroom training, 2 weeks OJT."
good,"The company has a great working environment and the methods they use are reliable in terms of productivity. However, they have very poor leadership which generates conflicts and does not help in countless situations."
good,"I loved working for OnStar through Convergys. It was Convergys that gave me issues, wish OnStar had their own call center.  Overall just needs to be managed right and have more care for their employees such as Benefits and schedules!!"
good,"Job is stressful "
good,"This company, at the time of my employment could have used a little more structure.  Sometimes it was hard to differentiate between employees and management. The training was not long enough to learn the job properly. The coworkers were very friendly and supportive.  Management was 50/50.  Some reliable some not."
good,"A typical day is taking 100+ calls well having 2-3 minutes in between calls in order to document customer’s concerns. "
good,I rated this company so low due to the fact that all they really seem to care about is money. They don't seem to care about their employees and the conditions they have to work in and how we are doing with it. They just want to make as much money as possible at what ever expense that may entail.
good,When it was for att it was a great place. When i switched to anthem it was no longer fun. I attempted several times to go back to att and was told i could but never allowed to.
good,Answer phone calls...scored based on calls and if scores dont meet numbers then possible termination. Points in place but they harm more than help you. High turn over. would not recommend.
good,My typical day at work would start by reminding invites for their interview after that would be leads generation for applicant and employee referral programs. It is then followed by encoding of the leads garnered and call outs or phone screening for the rest of the shift.
good,Very good place to start career. Tight relationships with co-workers.  Extremely structured work conditions. great willingness to work with personal issues and available to assist with health and school issues
good,"Trainers, agents, and TL's are good people Managers are incompetent being an agent was fun able to help customers management isn't on the same page"
good,"you dread work right as you park your car. you dont  have assigned seats but theres barely anywhere to sit as is. You dont learn anything in training, its all learned on the floor."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Working 7 hours taking calls from customers solving problems on there printers or network. Learned a lot about xerography and networking. Management is trying hard to solve the issues of being understaffed, Working with great people in the team,but unfortunately not enough people to provide the service they ask for. Therefore the pressure is growing on both ends. Hardest part is at the moment to try to provide the customer the service they want and still target the goals the management put up. SLA ,RCA, etc. Most enjoyable is the ""thank you for your help"" from the customer"
good,There were many ways to make ok money with Onstar but career wise this is not the type place to work for. There is no room for advancement and it is extremely unprofessional.
good,A typical work experience with pleasing environment and work stations. I have learned a lot from training and in Op's and I also meet a lot of people in the office and on the floor.
good,"The Children's Place, is an ok place to work. The co-workers were pleasant and the hours were good. Work is hectic but great around the holidays."
good,"typical day with this job was receiving calls from customers who either didn't like their phones, their bills or plans"
good,"In some areas the company was great, in others is lacked a lot. One main thing is Communication, Compassion and Favoritism is used at an access of so much that it does not matter how well one employee does at their job. If the management has a favorite they will chose their favorite. Sleeping or otherwise job avoidance is being done. This  company does not have good management skills nor people in their management. "
good,Everything was good until they implemented the Every Other Friday Pay which deducted almost Php2000 for my every cut off. Management sucks especially the HR. You don't know what to expect every cut off because of the possibility of inaccuracy.
good,"Provided highest level of customer service over the phone. Educated customers about their bill. Generated sales from customer enquiries.The hardest is to work during the night and the holidays. the best part is, you get to sit on a job and meet various type people."
good,"good pay, I wou.d assist customers over the phone with their att cellphone service. I really enjoyed helping the customers however when it came to anything besides minor issues management would not support the agents or give them whatever answer they think will work to get off the issue, Many time other issues brought to  managements attention, were left unaddressed then and later. Several times i was given incorrect information on how to handle issues yet . It seems like ATT is no longer about the customer or employees yet about the numbers on their paycheck."
good,"a typical day at work for me are assisting clients regarding their account,s info, such as balance inquiry, credit cards info & loan & lines of credits. i learned a lot of things w/the company because this is my first bpo working experienced, i learned how to handle costumer,s concern, how to deal w/them, how to empathized & address their concerns. i'am not satisfied w/the management from the beginning up to the end, because for they were not being fair w/their employee."
good,"same of the management team were really nice and fun to work for, they do drive you to make targets and I did hit all of my targets. a typical day at work was to make sales and hit above a 50% conversion."
good,Great entry level company to enhance customer service skills.  On the phones 8.5 hours a day.  Taught me how to handle and extinguish all types of customer service situations.
good,Convergys is a decent place to work at. Been there for a year now. Coworkers are great. Management tend to care less about you.
good,"About 35 - 40 calls a day"
good,Good place to get foot in the door has time for advanced meant in a fast pace works. differ job skills need for the projects they support
good,"The job pays well, assuming you work in the Blue Button Welcome Call department and the management is very relaxed yet take their jobs seriously so they're easy to get along with but the job itself is time consuming. Like with any call center job, they don't have set schedules, which makes it really hard to have a life outside of work and to schedule anything. Great job if you have no kids, friends, or a social life whatsoever. Horrible job if you have even a single responsibility other than the job itself. They also have a habit of cutting your lunch in half and using the other half for work time and scheduling for extra hours. These extra hours are mandatory. You may end up working an 11 to 12 hour shift with only a 30 minute lunch without even so much as a 24 hour warning."
good,"Minacs is a good company, but workplace quality isnt very high"
good,"The pay is just not enough, its a very unprofessional environment but the work is easy. The point system is awesome and the PTO is okay as well."
good,Good place to work at times. Management enforces rules when they want. The pay isn't that great and the scheduling is based off of performance
good,My time at Convergys has been a good experience. Overall not a company to work for. I now feel that I need a change. Very little in place to motivate workers which is why I feel that it is time to move onto a new challenge.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I left by my job was repetitive and it was hard to get time off if needed for family emergencies. And the opportunity to advance was offered as I was getting to the point of putting in my two weeks notice.Other than that it was a pretty ok place to work.
good,"When I started at Convergys everything was exciting, full of promise, and I felt like I would make a career there. I found out in November 2014 that I had cancer, and would have to go through 12 rounds of chemothearapy, once a week on Monday's. Since Convergys works off of the point system I went to my OM, to ask what would be the best option. She offered me a medical accomidation for the Monday treatments. Everything was awesome. Then my OM (OPERATIONS MANAGER) got moved to the new at&t project, before she moved she did not finish my paperwork so that my points for treatments could be excused. I got a new OM. She didn't know anything about me or a medical accomidation."
good,It wasn't a pleasurable experience for me because I was mislead about the sales aspect of the job when I was hired. I was told it was more customer service and sales wasn't a requirement however sales is more important than customer service at Convergys
good,"As much as it was an interesting job, I learned that I didn't like working from home as much as I thought I would. the work became too technical at times."
good,You are not taught anything.  The reason we did so well with sales is because we worked hard to make our commission monthly.  There is no flexibility on the weekends whether you have an emergency or not.  Not a good place to work.  Especially if you have a family at home.
good,"Being a Technical Support Representative, you get calls 8-hours a day. And most calls are repeat calls, meaning someone has already handled the customer. "
good,"La presión en el área de ventas es algo común pues las ventas se califican por logros, pero llegar al colmo de estresar al empleado o acosarlo laboralmente es una infamia y esto es lo que sucede en Convergys."
good,"Scope  of   learning is and introduction to enterprise support is  PLUS."
good,I worked with concentrix india pvt ltd around 4 years. My experience with company was good. My team was good. Employee satisfaction was not good.
good,"Trained on numerous projects, (2) 15 minute breaks (1) 30 minute lunch , points system"
good,"I was in training the entire time was with the company. I would go in sit at a computer while the instructor gave us loads of information. I learned quite a lot about all  the company's departments as I was training to be a part of the ""CARE"" department. The manager of the training department was not as thorough as she could have been as there were people removed from the training before they had any real chance to apply the information that given to us. The hardest part of the job was trying to learn the massive amounts of information given in such a small amount of time (2 weeks) and applying it to the job immediately. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to talk to and resolve problems with the clients. I was happy to have a happy, satisfied customer on the line after I ended my calls."
good,"My job consists of answering phone calls from American Group Health Care customers, answering questions about benefits and how their claims are processed, I also take calls from Health Care Professionals."
good,Convergy's employees were a pleasure to work with including my fellow supervisors. Upper management seemed to be a problem.
good,"I liked working at Convergys, I felt like I interacted with a lot of people all over the world and it was good to meet new personalities on a daily basis."
good,"if there's a lot of applicant we're to busy to entertain others, But we still to manage to do our assigned work for better reflection to ourselves."
good,answering phone calls for drectv customers wanting to cancel their  prem.ch's explained the benefits of those channels offered discounts to help off set cost
good,very friendly work environment but not very professional....Would not likely tell people to work there... very high turn over rate
good,"Se llegaba al piso donde eras asignado, una vez en el piso, tenias acceso a un computador donde entrabas usando un codigo unico de empleado. Una vez en el sistema, podias activar el telefono para empezar a contestar llamadas de clientes. Como trabajaba para una empresa de telecomunicaciones, solo nos enfocabamos en la parte inhalambrica. Solo ayudaba a clientes que tenian problemas con telefonos celulares. Ofrecia soporte tecnico y asistencia con las cuentas de celulares."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Concentrix is in the process of evolving from 4000 employees to 40,000 with their purchase of the IBM CRM division.  They have a long way to go to develop the tools, teams and corporate structure to be successful."
good,Learned many aspects of a call center and processes that go on in a call center.  Am glad for the opportunity obtained in the call center environment.
good,"Convergys is a place where the training was limited and didnt give you real experience of what the job would really be like, the managers were all great people but to distracted and never really helpful when needed. The coworkers were great friendly and supportive that is the only way you learn anything in that place."
good,"Face-paced environment, lots of available skill sets & training to acquire once you're in the door...only thing that could better the time spent here is to make the job stability more longterm."
good,"overall a decent employer, training managers and some of the production managers great people. from my experience only about half of the management staff is competent enough to perform their job and most of them dont care about the customer, just about making money."
good,"You get a lot of training within the first 90 days but half of what "
good,"I would like to rate Concentrix as good place to work..The Enviornment is enriching in Concentrix, Each day you learn something new in this place, The Environment is healthy and Competitive. The moment you enter your workplace you feel that you are back home..Puntuality was a basic necessity in work..I have learnt many things like Discipline,Stacks Oriented,Flexibility in workplace.Talking about Management..It was typical,Partial,Non-Responsive,Inconsistent,Stereotype.I had Great fun to work with my Co-workers..I have learnt many god thing from them and made some good friends., The difficult part of this job was to attain stacks and the Good thing about this company was they always prefer to give second chance to their Employee."
good,Business as Usual even on Holidays.Worplace is fun. Have established good relationship with my colleagues.Hardest part of the job is doing extra work load but not well compensated
good,"With all the potential clients its great company to work.The company has expanded leaps and bounds in a short span of time."
good,It's nice to working with company. Basically the people are so nice as well the company culture is good. I learned  to meet  all  the   company metric  and  even  exceed to  goal. Which I can do so much more if they would give me a chance to  work with  the   depart I choose.
good,"They changed work shifts at least 4 times a year which made it difficult to develop a lasting home life routine."
good,"A typical day at Convergy's starts with trying to find a parking spot. There are 15+ sectors and over 3,000 agents, new hires, clients, staff etc. that work here and drive to work. Once you finally find a parking spot you have to make sure you find a computer and phone that works, clock into it and hope the headset doesn't go out on you during your call. Agents are allowed a 30 minute lunch in which you must get to where you are going and back, consume your lunch, and be back on the phones within that thirty minutes, or bring your food, or shop at the expensive convenient stores in the building. When you are not on lunch you are spending 8 hours in front of a computer screen in an uncomfortable chair. Agents are allotted two 15- minute breaks two hours before lunch and an hour and a half after lunch, which by the time a person is able to walk outside the break is half gone. I have learned the essence of being the barror of bad news and how to deliver it in a more acceptable way than most. My co-workers are amazing. They are always willing to help. The higher ups are rarely ever available and when they are they only have about two minutes to spare with you. The hardest part of the job is being expected to know what you have not been taught. The most enjoyable part of the job I would have to say is the customers. They make my day 10 times better."
good,"like most jobs, managers and supervisors had favorites, but It didn't stop me from getting a 10 cent raise and completing my job with my best performance, which later earned me plenty of recognition over the 2014 year."
good,This company was okay to work for. I wouldn't work here again though. I previously did a more extensive review of this company explaining the inconsistencies with training.. it's a little tiresome when someone tells you to do things one way and it turns out that you're supposed to do them another way.
good,The job as a TL is very demanding.  A lot is expected for very little pay.  The job is less than enjoyable it is very much day in and day out type work.  You deal with idiots every day.  You are expected to perform miracles to get people to do what you tell them to do..Guess what.....they don't.  It's stressful and is no way near financially rewarding.  You have to work holidays too.  so you only get vacation days off and then comp days for the holiday
good,"Answered incoming Internet service calls"
good,"I worked here when I was in college for 3 months. The pay for my position of houseman was minimum wage. I didn't mind because the work wasn't that hard and I would be unsupervised most of the time. The bad thing about working here was that the coworkers were a bit rude and it was gossip central. Alright for my first job, but not a good place to stay at forever."
good,"resolving customer's cable issues over the phone and explaining how to operate their equipment without visually seeing it. My co-workers are great to work wit because if you can't figure out something, someone is always willing to help. the most enjoyable part of my job is assisting people who thing they can't fix it themselves and after giving them proper instructions realize they didn't even need a technician to come out."
good,"Great employees, friendly environment, great flexibility, the only bad thing is the pay rate."
good,"Everyday after training is usually standard, I learned some great people skills and also some great computer skills. There is a lot going on so it's usually up to you to find a solution for a problem even when a customer asks for a manager. Everyone has their own little desk but everyone is friendly for the most part, The hardest part of the job is that it has a ""its all up to you"" attitude but it was nice pay and a great learning experience"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,If you are looking to gain experience in the customer service this would be a great place to start.
good,Uma otima empresa para se adquirir habilidades de atendimento ao cliente.
good,I enjoyed the aspect of working with the elderly and learning their life history.
good,"A call center so basically you as the customer service rep will get the wrath of the customers since we are the first to answer for the company. Especially when customers are angry at the company for the charges or dont understand how billing works. You do have to have lots of patience for the many complaints that come in back to back. Management are not really there to assist and I can say that as a former employee, they rely on their chat system and even so to get an answer for a customer takes a long time. Thats why customers say they are on the phone for hours since we as the customer service rep are trying to figure out the answer with Management or fellow staff they are always busy on the chat system, ie...asking who wants to work my shift? where they find housing? whats for lunch? anything but answering a new staff that is not familiar with the company. I hated it every single day I was there. And as far as $500 bonus for part time, Naw that is only for full time employees and you do have to wait 130 days before you get that bonus, if you can last that long with meeting your Metrics, Stats on a daily basis or if not you get a coaching. This job is not for everyone but when there are no other options then you have to take the job, especially when its hard to get a job in the first place."
good,"I work as a CSR at the same time I trained and assist newly hired employees that will be part of our team. I am once a versatile person and I love that. But then time came with the management seems too personal to me when all I wanted to do is just to work. "
good,The worst part of this corporate take over was that the current employees were kicked out to make room for IBM employees regardless of the quality of their work.
good,"Place is okay to work, however it has it perks.  Taking calls (325 calls daily) no real appreciation for what is done.  Stalemate. Happiness is coworkers and Team leaders satisfaction of proper encouragement.  Makes a laggy dry day bearable."
good,"Loved the product, hated the company. Convergys' Like some other call centers had very shady tactics and management"
good,"After taking over the business, Concentrix has vowed to make changes for it's employees. So far they have tried, but the upper management is not knowledgeable about the compensation or benefits. We often times have to complain before corporate is aware of the basics like: how to apply for FMLA, if we are able to get raises, and what discounts we could get. A typical workday is busy, stressful and constant angry customers. Management is not consistent and only a few follow policies."
good,"Took calls for AT&T regarding questions, concerns, and payments for AT&T services. What I learned from this experience was how to better handle my work task under pressure. Management was rarely around but, there was a chat service open for employee to ask other employee questions when we needed help with something. Co-workers were very nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job for me was making notes in the customer account about what the call was about before the customer got off the phone. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work alone and not depending on others to help you get tasks done because I feel I work better alone."
good,"The pay is alright considering you just talk on the phone. Unset schedules is not good considering it is hard to make plans in the near future.  Sometimes it is hard to get time off including vacation time. They do make promises to employees but sometimes do not deliver.  Even after I left, they still continue to call me to come back, but the pay for the drive and the unset schedule keep me from going back."
good,Great place to work until the Teamster came knocking. Convergys packed up and left town because of them. Thank you Teamsters!!!
good,"Job is very good and would recommend people to work here, learned to be patience and meeting new people all the time"
good,"Monotone, one phone off the phone, 2 breaks and one hour lunch if in production. I've learned that all customers can be calmed if you can get a word in and to not take calls personal. My co-workers are chatty among themselves, many are unprofessional and don't take the workplace serious which makes it hard for the ones that do. The hardest part of the job is the limited flexibility. The most enjoyable part of the job is VGH."
good,"Hardworking environment but fun! High volume call center, with advancement opportunities"
good,"low pay, inefficient computer software to help customer, no support from mother company to WOW customers. lack of structure and high demands on call takers."
good,"The company was from out of the country, do their work effort was a little different than what was accustomed to normally. The training aspect didn't run parallel to the regular schematics, meaning being taught and promoted from within."
good,A typical day at Convergys is pretty productive. The calls are easy going.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,ok job especially if your just graduating from high school because experiences isn't 100% necessary
good,Learned time management & deal with different ethnicity in Canada...
good,Scheduling is hectic and you must plan very far in advance to time off work.
good,Convergys provides outsourced staffing. I enjoy helping people and I enjoy the cable technology I was working with. I did not enjoy being micromanaged.
good,"Average place to work"
good,"Not a good place to work. Would not recommend job to anyone. Took years to get a raise, Obtaining bonus is unrealistic. High turnover rate."
good,"Convergys offered a very good training with an excellent instructor. But beyond that, the job was demanding and unrewarding."
good,"answer up to 200 calls a day gave look up destinations and gave driving directions"
good,"Great place to work as a supliment income, or a for now type of employment."
good,"It was a nice place to work, plenty of support from management and training staff."
good,Great environment for gaining experience. Flexible work hours.
good,"professional environment at work place , corparative management"
good,the enviornment was very relaxed.Some of the managers took their job seriously while others did not. my typical day started at 9:30 pm i helped customers with technical issues with their comcast services including handling bill payment.
good,"Overall the company isn't a terrible place to work. I really enjoyed the fact that we could come to work in comfortable attire and the mildly relaxed environment. What I dislike about the particular location I worked was how terrible the management team was. The people who are now managers are either all close friends outside of work or are related. Therefore causing favoritism and unfair judgement in disciplinary actions. I personally have never gotten in any trouble or had disciplinary actions taken, but I've witnessed how things were handled first hand. I also don't agree with how they treat their customers and expect us to present ourselves to the customers. I feel there are alot of hidden charges and fees the customers were left in the dark about. Which is how we were trained to conduct business. I feel this job would be a great fit for some, but as for myself I feel I would enjoy working either outside or doing something requiring a variety challenges aside from sitting behind a desk all day. The hardest part of my day was sitting still, I have far too much energy to just sit there. The most enjoyable part of my day was talking to a variety of people from all over the country. Some of their stores were quite interesting."
good,Typical call center environment. It is a good student job with education assistance.
good,Benefits are not good and their schedules are always changing.
good,"Inbound Customer Service Reps need to have the ability to handle stress and anxiety on a regular basis. You never know when you take that next call what type of person you are getting on the other end. If the person is irate, you are responsible for calming that person down and resolving there irritation (even if you can not solve the actual problem)."
good,Taking inbound calls from customers all day. I learned how to multitask a lot better and how to deal with irate customers. My manager was good with answering every question that I would have. My co-workers were also very helpful. The hardest part of the job is getting an angry customer to buy or upgrade their services. The most enjoyable part would be talking to customers from all over the United States.
good,"This company was also very dynamic in its on nature. Subsequently, there was not possible chance of advancement because of the management structure. However, this company taught me the value of oustanding customer service and how it effects the business."
good,"What can I say about Convergys"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Grave yard shifts since it was a customer service and our clients is from USA,. It was my first job after i finished my college in known university..it was a challenging one, i spoke to different kind of people. hot headed, polite and everything.. so i learned how to deal with different approaches in different people,,"
good,"My day started at 8:30 and was non stop from start to finish.  The hardest part of the job was the feeling that I was not adequately trained and therefore was sometimes unable to offer customers the help that they needed.  The most enjoyable part of my job was when my shift was over,"
good,Good job to build your resume and gain work experience. Pay is not the best neither are the beneifts but there are chnaces to progress in the company. Little job security.
good,"answering calls for direct tv customers, helping customer set up packages or tech support on directive equipment, taking payments."
good,"In my time at  Convergys I have seen employees from upper management to lower level employees come to work intoxicated and/or under the influence. Sexual harassment every time I turn around and poor work ethics all around from the top, down. I have zero tolerance for such behaviors so that is why I am seeking better employment in the Hickory area."
good,"I loved working for the Ann Taylor/LOFT project at Convergys. There were a lot of great people that I worked with, and I learned a lot about fashion I hadn't known. "
good,This job was a constant flow of inbound calls to resolve customers' issues. There are consistent hours of 40 hours/week and benefits.
good,"I was the Systems Management Expert for one project, and would have to send reports to management to report call volume for the call center we managed. Every morning I would enter a conference call and report the stats for the previous day and offer suggestions as to how to meet SLA."
good,It was always busy you would take calls back to back. The breaks were too short. people that worked part time only had two breaks and no lunch. The people that worked there were some what friendly. The management some where good in working with your schedual but others weren't.
good,"A typical day at Convergy's call center is very bizzy up-beat environment. Convergy's really helped  me with my multitasking skills, computer knowledge, and my customer service skills. Co-workers always worked as a team and always made sure everyone was on the same page as far as keeping up with there work task and helping each other correct mistakes. I would say the hardest part with working at Convergy's is dealing with customers and knowing when to draw the line between having empathy and getting off task. The most enjoyable part of working with Convergy's  was being able to help customers, especially the irate customers and actually calming them down by being super polite."
good,"In the past year, there has been a major merger with the European head office that has had a knock-on effect for the UK mainland site. There has been numerous changes, which have not been beneficial for the departments."
good,"A typical day would consist of answering calls for ATT's wireless service, helping customers resolve issues with the wireless carrier."
good,answer the phone and provide information to customers. you didn't get to know your co-workers much and it was a boring job. I hated the fact that you were not to leave your desk to use the washroom unless necessary and that you couldn't tell the customer to stop calling you names and to stop yelling at you.
good,Average workplace. Nothing special was offered to make it better or worse. Put in your time and go home. Management was good.
good,This was a job while working my way through school. I definitely felt I was effective in the field of customer service however I didn't see this as a career opportunity.
good,As per my experience it was hectic calling place.it was inbound call center so call bombard continuously on your phone machine & they expect we should wrap the call within 2 minut without customer satisfaction.which is not acceptable from my end and costumer end also.
good,"I started with Convergys about 6 months ago. It seemed pretty cool in the interview. I mean I'm a college student so any job at this point is awesome. But during the training (which is paid thankfully, but you absolutely can't miss a single day otherwise you're canned on the spot) it was made known to me that we weren't working for Convergys exactly but rather being contracted to DirecTV and getting the benefits from that company but being paid by Convergys. At 8.25 an hour, I could barely keep up with bills as it was but later found out that a typical DirecTV employee actually gets around 12 an hour to start and some could even get somewhere around 15 to 20 an hour if they stay with them for about a year. No raises, weak incentives for sales. If you go even a little bit below the 'goal' of 20% sales per day they harass you until you get there. The reason I'm no longer with them is because I had a family emergency, I had to leave early, I made sure with my direct superior and even his superior if it was ok for me to go and that it won't be counted against me, and they said ""Yes of course, just come in tomorrow, we'll see if we can make up the time later"" and the next day I was immediately fired for attendance even though it was the only time I actually missed. Work for them if you think you can meet the standards and deal with the lying and deceit they impose but just know you must always put them first even before family otherwise you'll get canned.  "
good,"I was very funny at my job"
good,All eyes on each other at work. Typically its loud with all the talking going on. I learned that its always a way for you to please the next person such as the customer. The management had a hard time trying to comply with the employees because its just a big corporation that doesn't care too much for the employees everyone has to be higher than the next when we are all equal. Co workers are mostly fun but you have the ones where there is negative vibe so you keep your distance. The hardest part will be dealing with the angry customers and trying to give them the best experience with the company. The most enjoyable would be when you have all the people you enjoy around you all day and have the same lunch to spend time and talk.
good,"great training program to help handle account information, hardest part was giving bad news to card holders"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of taking between 100-200 customer service and technical malfunction calls, precisely documenting each call and merchandise that was offered by the company, and meet a sales quota. Management was concerned with the profitability of the employees and not as much about individual job satisfaction or tools needed to complete required tasks. My co-workers were all very competitive for the available management positions but not much about quality of work. The hardest part of the job was not being able to take bathroom breaks even when they were dire. I learned from this position that there are all kinds of customers and each deserves his/her most value for the money they are spending and a helpful positive lea son to guide them through the process. The most enjoyable part was knowing that you had really helped someone. "
good,you have to be on the phone most of the time there dont really work with you in regards to case load but the employees/co-workers are very helpful
good,"working i a call center . responsible for the vip accounts "
good,Perfect company to work if you are a student or a single person
good,"You deal with customers across United States. Customers with different cultures and race. The account requires each one of us to render an over the top customer service. We try to do one-call resolution to avoid any callbacks from our clients. One of the most difficult part is dealing with irrate customers."
good,Its a company that's about business; making sure that their agents and customers come first.
good,Supervise and coach agents taking calls to meet metrics. Contract was for the USPS.
good,Being on the phones and helping customer fix something so simple and making them so happy is the best and only part of this job that I enjoy.
good,"Learnt Oracle application here and hardest part of the job is less work. It is a fun to be at Concentrix, but alas, has less job security"
good,Overall work experience was great but due to management practices I was unsatisfied with the experience there. I did no like the way they handled employee concerns.
good,"Long hours spend over the phone helping clients with a variety of issues such as connectivity, email and escalations to specialized local teams."
good,"I did not love my job at Convergy's but it paid the bills. A typical work day would be sitting with a headset on your head for 8-9 hours. I did learn how to deal with angry customers in a calm and effective manner and how to build good relationships with customers. The management there is awful, they are constantly threatening to fire their employees. The hardest part of my job would have been that the job wasn't very challenging, it got boring very fast. The most enjoyable part would have been the people I met and the friends I made."
good,i would not work for them again! I was doing $15/hr work for $10/hr pay
good,I learned how to handle difficult customer in minacs and making patience when you talk to customer
good,"It's known to have a bad reputation, but overall the experience was not all negative. I moved to Clarksville and its was my first and only job there for almost 4 years until I moved to Nashville."
good,"workplace was ok,,i have learned there so much for future use,their management was ok,,but the hardest part was continue speak on every call,it may cause for headache,,,rest work was enjoyable"
good,"A typical day at Convergy's is coming in and attempting to find an empty seat and logging into your computer, only to find they added an extra hour or half an hour of mandatory OT and didn't mention it to you before you left work the day before adn they changed your schedule after you left. Being on the phones for a total of 8 hours a day with 2 15 mintue breaks and 1 30 minute lunch."
good,"The job isn't bad paying, and its a pretty fun job seeing as I love call center work. My issue with this business was the ""supervisors"" a lot of them didn't do their job. They acted like they didn't want to help when you needed something, they would fault you for something being wrong with the system. The computers would run slow so even if i was early i was late because of the system working when it wanted to. There was a lot of favoritism shown to certain employees and things used to change so much and we were supposed to roll with the punches no questions asked. I ended up losing my job due to a move away from the area and a ""supervisor"" who was really mean and whom for some reason did not take a liking to me. One good thing i will say is, once you get the hang of everything, the systems are easy to use and the department was always busy so it made the day move along."
good,convergys has a great training program and is wonderful for people just starting in the work field. They have a wonderful benefits program.
good,"Helped customers with paying bills, setting up cable for their television, add packages to their cable network,and lower cost of cable services when applicable."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Busy, with documentation, time keeping, coaching, taking escalated calls. I've learned how to manage my time with all of the daily duties. My management and co-workers are supportive. The hardest part of the job was to have a total of 105 monitors complete for the month of August for a team of 22. The most enjoyable part of the job is that we go to Pueblo CSU for learship team building, and managment provides us with books to read to better ourselves"
good,"New Team Lead for Cisco does not know policy's and procedures for Medical Accomidation / FMLA forms and will fire employees who were told differently or wrong information by New Team Manager. When employees contest the Managements decision the employee is given 1 phone number to Service Relations and is told ""Call someone who cares."""
good,A typical day at work involved assisting customers with their enquiries on technology devices.
good,"The management is hard to deal with. The outsourced nature of the company produces a very fast-moving environment that waterfalls stress down from the top all the way to the bottom agents. Attrition is an issue because the whole system operates on a punishment system, not rewards. Ultimately the pay was not worth the stress."
good,Days i'm just on the headset. I've learned somethings about the job mostly bad. Management takes time on some things to get done unfortunately. Co-workers kept me leveled.
good,"A typical day would consist of fielding inbound customer service/tech support calls for high-speed internet. Meeting sales goals, customer satisfaction and call time matrices were also very important tenets of job performance. I learned how to use software and knowledge management systems relevant to my duties. I also learned lout about the basic ins and outs of high-speed internet and home networking. The hardest part of the job was the poor team management and organization of the supervisors. The most enjoyable part of the job was the sales reward system."
good,Job was a fun place to work at. Had many people to interact with. Co-workers were friendly and always able to help. The stress with working over the phones for a full day was not easy. The company did not think about you as a individual but as a worker. They did not care about your personal life or if you had an emergency.
good,"Data entry was excellent, would still be there if the dept. had not closed. Probably would've advanced to team leader or higher."
good,"It was a hard place to work at, since you fear you would lose you job. There favorite quote was ""You should be happy to have a job, during this recession. The job itself was not bad and all in all customers were easy to work with."
good,"Very strict and doesn't allow many days off. Lunches and breaks are really short. Hectic call flow, no time in between calls"
good,A daily routine would consist of inbound phone calls dealing with order placement and billing resolutions as well as account management.
good,No room for advancement great place to learn to sell but very stressful
good,"A typical day at work for convergys you took over 150 calls a day dealing with costomers who has cell phones with sprint and there contracts were almost up. I learned how to distingished what is a better deal with cell phone companies and also how to talk to people who can only do so much for you and your cell phone plans. I also learned how to sale phones, change plans, and convents people that changing their plan is not the end of the world. Some co-workers are more easily to get alone with then others so pick your friends wisely. The hardest part about my job was handling costomers who were upset with the company and thinking about canceling. The most enjoyable part of the job was when you were off on payday.."
good,"You dont know what Convergys is until you actually get the job. I learned how to fix customers internet problems and how to sell our company products. The management is hard to get up with at times do to so many people working there. You never really talk to your coworkers because we're all on phones. The hardest part of the job was learbing everything. the things we were taught didnt really prepare us for when we actually got on the phones. the most enjoyable part of the job were the conversations we had with certian customers that were down and out. It made me feel better to make someone else happy, even if it was something so small as fixing their internet connection."
good,"busy call center environment, cool management, pay and benefit are good as well"
good,It was nice working with most of the people there; but most of the upper echelon management doesn’t know how to respectfully treat its employees.
good,"a good job but, the environment was somewhat lacking and the schedule is not great, the managers were nice but had a lot of employees."
good,"I started working there before I started school and was told they could work around my schedule. Then school came around and they could not work around my schedule so I quit. It is a very busy place, and policies change constantly, if you are a fast learner and a self starter it is a great place for you."
good,All about the metrics. If you can handle negativity and being accused of things you have no control over all day without it effecting you this is the place for you.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Highly competetive, stressful, misleading job descriptions; system inefficiency; unrealistic targets and demands; impersonal approach of majority of senior management;"
good,"very exhausting, people are really great but the work and company itself has a way of things that does not go well with the employees. but it depends on the person if they like the job"
good,"There are agents, and then there are Team Leaders. The Team Lead position is basically the manager of a specific group of agents. The Team Lead position is too easily acquired and some of the Team Leaders lack key social skills and workload processing."
good,It’s an ok job regular like any other the worst part is just the people that’s there a lot of negative energy but as far as the manager and supervisors they are great and understandable
good,"The company is client focused, the employees is just their to fulfill the client needs. The company have several contracts. They pay is low compared to most companies with the same client."
good,Very amazing people learned a lot of new things that will always help me through out life also learned slog of memorial meaning work that will help me in my future jobs
good,I loved my job and enjoyed very much.  Management didn't want to help n and if they did it was like it was held against you. I went on maternity leave and was currently working first shift.  I was old I would go back to first shift when I returned.  When I did return from maternity leave was told I was being  put on 3rd shift.  By no means could i do that after having a new born.  I tried fighting it and in the end received no help from HR or other management.  I decided to leave!!!!
good,Processing medical claims is a everyday learning experience because every claim can and will be different but I welcome the challenge. I love being a claims processor.
good,The job itself is not difficult. I feel as though the management was poor and lacked a good culture. Too much bad language tolerated on the floor. Too many people that were allowed to be distractions.
good,Nice place to work for people who enjoy talking on the phone troubleshooting and resolution management.  Employee turnover is low from management support.
good,If you sre amped for different task. This company has many different programs. Look for ways to bring diversity in. Management is not diverse and needs to be open to talent from all backgrounds.
good,"Concentrix is formerly convergys. We  handle inbound AND outbound calling, supporting the Humana project, LensCrafters, TMobile, and Apple. Working here is ok, not great. Entry level job."
good,"a good to start you career in BPO sector.but i nerver suggest any one to choose this sector.u loose your social life once you enter is BPO sector."
good,I really loved the job at first.  It paid more than minimum wage and the bonus was really clearly defined as to what was required and the levels of bonus but that completely changed in the last year.  They stopped even communicating the details of how the new bonus worked and even with a 10 on the scorecard that didn't warrant any bonus according to my team lead.  She was working different hours than me and the weekly team meeting was scheduled on my day off and as a result I was unaware of certain new policies and she would write me up anyways.  Basically started bombarding me with writeups my last couple weeks then randomly fired me.  The reason they gave me in the zoom room was because they were concerned about my health but then they lied and gave a different reason on the record of employment.  They also purposely leave a comment so that it delays the processing time to get EI.
good,"Its good to work with Aditya Birla Minacs( Concentrix)"
good,"Too much focus on profits and client needs and shareholders poor communication within structure.."
good,"Co-workers are friendly and professional; Managers are professional and encouraging. Whether you are a tech-geek, like myself, a novice, or just want learn about technology, you can succeed here! Training and support are valued at Concentrix! You will continually receive training on a regular basis, even after your ‘basic training/ introduction’. For all of positives with working with Concentrix there are some serious negatives that, make the experience less appealing for a long term commitment."
good,Low pay. Great atmosphere. Management didn't care about employees. Employers only cared about numbers. Employees made work fun.Great benefits and overtime always available.
good,"Concentrix offered an amazing training, such a shame that you’re not allowed to take holidays when you want to, you get short breaks, you’re toilet breaks are monitored and the kitchen staff are not friendly."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I worked a long time with them. I felt they had reasonable benefits and work hours. Management tends to be untrustworthy and they hire management based on friendship not skills. Sometimes questionable work ethics and no time off for work/life balance. "
good,"Office management sucked. Everything else was ok. Also I wished they understood that when you have an emergency, you have to leave. NO questions should be asked."
good,"Was not a fun place to work, you come in and do your job. I don't have anything else to say about this job. Would not work for then again. Would not recommend to anyone. The paid could be a lot better"
good,"My time at the Convergys/Concentrix in my area was overall pretty bad. Flawed management that promoted people based on favoritism. Commision plans for sales were almost non existent when I left.  They tell you they care about you, but never make any major changes to make it a better work environment.  Issues with bedbugs and other insects persisted after I mentioned new carpet was needed due to pest control option not resolving the problem. No good schedule structure unless you're a top performer, and honestly, sometimes that won't get you a good schedule. Only Holidays off are Thanksgiving and Christmas, and all they do is swap your off days for that week so it won't exceed two days. Poor training as a result of the amount of time training took place (trainers were great!)  Constant rehire of the same employees that were fired for things like: absenteeism and fraud.  The only good thing about this job is the diversity, base pay, certain people driving great energy and the PTO system.  Those were the reasons I stayed as long as I did."
good,Its made out to be something it truly isn't. It could be a wonderful job but majority of the leaders have a god complex and treat you like peons. The attendance policy is the best part about the place.
good,This is my first call handling experience. I've learned a lot and get promoted in short period of time. Earned more due to unlimited commissions as well.
good,Technical Support for macOS and iOS devices. Company offers paid training and provide iMac to work from home. You have to have high speed internet and a land line. You are required to follow a script depending on the issue. If you deviate from the script or give out personal information it’s a compliance failure. Eventually I quit due to constant negativity and threats from leadership
good,"I'll try to be fair and impartial on my comments:"
good,"It used to be Convergys, so I'm not sure if the policies are the same. The management was not great when I was there. From what I have heard, it has gotten much better. Its a good place to work as long as you're comfortable in the call center environment and quick-paced atmosphere."
good,"Easy job to do, however the company as a whole was not on the same page. I worked for them on 2 separate occasions. The first one the day the season ended was the last day with no warning whatsoever. I reached out for 2 weeks to my manager to find out why I wasnt being scheduled with no response. I applied for the new season and was hired again (seasonal positions) I went through training for 2 weeks and was unable to do anything because nobody knew how to reactivate my account from the previous season. It took almost an entire month to get my on the phones and working because no one could figure out how to get me back to active status."
good,A majority of the calls you take you're apologizing and explaining to customers  that they are in a lease and not a contract. The atmosphere is very High schoolish at best and the training is sub par with no real application of what you're job really entails. You also must provide customers with offers from sprint even if they show no interest.
good,Existe pouca pessoas preparados na área de treinamento
good,Company that is showing for review is invalid not sure what this company is but it was convergys not this company....which I worked there for almost 2 years
good,Somewhat a revolving door even for the professional representatives that they were able to recruit. I would recommend to help by changing management and boosting pay as well
good,I can honestly say my experience with the company wasn’t the worst of course it had the bad but I actually enjoyed the job. I loved my team when it came to my management and some of my co workers. My team leader in the technical department definitely looked out for us. We got 2 breaks and a lunch depending on how long your shift was and it was a pretty easy job just really working at your own pace but meeting goal. Its actually a good first job for someone young with no responsibilities because pay isn’t good and your paid extremely low for them to be incorporated with General Motors. The worst hing is the fact that it’s infested with bedbugs apparently you won’t see them but they are there.
good,"Pros:"
good,They favor people waist of time no job security they got bought out no advancement....this place can be fun but its alot of young messy kids working their and they do not communicate well. Take some mace with you in the parking lot and be careful supervisor side with they friends and family they should have a class action soon
good,"When I started this employment I worked for United States Postal service and the site manager really cared about the employees and their families.   After the third year the site director was promoted and a new site manager took over and she did not take a great care of the employees.  The employees became more and more disgruntled, the incentives decreased, the point system was on a person to person basis but favoritisms were used to make determinations,  the management started dating and going out with hourly employees and giving special treatment.  The company itself is not bad however the Jacksonville NC location needs to terminate all Management positions and bring in new managers."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I have worked for Concentrix (formerly known as Convergys) for 6 years now. I can say that its been a steady source of income. If you are looking for advancement and good pay, this may not be the place for you. If you have been looking for a job for a long time with no luck, apply here. They hire anyone. Its a job!"
good,Good place to work. But there is no stability for future and all other activities. Anybody can work here but there is no futurw security at all. Only a time pass working place..no experience count in your resume
good,I only worked with Concentrix during tax season and have been trying to get back on every since 04/19/2019.  I keep on getting turned down even though I passed everything for the Intuit TurboTax project.  I like working from home and would like to continue working with Concentrix.
good,"Terrible stat system in which a non BT Customer can call in, you're unable to help with their issue as they haven't a BT product can still rate you 0 even if you've helped to best of ability which affects your bonus. Worked there 3 months and never had a schedual. was told on multiple occasions when asked that my TL had to send off for a new password to get me access to it as they sent an incorrect password originally. Apparently she had emailed multiple times for it, but when I joined my new team after training the new TL informed me it's a quick process and she never sent off for it in the process. Negatively effected me as I joined the new team on friday, and wasn't informed that I'd have a new schedual causing me to work Saturday when I had the weekend off. Not knowing this as neither TL informed me or got me access to my schedual in the 3 months I worked there. People quit every few days, TL's dont seem to care too much about those below."
good,Working for the company I learned that we have an opportunity to continue our goals to the next level.. The hardest part of the job was able to learn all the medications name and pronunciation. The most enjoyable day at work was able to be there on time and hear my customers happy that I was able to make a different.
good,"After working with the company for nearly 6 years, the company offers chances of advancement and learning options."
good,Great place to get sales and management experience . It’s a job not necessarily a career. The turnover/attrition rate is high. Schedule is not flexible. PTO use is limited
good,"This is a typical Call center. Your handling calls all day long from Customers of FCA products. Jeep, Chrysler, Fiat, Ram. You have to be fast in typing, you only have 2 minutes to do your after call messages. This can be a pain if you have been on the call with someone yell in your ear. Not to bad a cut above YA. Hardest part of the job is to get your after call down to less than 2 minutes or you will have your lead coming to talk to you asking why your not ready for the next call. I have learned that it pays to hold your tongue and not take it personally"
good,Company and Work culture are good but needs to improve Management Process wise.It should be more employee friendly.  Salary structure should be variable as per the line of business and work presser.
good,"Management is highly undeveloped- no motivation, lack of communication, poor workplace knowledge, negative attitude towards coworkers, and no team building. 401k benefits do not start until 1yr employment and does not have impressive employer contributions. There are no employer matching contributions for an HSA account. The only room for movement in the company is from their high turn over rate."
good,The culture has changed for the worse due to management changes.  Has become unprofessional with no accountability.  I have no more to add to this section
good,"Concentrix is a very good opportunity for freshers, The pay circle is not so bad to comparison to other MNC in Kolkata. Work culture is average, But management is very poor."
good,"I worked on a graveyard shift, work mates are fun to be with, learned how to answer calls from outside of the country and cater their needs. Most enjoyable part of the job is when I am able to help a customer"
good,The most enjoyable part pf the job was making customers happy. Most customers were angry or unhappy when calling in and it was great to be able to offer them reolutions to their issues.
good,"i started working at concentrix back in november, the classroom training for the calls was really easy and the dress code was super lax which i was pumped about. but the calls are absolutely horrendous and the project i’m in is currently working mandatory overtime. nights and weekends off are pretty nice, but it does make it hard to get anything done as far as doctors or banks go because you work through normal business hours. would like some flexibility in scheduling and something a little more fun."
good,"The job it self is good, I love my calls. The environment of the job is horrible, the team leaders aren’t to great ,my training experience was not good at all. My team itself I did like, it’s just an unprofessional environment"
good,I worked in a very fast paced virtual environment. Calls are back to back all shift.  You handle a lot or all of the customer complaints.  You are required to have a first call resolution on every call.  All your calls are being recorded so management is always listening. You better follow protacol or you are in trouble. This the hardest part of the job knowing the answer to a customers question and still not being able to go directly to the solution. You are required to follow the steps in the resolution chain every time on every call. To me this wasted time. I didn't do that on one call because I knew what the problem was so went right to it but got in trouble for doing this by my manager because she was listening in on the call. I did learn a lot from this job & extreme amount about technical issues & how to solve them on mobile phones. The most enjoyable part of the job was the customers. I am very much a people person and this is what I love to do AWESOME customer service always!
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Rules are to be followed and are strict. Lighthearted work environment at times. Managers are not very helpful. Company does not show their appreciation for their employees as they should.
good,"As long as you can put up with the working conditions, have a certain degree of skill, and maintain a decent attendance record, you can basically be employed indefinitely and they will hire most backgrounds. On the other hand, the pay is low, the medical benefits are worse than useless, it's extremely difficult to advance despite what they claim, and the work environment largely depends on what project you're working on and your manager."
good,"Work load is higher than other companies. Management has very straight forward and dynamic approach, No such things called Protocol, Guidelines or Moral exist in the work culture. Decisions are money minded."
good,"I can't believe a company can start out with a billion dollar contract, elect to get out of that sphere of business, and abandon such a gravy train.   Pathetic."
good,"Part of Convergys for 29 years before Concentrix/Synnex bought company and after only one month let 200+ IT professionals go.  No rhyme or reason to layoffs, high salaries seemed to be targeted."
good,"Well a call centre has to be like call centre. Night shifts could kill any employee. With biological cycle change, changes your mood, health, relationships and overall life."
good,"A typical day consisted of 250-400 calls per shift. I learned alot about maps. Did not speak with upper Management, only team leads.Some team leads were very helpful. The work place was very relaxed. The hardest part of the job was having your schedule  changed four months. The most enjoyable was interacting with the customer. Most of them were hilarious, and very nice."
good,"Its a great place, but only if you dont want to get promoted."
good,"A lot of our team members isn't really motivated to get to work as they aren't managing people well. "
good,This place was okay at 1st. I had perfect attendance for 5 months straight. Management is horrible. Upper management is extremely poor. Turn over rate is ridiculous. OMs are ignorant beyond belief and live in an alternate reality. The only thing decent about that place is the pay. Period.
good,very competitive environment. easy to move up. no uniforms/very relaxed dress code. high stress work. mandatory overtime at high traffic times of the year.
good,"This job pays pretty good, but it is extremely tiring and I was always questioning if the pay was worth it. Management wasn't that great, and neither was the culture. I learned quite a bit about customer service, although it seemed that there were always many problems with our customers that we had to fix in a very tight time frame. "
good,"I worked in ISM Retention which means we were the end all catch all of everything At&t related. We would get yelled at and cursed at every day, multiple calls a day. When I first started there it was okay. The cubicles are dirty, but we used to have our own headsets. When I left we had to share headsets and we have no set desks. The environment coupled with being yelled at constantly and sales quotas for cancellation calls were just too much. They'll hire anyone, you'll be paid well, and the benefits are pretty nice. All that being said it's pretty much impossible to have a good work day there."
good,"The job was fine, it wasn’t hard to do. You are in a call center and answered phones. The only down fall for the job is there are no raises. You have the chance for monthly bonuses but that’s only if your stats are perfect which is impossible bc it only takes that one long long call to blow your stats for the month and no bonus."
good,"It was fun, i improved my skills including sales skills, how to handle angry customers. Good friends, Training was good but the shifts was bad as you are working all days"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Working at call center will receive complaint from customer everyday.  From this, i've learned to be patient and to be good customer service you have to be good listener and good at problem solving. The management is great as the leader make the environment fun even the job is stressful."
good,"Good entry level job, dont make it a career because there is barely one present. The management team is diverse in skill, however the good managers rarely balanced the bad ones."
good,call center that made calls inbound/outbound. no opportunity for higher pay. no part time. make 80 to 100 calls per day. assist in billing help others navigate their sprint products.
good,"it's a typical call center setting. there's a few weeks of paid classroom training and various knowledge checks before they put you on phones. I did tech support during my time at convergys, it was okay. it was stressful at times when you get yelled at by a customer, but there are plenty of resources to succeed if you use them properly. the break rooms are really nice and convenient. parking is okay. option to work 8 hours or 10 hours."
good,"Not to bad of a place, long hours though where you answer phone calls and help people with managing their accounts and services associated with it. Long training period."
good,"Relaxed but strict.. when you need help it’s hard to find it, no flexible hours. When a costumer wants a supervisor they will not speak to them. Etc.."
good,I usually worked mornings from 6am-3pm. I got two 15 minute breaks and 1 hour lunch. Overtime was always available and I did IT Tech phone support for iPhone users internationally.
good,There's a lot opportunity to work in this company but my previous manager wasn't capable enough to handle and defend his team member in times of need.
good,nothing special.The work was good as you talked to different people. expectations were high and pay was low. benefits were decent. Company had trouble with employee moral.
good,"Working in a place where you get free food and unlimited internet access is so much fun and beneficial but the downside of getting those privileges is having to travel 2 hrs to work and 2 hrs going home. What I loved most about my previous company is the family day, wherein all employees from all sites get to bring their whole family to a theme park for free and monetary value stubs that can be used for food and other store purchases. It has been a fun stay with the company however, there are reasons to consider that made me leave the company and that is proximity and other benefits that is not so beneficial for an employee with a big family."
good,"A empresa promete um mundo perfeito onde a evolução é continua e há o respeito por diversas religiões, onde há uma gerencia que escuta seus funcionários, mas não confere com a prática."
good,"For the most part I have really enjoyed my time here at Concentrix. My biggest complaint is the amount of work required from Managers and the salaries they are given. I easily work 45-50 hours a week in order to complete all of the required coachings, payroll, surveys, feedbacks, advisor tech issues and other task assigned daily."
good,"Full time, benefits, semi-flexible hours, great for night owls. If you take the job seriously and do what is expected of you, it's great. If you have an entitled attitude, and slack off it won't work out."
good,laid back environment sometimes fun and exciting. things always change so be able to accept change well and just try to go with the flow. big break room.
good,"A typical day at work involved answering phone calls  right from the get go.  The management were tough but fair.  The workplace culture was very poor with very low moral.  There was job security and room for advancement with the company"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Low paying job at the salaried level relative to the market. There was frequent leadership change over and high overall attrition among the front line employees. At one point, the local site closed completely down, laying the majority of their employees off without warning."
good,"Well, there are good & bad things about Convergys. The pay is very well averages around 9 to 10 dollars with chance of getting a raise if you get a management position. Management however is very fond of favoritism."
good,"Por falta de ética en la parte operativa y de una comunicación eficiente, muchos esfuerzos metodológicos y estratégicos para mejorar los resultados de nuestros agentes y el ambiente laboral se perdían. Además los horarios eran muy largos."
good,Open Environment for a new joinee to grow from start point to the milestone he set for himself in near future with the gradual increase in their dreams
good,my position was seasonal but the managers i had were great and understanding as long as the job was done.  i wish there could bring this position back .
good,"I dont feel that they are very fair with the testing process. You have to take written tests, if you dont pass you get fired. I feel that some people as myself are better at on hand than on paper."
good,"It was fun, but you get taught to deal with problems and when you get in the floor it switches to all about sellin direct tv, if you can switch mind flow to making sales vrs trying to worry about problems you’ll do good."
good,"I kind of liked working for them, they moved me around departments enough that it made me feel good that they continually up trained me every 4-6 months. They liked the work i did for them enough that i received several lateral promotions. the pay increases were generally not great at all. For the  duration of my employment which was roughly 3 years i received 2 skill based pay raises and 1 incentive pay raise the total pay raise for skill was $0.55 cents. I received a pay raise of $2.00 once as incentive to stay with the company because they were on the verge of losing the project i was on and they gave that raise to everyone in the company on my project. I left the company because I started to notice more people were being let go in anticipation for the project closing so i left of my own accord."
good,"Convergys manages your time down to the second in some cases and has a ironclad and sometimes byzantine policy structure as well as poor communication between management and workers. But once you settle in, it is predictable and the people are awesome."
good,Thing are constantly changing without an notice or it takes ages for something to get fixed. You can attempt to clock and get your stuff working and systems will be down. HR is on site but it is like they are off site workers because you never see them
good,"I think convergys is a great company. Just depends on what location you are and it will be different on how the company is operated. I loved the Wichita Site but when I relocated to the Olathe site, I decided to look for opportunities elsewhere due to how the company is operated there in Olathe, KS."
good,"Convergys holds many different projects in a call center environment. I have worked on 2 of the projects there. These were customer service oriented, call center projects with little room for pay increase or advancement. A lot of high level stress. Required to learn new procedures quickly and implement them right away. Daily goals and quotas. Good health benefits but low pay."
good,this job taught me to be very adaptable with training and software programs because their was always a new company every year that required a month of training for the new requirements.
good,Interacting with customer concerning their utility bill. I enjoyed helping the customers making the right choices with what fit their needs. Was very stressful but still enjoyable.
good,It is a good job but hard to advance. I been there for almost 7years. They have a few different shifts and some overtime. No regular pay raises. It is an ok job.
good,"Convergys was a very performance driven environment.  Strict expectations for sales, saves, and upgrades.  Sometimes overtime would be mandatory, sometimes 1 hour or more on any given day."
good,"First job ever since graduating college, it was okay. but the proximity and the constant change took it's toll because i was going home from Cavite. but no complaints because the job was easy, it's about going to work that will be a problem because you're going to deal with traffic alot. and all of this lead to my resignation. they handle backpay very bad and that's for my personal experience with the company."
good,My Manager I thought were fair. the job was fun at times. I did really enjoy the  multiple shift changes  but that was client driven not Convergys management
good,"When I worked for the shared line, I kept getting Voluntary Go Home or Mandatory go Home. I was not able to do much with my pay check so I decided to try other things."
good,You sign in and receive calls immediately. You have to self educate most information and deal with extreme rude customers at times and supervisors who decline customers requests for them on the phone.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Work hours are unpredictable.  Communication is not a strong point with work at home advisors.  No real communication with leadership outside of email.
good,"paid for Pharmacy Technician license out of pocket with the understanding that I would get a $1 an hour increase in pay, however, because I am considered 'staff' I was informed after the fact that the increase was only for the agents.........I am paid hourly, but considered staff.....I've also been told that the project I'm on is the only one that I can work at......that there are no other projects that they will let me transfer to.....simply because I've got my license. Advancement into anything other than Supervisor (few and far between) is impossible.......anyone above that level never leave."
good,"Hectic, Poor Management, Barely any training. Easy Job. Low Pay, (apple pays $5 more to work from your house)"
good,It's an okay place to work but please stay to yourself. Sometimes you may have to use other Team Leads because your Team Lead is not as beneficial or resourceful. They are very gracious when comes to attendances and absences caused by real emergencies. I've never been employed with a company that great with time-off and a lot of extra benefits. And lastly the women bathroom is just about always nasty
good,Fun working environment. They will work with your schedule if you have a legitimate reason. Good pay if you put in the work necessary. Laid back coworkers.
good,In this company I have 3month's experience but it's  very enjoyable  there are so many frds of mine.in this company  I'm in Abilene prossec it's was nice experience
good,"Some days there is mandatory overtime. "
good,"Calls were back to back non-stop. Team Leaders had a lot of favoritism. Your job was not secure, you could be let go at any moment. Sales had to be met every week."
good,"Convergys wasn't a terrible work place, and it did have a lot of benefits. The hourly pay was decent, and the overall building was  nice. However, some agents did not clean up their desks and left trash and food there. The agents were more friendly and most management was fair and nice. There was a few managers who did play favorites and was not manager material. The work was steady and everything was well organized."
good,-A typical day at work is being yelled at by customer about their various cellular devices and why they don't work. A constant observation and montering of employees.
good,"Not a bad job if you don't mind sitting all day. You work alone in a room with other processors, Saturdays have been mandatory since February 2017 with no end in sight, good if you like over time or don't have a family at home. Benefits are expensive for a family, 8 hours of PTO every month, no vacation time for processors. Not much room for advancement and work is very repetitive."
good,"Working on the phones."
good,Left and would only go back if I absolutely had too. Not the worse place to work meant for college students or someone not looking to be there too long
good,"No electronic devices were allowed on the floor and that was just the first thing I did not know when hired.  Highly controlled work environment and restrictive,"
good,Your skills are always growing and expanding with the skills that you have learned. New things and experiences every day. Helping members with their issues.
good,Seems like overall the company is not organized and does not really care about the agents they hire on for their clients.  Agents are disrespectful to management and there is not really a job security for those that have a client break contract.
good,"Job is pretty easy. rotating days off and set hours. possible to get VTO almost on the daily."
good,"I worked for Convergys from Nov. 2016 - Sept. 2017 as a Tier 3 Network Engineer for the Microsoft contract,"
good,"Felt like an actual well put together place, good training environment, store, building, equipment, and all around presentation of the place inside and out. High competition, but heavy workload and harsh supervisors."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Taking calls from customers in a very fast paced and ever changing environment which may include handling and maintaining their accounts, assisting with purchases and complainants . I am also a trainer that trains new advisers as well as keeps current advisers up to date on their skills. I have been provided the tools and skills needed to step and work outside the box. This job has provided me with confidence in my abilities to teach others and communicate with others my ideas and opinions. The best part of the job are my co workers. They make my job fun and exciting each day."
good,"When I worked here, I kinda enjoyed being a customer service representative even though I had to handle the ""hardest account"" as they call it. I enjoyed helping our customers and giving them the best service that they deserve. Though, I had to leave from there because I wasn't happy with the compensation that I've been receiving when I was still working there."
good,Very happy with this job unfortunately  was laid off die to company closed I worked my way up from representative to floor support and was on my way to management  until company was closed out of business
good,I enjoyed my job. I also enjoyed the fast paced environment.  I had an excellent management team. The hardest part of the job was no in between time while taking inbound calls.
good,"Need Proper People Management in Concentrix. Need to involve people with skills in right project.Have Professional environment in office."
good,It is a relaxed environment but there is very low room for advancement. It is typically unorganized. Communication is crucial in this type of environment but no one ever seems to know what is going on.
good,"A good place to build a career if you're willing to work extremely hard for a minimal pay off. Keep to yourself, do your job, and you will succeed. Several different areas you can potentially grow into."
good,quick easy money when looking for a desperate job. over time is good. they always deny time off even when you have PTO to use. and they still give you points no matter what.
good,"I've learned a lot to improve my skills conversing with English race ,how to deal with their temper and how to overcome roadblocks on their given concern. The most enjoyable part of the job is having great people around ; however , having hard time staying because the progress on having higher positions were not secure also incentives were inadequate."
good,Fun place to work just needs a better training program and better team leads. Needs to have better trainers so no one is falling behind. Team leads need to be more accessible.
good,I work night shifts and commuting was difficult. I learned that working night shifts was hazardous health-wise. Though our managers was supportive. Friendly colleagues and team leaders.
good,"Current Team Leader at Convergys."
good,"Call Center Management is stressful indeed but working for a BPO is much different.  A typical day not to many of those a things are changing consitintly as so in the call center industry, but operating with bare levels of coverage and waiting for last minute decisions on replacements is typical here and being asked why our results are low is all in the recipe.  Resources used to do the job well are common issues that we face, but the knowledge gained for always pulling of miracles is a test to an individual overall leadership and the team that supports them.  Unfortunely all are not that successful as it really depends on how that individual had been groomed before."
good,"Great as an entry level job, and good as a start to a career. Call center agents are paid fairly, however middle management is not compensated appropriately for their skills."
good,"The management meant well, but the corporate pay scale and expectations for workload could not overcome the positive intent of management. The workload was especially ill rewarded within management roles. The company needs to become more competitive in the marketplace."
good,The manages seemed to be slightly bius and did not offer assistance when an employee needs help. Some employee were granted passes for missing scheduled days while others recieved disapline. Also management did not give equal opportunity to advance
good,"Its a good job to start at if your just trying to get experience, if you are looking for a job to grow or advance look somewhere else.  The bonus structure changes so often, its frustrating and not secure."
good,"You get treated very poorly by customers majority of the time, they track your every movement on the time clocks they want you busy constantly even if you need a breather because you had a bad call or ten, and they think that humans only need to use the restroom once or twice a day it was very nerve racking knowing someone was tracking you, and looking over your shoulder constantly, along with being yelled at and belittled by angry customers who think you make the rules it was constant stress, and anxiety. "
good,"Convergys is a multinational outsourcing company and they have been in the industry for quite a few years now."
good,"Great environment for someone to get their feet wet in working in IT. Training was comprehensive and excellent leaving me feeling ready to handle a customer's call on day one. Managers and leaders seemed to lack structure which made cohesion between reporting cases and managing issues muddy, but staff was overall very welcoming and accommodating to those willing to be attentive, accept direction, and improve."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,It was interesting.  It was different everyday.  You had to learn about how business operation and how to update the business's profile.  You had to know your information.
good,"had some good  work with att ,  and cisco  but they  moved away at that time.   there are a lot of  different  companies that locate  at  Convergys  something for all"
good,Working here is great in the beginning... after being there for 5 years and not advancing after applying for advancement opportunities because I'm not part of the in-crowd
good,"they like to have fun, but if you have any type of disability they really dont work with you, you sick well to bad because they dont care, if you kiss your bosses but your good."
good,It is the international workplace where there is no place to grow in back office. Although one can grow with voice process and there are many benefits in voice process.
good,It was a place that was very non-consistent in change and nothing was stable to feel of reassurance. Management and work ethics were always in flux for employers to do their job efficiently.
good,"the culture at Convergys where i worked was always quick turnovers and sassy attitudes . People always quitting, getting fired, and then hiring more employees that saw it as a temporary job. i'm assuming being from a small city that had something to do with it."
good,Hated the job and the pay. They never paid me correctly. The job was stressful you could only be on the phone for so long. They were super strict about how things were supposed to be. over all everyone I worked with hated it there.
good,Answered calls in a call center from customers concerning billing or technical support for their cell phones and cable. Worked there for 7 years and used their online systems for billing. Technical support was on website that customers could also access.
good,Great place to work. Easy to get along with clients to provide the best care for the clients. Flexibility work schedule. adequate training available before working alone.
good,"I would clock-in, sit down and being taking calls. It was fairly straightforward but there was not much room to grow in this company and management didn't help out much. Most often, you'd find them in their offices hanging out and goofing around when there were (new) people on the floor who needed help understanding the job. I'm very tech savvy so the job was a piece of cake to me and was also why I felt as though I should've been looked at for a promotion but instead the management only promoted the people they would hang out with down at the smoke pit (their friends, basically) highly unprofessional in my opinion."
good,"No further comments on this place. I was blessed to have had a job though.  Not one to really complain, I wouldn''t return to this place even if i was offered the option in the future to do so."
good,"Job Work/Life Balance - 5 stars"
good,Good working environment. Workmates are friendly. Travel is hard from Cainta to Makati. Con is it is nigh shift. But all in all it is a good company with good benefits.
good,"Convergys is a good company. It is widely known in the BPO industry. However, the schedule does not suit my lifestyle and sometimes makes me sick. That's an apparent reason why I will be leaving the company. I would love to work where I can fully balance my work life and my own lifestyle. What I enjoyed with Convergys is that I've worked with different kinds of people and grew with them as a family. The sad part was we have to be dispersed according to our performance."
good,"You begin taking calls, learn a lot about taking care of people, manage their anger."
good,it's great to be a part of the company. I have been given the chance to mingle with oter group of people and I have been able to attend few trainings and seminars that helped me a lot.
good,This job has a heavy workload since we do many things in each call and the calls are queueing. The schedules are not that suitable. They tend to change every week and sometimes the rest days are split.
good,"Great for getting experience in the industry but overall poor upper management, poor morale, poor benefits. Compensation is low for the industry. Low hiring standards."
good,"The job is a decent one, good if you are pursuing furthering your education and simply need a job to stabilize you. Not a career type of job unless you get into HR."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Stream is a great place for students to enter the work place as they need to develop good habits to take into the position they will eventually wish to succeed in.  People make the job requirements harder than it is.  Selling is just saying I notice you have a printer, does it need ink or letting people know their warranty is about to expire.  If you do your job they leave you alone to do it.  I rarely had an issue."
good,"Dynamic environment, working towards excellence by focusing on key areas and bringing in new ideas to work on. New challenges are given everyday in order to learn and grow."
good,"The company has a lot of skills to offer esp for those student trainee, however they should appreciate the value of people in their respective departments."
good,"Live chat, calls and emails.  Some days are busy and some others really quiet.  Nice team, nice team manager.  Cantine not really good, bring your food !"
good,I help alot of different people that called and that i have to call.I love the job i love to help people.Its easy and everyone is alot of help. I love to have more jobs like this
good,"CLIENTS before STAFF"
good,"A great way to get your feet wet when learning customer service and computer/typing skills. "
good,"Good company to work for. Great tools to work with. Worked for AT&T wireless phone services when the iPhone and Smart Phones first came out. Had the opportunity to go the the USA for one month to give verbal input for the opening of a new call centre. Bad news, with the rise in the Canadian dollar to the American, they pulled out of Canada and our call centre was closed"
good,"Everytime i go to work i will condition myself to get csat. I was challenge how to pass the required metrics asked by the client. Am thankful that the trainor, floor assist and team leads are very helpful.I learn how to handle customers to get good scores. The management is very abundant in terms of giving incentives to the agents and the activities like party or customer service week we receive a lot of freebies. It has different culture in every account because my first account was closed. my first account the workplace is full of freedom to agents, like loud voices when chatting, selling food on the floor. However my second account i like the culture because all the agents are very focus to their calls, less chatting on the floor and no loud voices. What made me disappoint to my work is my team lead. He cannot assist us because he is not trained and he did not take an effort to assist us in our calls."
good,"Poor paymasters and long working hours of 9+. No employee engagement activities or any extracurricular activities."
good,"It really just depends on who you surround yourself with.  Call center, typical, just do what your supposed to do.  Pretty laxed, a little ghetto. Has a lunch room with ping pong tables, nice hands on open vending machine, some good people."
good,Management team needs to understand their employees before they could talk anything & salary wise no hopes no increment nor no communication..All put in together average
good,"Working with this company is very stressful since it takes your all the time, you won't be able to enjoy your life with shift you have provided. I've learned many things here and especially about world culture and how people interact with you as far their demographics concerned. But sometimes management makes it very awful place they always change their plans without any solid reason (which I think maybe not true), however, they seem very unprofessional. And I think shifts are the hardest part of the job."
good,They are TOO picky about calls...i did excellent and made great results but they need to dial back because after a certain point the job became very unenjoyable and that effected my performance
good,Empresa em desenvolvimento no Brasil com perspectivas de crescimento.
good,"We had mandatory overtime due to being understaffed and the high turnover rate, edging up on 10-11 hours a shift and getting worse. AT&T bought Directv which payed Convergys (the company I worked for) to take the calls. AT&T hadn't done much the first year of the purchase, but when I left they were squeezing employees even more--at the cost of both customer service and employee well being. We were no longer able to notate accounts after a call ended, meaning we had to ""ready in"" to the next call immediately or face a penalty. 80-100 calls a day literally back to back with only 10 minute breaks made the job very stressful. Training took three months, but covered things very poorly with not enough hands on training. This resulted in us being expected to know things from tech support to billing to RV troubleshooting (I was on ""Special Projects"") from the first day on the phones, and instead just know where everything is in the employee information database (called ""Agent Answer Center""). Very difficult to make customers happy with a setup like this, let alone the employees."
good,it was a temporary job. i dont think anyone likes to have to sit in a chair staring at a computer all day getting yelled at by customers who wont let you get a word in.
good,"Convergys is a call centre which i learnt many skills from. I was an inbound telesales advisor for Vodafone. The lack of management and help that the team leaders did not give us advisers was sometimes ridiculous. Now i'm not saying every manager is like that, but the majority don't actually care if you are enjoying it or are feeling comfortable on the phone. They care about quantity of sales over the quality of customer service that we give them. The managers only pick up on your bad days and never take into count all your amazing days. Pity."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Learned various skills since I had to be transferred to a different department and team every now and then. They are very dynamic, changes always take place."
good,"My typical day at work I came in sat at a computer that was in my supervisor's area. logged on and started answering calls. I learned how to type fast, listen and work the computer all at the same time. Management was good if you had a question you could always ask in the live chat.The hardest part of the job was when customers got mad at you for something you could not control.The most enjoyable part of the job was when you helped solve a problem and got the issue fixed it made me feel good about myself."
good,"Learning and exposure, management is partial, ot for long term, salary is not justified as compare to work pressure, fun to work with but not long term,"
good,"Good company but too much work pressure and salary is less lots of deductions in salary ... Working for etisalat UAE company supporting. Mobile and homes ......In concentrix I was working for etisalat process .. supporting mobile services and home services ... If there is any issue with the mobile billing and data issue and plans to be informed to the customers change of plans any request for adding or deletion of services .... Homes services like internet , TV ,landline not working we try fix from here itself nd shifting of the place nd billing issues everything was taken care ... Tis is ma job profile"
good,this is a company that has nice facilities but when it comes to comissions and salary they are so late and unreasonable excuses and do not process papers when it comes to benefits of employee specially taxes
good,There are a lot of attitudes you must deal with on and off the phone. 90% female employees. very few opportunity to advance. no raises no matter how long your there. you will be trained in up to three more jobs than what you was hired in to do and expected to be able to perform them all efficiently with out additional pay.
good,"Helping out the customer flying booking tickets for them."
good,"how to save people from downgrading their programs.  I hate the quick breaks that we have.  I wish we had an hour instead of 30 minutes.  There is never anywhere to park, the bathrooms are dirty."
good,Convergys is a very good company for starters and can learn more about how BPO's or Customer services works...salary package is less but ok for a fresher to kick start
good,I enjoyed working for Convergys. I answered inbound calls and took an estimate of 80-100 calls daily. I learned intricate details as a  Telephone Banker for U S Bank. The hardest part were calls never ending they were always back to back. I really hard to use my time wisely.
good,"The people are nice but the company itself could care less about its employees. You are promised vacation days that you will never see and you can only pray that your pay check is correct. Can't blame the staff, they have to work with what Concentrix gives them. I have heard rumors of a class action lawsuit over back payments. Don't know if it's true or not but seems quite possible to me."
good,Training should have been more hands-on. When you were put out on the floor it did feel like it was sink or swim. Fortunately MOST of the people that work there are willing to help. Hate that we aren't off weekends. Really sales oriented.
good,"It was a good company but when comes to salary and growth The company has to look on to it.They issue Ijp's but selection will be not based on your experience"
good,"I worked in a troubleshooting call center where you hear complaints from customers and managers all day. I learned a lot about how to handle angry customers and there were opportunities to move up the ladder, but in the long run, it's a negative atmosphere that does not compensate well."
good,During my first 18 months the place was great and the support was there. Once they moved to AT&T it went down hill. The support and fun had all gone in the toilet and it was not a good environment. I was not paid according to my background and skill. It is a good place for one to gain some skills with people and there are a lot of nice people to work with.
good,Training and implementation.  This was a very fun experience but the company itself was poorly managed. Hopefully thing have changed since I was there as it had to potential to be a really good company.
good,"i worked for this company for quite a while. i was part of a legacy company that merged with convergys. the transition was somewhat smooth since the policy were the same. the branch where i worked is pretty neat [moa]. basing on my experience, depending on the acocunt that you're working for, there will be incentives, as long as you are working hard. that's one thing that i like about working here. though there are sometimes that the pressure is unbearable because of the client demand. especially when the account is on red alert."
good,"working environment is professional, area is good, Facilities are okay, transport from company is super. workplace is good, hygiene maintain in the campus"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,It's not the most desirable to be in. The atmosphere is dreadful and there isn't much opportunity to move up as I experienced. There wasn't much hope in getting higher in position at all.
good,"This was one of the worst jobs I have ever had.  I wouldn't ever wish this job on no one, no true help or leadership.  I don't see no one staying here, the turnover rate was so high, most people were leaving before they even finished training."
good,"The pay wasn't too good at the time that I was there, but it has since increased. Schedule is not set it can change from day to day. There are good people that work there and help in anyway they can."
good,Ok place to work. no advancement. Contract can end at any time without warning. Management are not involved with employee task and cannot participate in review process.
good,"The beginning was very nice, felt welcomed but over time I was able to see a few things that were not apealing . Rising up in the ranks is not very likely, the HR department is not always looking in the best interest of it's employees."
good,"This is my first company and people can learn a lot from this company.You will get a diversity of people working here and customer from all over the India, u will get such a nice experience to feel understand people issues and then giving them solutions."
good,It's okay to work there but my job has ended unfortunately. But if I had the opportunity to work there again I would but I really didn't like how they where doing there coaching
good,The headsets you have to wear always gave me headaches.  The bonuses are great but its hard sometimes having to tell customers things they don't want to hear.
good,"Convergys is a third party staffing company. At my role in Convergys, I would take inbound and outbound calls from their call center here in Jacksonville. The calls would be mostly sales oriented and would require me to book a minimum of 40 appointments per week with an average of 50 calls an hour. The duties involved a high pace work environment, multi-tasking, going through patient/client demographics and medical insurance which sometimes had patient EMR documented on the files we had access to. To me, Convergys had very little opportunities for growth in the company and the company has a high turnover rate for its employees. I left for a better opportunity with Mayo Clinic to become a scheduler and later to transition into a quasi-medical secretary/surgical scheduler role."
good,"On a day to day basis I handle billing calls for the most part.  There is a small commission aspect, but mainly making changes to corporate accounts and consumer."
good,"It's a night shift schedule. It's a TELCO account, we take calls and assist our customers in collecting payments using their Credit cards, we do basic trouble shooting of their smartphone, and assist them with billing inquiry. the hardest part was most customers are irate and had a hard time to understand the company policy and we need to educate them i a professional way and apcify them with full respect. It was enjoyable because of the incentives that we are getting."
good,The job itself is very challenging that it would require you to be alert during your work hours. Credit card department in an American bank is an avenue to enhance your patience and work ethics towards the clients.
good,"I accepted a position at this employer upon my initial relocation to Charlotte.  I loved the company, and training staff were knowledgable and helpful!  In regardes to the culture of the call center and team leaders, some of the behavior  that was allowed as well as tolerated, was well below sub-par"
good,"High energy and lots of support while solving customer issues.This company provides good support utilizing extensive job aids, It also promotes team leadership roles within."
good,"A typical day at work include working with various challenges faced using the data and how to gain insights out of it.I have learned many new things coming to this organisation.Workplace culture is good, but needs improvement as it needs to engage with employees more than what is currently there. Enjoyable part of the job is having a fun-loving team. hardest part of the job will be to sucessfully over come challenges."
good,Answered calls from people with problems with their product. Handled their problems and if possible sell more to them. Learned how to handle lots of stress. It was by far the hardest place to work I ever encountered. Fast paced and stressful
good,The only thing I didn't like about Convergys is going to work everyday wondering if you are going to have a job or not. The lack of communication between management and employee is horrible as well.
good,it was a pretty good experience while working at this company. got to  learn a lot from the managers in terms of process and management wise. The Journey was tough due to the new project but still survivable.
good,"Its a good place to work if you just starting out looking for an entry level job."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"It's a good place to work in. However, the culture is not great. The leadership does a good job sometimes, but the structure is a bit disjointed and requires redress. "
good,"I just don't like their management. On the way they handle their employee and regarding with the salary it was pretty good. But, i still finding a job that can boost my confident ."
good,Clean and neat place to work. Security is nice but very strict. Needs permit for everything. Training is intensive but the job needs focus to get accustomed. Low salary for a big company.
good,"Managed call center to ensure call center metrics were met."
good,"Job is good but there is little security.  They track you by the minute, so if you are late they keep track of attendance and it is difficult to make up attendance issues.  The management is very fair and work environment is fun."
good,Minacs was not a great place to work but it was purchased by concentric so it could be different now. The job itself was challenging but the company culture made it somewhat more difficult.
good,"It is fulfilling every time you are able to satisfy a given customer of AT&T. For the company itself, BPO industry in the Philippines has a different culture and I believe that culture works well with other people."
good,"a typical work day consist of placing orders for customers or tracking there packages "
good,You'll get good training from them but  you wouldn't want to stay with them for a long time since there are a lot of other BPOs out there that offers higher compensation and benefits.
good,"If you want to start your BPO career, CVG (Convergys) is the perfect company for you. The staff members are approachable, trainers and coaches are great and friendly that will help you to gain more knowledge with enthusiasm."
good,A good way to make money. Wouldn't recommend making a career out of it however. Long stressful calls for not enough pay. You are guaranteed 40 hrs per week however.
good,Management for the most part is fair however depends on your department. Hours can be sporadic with rotas changing frequently. Equipment depending on department can be faulty causing issues. A good place to gain experience.
good,"Convergys was an overall ok job. The management were willing to accomodate, provided positive feedback/kudos when due. I do wish there was more room for advancement."
good,"Convergys is a call center run by a wonderful woman and several others with various degrees of professionalism, composure, and sensibility. The base pay is agreeable, but before long the stress of keeping your statistics up to par and handling the general poor morale of the workplace will have you jumping through hoops to get another job. While some of the lower management is amazing, compassionate, and helpful, the chances of getting an awful, inconsiderate, counterproductive team leader are comparable to a game of Russian roulette. Some days are very good, but as time passes the low moral, stress of meeting sales and keeping a low average time, and workplace drama will burn you out. Recommended for those who don't have other options or simply for those who thrive under negativity."
good,"Can't clock in 5-10 min ahead of time. Either you clock on at even time or take a point for being a minute late. 10 different login sites for tools. "
good,The position was good but there was so much unprofessionalism within the workplace regarding management and employees.  The companies turnover rate was very high.
good,Drama everywhere at Convergys! I was signed up to work on certain things that I did not sign for. With no training at all about those objectives I was set to do I was to accept the failure of failing them.
good,"It was productive and indeed the working environment was amazing from the managers, the trainer and stuffs of the company. The benefits also are very great."
good,Cant say enough good or bad about this place the management is a joke they more often than not have no experience in the field that they working in the training staff is fantastic
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"En general ofrece buenos beneficios para sus empleados, en salud 401k."
good,Concentrix is a good job with good benefits. The employees are nice and easy to get along with. The computers and other devices used for daily work could use some update
good,"Enjoyed customers, and co-workers."
good,"Customer Service Representative (CSRs) Phone contact with customers for technical support of iOS and MacOS devices and taking phone sales orders for said products."
good,"They aren't a terrible company, but their pay is low. They don't have great benefits, and due to the nature of the job or their requirements it is a tough job. You don't get treated great."
good,"Healty company, good colleagues, however life balance is not there."
good,"Low wager and little benefits. Needs to adapt a more professional atmosphere."
good,"Good Work Atmosphere. "
good,"really enjoyed the  job., but not much room for advancement .  . need  better  structure  and  not so much  favortism.  but  good place  for those  just starting out ,."
good,it was fun working in this company but some of their goals especially on time limit on attending to a call is very difficult especially if i am talking to an elderly.
good,"On the first part of my employment it was pretty smooth. But when I get to know the management it seems that I understand how they manipulate the employees. In terms of bonuses, they promised bonuses to be given on a specific time but there has been a lot of delay of almost a month and sometimes it take 3 months for us to receive, which is very demotivating. Another thing is how they manage to have more employee when employees doesnt fit in the floor anymore. It is salary impacting since you will be force to go home early just for others to take a seat."
good,"A typical day at work was high-call volume with customers calling in to make a payment on their insurance or ask about doctor/physician referrals. I learned another way of communication skills and excellent customer service. The management there was very unorganized and everyone tried to be the ""Boss"" even though it was only 1 person running the floor. My co-workers were nosey and talkative people who did not mind their own business."
good,"Was good to have worked here but,need to be very cunning to grow, working hard will never get recognised so no use trying to work hard."
good,The company is not the best i have worked for but also not the worst. The hours are good but the work is not as good. There is no support from higher management but the managers will try their hardest to find a solution to your problem
good,"I personally did not stay at this job very long, due to illness during the training period. However, what I did experience during my time of employment at Convergys was enjoyable. "
good,It was a customer service job for DirecTV. I liked it for my first customer service job. The people were nice and they had competitions where you could compete and win prizes once a week depending on your stats. It was rewarding at times when you could make the customer happy.
good,"Good for freshers keento learn new technologies"
good,Workplace is too stressful and its really not employee centered company and it requires OT everyday. I hope they change the way they treat their employee
good,"helping others. not a bad company to work for thank you. not much to say it was a call center taking inbound calls helping customers with product knowledge and ordering, and complaints."
good,"High pressure job with minimum rewards. Love the people I work with, the company does not value talent. If your willing to put in lots of time its a great place to learn the field."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Learned many skills such as troubleshooting and questioning.   Responsible for customer service, staff coaching and enhancement as well as new hire training."
good,A lot of immaturity coming from some of the management and staff/people actually get into fights there/Very hard as well to get help around there when you needed it/Escalation team did not want to answer their chat and several times I had to walk back to their desk to get their attention and they were on their phones.
good,"There is no room for improvement, all the employees are complaining. It is a good place to work if you want to work there temporary."
good,"A typical day at work consist of managing a classroom of new hired agents, while training them on customer service skills.my co-workers always helped each other in any way we could. The hardest part of my job was working with upper management organizing the day. The most enjoyable part was seeing my students excitement learning new skills."
good,"Basically i loved this job except for their attendance policy. They are using the point system. I became ill about 2 months after I started working there, even with a legitimate doctor's excuse I was still given points for all the days missed due to my illness. So if you become ill or you have children that become ill, you will most likely lose your job."
good,"A typical day was to service my customers and balance and manage my work load.  I had aggressive customers which I enjoyed working with and for.  Everyday was a complete challenge that I would overcome.  My work team and technical management team were so accommodating and knowledgeable.  With me being remote away from the core team it made it difficult to stay on the same playing field.  The hardest part of the job was staying current with today's technology and getting the proper training.  I persevered and accomplished my goals,  The most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction and no outages."
good,Management was available to answer all questions and assisted staff and customers at the time needed for best customer service for staff and clients.
good,"This was my first time working in a call center. The training was fun but the real thing was exhausting. I was able to learn multi-tasking and improving my English. Management was ok, but they had an environment were those with the most connections were given the most attention. Hardest part of the job was of course the long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job were weekends and end of shift."
good,"Answered calls and helped solve customer issues with billing, tech, and sales also offered them specials on new programming."
good,The one place I love the most in the company was the sleeping quarter area which is very comfortable. The recreation area is very accessible as well
good,"lots of campaigns to work on pay was very low compared to the amount of work they require."
good,"It is a nice place to gather experience with working at a call center, however longevity is not always guaranteed. For 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, you are required to be available to handle customer inquiries and resolve issues. Most people I saw liked to play pingpong to pass the time on break or lunch."
good,I start at 4 am shift up to 12 noon.I have learned that this is not a career job and your expandable once your not hitting your goals.The management is not that good He resign from his post due to many conflicts.My co-workers are normal people who has fantasy over other humans.The hardest part of this job is that you talk too much and get sick permanently.Nothing is enjoyable about this job.We only work here to get pass our monthly obligations in life.
good,The salary is very low but the people are very friendly and helpful. The culture is like we are family and it is like there is no competition.
good,"Cyber One Building infront of SM North and Trinoma gives me a goodview of the Metro Manila Traffic :D"
good,It is an ok place to work. There are great supervisor. They take pride in their work. I enjoyed the environment but not the extra work that was not needed.
good,"Cool Ambiance, friendly co-agents and very good Pantry. Not good in Commissions and salaries."
good,"The job consisted of coming in, and trying to find a place to sit. There was no assigned seating, and you were only there to place a band aid on the situation"
good,"You start with little sleep, gets blamed a lot of times, gets shouted at as expected but still needs to perform as required."
good,its one of the best companies in the Philippines. Working everyday can be fun with the right motivation. I learned that patience plays a very important role in every position and or job. Management always try to make the workplace a better place to work. Convergys culture is the best in the making.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"The compensation for the amount of work expected is low, however the benefits offered are very good. The hourly rate of pay most employees cannot afford the offered benefits."
good,"Wish I would have never moved so I didn't have to quit this job. This is a leg it work from home hourly based pay job. Working from your own home, computer answering calls from a call center environment."
good,"as a customer service associate you have to attend to all of your customer needs and give them a quality of service that our company is offering, to meet their expectation and help them regarding with their problem in our services, even sometimes they are irrate you have to emphatize and be patient talking to them because our customer is our first priority, and i learned that you have to work hard and be patient to succeed in your chosen endeavor, respect and treat your co-workers as your family to build a good relationship."
good,"Working at Minacs is very challenging. Most of the customers that contact are not very happy with the vehicle that they bought and usually take it out on the agent that picks up the phone. Minacs makes it very hard to get assistance, and the lack of training makes it difficult to complete the job. Customers get very upset because of the lack of knowledge that an agent is able to provide the proper assistance the customer made need. As an agent working for Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge and RAM it is very frustrating to work for, for these reasons I would not recommend this job to others due to the lack of training they provide to the agents."
good,Great people with opportunities to progress. I have learned a number of data and account management qualities whilst being here.
good,I would not mind going back to work here in I HAD to. The workplace is stressful and the supervisors make it worse. Most of the team leaders feel they can talk and treat yo any kind of way.
good,"System has and always will be broken- they should have created a new program instead of working off one made by a company who went under. There are a lot of great people that work there, but if you arent part of the ""family"" prepare to stay stuck in the hierarchy."
good,"Low pay for the responsibility placed on agents, promotions based on popularity rather than performance or experience."
good,"I was an tech support agent for Comcast Cable Company, Through Convergys call center. I answered Inbound calls and also made outbound calls in needed."
good,Job was easy but the tools prevented almost anyone form doing their job in time so did not get overloaded. Management was not helpful cause knew tools were bad and did not care and expected productivity.
good,All I did was answer inbound calls of upset customers that had trouble with their bills and answer any kind of questions they might have. Most of the managers were good and they wanted you to do good. The bad part of the job is listening to all the customer yelling at you and wants to take you to court.
good,"It was great but not that consistent, meaning when it comes to their coaching ,it seems that they are by the book. that's it."
good,I did a lot of  troubleshooting and selling products as well. I learned how to use eight different programs sometimes more at the same time. This was something different for me so I learned a lot and I liked it I loved the over time and I had great co-workers. The hardest about the this job is the time crunch we had less then ten minutes to fix the customer's issues and sometimes their issue would become issues or they had a lot of different issues to begin with.
good,"clock in, and receive calls from costumers concerned about their at&t products, take payments, answer any and all questions the customer may have and assist them with upgrading any product they currently had"
good,"Convergy's was a great foot-in-the-door and introduction to a team based business environment. "
good,fine short-term job for college students etc who aren't committed to being there long-term anyway or for those looking to climb the corporate ladder.  requires huge investment of ambition and sacrifice of other life priorities
good,"Answering emails about users having problems and issues on their computers, tablets, and other devices. I enjoyed with my workmates."
good,Answer calls for people with accounts at USBank and help them with their questions and some of their problems related to their USBank accounts.
good,I worked at bank of america project for about 9 months.  I learn a lot more about how credit works and how does your credit card works differently from normal bank accounts.
good,I liked working with my team and meeting new people from different walks of life. My co-workers where the best part of the job. Management needed more training and was the hardest part of the job. I learned every unhappy customer i could always send away happy.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"This is a place where someone can hone their skills, although they need improvement in terms of benefits, performance bonus for their agents and supports."
good,"I liked the job, the people were nice, easy to get along with. The pay was decent for working at home but objectives constantly changed. Willing to recommend was important always but some times handle time was more important and there is no enough staff to support the chain through which one must go through to complete a call, Sometimes calls end up being longer because you must wait on someone else to respond in a chat, but then you get in trouble because your calls went long. Also, you could never seem to leave work at end of shift because you were not allowed to log off phone until shift was over by that time you had another call and was past end of shift,"
good,"Handling calls everyday is okay but handling irate customers is not fun. Some would mock you but you need not to take it personally cause if you do, you lose. Co-workers are fun to be with."
good,"Occasionally would wipe out half the staff, including members that had given the company 10+ years. Leadership had changed and became rather vulgar. District Manager was quoted with inappropriate  descriptions of the employees, as confirmed by co-workers and managers themselves."
good,Great supervisor was good at listening and understanding the employees.Did his job well would work with you to help you improve and gave advice on areas that could improve your sales and customer relation. Come in to my job sign in to my computer start taking calls.Supervisor would arrive and start motivating us to make sales by either incentives or positive reinforcement. co workers would be willing to help you out with any questions and mostly had a positive attitude. Hardest part of the job was getting the sale it was a scripted sales pitch. You were not allowed to variate from the script. Most enjoyable part were how positive my co workers were around me always able to answer or assist me with any questions regarding my position
good,They threw out my personal belongings in the trash can while cleaning out all of the employees lockers. I was not pleased at all with how they handled the situation .
good,Paid training and plenty of bonuses. Doesn't really work with school schedules the way they say they will. Adds mandatory overtime to everyone's schedule regardless of availability.
good,"Working for Convergys has its moments. The money was okay, but the atmosphere was pretty calm. It could get pretty loud at times, and that distracted many of the workers while they were on calls. All in all, if I could work for the company again in the future, I would."
good,"Overall, Convergys was a great place to work. It really depended on the account you were working for and the management on that account. For the most part, I worked with/for some really great people."
good,"the work envirament is good but lacking leadership, and they do treat you good but when you need help they walk away.the best part about the place is getting new friends and working beside my colleagues."
good,"Convergys is a call center. You will be answering phones nonstop all day long, but compensation is pretty good and they'll hire just about anyone. They also offer overtime for anyone who is willing."
good,I like that the day went by fast because the calls were non-stop the people I worked with were very friendly hardest part of the job was being yelled at by customers when the problem was not something I caused
good,"This is an inbound call center with no breaks between calls. Training needs to be extended for the amount of information required to handle inquiries. The pay is very low compared to similar positions with other companies. There is room for advancement, but that is mainly due to the high turnover rate. Some of the promotions do not include a pay raise, but rather just a change in job title and responsibilities. "
good,I would say that job loads are not that easy. We do tons of jobs and I think their pay are quite low. Mangement are okay. The company invests on good employee benefits.They are fair when it comes to sanctions.
good,I made lifelong friends working at Convergys. I enjoyed learning something new each day and helping customers with issues and educating them on the issue and resolution. There was so many shifts to choose from that it suited any living situation you had.
good,The job is easy the difficult part would be the scheduling its on a bid type basis so you could literally go from working 8-4 to closing 3-11 thats the only part that was unpleasant
good,Concentrix has been my first experience in a call center. I am so grateful they had opened the door for me to be part of the team. I have seen them grow from a small backyard location to a global enterprise. EXCITING!!!
good,"If you are have a condition or disability where you can't climb stairs, this is not the place for you (Odgen, Ut site)The building is a multi floor building without elevator access. Meetings are held upstairs and if you can not climb stairs, you can not attend and they are not other meetings held on the lower level for those who can't access the second or third floor."
good,I had never done customer service phone work before and I liked it except the fact that they were telling us to give the customers mistruths at times just to get them to stay with AT&T
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"This company has great people working for it but it is very stressful for a single mom."
good,The typical day working with Convergys's was a balancing act.  The split shift take some getting use to but other then that the job was enjoyable working from home.
good,management not at all what they say they are they mslead you and tell you false information.  Would not recommend at all...
good,On the ATT side it's a handful of stress that you have to deal with on a daily basis. Not worth it if you cant handle pressure.
good,"The job itself wasn't a bad job. The upper management was hard to deal with. "
good,"A typical work day at convergys would be coming in to work not a 1 min late or you will get a referral. Immediately sitting down at your desk and start pounding out numbers for 8 hours straight, with two 15 minute breaks and one 30 minute lunch break. Wash, rinse, repeat for 5 days out the week until the weekend."
good,"It is an interesting place to work. The project i am working is new enough that there are occasionally hiccups with the pay and the recording of hours. I enjoy my co-workers, it is a welcoming place to work. The coaching is very hands on and personal. The management does try to take the time to get to know you."
good,"This was a pretty good company to work for, but the compensation was not very good. Flexible schedule and they valued family time."
good,"work is easy and you will get nice salary however due to long shifts you would be left with no time for social life. Also, no job security there."
good,"I moved out of state and tried to transfer locations. HR was very nonchalant about the transfer. Made me assume it would be very simplistic. Literally you apply for the job at the different location, and even though you are already working for the company they dont give you any preference over other applicants."
good,The job was very simple and self explanatory  I  took Inbound calls for Direct T.V.  such as answering customers question and or helping them with either adding the product to account or taking it off plus adjusting there bill if it was high.  My co-workers were nice and my direct supervisor was enjoyable to work with.  The hardest part about the job was the roamers they would yell while we were calling our customers. The most enjoyable thing about the job was when I sold the product for the company I would get incentive or a bonus.
good,"WAH project at Convergys is very beneficial, no fighting traffic to get to work. There are really great people within the company."
good,"Customer and technical services is the main heart of our everyday life at the operations. We make sure that our customers are fully satisfied with the product and services that we provided. And the basis of our services is through our customer value metrics that are generated from the satisfaction survey of our customers. Through these, we can measure the efficiency of each and every associate that we have for the company. As a Team Leader my main responsibility is to ensure  that my associates are performing based on our company's mission and vision. It is part of my responsibility as well to provide a skills and behavioral feedback and development with each and every associates that i handle."
good,"Go in, talk on the phones for several hours about the same stuff over and over again until you can't take it anymore and quit."
good,"If customer service is what you are into, than this is a good job. Extensive paid training, great managers. Customers can be hard to handle be that is ok. this is an inbound phone customer service job. min wage start but can move up, and decent benefits."
good,"Only a good job to gain call center experience.  Management was unprofessional, HR is never there, and training does not teach you anything."
good,"This was a very fast paced environment that I did enjoy.  Work days went by very quickly.  However, the biggest complaint is that all supervisors, upper management were around the age of 30 and if you were older, you were never considered for advancement no matter how well you performed you job duties.  The most enjoyable part of the job was definitely my co-workers.  I did learn better time management skills- almost down to the second."
good,"My work day was being on the phone for over 7.5 hours. I learned how to tune in on my Customer Service skill, how to calm an Irate customer and resolve each and every issue with smile through the phone hear a smile. Able to understand the the details the customers  are informing about and resolving each issue without management involvement if possible. Management was decent and knowledgeable. Coworkers were knowledgeable as well and good to work with. The hardest part was trying deescalate a customer that didnt want resolve the issue but do nothing more then to vent. The most enjoyable thing about my job is making customers happy."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"the nature of the job was routine, I learned management as a supervisor, It was so hard to handle hard headed technicians, the hardest part of the job is when your staff or your does not follow/obey your instructions and requirements."
good,"its a good first time call center job, very easy work to do, Very easy to learn make sure u use your tools and resources, co workers I has where no too bad  management  was so so  not much to say about them  hardest part of the job is dealing with management  what I love about my job was it was fun  learned alot"
good,"Work here is not hard, however internal management lack communication to the point where support professionals knew more about day to day and changes in the works than the team leads. Company plays favorites and does not reward employees for seniority nor work ethic"
good,"A typical work day I would at least 500 calls in the que. Working in a call center environment for over 5 years taught me patience and outstanding customer service skills so that i could have a successful call with individual customers. The management wasn't up to par at all and was unorganized, I loved my co workers not only did i enjoy working with them, we all helped each other. The hardest part of my job....there was no hard part I aced everything with the guidance of my team coach! The most enjoyable part was when I sold over 250 products in one work day."
good,Working culture was good but management was pathetic and were doing partiality. Transport was pathetic. Solution never came from management on time. Only came for loving ones. HR & BHR including with Team lead and Manager was not good. Overall I never recommend anyone to job in Convergys.
good,"the pay was decent. Mandatory overtime was random, and you couldn't count on bonuses. People were nice, managers weren't understanding. All in all though, it was a good place to work."
good,"A typical day at work for 6-7 hours: Daily logins at home. Always on the phone talking to customers and only 2 10 breaks with no lunch. The calls are either coming in constantly or sometimes there are slow days where customers calls don't come in every 10-20 minutes (not often). Lots of pressure to get sells and weekly performance with your team lead. Must maintain 15% sells or they will fire you (this is hard to do)."
good,The company is nice. I have learned how to work in the worst situation. Handling client escalations so learned how to react in the bad situation. If needed then also working for 13 hours in a day.
good,i have learnt there how to communicate to costomers and solve their problems. management issatisfactory. this work is harmful to ear and eyes.
good,"the shiftting schedule is good, easy to embrace, my team is good and fun to be with, but the management is really not that open, they are just after the sales..."
good,Over all I took away from this employer is how not be just a manager but the difference in becoming a leader. This allowed me to drive performance in my team member which lead to them advancing in the company.
good,"I worked inside a call center, loved my job and my coworkers but the people taking calls had a seemingly very rough time. Low management visibility and not much room for growth in this particular center."
good,"A typical day at work starts with your team leader yelling thru chat and everyone fighting for their jobs. "
good,I thought this position would be exciting because it was working with OnStar. The most interesting part was I got to communicate with celebrities. With all equipment having flaws the system sometimes was a nightmare sending people in circles which was a horrible outcome.
good,"Working at Convergys is such a privilege to anyone especially for me as a newbie in BPO world.  The training we had for the account is such fun because we have gained not just knowledge but also friendship amongst us is there especially during exams and mock calls that we had.  The hardest part of the job starts during transition period wherein we are already on the floor taking real calls.  I don't even know how to use the avaya and we had fun especially when the customers we have are already irate.  Overall, it takes such knowledge and hard work to be with Convergys.."
good,"I think that the company is a good company to work for, but they need to do better with the attendance policy."
good,"The company I work for have sites in different locations. The Site I report to is in Quezon City, Eastwood. As far as facilities go, it's well maintained, regulated, and the employees are well taken care of. There are some lapses occasionally, but these are faults hardly worthy of being pointed. "
good,"no typical day at work"
good,"A typical day at Stream/Convergys is showing up and taking calls from customers calling in about billing problems, among other issues involved with their cable account. My manager has always been great with helping make sure I reach any goals performance wise. I learned how to handle difficult customers in a professional manner."
good,"I took the job because I needed to find work, and it wasn't bad to begin with. I had paid training and enjoyed my training manager, but the hardest part of the job came after. You begin on third shift, working 3 pm to 11pm, or later. You have to work your way up through statistics that can't always be helped, and management isn't always helpful to employees looking to move up or to get a better schedule."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"My typical day at work is to check and complete the pending work and then schedule the work plan for the day."
good,Working on the phone with customers helped me to have a better attitude with when talking with someone with the same job. My co-workers in the beginning were more like a family we stuck together and helped each other out from day one of training until we split up into other groups when we reached the main floor. We still kept in touch even today and each of us got to meet more helpful co-workers when we had to change teams.
good,"Have worked both from home and brick and mortar centers."
good,"you do get to learn good people skills, objection handling and the opportunity to build your confidence even if this kind of sales job is not really for you."
good,"Extremely busy work schedule"
good,"A typical day at Convergys was very busy, always on a task helping a customer. My co-workers were friendly and helping.  The most enjoyable part of the job was fixing a customers problem and hearing the happiness in their voice."
good,"The job was very fast paced,  you never knew what to expect on a call and good customer service skills were an asset. It became stressful but once you competed the call it was a good feeling to know you helped someone."
good,"little to no job security, no pay increase, favoritism, and drama"
good,I would sign into my desk check all required emails and reach out to me fellow team members and agents ask if anyone had any questions or concerns but what I learned from management and co-workers is that everyday has it own challenges and problems so I used all resources to make sure I corrected those issues within company guiedlines
good,"My day comprised of talking to health care professionals about claims, benefits, eligibility & contracting issues.  I learned that I could talk on the phone and work a computer at the same time.  The best part of the job was the people I met on the phone everyday & the people that I worked with.  The hardest part of the job was knowing what some people in the world were going through health wise.  The management were okay. "
good,"Convergys is a great entry level job for people trying to gain call center experience. However, it is an unstable place of employment. The benefits are ok and the commission is acceptable. If trying to get promoted, its easy as long as your stats are ok."
good,I enjoyed my job but the drive to and from work was costly and taxing on me. The compensation for the job and lack of advancement opportunities didn't warrant a household move to the area.
good,"A typical day started at 7am. 2 breaks in a day. Talked on phone with selected people. Typed information into computer for clients. I enjoyed my immediate tl,  was great, not so much with her boss. I learned patience at this job. My coworkers were generally nice. The hardest part of the job was not being able to talk to coworkers and it became not as enjoyable to work there. I did like it when we could get together and hash out problems with each other."
good,"On my  second day in Canada, my friend took me to Convergys where he used to worked, after series of tests and interview I was hired. Our one month training (8 hours a day and 5 days per week) started, it was the most comprehensive and extensive training I ever had, the trainers were experts and well qualified for the job we had lots of workshops and mockup sessions to make sure that when we hit the floor we start our job like a seasoned professional from the day one. The job was very demanding we had to be on our toes all the time the salary was around $ 11/hr. which seems much less for the hard work. But for the company it was the other way around they outsourced the work and opened a new Centre in Philippines and our Mill bourn Mall Centre was closed and I got laid off. Other Convergys Centres are still open in Canada. This type of job is nice  if you want to polish your conversation skills, improve your listening comprehension and work place time management and efficiency. I'd recommend this job to new comers in the job market."
good,all you do is sit around answering phone calls making a customer happy within 12 mins
good,"The call center floor is really ghetto, a lot of rude ghetto people. A lot of times I would come into work and have no seat to take my calls the company is very unorganized and hires just about anyone. The times are ridiclous and their refusal to work with an school schedule is so poor"
good,A typical day at work begins at 2:00AM. I was responsible in handling inbound calls of Citibank customers who had problems in their accounts. This was a very tiring job since most customers would call in and have irate concerns. I learned that handling these customers would be easier if I kept calm and serious in my job. The management of Convergys is fair and I have friendly co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the time my work starts. The most enjoyable part is bonding with my colleagues.
good,"Working at convergys was a good experience far as being new ,the longer you are there u will find out that  after your training you will not any help from mangement or floor support with a issue with a customer or when they feel like helping you.the schedules to come in   to work are to random for me"
good,"this is a great place to work , they have wonderful team work ,and always looking for ways to improve the site overall"
good,"Concentrix, Corp, is the SYNNEX BPO subsidiary that aims at diversifying an already great company.  That said, Concentrix is growing at a break-neck pace, and can sometimes fall victim to its own successful."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"- take in calls from US "
good,"challenging environment, lots to learn, I enjoy working there"
good,"I worked at Minacs for a year and a half, and I loved it. Then, one day, they told me I was being forced into a new position that I wasn't comfortable with. They gave me no notice, I was told on Friday that I would start training on Monday. "
good,"The management were not pro active in supporting you or providing ongoing training with regard to the campaign you worked on,I had five different line managers in 14 weeks and they were not interested if a change in your working hours affected your home work balance."
good,Advisor for call center in the GM Tech Center where I Assisted all customer who purchased OnStar  products and services that were equipped in and for their vehicles.
good,"*login and check the call flow"
good,A typical day at work was hectic but enjoyable. I enjoy my cowokers and the people more than anything.
good,enjoyed the work but it the company didnt care about costumer service.
good,"The best thing about working for Convergys is the incredibly lax and flexible attendance policy. While it can be difficult to land the exact shift you want with their bid system (based off both metrics and seniority) it is usually very easy to find someone to switch schedules with or cover you for planned days out when you have no PTO built up. As far as sick time and UTO, Convergys offers a standard rate of building PTO per hour worked that was very comparable to what I have seen else where. Their attendance policy is a points accrual, with what seems to be the standard policy for gaining and removing points- you gain .25 for being late/leaving early up to an hour, .5 from an hour to 4 hours, and 1 for anything more, an NCNS is 2 points, and you gain .25 point back for having no attendance issues for 30 days. What was very different than anywhere else I have worked, where the max points you can receive before being fired ranges from 2-5, Convergys allows you 12 points. Basically, you can take a day every 31 days and never point out."
good,A great place to work and strictly follows the corporate ethics. But sometimes the policies of Aditya birla and Lenovo had clashes and  Looking for new challenges in a new environment.
good,"Convergys is a great company to work for if you enjoy being alone and only getting negative feedback. A typical day goes as follows:"
good,"Good place to work, but low pay, most supervisors would help you reach goals, other will give you a bad criticism."
good,"I learned to work with a diverse group of people and thoroughly enjoyed that experience.  I also learned leadership skills and technical programs that helped me advance in the organization,"
good,"The job overall was not a bad job but the management isn't that great, nobody cares about the workers unless your doing something you're not suppose too."
good,"It was fun working from home because I didn't have to deal with traffic, getting up in the cold, trying to find something to eat at lunch.. I liked because it was nice and quiet and no one talking over you like a call center, I love working in the Customer Service field, and would love to do it again whether in call center are home."
good,"I was promoted to a supervisor and it is easy to move up, but after agreeing to a schedule they moved 5 of the agents from my team to midshift, witch they knew that many of us could not work that. they do not care about school, religious, or emergency family issues.  issues."
good,"Good pay and benefits, multiple accounts types for collections, both inbound and outbound calling, small smoking area and break room"
good,This was my first call center job. It was an ok place to get use to the call center environment. Management was not the best at this time.
good,We assist customers by responding to their emails. The hardest part of the job is to get a promotion.
good,You have to get with the right group if you would like to advance within the company taking on higher positions.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Its mainly helping customers with getting there games to run on various platforms. A active and young team to work with and a high variety of problems to solve. The contract I work in is nice get to play some games in the free time in order to help customers better and management team that runs our contract seems to be engaging and open for suggestions to make it a nicer workplace to be at.
good,"Accepting inbound calls, learning the pharmaceutical part of the healthcare industry. The management was disorganized. Co-workers were inconsistent. Hardest part was taking 90+ calls per day. Easiest  part was not dealing with customers face-to-face."
good,"A typical day at convergys is alot of loud and energetic people. I have learned a lot from working with the company whether negative or positive. The management in some cases are awesome along with the co workers, i've met alot of wonderful people. The hardest part about my job is selling, I am not a fan of selling to a customer that insists on saving money. The most enjoyable part is the last second that I spend there to go home and relieve my stress."
good,This call center is very unrewarding. There are no raises to pay. Training is generally poor. What they want you to do contradicts what is required to perform the job.
good,"Easy work, not challenging. Its a good place to work if your not worried about advancing. I've worked in offices where they had a high turnover rate, but this company exceeds that by many. What makes it even more ridiculous is that they tell you before you start, if you don't succeed you will be replaced easily. At first that statement should of red flagged me, but now me and my entire training group of 22 are now unemployed . I would definitely not recommend The Apple project for Conveys. Maybe other projects are good ."
good,"Co-Workers are the best. Management team up against lower level employees. The hardest part of the job was to see team mates not being told which position was seasonal or not. I enjoyed the customers. (Jarden Account). The training didn't prepare for the job. And the rules keep on changing. One supervisor in the department everyone tries to stay away from, but overall ok. Pay is good 10 per hr."
good,"Had a Dynamic work environment as it was Break & Fix Support."
good,"Overall it was an ok company to work for, loved to take the calls most of the time"
good,not that bad for a call centre.  but they tend to fire people without warning and reason.
good,Took incoming phone calls for credit card holders. Therefore we loss our lease and the Pickering location closed.
good,"Typical day consists of being on the phone handling billing inquiries for AT&T project and making sales. I learned a lot about how the AT&T systems work, how AT&T bill their clients, and the technology the use to make the services. The management was not that great. Co-workers were not professional and showed up to work as if they were coming directly from a night out at a club or bar. The hardest part of the job was controlling my time spent on the phone, the customers usually had so many issues with billing."
good,It was pretty standard that you were never good enough. We would receive calls and get our internal ranking hit based on the number of callbacks due to the technician not showing up.
good,"Overall, I love dealing with people so I loved my job. The coworkers and managers were pretty awesome too. The biggest thing that killed it for me was their scheduling system. If you're not in the top 25% ranked in the call center, you will not be able to change your schedule beyond the typical hour/day trades between other agents. They don't care if you want to give up a good schedule for a more iffy schedule that's more convenient for you, they won't do it. If you spend two months in the bottom 55% however, they'll be more than happy to take away your good set schedule and give you a worse one. Best part? I was trying for 6 months to get a later start time; I ended up with an earlier start time. While individual managers may be an exception, Convergys does not care about its employees."
good,Working at Convergys is a huge sacrifice for someone who is use to being around people.  Procedures are constantly changing and you are held accountable. The hardest part of the job is generating sales. They tell you its not important but you have to constantly offer sales in order to meet standards.
good,went in every day just doing my job. the management was good but not enough support on the floor
good,"Train you to be multi -task"
good,Convergys is a good company.  The incentives are great as well as the teams. The only drawback is the hours
good,"I have been there 2.5 years.  Its a very high turn around rate and no room for advancement unless a TL quit or get fired.  THey don't care about your sickness.  If you find someone that can work for you, they cant have more than 40hrs that week and you have to let them know 48 hrs before.  If there is a que and ur sick...they don't care. I work for the express scripts side and the exts and phone #s  to transfer ppl don't work and they don't fix it.  It could be better if the management would do something to fix it.  Greenville Convergys isn't organized as it should be. If you want a job its a good start but its not a career like they say it is.  Human resource will say anything to get u in there."
good,I learned to take of Customers with Good Personal Development Skills
good,"Pathetic Pathetic Pathetic work place,"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Just was like high school just alot of drama. the hardest part of the job was dealing with the childish co-workers.
good,Challenging and frustrating this company has offered opportunities to learn one’s own boundaries whilst developing skills and talents often not fully realized. All about people and the relationships necessary to make operation successful.
good,A typical day at work requires a high amount of coffee or sugar to stay upbeat and alert with the tremendous number of inbound calls with little or no break between intervals.  Customer service is a must but also meeting far flung quotas.  The pay is normal.  You have to work extra hours to make 1 k every two weeks.  Overall this respective company is great for the college student seeking extra cash here and there.  
good,"I did customer service for a wireless provider. They use what feels like a million systems on a typical call. If you've worked at one call center, you've worked at them all. They are not very accommodating to school schedules, which is what lead me to leave. My supervisor seemed to do nothing, but kept telling me she's waiting to get my schedule changes, all while I was accumulating attendance points. There's was not a lot of help from the support staff. "
good,"I enjoy my job. It is a fun enviorment and is like my second family. I learned to communicate well with others and listen to others opinions. We loved to have potlucks for any and every occasion. We work in teams and each team would have a competition daily on our sales and goals. Every day we would have different pizes. We have spirit week for instance, zombie day, beach day and jersey day. I love my job it was a great learnig experience."
good,"My job at Convergys is rewarding when I know I am helping others, whether the customer on my phone or a co worker needing assistance with the job. A typical day is 20-60 calls, many of which are escalated, from customers across the U.S. needing assistance of various kinds with their Directv account. I have learned much about communications skills and being confident at doing what I know. The hardest part of this job is the high stress level and the inconsistency of the scheduling. The most enjoyable part of the job is assisting others on any level. "
good,"everyday is a learnig process, everyday I master the skill to sharpen my mind to resolve customer problems "
good,"Convergys is a place that will provide solid employment. Anyone who wants a steady job with steady pay would do well to apply. As a contact center, turnover is high. This is mostly due to individuals not being willing to work in a contact center for very long. Being in constant phone contact in a customer service role with little or no downtime requires thick skin. This, however, can be advantageous to anyone who needs a job to pay the bills during college or to fill in while in between jobs in their field, assuming that they can handle the type of work. There are almost always opportunities to get hired. "
good,"It was a great experience for me to work from home, and be a colleague of team's members from all USA."
good,When being hired wasn't not told about the stats i would be graded on nor about how sales would become more important than quality of service
good,"taking calls with everyone looking at you to see when you mess up on calls. having to learn how to literally B.S. you whole way.. management not very cooperative whatsoever with schedules, attendance, calls"
good,There was a great working atmosphere until there were more concerns about money being spent so the customer became less of an importance.
good,"Well they want 10 minutes and 20 seconds a call, thats very very hard to do when just trying to get a new locator's address out of them and they spend 10 minutes looking for it. So unfair with the call time."
good,Typical day at work is spent taking calls on the phone to resolve customer issues and retain them for AT&T.
good,The current client is very demanding and offers very little support and expects the Level 1 agent to be able to make major decisions for callers.
good,"Good company with good benefits. Constantly changing and fast paced job. Strong sales environment. Wonderful people to work with. Paid time off, sick days etc. Hardest part of the job is ever changing expectations. Most enjoyable part of the job is building relationships with the people you work with and the events that are offered for occasions. Supports the community by fundraising for charity."
good,"Planned vacations, renewed memberships, handled any needs, wants or concerns of all members."
good,Taking calls for at&t
good,"They were a decent company when they first moved to their new location out by Winnipeg Tech but after the first 2 years things went downhill, bonuses became almost non existent and they didn't seem to care about your time or method of getting to work."
good,The pay isn't much at all but considering that you are working from home its OK. There are always some technical issues with their soft ware and you don't get paid if you aren't in the system and ready to take calls. Some managers are helpful with this issues some aren't.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,The job itself isn't very rewarding since you have to call people and ask them to pay there bills. But the people were fun to work with and the atmosphere was nice.
good,"start the day with customer service answering providers questions on eligibility an benefits for a patient, navigate thru the systems to find accurate information on what the provider is requesting, sometimes back to back calls , i have learned to become very efficient in using different programs and getting accurate information in a timely manner, how ever the hardest part of the job is finding new information that was never acknowledged before, the most enjoyable part of the job is learning how to provide quality customer service and getting coaching and becoming knowledgable every week with improved skills."
good,Need to be more considerate of their employees. Better pay for their employees for the amount of stress and hardships dealing with their customers.
good,"Being the breadwinner for the family is stressful enough, because of my husband's disability. The company has a problem with you if you have family medical problems and can't make it to work or even car problems. If you are a single mom, don't work here."
good,"A typical day at Convergys is Logging in and taking calls. The busiets days are Sundays and Fridays back to back que. I love my co workers the department i work in really feels like a big family. Mangement is ok its just very inconsistant, one manager says one thing and the other says another. The most enjoyable part of my day is dealing with the customers."
good,• Post customer bill payments and handle billing questions and problems
good,The company tents to view you more as number then a person many of the things I liked about the company is no longer there
good,Not that fun of a work place. Always hearing how confused everyone is when working because no one knows what the other is doing on customer acct
good,"I was working with customer service contract for AT&T incoming calls. Excellent training and professional working environment. Managers are under pressure and that is passed down to the floor workers. A lot of management turnover. Overall, a very good company to work for in a call in centre."
good,Diverse atmosphere where a normal day included interaction from coworkers that fullfilled the day of constant repeated problem- solving scenarios.
good,Assist customers with questions about various products and services.
good,its a good job to have but if your looking for a stable company and a better income instead of working pay check too pay check
good,No comments. Bad experience with no work life balance for employees working with Convergys.
good,working there was a totally something else then I thought it was.
good,Poor upper management and not very involved with the lower status employees.
good,This is a job that holds you over till you find something better. They have a high turn over rate.
good,"Accounts Payable, Bank Reconciliations, Accounts Receivable/Cash management operations."
good,"Work at home tech support, taking inbound calls to troubleshoot AT&T Uverse customer technical issues."
good,this is the worst company I have ever work for. They don't care about their employee.. they promise a raise we're never received it not good
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Location had nothing but loud people who didn't take their job seriously and the position i had was worth way more then what i was paid. Hr department helped with issues but team leads never did their job.
good,"I feel once you've worked one project and there's another opening available with your experience, one should be immediately considered for the position,  and be transferred over into the training classes. Instead they make you reapply EVERY time and that takes away from the company's hiring process."
good,It was a good company to work for. Everything happens for a reason. Glad it's over though. No more telemarketing for me. Good luck with that company and their business.
good,"It's Oshawa,  different culture if you aren't used to it. People you work with are generally very nice . Sometimes the incoming callers can be rude but don't take it personally. Was quite a learning experience!"
good,Good for freshers. I don't have any issues except salary..leaves issue..my process management is not as good. My present job is very satisfying so I am working here for 4.6years
good,"Well company is ok...It's the management who runs the show, however Since I was working in Recruitment of cnx must say there is no life balance though we were called HR Of the organization...."
good,"Even you are sick or there is a calamity, they still require everyone to work. Life doesn't matter. Work is what is essential to the company. They do not care if you really feel sick, they will just decide that it is just a thinking you are sick and you can still work."
good,People are chill but bosses have their favoritism and would not acknowledge coaching schedules. Supports are not helpful they will let you learn on your own
good,Exciting place to work.They do have great customer service thanks to us thank you. The training is a little fast also but if you don’t get it just stop take a break ask a question and someone will help you right away
good,"Did not pay enough for the distance that I had to travel the hours were not flexible and I was constantly switching supervisors"
good,Co workers was okay but most supervisors was very rule besides a few it was a pleasure working with them few. The best part of my job was talking to the members and being able 2 help them out.
good,"Was great at first, but found that no one was on the same page as far as instructions go.  They will work with you if you have any issues, so that was a plus.  This is a place to work when you're young, but not when you're older."
good,It did give me a chance to try a new job and learn more about the 3rd party company I would be working for.  Got to learn things about tracking orders and then scheduling for installing of new equipment on secure government sites.
good,"Low salary 14k basic, all sites are not synchronized. One site will tell you one thing and one site will tell you another regarding the offer stressful"
good,It seems as if this company hires anyone that applies. Work/Life Balance was not ideal. Wages were low. Not much room for growth. Long lunch hour was a plus to take a mental break.
good,Management was good but the job was numbers driven. That cause stress among the employees  . We were held responsible for customers not wanting to accept transfers for rebates rental cars or vacation getaways.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"The work environment is very stressful, as you aren’t only trying too keep the client happy, but Concentrix as well.  When you have more then one company you’re answering too, it starts to overwhelm the management which trickles down to the agents.  Too many new employees were coming in for the client Capital One, thus leaving no computers available for at least 5-10 agents to use between the hours of 11am-4pm Monday-Friday.  You feel more like a number then you do an actual employee."
good,"An Okay place to work depending on your account. With my experience, the account is a little bit hard, but the management is good, but the workplace is a little bit toxic."
good,Compensation could have been better. Individual people were nice. No RAISES EVER!  They were considerate of my disability only I had to have a Doctors note for an obvious physical disability
good,"Hours were consistent, supervisors and managers are great to work with. Laid back atmosphere. Pay wasn't great, however, it is a place I would return to work if I have to."
good,I enjoyed my time at Concentrix although the pay is not enough to live on. Management was very loose and inconsistent. It definitely needs improvement.
good,"The pay is good at $12/hr and they have a 12 point attendance policy. As your tenure level goes up, the more sales (booked vacations) they expect you to have which is fair, but their targets are unreasonable. It's a call center environment much like Elead/CDK Global but the client is different."
good,"I like my current position and would like to continue to work in this field"
good,"Face paced call center environment dealing with various customer needs pertaining to DirecTV."
good,"Training was a hot mess, they barely train me for my job, messy people and they wouldn't approve any of your paid time off but overall its okay I guess."
good,"first thing what we do hone we clock in is sign into our computers and login to all our applications that we use to do our job then ww start taking calls rite away, we have to handle angry customers and try to calm them down,i learned to control my clients no matter how they was on the phone and keep calm and to remember its just my job and left my problems at home.the hardest part of the job was saving customers that left to another company already and getting them to stay with us with the little deals we have with directv,the most enjoyable thing about the job was your co-workers and the good energy they bring everyday to keep you level headed and motivated to do your job."
good,"If you do not mind working nights (5pm-10pm or 12am), then this job would be time beneficial for you. This job requires a lot of sitting and you are not allowed to have anything to pass time such as crossword puzzles or homework. Phone usage is also not allowed. You are required to work either Saturday or Sunday, which the hours vary from the normal  Monday-Friday schedule. A benefit is if you call in, you are not questioned or harassed about WHY you were unable to come in. It is an IVR system and the most you'll be asked is if you are okay."
good,"Lack of sufficient training"
good,This is not for everyone; it is a high volume fast paced call center. it can be very stressful at time. I wouldnt reccomend anyone to work here if you have alot of experience the pay is not worth the amount of work you do
good,"There is no room for advancement if you have accomadations. I was finally told after filling out several Internal applications that I won't get it because of my accomadations. Concentrix has taken over Convergys and they are hiring new people at $2 or 3$ more than what I'm making now. People that has been there for yrs are now making less than newbies. There is nothing to stride for because I have accomadations. So tired of saying same thing over an over on every call and the same script on every call. And if you try to put some spark in script you get marked down on your Call Evaluation form. Past bored at my job and because I have accomadations I'm stuck. So stay and never excel, or start all over."
good,Job is not hard.  Depending on Management if you are able to like the job and feel like you could be successful.  At smaller sites employees might not feel as valued as they would at bigger sites.
good,Concentrix took over Convergys and started to implement the closing of the site I was working at. They created an adversarial atmosphere with the main clients not wanting to do their best to retain them. This was done at multiple sites throughout Concentrix with thousands of people being fired.
good,Management was never on one accord. One person knew everything while others knew nothing. Showed favoritism and that's not right. Had family members working under one another
good,"This can be a very stressful job. However, it all depends on which client you work for. There's favoritism within the company. They say that they're there for you, but when it comes down to it, they are all corporate driven."
good,"Never worked for Concentrix, it was Convergys when I worked there."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Working for Concentrix has been a rollercoaster. Started off good, but then you slow start to see how the job for what it is, who is hired for management, the agents, the people, the work is all kinda sub-par what you’d expect from a professional company to be like."
good,No comment for this job I am not satisfied most employees are not satisfied at this current job it is not suited for everyone here. This is not the job for everyone
good,"Day Shift "
good,"Atypical day includes being on the phone all day assisting customers with issues regarding hardware or software "
good,"Many different projects came and went, they do offer training, however if a project ends and no other projects are hiring, you are let go. Very gossipy working environment. Team Lead are very underpaid, however they are very helpful. Upper Management does not really care about employees, it is all about making the quality scores for the project. Good job to get experience for call centers."
good,"The company could be a fun place to work if they allowed input from the staff and took better care of their employees. The first few months are challenging.  Unless you are friends with someone that has some pull you are not getting promoted with this company.  It is a rather loud environment, as they play music in the background and a few of the managers yell clear across the room."
good,"While I do feel that working at Convergys was financially rewarding, I felt like a prisoner whenever I clocked in. Every second in the work environment was micromanaged. From using the restroom to eating lunch, there was not a moment of joy in those four walls. Training did not inform us of tasks that were basic to those who had been there longer. It really felt like they cut corners and rushed us to the phones instead of teaching us proper call handling. Although I would never ever step foot back in that place, the pay was good for a few months."
good,"I went into this job with high hopes, and excited to try something different. Unfortunately I found out that I am not an individual who likes to be constantly talking and answering call one right after the other with no break within the 5-8 hours you are there working."
good,"Concentrix is a standard business outsourcing company. "
good,"Concentrix is a pleasant place to work.  It is very challenging with many demands to meet metrix, but many impediments to meeting them.  Pay is very minimal."
good,Convergys was a well run Corporation but were purchased in October 2018 by Concentrix who didn't value the experienced resources and ethical practices
good,"Convergys's Sam's Club contract was described by the company as little pressure, that we would have a lot of freedom and flexibility with how we deal with the customers and what we can do to make them happy, that front line would not be a demanding position and that a lot of calls would simply be transfers to the correct department or small value returns. "
good,"Answering 1000 calls per week, common sense job. Co-workers are cool, management and staff are lazy, unmotivated. They accuse you of slacking, not answering your calls, their approach and communication to you is somewhat disrespectful. The scheduling staff can switch up your hours and days off and they expect you to be okay with you."
good,Convergys is a good starter job for a young person but does not sit well with someone who has been employed for more than thirty years. A very repetitive job that can bog one's day down. Reasonable salary for job requirements. The most enjoyable part of the job was colleague interaction.
good,"its a good job overall... the job did teach me a lot how to , great customer service have probably spoken with everyone in the united states I believe its a fun job"
good,"Working at Convergys is the definition of working just for awhile. At first it was fun to work there. The job was interesting, and easy. But the management and the stats are ridiculous. Training is a joke and does not prepare anyone for the floor. All the learning is done through research and on the job mistakes."
good,"I worked for the bilingual team , it is a slower pace than subscriber . Pay is 14 an hour but schedules depend on your work performance. It is open 24 hours"
good,It ain’t all that honestly they don’t pay you on time sometimes the hours are always messed up some managers don’t do they job they except you to do yours though
good,"Upon arrival to work everyone has a small locker to put their purses, bags, phones, and/or snacks in.  Regulations required everyone to not bring anything into the secure work area.  We were privy to private information.  Personal medical information.  I learned about HIPPA and adhered to the policies.  We were allowed to bring a battery AM/FM radio with earbuds to listen to music while we worked. The work was production based.  The company had contracts with a few health insurance companies.  Basically third party office personnel."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"A typical day at convergys, was busy from time you clocked in to time you go home, time went really fast. I learned alot from convergys, i learned how to multi- task very well, time management, and to document detailed notation of every call, management was unprofessional and uncaring, while co workers 90 percent of them were very nice people and fun to work with. the hardest part of the job was working on launch days, when a new product came out and ond every customer was unable to get the new product, because most of the new products were sold to randomly selected customers and all customers could not get the new product, so i would say having to try and explain to the customers why they were not picked in the drawing. The most enjoyable part of the job, was when i was working on the Nike account, learning the history of NIke and learning more about the products i was selling."
good,"It was a customer service management company.  It was okay for awhile, but I prefer a more stable working environment, where I can do a specific job and continue improving my abilities and advancing with the company."
good,If you like sitting down at a desk for eight hours a day without being able to move this is the perfect job for you unfortunately it did not work out for me because I cannot sit still for eight hours and not be able to move with only 215 minute
good,Salary is not enough. The recruitment process took so long. The first salary offered to me was a way different that I have but still I gave all my best to provide an excellent customer service experience to all customers.
good,"I worked at Minacs/ Concentrix for about 9 1/2 years. Early on , I found the management very helpful, but over time when the company changed hands to a foreign ownership, the management became less helpful, benefits were trimmed and it became harder to get anywhere in the company. The job culture , although overall positive seemed to be at odds with the management a lot."
good,"- Friendly Environment"
good,The management at the company is weak and unprepared.  Management doesn't try to support team well enough with deadlines and goals. Too many generic meetings that don't accomplish anything.
good,I was unable to work after getting pregnant. Too bad paid maternity isn't guaranteed for an employee that's been there for 5 years. Not enough FMLA to cover pregnancy complications.
good,Could be a good job for a college student. Call centers are not career jobs.  One must work within the company rules.  Not much creativity or thinking outside of the box.  You are working for corporations not for the customer on the other end of the phone.
good,"I did not work at this company for long, S0, I don't feel comfortable giving a review.  I was fast paced calls one right after another, which did not bother me, I like to be busy.  There was alot of back ground noise while your on the phone.  I did enjot talking to the client they were from all over.  Nice to talk to someone ouside of my location.   Management was a little disorganized, very unconsistant, hard to follow roles when there changing from day to day, person to person.  Overall the pay as good andI love talking to people."
good,Supervisors are friendly and easy going. The hardest part is making sure you have all of your notes done during the call and having to deal with frustrated customers every now and then.
good,"Managers did not know anything about the product, or what to do in certain scenarios, always demanding extra work, almost had to begged for my holidays."
good,"The problem with this is the company is they don't rehire. the company always wants to stay in a safe place. Even an employee worked so hard for a year and resign the job with a notice period, they don't wish to rehire. They dont give any proper explanation. thats very bad"
good,"Starting my day right is very important especially working in a call center. I personally have to be cool and collected to be able to provide better service. Continuous calls and none stop inquires are what compromises a typical work day. During my experience, I learned self restraint, confidence, team work and call handling. How to react to different kinds of personalities and inquires is important when working with people one does not see. During the day, one gets to experience highs which include good short calls and my favorite would be when it is avail (no calls coming in) and some days we experience our lows, where there are inquiries even the supervisor cannot handle."
good,"If you use good work ethic...being prompt, do your job as you have trained to do your job, it is a very simple job as customer service.  It is a very fast paced environment after training has been complete."
good,"typical day at concentrix (minacs while I was employed) dragged on from start to finish unless you blurred your time between calls with some mundane task like colouring. You answer incoming calls and speak to people who more often than not, would prefer not speaking to you at all."
good,"Convergys is a great for someone who does not have small children, newly weds, medium-high mortgage payments,etc. The hours change every three months due to schedule bidding based on performance metrics. The pay keeps one living pay check to paycheck and the really aren't any raises. Its a job."
good,"I had wonderful coworkers, it was like a family there but some team leads weren't so nice and only talked to you about where you were in your work or if you needed help."
good,"Rien n'est plus décevant qu'une entreprise qui ne souci pas des rapport de pouvoir entre employé.Les gens en générale y étaient sympathique, mais l'éducation de certains laissait à désirer."
good,"El training y las personas que se conocen son excelentes, pero el trabajo es demasiado para el salario."
good,The company will help you grow as an individual and also grow in terms of reaching your desired career. The most challenging part of working in this company is to work under pressure to meet client’s needs or requirements.
good,Work environment did not seem stable at the time.  Job task was fine.  Supervision could have been better.  Minacs was the company that I was employed by.
good,Convergys was a good job. The training classes were really effective and they really did give us enough time to adjust and transition at a great paste. Me personally wouldn’t go back to that location because it seems as if the management plays favoritism a lot.
good,"Can join to kick start your career. Don't stay thinking for career or financial growth.typical management who does not know the difference between utilize, use and exploit..  you will mostly be used.. don't expect returns for that.. in some cases exploit but never utilize.."
good,"Management allowed way too much stuff to go on right under their noses. People acting like children, teasing others right on the production floor ,doing drugs in the parking lot, fighting in the lunch room. "
good,I was one of the people that was down sized from Convergys along with 1500 other IT workers.  With no job security and much back stabbing I was happy to have been let go.  It was not a great environment to work in.
good,"kaum Aufstiegsmöglichkeiten, nur Mindestlohn. guteProjekte"
good,"Working at Concentrix has been relatively interesting. "
good,Pros
good,"A typical day at work was sit at a desk that wasn't your own.  You go to lunch and you would have to log in to another computer.  Worked in fast paced environment taking inbound calls to service clients. Workplace culture was to come in, do your job and keep your stats within company guidelines.  The hardest part of the job was to never get recognition for a job well done.  Definitely not an easy place to move up.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the interactions with the people and the customers on the phone,."
good,"Good place to get your feet wet, learned alot in a short amount of time when it came to dell computers and servers.great group of people on my crew. Management was good"
good,"There was always a game of Super Smash Brothers to be had. And we had cool Xboxes in the lounge of the microsoft floor. Lots of fallout iv to be had, as well."
good,Our market for jobs in call centers here is really tapped out. Quality hires were hard to come by and it was reflected in the culture and people who worked there. I was on a good contract but there was NO chance to advance even with my advanced skill set.
good,TL's need to be consistent in coaching and working with their associates.  There isn't consistency between programs and OM's.  A lot of conversations happen on the floor that shouldn't happen.
good,"This was a nice place to work. However, sales goals were unrealistic. Management was not the greatest. The job offered paid training. It was 3 weeks of paid training, which was very fair and I left the training feeling informed and like I could do my job. I do feel as if, the job was a bit misleading when it came to the hours that i was hired for versus the hours they change it to once I was hired."
good,"Overall, a nice job to develop some awesome skills. Wouldn't make it a permanent career. Work has very little consistency. Things always change as soon as you become accustomed to them, so its difficult to develop healthy work patterns."
good,"Convergys has been a strong powerhouse in the BPO industry for well over 30 years. The people I personally have worked with have been amazing, great teachers and they promote a strong work ethic. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Working at Concentrix was interesting at first and working for the company will only go as far as the client would like. The job really pressures Speed over Quality for supporting customers. Working with HR is a nightmare most issues that should be able to be solved are referred to a support line Nothing more annoying than a Customer service rep having issues with a pay check and having to call customer service about it.
good,Environment is quite interesting and the Work Place is kinda relaxing. Will surely miss the place though. Management is also okay. I learned a lot in our training.
good,"I enjoyed my time at this company, the staff was very friendly and welcoming which was ideal as id never worked in a busy call centre before, the work was nice and easy too, simply booking appointments with existing customers."
good,Ensuring that all incoming telephone calls are answered in a professional and timely manner.
good,convergys is very unorganized half of its work population are teens coming out of high school. the dress code and behavioral conduct of  the company was horrible. they were consistently changing mangers
good,"I loved my actual job and helping people. The environment can be fun and very easy to work in, but management is the worst I've ever experienced in any call center. The favoritism is a joke. It doesn't matter how hard you work, how dedicated you are, how high your ratings are, if you aren't ""best buddies"" with the right people your job won't last. I worked on the Turbo Tax account and during busy season, the money is good and the days fly by, but off season (if you even get chosen to stay) your pay is cut way down and hours are also cut."
good,"From being on one program to finding out the company has lost their contract and you have a choice to move to the next company or find another job within the next 4 weeks. Having to re-interview for a program that your company is also running and have to compete again for the hours that you want to work was an absolute disaster. No paid maternity leave. The management always had word and that was ""I can't do that"" it was nothing that she could do or even tried to. best part of working there was all the different people you meet and opportunities."
good,Concentrix is a challenging but an enjoyable account as acall  center  company because of its training offered and qualified officers that really help every agent who are coming in the company.
good,"it pays nicely but its not worth the amount of stress you encounter at work. "
good,Cool place to work at and had a great experience. There are challenges while working but the crowd and the mentors are helpful. In short you'll find the help you just need to ask for it
good,"Concentrix is my first BPO job and I owe a lot of things from them. Working with Concentrix enhanced my critical thinking skills, patience, understanding, working under pressure and the hardest part of the job would be encountering irate callers. Their workplace has a fun and lively environment although they don't pay much."
good,"Through my time working at Convergys I have worked on two projects, Directv, now RCI.  On Directv it was customer service oriented and I was always in the top 10%.  RCI is sales oriented and is a bigger challenge.  One has to balance customer service, and sales in order to maintain ones job, and it is heavily lopsided on the sales side.  I have been able to achieve some balance, and we  are given time to improve, however at first it was sink or swim.  Management has been improving on coaching and working with agents to improve their ability to meet the goals put before us.  Though the improvement is rarely met with any satisfaction, until everything is green, and the feeling of being underappreciated for the work that you do has become the normal.  The people I have worked with have been some of the hardest working, nicest people that try to fulfill their days goals while still keeping a positive outlook on life.  They inspire me to try harder and be better."
good,Great place if your new to the networking field. Not so great when it comes to promotions and raises. From the time of hire its pretty much as good as its going to get.
good,"i really didnt have a good work experience there at all, drama everywhere, just a very unconformable environment. Bad thing bout it is that you dont have to be involved with anything thats going on to get the a bad vibe."
good,Standard call center.  Hours were available at ok pay.  Location in Dartmouth closed and forced a lot of people out of work.   Customer service is an acquired taster.
good,The work pace is very hectic and stressful. Managers with attitude issues and not honest. Has questionable work ethics.Exceptional training program but a exceptionally high employee turnover. Would be a good place to be employed if upper level management had better control over how their supervisory staff supervise.
good,The time I worked at convergys I was pregnant with my two year old. Very high risk. My Dr put me on a strict schedule working a min of 20 hours and a Max of 30 my shift on as from 4:30-1am. Convergys did not apply with these orders and nothing was done until I was putting my two weeks notice in then they were able to try to do something but by then better opportunity had came for me.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Convergys is an international company and the number one in BPO industry. It is well-known for having a tough recruitment process but that does not stop me.  I want challenging jobs for me to learn in different areas.
good,"started out good in training learned how to handle technical issues in trouble shooting, got on the floor to actually start taking care of customers issues after getting stuck on a call management came to help after 20 minutes. The hardest part was not being able to resolve customer issues and the enjoyable part was was the help i got from the friends i met around me."
good,"The management is kind to its employees and everyone is friendly. Has good pays and benefits like you will get HMO, no split days off, you will get your salary on time,no delays and no disputes."
good,"had a wonderful break room with  pool tables and vending machines"
good,"El dia a dia era de alta exigencia, sujeto a cambios repentinos, se adquirio un alto conocimiento de toda la operativa de un centro de servicio de mas de 1000 colaboradores. La gerencia un poco hermetica pero de trato honesto. Cultura laboral un poco cambiante.Trabajo ideal para el aprendizaje de la alta exigencia requerida por las grandes transnacionales."
good,"Answering calls for technical support can have its challenges, but one can do a similar job for a better wage. What makes this place decent is the atmosphere. Very relaxed, casual dress and some good perks for break time and lunches. All the benefits you need, but should you opt in, your check will be small. Essentially, to have a great check you're reduced to working OT, but good luck with that."
good,Did not approve of having to up sell customers who couldn't afford what they already had.  Also felt company let us down when AT&T pulled out finding a new program to keep us employed
good,"Convergys tries hard to cater to the employees, only to make up where it can't. The work place has clients and the clients are more important than the employee, and it is made known you are replaceable. However you get PTO and guaranteed 40hrs, plus they work around your school schedule pretty well."
good,People are fairly nice and polite. Make sure to leave yourself enough time to get to work in a timely fashion as they frown upon tardiness.  Time goes by pretty quickly during your shift.  I've learned a lot about Health Insurance during my time their.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with irate customers.
good,"Overall a good company but it is very stressful.  If you don't perform perfectly in a very quick time frame, they will let you go with no notice.  Several good employees were let go because they had issues meeting the very high goals the company set for them."
good,"You are required to do so many extra hours a week, and if you refuse, or cannot do them for whatever reason you have, they will scheduled you in on one of your days off and not necessarily tell you. So if you did not come in, either because you couldn't or refused to, you would be given a ""point"" which goes against you in a stack ranking."
good,"Good company wish better hours and work environment.  The work is  kind of redundant.  The pay could be better.  High expectations, very noisy place.."
good,I really don't have a good opinion of Convergys. Its great for temp work. Do not stay there long. If you are not meeting goal you will not be there long.
good,"It is fast paced, you must learn quickly, training is given, but not enough, and as most management will tell you for that issue, fake it till you make it. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the frustration of the customer that is directed at you, and you have to listen and handle that customer, no matter how irate or upset they may be."
good,"Very average place to work for. If you need experience in anything customer service or with computers, this is a great job to expand on that. They do offer some lucrative contracts that can teach you a skill AND pay decently. It was a decent working experience overall. Fast Paced, A LOT of phone calls. Training is paid and can last up to 10 weeks depending on what contract you get. Typical call center life. Management does often infantilize the individual team members with toy/candy hand outs."
good,this job is unorganized and there is no job security. the upper management is less than competent and the whole place is based on favoritism. i have never worked somewhere so unproffessional.
good,Good environment. People were friendly and helpful. Management was good. Graveyard shift sometimes a toll on your body. Good cafeteria service. Pick up and drop from home.
good,Overall average.Do not know about other processes but the Reliance Jio process should be functioned in more humanely way.People who are workin there are humans not robots.That is it.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Convergys is a great place to start your career.  Great for advancement and development.  You can easily move up in the company if you have great people skills, attendance and work really hard.  Self-development is a must and desire to help others. Great benefits but the salary is too low from start to upper management.  It is good to begin your career with Convergys from the phones and work your way up in order to learn the culture.  They do most of their promoting from within for this reason."
good,"While the majority of the staff is okay, the management tends to show in-equal favoritism & lack of enforcement on policies to retain employees due to the lack of compensation."
good,"Definitely a great place to start a career n management.  This was a great learning environment, I was pleased to work here and build the relationships I needed to in order to mov up."
good,"I rather not say, it's ok just the rules and regulations changes everyday. I don't have problems with,but I have seen a lot of great co they don't come back."
good,Convergys is a busy call center always hiring and an opportunity for many. A good place to start a career  and a good place after retirement.  If you like to talk and communicate you would enjoy it.
good,The company is employee friendly with many opportunities to grow. There is process in place for everything. The best cafeteria. HR and management are very employee friendly
good,"I worked her many years ago, I don't remember much but one of the good things was that they offered unlimited overtime sometimes and that was a great way to earn money there."
good,this job in my personal opinion was too stressful. there was too much emphasis on sales when i first got hired i was told to get sales but they were not the most important thing. then they changed it to where sales were getting people fired
good,"People are very helpful and most of my co workers are very jolly. We treat each other as a family. Metrics change every month but we should adjust on it. The hardest part is we can't have toilet break anytime. You need to wait for your break. It's understandable because of the queue but it would be better if they will allow us to go to the toilet whenever we need to. However, everyday I learn new things. Since I've been working there for more than a year sometimes I feel that I already know everything. But every customer is a different challenge. So we need to accept the even though we know a lot we should be open for new things and learn it."
good,Constant full times hours is a blessing and burden. Co workers are usually great and make the job worth having. Management on the other hand is need of further assitance
good,"The day usually starts with checking the previous day's audits, creating educational mailers, and appreciation mailers. The whole day goes in training or planning next training. "
good,Company is not bad but not that good. Manager requires you to reply to customers in a span of 30 seconds which is impossible. Knowledge base is not reliable.
good,They offer different hours and a variety of different projects to work on.  The management isn't very inspiring though.  They tend to be very negative about the business and ways of the project.
good,"The environment is peaceful and relaxed. The 401 is a great benefits."
good,"Facepaced job "
good,"it was a good full time job, very demanding mental. i learned a lot of good skills, and had alot of good training. the schedule is very demanding at times which  is a downfall"
good,Communicate with management and employees to fixed schedules real time and also to make sure we are submitting reports on time. I've learned on how to coordinates and communicate well to other.
good,"Bilingual Team Leader was a very fast paced, with changes in directives almost daily.  "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"A typical day at work is back to back calls.  I've learned to have more patience, especially with elderly customers who get confused about how to work their cable service."
good,"The organisation praises you when you work accordingly. Great people, good management, everyone out there is helpful. You get to learn something new each day."
good,"Convergys is a call-center where the work is fast-paced. The work-life balance is difficult but not impossible. Pay is okay for the work, bonuses are possible but difficult to get. There is some opportunity for advancement here. It's stressful, but a solid job for those in need or for those disposed to handling this type of work environment."
good,"Its ok to work there. The only thing that I would change is some management, because I was victim of verbal abuse in the dept that I was working. except for that. Good place."
good,"Freshers can join."
good,"having worked for a year, been promoted  3 times within that time, diffrence in salary is 0! for a company that is an outsource for a major player such as vodafone, pay is basic literally. and the final blow is when they decide to strip commision that you worked hard for over minor sometimes insignificant diffrences in your methods. othar that anyone with a voice and some background in retail/customer service can get this job."
good,"As with any call center, this one holds true. Large open production floor with a tier designed management style (Site Leader, Operations Manager, Team Leader, Cust Serv Rep). Compensation is good for the area with included benefits. The standards of the management, and lack of hands on management, is the failure in this location."
good,"receiving calls from customers to manage their accounts such as answering questions about billing issues and making changes to their programming,and equipment."
good,"It's to work there. We have good environment team leaders are very supportive."
good,"I just think that they need to improve a lot of things from the management, (HR) and the working place is not something that I enjoy during my stay..."
good,A rewarding place to work for me at the time because it was a new call center and I was one of several Operation Managers that was able to put new procedures in place.
good,"I  handle incoming or outgoing customer calls for a business. A call center agent might handle account inquiries, customer complaints or support issues. "
good,"This job like all other call centers just aren't for me, it was very stressful because we had very  little resources to work with. And of the ones we did have they didn't work a lot of the time. There was no clear or working reward system, one that they would promise a lot of incentives that were never received although worked for. The hours were exhausting although I got off pretty early ( I started even earlier.)"
good,"At Convergys I would answer Comcast customer's calls regarding their internet and phone services. I would assist them in resolving their issues and, if necessary, send out a technician to fix the problem."
good,Convergys was a great job I like the workers and mangers but it was always problems with some of the co-workers and they will try to make it your problems and I don't like working in environment like that but the good part of the job is working and communicating with people all over the state!!
good,"Typical day was spent on the phone answering questions about the phone bill, discussing the bill, past and present. collections, and new plans for local and long distance calling needs."
good,Its a nice place to work if you like call centers and like a some what fast paced work environment.. Some times clients like to pull contracts out of convergys and most people go to other projects of leave convergys
good,"nice orientation program,,good focus on nurturing employee employer relationship.worklife balance if ok"
good,The pay was every low .put it is a good place to get your feet wet .some of the managers where great but most did not care at all .stay for a year then move on .
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,15 minutes break is not enough to eat the free snack. Employees from different parts of the world works here and that what's makes this office an enjoyable place to work with.
good,"convergys is a good company to start at and to get a understanding of how to speak and handle issues over the phone. a hugh company with a diverse group of people with managers ready to assist any and all agents. I enjoy solving the customers issues and also assuring them that they have made a good decision in calling in to get assistance. the only issue I would have with the job is the on the spot changes that may come with little to no warning, but somehow it does prepare you for any variable change that may effect your work."
good,The best thing about the work was you will learned a lot about the nature of the job and its business. It would have been better if the company was more into giving enough compensation to its employees.
good,"not a good place to work as no proper training program. appraisal is next to none, if you are thinking of moving up in your career and promotion within the organisation please avoid working here"
good,"Ambiance avec  les collègues très agréable."
good,There paying new hires more money.  Bedbugs in the building.  Management are very unprofessional.  Some people are allowed to take there vacation time while others aren't.
good,"You will meet different kinds of people with different personalities on the workplace and it's up to you on how you would manage it. You will have your own team to work with reaching your goals to qualify for the incentives that they give away,that's their way to motivate agents. Their main goal is to provide excellent customer service to clients"
good,"My time spent at convergys was great, the pay wasnt the best but I gained alot of experience in a call center. Defiently recommend this job for someone looking to gain experience"
good,A nice organization to be associated with. The Management is pretty friendly and helpful. The Company maintains professional work culture and is currently expanding in most of the domains.
good,"Concentrix is a fine starter job for someone just learning IT, the Compensation is low (but it is an entry level position and is treated as such) it is easy to move up to a better position though they also pay very little at every level"
good,"Neutral review for Congergys. The environment while I worked there was chaotic. I'm not sure how it is now. Hopefully, they have assigned desks to representatives and the other ""offices"" finished."
good,"The Job is easy, but They don't care about your skills relating to the client, only about the skills they deem necessary. Too much red tape to allow for alternative, better solutions to common issues."
good,"worked at&t, directv project  you have different functions selling, troubleshooting sat issues. You are couched on time on call, tone of voice resolution"
good,"Fast paced environment. Would not consider for older mature adults unless one started in this industry in earlier years from high school."
good,"Improve on your point system because some people go through things and you still get points for missing out on work when you really need to ,like doctor visits How do people actually know when there going to get sick ? They don't but you still get a point if you miss ."
good,"Its a very good company to work, i am working with friendly environment in this company. Its a grateful place in terms of work."
good,"shifts stink and making a person or trying to make a person work every weekend just makes them want to leave....hello"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,A technical support representative would take calls and help people with their current issues. Punctuality and professionalism is a must in a job like this.
good,"Convergys  really doesn't care much for the employer. They see it as a ""do what I say or leave"". They don't help when it comes to child care and scheduling. Helping with scheduling around the child care is not an option here at all. Other than being a mom and them not working with you it isn't that bad if you can handle the fast pace."
good,Good Environment and management team was helpful. Participated in fun activity on every Friday. Participated in all the functional programme organized on the occasion of any Indian festival. So many memorable interaction with US customers.
good,"Over all Good"
good,"Inbound calls assisting customers with technical problems on their PC/Macs, cell phones and tables.  "
good,"A very good experience in the telecom industry. Constant learning, coaching and feedback. Customer service industry with a lot of fun activities and growth opportunities"
good,I stopped because they downsized agents.  I decided to resign rather than to be kicked out. And I applied to another BPO company which is IBex Global.
good,The company was hired by a large phone network provider however the fault lies mainly with the phone provider than Convergy's itself. The training provided was extensive however very hard to apply to real life situations and there was limited knowledge on how to escalate complaints.
good,I learned to manage time and utilize teamwork. Not to much was hard about the job but the most enjoyable this about the job was being able to learn from the older employees.
good,Exciting place to work but you most be dedicated to customer service. Must be ready to answer long calls and ensure customers are satisfied. Must be knowledgeable with software used at the call center and also ready to offer sales of products
good,"Initially, worked in a customer-care station.  After a few weeks, I was re-trained to join the Account Resolution department.  Helped customers manage personal accounts and resolve disputes (e.g., finding an affordable television package).  In addition, helped customers navigate customer website.  Had to switch hours with a co-worker in order to attend my brother's wedding.  Had difficulty getting to church because of Sunday hours.  Best teams for a given week were rewarded with dinner at Tucano's."
good,A typical day at work for me would be something relaxing not as stressful. I learned how to be understanding and patient with customer who are upset. I like management where they understand we are humans and consider how people feel.  The workplace culture to me just has to be an environment where everyone gets along for the most part. The hardest part of a job is working with someone who is not willing to carry there load.
good,I had good experiences with this company for the most part. As long as you did your job and were there when you were supposed to your job would be pretty secure. But being yelled at gets old fast so a lot of people would be stressed. Not much job culture to speak of as everyone was glued to their phones and socializing was discouraged outside the break room.
good,Typical day at work depends on your job but if you like working in a call center and dont mind the noise then you might like it the management isent too bad.
good,"I am not unhappy at Convergys although the pay is quite low and there is little opportunity to gain commission. My immediate management is friendly and helpful and there is opportunity for internal advancement. "
good,"Do not wish to say anything about the company or the management."
good,"Convergys is a large company with lots of resources and experience. They understand how customer service works. Understanding that you are working in a call center, the leadership team, and coaches understand the business needs and goals, and how to achieve those goals better than almost anyone. "
good,Very strict work schedule with very little room for emergencies. Dr. Appointments whether they were check ups or cause you were ill were counted against you.
good,Very bad place to start career. Poor in management. No Holidays. Bad work timings. Only saving grace in this environment are the colleagues. Don't start your career in this organisation.
good,"stressful phone support with upset customer"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,The executive leadership's values don't sync with what the site leaders are held to daily.  It's been frustrating to work on a project that wasn't fully converted to CVG Global Operating standards
good,"Amazon is a lot of work but very manageable. It's a lot of physical work, but they give you plenty of time each pay week. As long as you manage your time, youll be fine."
good,"India center has not grown since last few years. Company is observing lot of cost cutting, lack of development and growth opportunities. We are compromising on talent pool which will impact the future leadership quality."
good,The managers was horrible. Made bad decisions. They didnt care for what you did. Employees are rude. I stayed to myself and made sure i made my customers happy
good,"clarifying about query of the customer about the credit card"
good,I have nothing special to say out of the fact that I have met great people working there and very friendly.  I can say that I learn everyday something new in the actual campaign.
good,I learned a lot of things from there that I can use for the future and for other jobs I would get to handle. I was able to improve my communication skills well.
good,"Decent Management"
good,"Work was simple once you learn systems but the managers aren't great and they will try to find any reason to get you in trouble, most enjoyable part was when I was on lunch or leaving, really hated this job, just not suited for me"
good,"- contact with customer "
good,"management is very biased towards certain people and the pay scale is very below the average market they don't give you yearly appraisals."
good,The work environment was average. Fun people to work with. Management on all levels definitely needs an overhaul. Typical day was taking calls from frustrated or confused members regarding their health insurance coverage or billing.
good,"For me it's decent place to work but from salary point of view it's not good. Management is cool, they take care if any of the employee  have any concerns or issues."
good,The company tries hard to make it a fun place to work. They appreciate their employees it does really show. Commission is there for those that are willing to work hard to get it.
good,So far was good for me at concentrix & had a growth too ..looking for a change in my career to explore myself and to learn extra mile and to think beyond the limit and out of the box
good,Working at convergys gave me the chance to learn different areas in providing excellent service to our customers...........................................
good,Worked at Convergys for years. Good place to work. Good people. Learned a lot about customer service. Hardest part about work is the upset customers. Most enjoyable part of work was helping customer just like me.
good,"Good company fun place good staff nice environment people are nice ,i am however not eligible for night differential, ot hours, offer is good however net pay is really low"
good,"My typical day at convergys was ok. i sometimes found trouble trying to find a working computer to do my work. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Loved the hours and such but they left a lot of things out during training like the sales quota and the fact that they really didnt want you to provided customer service. They wanted you to just make the sale, even if you had to do it falsely and then get them off the phone."
good,"very professional environment. Typical work day would be 8hr shifts, incoming phone calls. Task routing,fulling the needs of the members at any measures."
good,"Relaxed Atmosphere. Great Company to work for if you are just starting out in the workforce."
good,Typical workday is consistent. I have learned there is always change. Management listens to concerns. Workplace culture is stressful. Hardest part of the job is the uncertainty of employment. Most enjoyable part of the job is helping others.
good,"Team leader of 17 inbound sales associate. ""Trained develop new sales associates for sales of cellular service. Home to manage a diverse group of individuals. Management was changing often when you would adapt to a new manger and their expectations a new one would start. Enjoyable part was talking to customers on the phones"
good,Well I liked this job. Customers were sometimes lonely and needed people to talk to. We got to play uno when it was slow.  They let you call in 2 hours late or leave 2 hours early.
good,"Good work culture, more opportunities to grow."
good,"It is all about taking calls from both polite callers and rude callers. stressed out callers, angry and upset callers. You will learn how to multifunction on the computer from using multiple screens and programs to assist the customer. Management needs to be more sensitive to the employee that need help dealing with certain customers. the hardest part of the job is pleasing some of the customers. the best part of the job is 'a satisfied customer'."
good,"At first, it was fun working there, I learned to speak English with confidence, I had my work mates very approachable and considerate bosses. What I don't like on their system, they are not giving the right amount of the incentives, and it's always late. They do not communicate it immediately. In addition, they are requiring OT everyday aside from the RDOT (rest day OT)."
good,They hold you at your original position forever. Do not look for advancement or help from management. Coworkers are friendly and will help.
good,"Nothing much. Learning is okay. Everything else is okay. nothing great, as there is not much fun to do at work. just toxic calls and less of a fun environment."
good,"Very  convenient to work from home, I worked for the low wage because when I started they were very flexible with the hours and time off. That has changed and it's really not worth it any longer. They are now riding us about stats, time off, and everything else they can think of. Which makes the very low pay ridiculous. You don't get what you need to do the job properly and management really can't answer your questions."
good,"Nice work culture with fun activities, Good platform of opportunities for growth, ontime salary, friendly colleagues and decent working place at a resourceful area."
good,"They pay well compared by the other companies in the same role, but they have a management who thinks only about cutting cost, thier choice for people who get promoted is very poor"
good,I have learnt many things with my employment at Concentrix including the importance of teamwork and a profound understanding of Microsoft Excel and DOS based programs.
good,"I don't like call centers. The people were nice, team leaders tried to be reasonable. But the systems we used to help customers were hard to navigate and four weeks of training still didn't prepare for actually being on the phones."
good,not too happy with this company. they messed up multiple checks for me and had constant policy changes on a daily and would get upset because the workers could not keep up with the changes and would terminate us.
good,"Low salary"
good,"It was a good company to grow."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"most of what you learn in class doesn't have much value when taking calls they don't explain very well the metrics they grade your job performance on,  The company is spread between two buildings and communication between the from upper management and floor managers is shaky at best,"
good,convergys is a good company however the pay loss recently has hit me hard and i am forced to move on to provide for my family
good,"Work shift options, lunch subsidies, perfect atendance incentive bonus, OT,  paid vacations,  health insurance, VTO,  in the job training, office activities etc.."
good,Every day started with a problem with systems/software issues to be fixed so we could maintain customer service levels. I learned to be able to multi task and problem solve at all times. The hardest part of the job was trying to encourage someone who had no interest in working or assisting a customer. The best part of the job was when coaching an agent and seeing them light up when given praise for a job/goal well done.
good,"The overall teams are great in the office; however, the company overall lacks communication, leadership, and good benefits. It is a fun place to work, but there is not a lot of room for growth or raises."
good,"New culture   focused on client safety with many incentives and recognition for employees.  Many focus groups and continues coaching and training to maintain a high level of service knowledge.   I am multi-trained. My mornings   start out  opening up my matrix and looking at my  evaluation scores for the previous day.  I could start out helping clients  reach their destinations I them by mid afternoon I could be helping client activate their OnStar services in their new or used vehicle. The hardest part is finding  specific directions for clients who have certain ways of traveling. The best part of the job is  chatting with clients about their part of the country, getting them safely to their destination, and helping them in  roadside or emergency situations."
good,"I worked for Convergys for 5 years and over that time I showed them on numerous occasion that I deserved a chance to be promoted but because i didnt happen to be one of their favorites, I never received that chance that i deserved. however so long as you didn't try to advance without having someone in your pocket or make a stupid mistake, it is a secure job."
good,"overall good company to work with,dont know much as was working for CISCO Process.cabs a big issue.ok working place.great canteen ....new setup ....cabs issues need to be resolved,not very good paymaster"
good,"Typical Day - meetings and delivery of services for customers.  Target goals on a daily basis."
good,"working at convergys helped me a lot to develop my communication skills, they really invest in developing their employees for them to be able to exceed customer's expectations."
good,"Depending on the project, it is fast paced."
good,"We have reliable SME's to help us."
good,"This workplace isn't very professional, all of the other call representatives are great, but the management is very unprofessional. Overall the place isn't terrible I just think they need better management"
good,"Good and quality trainings, friendly environment. Good benefits. The main reason for leaving the company is i want to grow and seek better opprtunities and competitive compensation."
good,Really nice place to work. They have really come along way. If you're looking fro a place to grow at a fast pace. Then I would definitely recommend them
good,The people at convergys are great. If you enjoy sitting and not being on your feet all day this job is perfect for you. Lots of PTO and sick days.
good,Good hours but don't not have much opportunity for advancement. I believe this is definitely suitable for people seeking entry level positions in a call center area.
good,"the people I worked with were great the upper management no so much"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"It's OK can be better, I like working for Minacs, I enjoy helping my customers when they call in with problems with their on star."
good,Just an average customer service job.  Customers call and you fix their problems.  Almost zero job advancement but good pay and benefits.
good,"It's a nice place to work but not a place to have a career. Environment is okay but loud. It's an easy desk job. I work in the credit card department and that's really fun because you learn how not to be late on a payment, how credit really works, and definitely teaches you more about being secure, and keep track of your spending."
good,"It was fun within the little time I was there. I enjoyed the group of people that I Trained and worked with on the daily bases, I also loved my trainer and they way she taught."
good,"Being part of this company provides continuous professional growth as the company grows, employees are valued enough that it continually enhances and provides an abundance of training for future opportunities. The company has high respect for diversity and integrity."
good,Fun place to work only seasonal but good money and a fun fast pace to work. Ability to meet a lot of new people. Strict dress code but overall good place to work
good,"csr-convergys"
good,"nothing to write home about, typical work from home job. customers rude, help minimal..OT always available. Split shift ..(4 hrs in morning, 4 hrs at night)"
good,its a job but dont get caught up with the personal dramas in the building or on the property. Keep to yourself don't let them in your business.
good,I worked for them more than one year . The atmosphere was good we were like a family and the boss believe me so much . that was also a good challenge for me.
good,Position was a good position but very stressful due to constant changing of requirements for bonuses that actually negatively effected the amount of bonuses rather than increasing.
good,Supporting management culture. Good People alongside. Friendly Environment. Less Compensation. Uneven Expectations. Good Cafeteria. Good Transport....
good,"willing to push myself to limit but the management of the company or the process I am in is dissapointing, The job hours is higher and lacks stability in management, frequent chenge of timings in the name of client requirement"
good,My day would consist of floor support and also training of new employees. I also will answer inbound calls to give great customer service and trouble shooting to Starbucks employees. I learned how to manage several jobs and personalities at one time and succeed in providing the best assistance to store partners and fellow coworkers. The management could be better in the building to bring up some of the moral but for the most part reasonable. The hardest part about the job is leaving because i have built great relationships and bonds with people all across the country.The most enjoyable part about the job is that i get to talk to different people everyday from all over the states and Canada.
good,"very high turover rate, management is very ghetto , trainers are ok they accomadate school schedules , some ot not much  but overall nice pay bad place"
good,Work environment was pretty fun but the compensation and benefits were the only problem.  The lacked on providing checks and payouts on comission.
good,"Coming in to work with a positive attitude full of energy, always smile and greet ur customers with respect and look forward to getting your job accomplished, a typical day at work."
good,"people there are most likely approachable and has a good and friendly environment, it's just that i 'm having a hard time with regards to time because i'm still currently studying."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"This was my very first call center position, i enjoyed the work although the people that i worked with where fighting, arguing talking about one another and i just could not take the drama. overall if those things were not apart of my experience, i would still be there"
good,"Learned to work under the pressure and team work. Best place for the fresher to start the career."
good,salary is not good. I learned a lot of thing about work and how to multitask and maximizing the time. i love my co workers and the most enjoyable part was i was the lead in the employee engagement team wherein we organize event to motivate other employee
good,Working for convergys i was able to get along with everyone i worked with.  This company however takes advantage of there employees and can be rather difficult to work for as you are not respected as an individual unless you make something of yourself there. Over all my experience was great as i proved myself to be an over achiever and was aloud the opportunity to work within the back ffice
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,The hardest part of working for Convergys trying to sell being in tech support not everyone is happy about there services being down and trying to upsell them.
good,They are all about the money. I was a top performer the whole time I was there. I was told I can not move up because we would lose to much money. Though I did TL jobs at time as they talked about outside life or slacked off. Not impressed hoping that I find work at a more professional company.
good,I have learned so much in this company. I've learned that changes are constant and I should learn to love it for me to be flexible and will be able to learn a lot of things. I've earned a bunch of good colleagues as well. They've taught me to always think positive in life and to always reach for my dreams.
good,"it was nice at first but there is so much change all the time. if you don't like something there, stick around because it will most likely change"
good,"There will be nothing new in the company to learn, not even policies are stable. Correct typical job and no challenging tasks and work stress and dump work on one person."
good,"Typical day was answering calls and upgrading mobile phone contracts. Which has been one of the easiest jobs i have ever had to be fair. The work place is not the Ritz but it is manageable as you are normally at your desk all day and only in the eating area at lunch as it is quite a walk to get anything for lunch."
good,"This is basically a guaranteed job for anyone who can hear and speak. Work life balance isn't there though so that must be kept in mind. Also you'll ideally want to live in the Fanshawe area, or get a carpool going right off the bat as you don't want to rely on public transit. Pay is $14/hr which is the highest for the contract. Definitely opportunities to move up if you can stick there long enough to do so. Attrition rate is pretty much 18 people out the door of 20 who initially started."
good,"its always a tough days of work. I've learned a lot specially on how to handle customers effectively. the management though was quite intimidating and my co workers, there were some that always had a power tripping over me but I guess it always comes with the package. The hardest part of the job is handling an upset customers. The most enjoyable part was when I was able to solve customers issue and got their satisfaction."
good,The job was interesting but the bosses aren't the most respectful to the employee. You get to be helpful when people really need it.
good,West is a good paying company and a lots of benefits while CVG has good people and activities and there's a lot of job oppurtunities
good,convergys is a good company to work for. some of the management team could use additional training due to lack of communication with the team members. the company values employees most of the time.
good,"A typical day at Covergys would be you come to work ready to provide service to the customers. Go on our first break eat snacks, play pool, video games and also ping pong. We would have team meeting once a week or twice to learn about the new product that we have. The management it ok and for the co-workers some are a little out of hand. The hardest part of the job is when they change the system around and we have to adjust to it and forget how we're taught to learn the new way. The most enjoyable part is my team itself."
good,i work that company for 1year like agent for call center in french there after 5 mounths i got a promotion i became quality angent there and we are working in the night there
good,"-learned how to deal with customers which enhanced my trouble shooting skills, technical support and communication skills with different perspective to encounter problems."
good,"People who i worked with didnt provide a good atmosphere. Otherwise it was a decent job."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"The job itself was fun and much potential for growth, however did not pay enough for the work done. The same job working directly for the company we worked for was significantly higher. Employee moral was low due to very poor management from HR down."
good,"I worked as a customer service agent at Concentrix and enjoyed it more than I thought I would! The hours where great and the pay wasn't bad at all!"
good,"Job was good, management was okay at times. Most of the time they weren't too understanding of extreme situations and time off requesting"
good,"Specialized Billing had not been in Canada for some time and nobody knew how to train us. The training class was a joke and we spent most the days reviewing information that never came up in phone calls. We were put in serious billing conversations with loyal customers and we had to always ask for help because we were not fully trained. I felt bad for the customers, who would call with billing issues, and they would be put on hold every 2 minutes so we could ask our ""team leader"" our  questions. When we put our hand up to request assistance ( all the time ) , it would often take up to 7 minutes to receive help, at which time the customer is furious. Which puts the advisor in a very tough situation, constantly."
good,"My job was a temporary position for the tax season, so there wasn't a lot of job security in that. They did care about their employees, which is nice, but the work was just not something I really liked. If you're into MAC computers and Tax software, this is the perfect place for you."
good,"As I technical support, I take inbound calls and addressing customer's concern regarding with their system problem and other inquiries. Addressing service request number (customer ticket) for their concern for every hour and processing dispatches for replacement for their system, If it's a depot or parts only with an onsite technician service. I can handle multi tasking while taking calls such as chat support and email support with a different customers issue. "
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job is to have a good tl, co-workers, and how you handle the pressure at work.the hardest part of the job is when you have to leave the team and be transferred to different team"
good,"I worked at Minacs for 3 years. The people were awesome and I had alot of good times but the job itself was very stressful. The targets were really hard to meet, especially if you wanted a decent bonus. Policies would change on a regular basis. There was a very big disconnect between the client and the management. And also job security was not very good. Honestly I still would be working there today if the center didn't close down."
good,"In this kind of industry specially BPO (sales) its very stressful however the rewarding parts working with such a very positive people, enthusiastic individuals. Working under pressure is something that you will ease on because for strong team bonds."
good,"This company gives much courage to their employees that gives motivation to them to do work well, managers and co-agents are nice people to work with."
good,I had 17 great years with the company and have experiences that will lead me to another job.  I was given the opportunity to work with a great bunch of people and do a job that I loved to do.
good,"Not a bad place to work, with good incentives, although they do have issues with not paying money that you worked for and was promised to get. It is also very fast paced and can be stressful at times, and getting help was always questionable after just getting out of training."
good,The training is 5 weeks long and within that five weeks you learn everything that you will need to know on the floor. you answer calls for customers who are calling in to cancel their service with AT&T wireless.
good,"Very busy typical day about 50-100 calls per day"
good,There is no perfect company. Normal workday in a call center. I learned advance knowledge about the Windows OS and Office Software. Unsatisfactory policies when CVG assumed the administration. My co-workers are behaving like normal call center agents. The hardest part is accepting the unfair policies. The most enjoyable part is working and getting paid on time and receiving above average compensation than most working individuals in the Philippines.
good,"Like all call centers I've had any contact with, the emphasis is on volume of calls and sales as opposed to true customer satisfaction."
good,"A good start off for a fresher."
good,Not much room to advance. Big company so a lot of people get lost in the mix. For the most part I have enjoyed working for this company.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Fast Pace"
good,"The work was far too depressing, sitting there sending directions to rude costumers everyday wasn't good at all. There training team is very good and helpful."
good,the company is all about numbers. you really need to work hard in order to meet the required numbers given by the client/.
good,inbound call center environment with the responsibility of troubleshooting iOS devices over the phone & provide exceptional customer service
good,It was an alright job but the training that they would do for the systems they expected us to work was simply not good enough.
good,"I can say that the company has a very good working environment, you can easily get well to the people around you. You can easily ask help from others, whether they are your manager or not. They ensure that they can attend to your needs especially when it's about product specifics they are much willing to help you improve more on how you can make your work better."
good,"Company is OK, lacks in on time pay when first starting. Slow to respond to important changes such as tax information. Co-workers are great and some team leads are very helpful."
good,"Good work place with supportive management"
good,The company has very competitive standards since it is a BPO company and handles international accounts. Strives to get a very large amount of income through pushing employees to work hard.
good,"Since it is a freelance job, so you are uncertain of when the next job is. But you can balance your work and life because this is a home based job. And I do love this job because I was able to practice my degree"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job : is when I  resolved a customer issue on a call. Even after  the customer has faced multiple transfers, unhappy with the past experience with the previous Technicians. Spending long time on calls, irate and frustrated."
good,"dirty , people were unorganized and uncaring about others,not too much room for advancement unless you were on a favorites list. no matter how many times i won employee of the month. even after many many kudos awards from customers."
good,convergys is a ok starting point of call center experience.... just a place to get the gist of things and seek further advancement elsewhere
good,"The management was great, decent amount of red tapes and politics. But they could have done better when it comes to incentives and salary."
good,Convergys in one of the best in BPO industry and has lately made some changes so as to benefit employees such as fun activities so as to work on the stress level and make them productive too.
good,"The most enjoyable part of a days work is when you learn something new that you can use again and again! Often, the fastest way is by the manual."
good,This job was all over the place. The way they handle people overtime and money was all ways a problem. The management was rude they didn't want to help
good,"The management to me was always the best. They're constantly trying to help you out and help your stats improve. My dislike to this job was being on the phone for over 10 hours straight, with very badly placed breaks and almost no time off the phones to relax and breathe."
good,a call center that was partnered with onstar . considered a corporate setting. good start for anyone wanting to get their foot into the door of a higher stature job
good,The most ridiculous part was the point system. It was a good idea but wasn't executed very well. You were given 12 points. If you were late by 1 min - 1 hour you lost .25 of a point. If you were late 1 hour and 1 min - half your shift you lost .5 of a point. If you were late from half your shift and a minute - 3/4 of your shift you lost .75 of a point. If you called out on a scheduled shift you lost a full point. If you didn't bother calling in you lost 2 points. The problem isn't with the whole point system. The problem was there was no grace period. We had 4 different programs we had to log into. All with different usernames and passwords. You could only log into the computer you were going to use that day 5 minutes before your shift started. The computers were about 10 years old already so start up was slow and it took about 7-10 minutes to get everything pulled up and signed in. In this aspect the no grace period and the point system worked against you since you were almost always late unless you happened to log into the same computer you had the day before and no one else has used it.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"the job kept you very busy, had good compensation, but was stressful and most but not all of the management wasn't very helpful. the hardest part of the job is that the work involved a lot of customers calling in screaming and very angry. The best part of the job is that they are very good at working with your schedule and at working with your hours"
good,it is a fun work place with great people. its all about numbers so at times it could be stressful but that was to be expected of a big company. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the great people i worked with and everything they had to teach me. The office was way to crowded.
good,Het werk omvat call centre werk voor allerlei internationale bedrijven
good,"For the job I was entitled to do, compensation could have been more."
good,Coworkers were friendly and willing to help when needed. Typical day required active listening skills in order to help the customer.
good,Convergys has different clients at different location. the DTV project was angry customers most of the time. A full time work sched almost always had you working 40 + hours because of mandatory extra hours - fine for some one with no family obligations. Promotions are half earned half just who ever wants it and were  some times given to undeserving people - i.e people who should have never made to the production floor are suddenly in management positions.Some great management some terrible. The work is repetitive- no room for creativity- this job takes no skill to do. any one can do it.
good,"We take in calls and look for the best resolution to customer's issue. I learned a lot from the job in calculating and preparing payroll taxes,how you handle irate customers and time management.The working environment is really good it helps you develop as a leader and how you communicate with your co-worker to achieve one goal.The hardest part of the job is how you identify the issue of the customer and how you resolve and deliver it to the customer and you tend to enjoy the job when you make people happy and make their lives easier."
good,"Pros: fun place to work, good work environment, professional attitude, learned a lot thru training, flexibility on schedules.  "
good,"I loved working at Convergys for the job itself, however the coworkers and the management was bad."
good,"I received valuable work experience while at Minacs as a member of their Consumer's Energy campaign. The schedule was reasonable and reasonable accommodations were made when necessary to allow employees to manage personal matters. "
good,really wasn't a fan of management different personalities but the job was fantastic I love helping the members and providers with the information they needed
good,"The worst parts: not being able to stay on one contract. I was placed on 3 separate contracts in a 10 month period, so I did not feel as though I had job security. I would get to the point where I was finally comfortable and felt I had a firm grasp on how to do my job well and then would have to move on to another contract, it just left me feeling defeated and like a hamster on a wheel, always running but getting nowhere. Another issue with being bounced around from contract to contract is the bouncing around of the rate of pay. Agents that have been there for years end up making the same hourly wage as a new agent and I just feel as though they should be entitled to a higher rate of pay, especially if having to be downgraded from a contract that pays(for example) $14/hr to a contract that only pays $9/hr. That is a really huge drop in income and those agents should be entitled to a higher hourly wage. I also feel that the training is lacking in certain areas.  I never felt completely trained on the tools that we needed to access to assist the customers, I felt that their main focus was mostly on the education of the product and company rather than the actual step-by-step process. "
good,"Many things i have learned here, time management, People management, Feedback in positive manner, Coworkers like friends."
good,Very unprofessional environment. Mangers where young and immature. Jobs is good with keeping its full time hours available.
good,Working for Convergys would be average experience and the pay was decent.  Enjoyed the people I worked with on a day to day operation.
good,the hardest part of the job was to solve the customers problems while following company guidelines. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping other agents solve problems they were having while dealing with difficult customers. My co-workers were great for the most part. Management was focused only on the ratings customers gave to us and whether we were following company guidelines while making sales on the phone.
good,Convergys is a standard call centre and workplace environment. A typical day at work is taking as many calls as possible while managing stats.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,".Great Environment"
good,"Everyday is a challenge at work. I usually start my day reading my emails to either check on responses or accept additional task from my manager. The challenges I encounter on a daily basis are to ensure that the content of my project will benefit both the Clients and my  company, manage the development timeline by making sure that everyone working on the project with me are on schedule, and to provide development status update to Clients. The hardest part of my job is to think of a quick and feasible resolution whenever a road block is encountered and eventually update the Client on these changes. On the contrary, the most exciting part of the job is the additional knowledge I gain from each and every project I work on. Working with a variety of accounts is really interesting. I learned how to work with different nationalities who are working on the same project. My patience, credibility and development timeline skills are put to the test on each and every single day."
good,Convergy's was better than CSS and IBC (Xerox).  At least at Convergy's management or leads would try to assist you with a question or if you were uncertain about something. They even offered you your PTO time if the calls were slow.
good,"I would clock in log in and begin calling customers with delinquent credit accounts."
good,Convergys is definetly not the best place to work but it's a good place to work. Depending on the account you are on. AT&T forget it worst account to work on. you have to compete for a seat and then if there is overflow you sit in this tiny room with about 100 people waiting for a seat then you get in trouble (no matter how early you are) the point system is not the best. and you can never be sure if you will have a job. The best part is the customers but you can't spend any time with them becuase of your average handle time. definelty wouldn't recommend my worst enemy here.
good,Convergys/Directv has a working environment very socially inclined. The benefits were amazing but the environment of managers wasn't ideal.
good,"There scheduling is weird. Everyday I start at a different time and never have the same days each week. Makes it hard to plan stuff more than 2 weeks out, You can only ask for a day off if you have PTO and UTO (which is 2 days a quarter), So by the time the schedule comes out there may not be any time available to take UTO."
good,"I enjoyed my time with Aditya Birla Minacs and I always had very good performance reviews. Senior management was aloof and seldom had any contact with people on the floor. Training was adequate. We were told not to be concerned about work being done off shore and three months later forty jobs were lost. "
good,"Enjoyed the collaboration in building and instituting better learning environment for employees to enhance customer service experience."
good,The principal of a person working with Convergys for more that 6 to 8 months should be considered to worth fighting for to promote.
good,"a typical day at work"
good,Company a great place to start out your career path and learn how a help desk work. This company help you with customer service and how to deal with difficult people.
good,"As long as show that you care for your job as well as keeping open communication with your team lead, the company will  try harder to keep you as an employee..."
good,"Training was done very well, sales goals were set at a very reachable level, customers were just unhappy with company, so it made it difficult to listen to customers yell and me. Overall, a nice company to work for if you want a call center job."
good,"The entire day at work was spent at the cash register, checking out groceries. At the end of each shift we had to balance the books. I learned how to use a cash register. Management was fair. Co-workers were fun to work with. The hardest part of the job was really balancing the books at nights, but was not really any major challenge. It is always a pleasure to meet new people, as a result that was what I enjoyed the most about the job."
good,"Shift work and shifts can change quite regularly. Management is on the whole fairly good at lower levels, but woefully unconnected at top levels."
good,"Compensation was acceptable and they offered the good benefits of health insurance and 401k.  Management tried to keep things positive by giving us written statements and certificates about a job well done.  They congratulated us with cake and cheerful balloons! Sometimes we had free food offered to us as well.  Job Security was not very good.  Many people who were full time had their hours cut back to part time.  Many people were let go all at once when no longer needed.  As soon as business needs picked up, new people were hired.  The people who called our inbound call center were usually very troubled about their Secure Horizons product/services.  They didn't understand a lot of it and were troubled about certain things. Because most of them were very elderly,they usually spoke very slowly.  The call center makes money for each call.  Unfortunately, that made the management pressured to pressure us to make each call very fast.  The instability and pressure was the hardest part of this job.   The most enjoyable part of the job is whenever I was able to help someone who called and the compliments that I received from Management.  The food and balloons too!"
good,Great place to work.  Get to pick your schedule and dress is casual.  Coworkers are very friendly and always room for advancement
good,"Good benefits, but not much room for job advancement, and too much forced overtime."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"A day at work is busy and always productive. We learn something new everyday, new softwares and iOS devices. Our management team is never on the same page. It is a contract job, so three different companies work together. Payroll is not on point, no one likes there money to be late especially when they expect the employee to be on time. Co-workers are very diverse, and people are pretty mature. The hardest part of the job is dealing with all of the issues and devices for low salary. The best part of the job is resolving the customer issue."
good,a typical day at work would be fine minus the chaos around it.my co workers were loud and didn't care
good,"The first day of my TL"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is being in a fun environment meeting new friends. The hardest part is the constant forcing of selling products to obviously struggling customers. Most times open opportunities are given by favoritism especially to those who don't know the system or procedures. Job security is not available trust me I know after being forced to resign after a motor collision overseas and reassured the position will be available.
good,I enjoy interacting with customer's daily. The management team is superb and promote career advancement.
good,"Basically, I love my job, the pay hours and benefits are all good, and I enjoy helping people understand their bill and how their phones work.. The only real downfall is how poorly the company is run. Management is terrible."
good,Working at the Lake Mary building was fun.  A typical day normally included taking phone calls from customers to assist with serving client accounts.  When I was promoted to management I became responsible for 15-20 direct reports.  Every day was something new and something to learn.
good,"The job wasn't exactly what i thought it would have been. long hours with little breaks. management wasn't the best in the world, they did listen but they wouldn't do anything to help the situation"
good,"Answered customer service inquiries, helping caller with technical issues for the first three years and then moved to billing.  Managers were changed out at least twice a year, but all were supportive."
good,"Great place to work at if you are with the right people. It is not a stable job and gives you no opportunity to manage a daily life. Great benefits and commission. But some supervisors are rude when it comes to asking for help so it really depends on who your team is. Loved the job, not for everybody though..."
good,"I enjoyed my job at Convergys for the most part, I loved going to work because of the people I worked with.  When I would come into work I would get set up and get ready to start my job.  Once I was in the call flow or taking emails it was consistent, I never had to worry about  staying busy which was good for me.  I enjoy working in a faced pace environment and keeping my mind challenged."
good,"answering phone, sometimes customers are very rude. I learn how to accept negativity from customers and still smile. The hardest part of this job is your hard work sometimes go unnoticed"
good,"I was an in-house, inbound credit card collections agent for Citibank and collects 30-180 days past due accounts.  Some shifts last for 9 hours while others last for 12 hours.  There is no work-life balance with this job.  You are expected to come to work even on Saturdays and Sundays, in dire weather conditions and on holidays as you are supporting an off shore account."
good,"This started out as a job to get me through until I graduated from college.  When I saw I was able to promote up quickly, I chose to stay.  The further I got, the more I saw the politics and what was needed to continue to be promoted further.  For where I lived, the pay was one of the least competitive in the outsourcing industry.  "
good,learned alot about customer service field..how to talk to customers better
good,"I worked there six months after retirement for the USAF.  Just paid the bills, but  it was and is a call center. I was offered a job not to long ago same company but they wanted to lower my pay from when I left.  Tucson Sucks for employement"
good,"I learned alot from working in a call center i improved my language skills and also improved to convence people by talking to them the, the hardest part of the job was to understand the language of Australians and to understand their accent, the most enjoyable part of job was to get a break after every 1 hour to get fresh."
good,A typical day for me was taking calls for Consumers Energy assisting their customers with questions about their bill and setting payment arrangements. I've learned that there is a lot of people that needs assistants. My supervisor's were helpful and friendly and flexible as far as accommodating your schedule. My co-workers were awesome in helping if you had a question or just lend a listening ear if you had to vent after a bad call. The hardest part was trying to assist a customer whose has a bad attitude and is not listening and just wants to argue. The most enjoyable parts where my co-workers there was really good team sprit and fun Friday's.
good,"The environment at Convergys is nice. Modern, sleek, and sophisticated with a edge on safety. In a typical day, you will start off with paid training (2-6 weeks), move on to a trial 2-5 week very supported floor environment, then graduate on to become a fully tenured employee. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"pay rate, friendly employees, equal opportunity, how to treat all the customers, life of a call center"
good,"This job consisted of answering inbound phone calls daily and assisting each customer with any questions or concerns that they may have had concerning their account, and also taking payments for customers if a payment was due. "
good,"Working in the B2B division of Convergys is different from their call center atmosphere. You have the ability to make your own schedule, in regards to work day activities, while no day is the same."
good,"Good job for someone starting out, or wanting a relatively easy job."
good,"I worked on the OnStar project.  You only get good treatment if you leave the subscriber department and go upstairs to Priority, Emergency, or Bilingual.  Some of the people they choose to lead are sarcastic and not helpful at all.  You do, however, make plenty of awesome friends."
good,"For nine hours straight, your answering phones. Resolving customers issues, and keeping them apart of the company. I liked my co-workers. The hardest part of the job was the hours, I'm a full time students, as well a mother of 4 small children, and with the schedule that was given, it wasn't working out. But for the right person who likes a sit down job, and hours are not a bother perfect fit."
good,One good benefit of working at Convergys was the availability of advancement opportunities.  The company does alot of internal job advancement.
good,"The first few months I was there were great. After a while just anybody was hired. No one knew anything, people were stealing and a lot of people had deeper relationships than what should have been allowed. Management liked certain people and would help them in any way. Management would make things harder on other people that they did not like and had relationships that were inappropriate for work."
good,"deal with customer based in U.K and process the order as per there request,"
good,"Over all the job is enjoyable and most days you come away feeling as though you have made a difference in the customer's day and have restored their faith in the company. There are always those customers that nothing you say or do will help with their current situation from their view. My direct supervisor was great, offering support to me and the rest of the team when we needed it. She is very knowledgeable in the day to day dealings with the customer, and offers support with those hard to deal with customers. I've honestly learned a lot from working here, and enjoyed my job immensely, however ultimately have left because I no longer feel valued at my job."
good,The computer programs went down all the time making it hard to complete job requirements on time. Good management in my department. A smile makes the voice on the phone sound more helpful. My co-workers made good team work. The hardest part of the job was computer programs not working right. Most enjoyable was my team.
good,"In my experience, the company is very business oriented and puts no merit in employee morale. Certain members of the management team I worked under tried very hard to keep morale up and to keep a good balance of job work/life balance. The co-workers were nice and I learned a lot about call center operations, metrics, etc. The hardest part was being micromanaged constantly on every aspect of your day, the most enjoyable part was the opportunity to make money and the people I worked with."
good,The company is amazing! It's just the people that was working at my location was like a bunch of chickens with their heads cut off while holding it in their hands. It's full of cool and great amazing people. I learned alot. I've learned how NOT to manage my company and I also learned a lot of amazing customer service skills. Never judge a book by its cover.
good,Great place to get all the call center experience you need before moving on to bigger and better things.
good,"On a typical work day I call my listed accounts and find the decision maker offer to assist them and grow the account. Management is always has open door policy, if time allows. Co-workers are a nice mix of different backgrounds. The company does little things for employees that they don't have to, which is nice."
good,"Easy job and is rather safe, but if repetitiveness isnt your cup of tea, this isnt the job for you."
good,"Since being employed at Convergys, I've learned several different skills to enhance my knowledge with several different intranet systems &  technology"
good,"I do not feel qualified to review this company. My typical day was being punctual, finding my seat and readying myself to answer phone calls.  I learned what was necessary to do my job.  The management was fine.  My co-workers were great for the most part."
good,Atypical day at work would be me coming in and trying to find a seat to clock in. Once I clock in I have to pull up all my tools and log into the phone and wait for calls to come in.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"You Clock in and as soon as you walk on the floor and put on a headset your on the clock "
good,I assisted American Express with learning about other products that american express offers.
good,I like socializing with people I don't have a problem with talking to people I love working if I could stay all day  I would I love working its fun. I love my co-workers I love people maybe the hardest part of the job was angry customers having to calm them down but with patience and you know what your doing everything works fine.
good,"Management was the best part of the job, they really tried to make you feel needed and wanted, and rewarded you for good work."
good,"although the people are generally great to work with, I do have concerns about the managers and the direction the company is going"
good,"the best thing about the job is being with a team. You have lots of co-workers. one of the hardest things in the work  that its too stressing. The customers call angry, you try to solve the problem and sometimes it take time and then you must offer to the angry customer."
good,"good place to work at."
good,"go in sit down put on a headset and take calls"
good,"I go to work and try to do the best possible job in assisting my customers to my ability. I learned that customers are regular people with problems such as any other ordinary human being and that they have issues that need to be resolved that they inquire about just like I do as well.Management taught me to be more open in my approach I have been in this field for a numerous amout of years and they just taught me more of how not to get comfortable in my regular customer service experience and be adaptable to any situation. My co-workers have  taught me to bring a good attitude to any call situation and be free and understanding of the customers. The hardest part of the job for me now would be not acheiving the ideal meaning of why customers call and not being able to assist them with their inquiries. The most enjoyable part of the day is the end and knowing that I did absolutely everything I could in order to achieve maximum satisfaction doing my job accurately as well as effienciently, also knowing that the customers issues were resolved."
good,"Convergys is a good job. I learned how to cater to people needs. I've also learned how to open up a little more at work and being social. The management could be a little better overall I love Convergys. The hardest part of the job is using my own PTO hours if I really needed to use them, and also Bereavement. Convergys gives you limited options on almost everything. They love giving you points that shouldn't even be counted against you; such as family emergencies, doctors notes, and more. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to satisfy my customers and the environment I surround myself around. They are all positive people whom any job would love to have."
good,This is a good company to work for but pay is not market competitive and opportunities for advancement are limited.
good,Really difficult to deal with the working envoirmnet being that it is hostile most of the time.  But the pay is not bad.
good,Convergys is a good company to work for and if there job security was better i would still be employed.
good,good environment but had a lot of targets to complete.There were a lot of extra activities to do which would keep the employees happy and benefits were also there.the hardest part was to complete the  target in time.co-workers were very co-oporative.
good,if you want to learn then convergys is the right place for you guys.
good,"Lot of fun. Every day is like a party. Though, we learn nothing. We can have good incentives."
good,company has a strict aadherence policy other then that great place to work
good,"The start of the day is peaceful."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"A typical day at work is very fast pace an consistent, I've learned how to deal with irate customers and continue to smile. Management  in the company could be a little better. but I enjoy my co workers. The hardest part of the job is remaining positive when a customer is insulting you, but the most enjoyable part is being able to help them."
good,You have to pay close attention in  training because they cram quite a bit into a short amount of time.
good,"Convergys customer service is a job that is good for someone trying to start out of high school for a temporary time. There are benifits but the wages are so low that you cant afford to keep them and take home a living wage. The management though they have seemingly good intention are often confused and conflict in information that they give. Every thing is often chaotic and disoreinting and it doesn't help that the managment is often confused about what to do in certian situations. There is a level of favoritism, and supervisors change often messing with the chemistry of the entire operation, because no two supervisors ever does the same thing as there is no universal operation proceedure. Supervisors are lazy and often hold grudges. The good thing about the job is that if you can handle the chaos and disorginization, there are small bonuses that you receive for sales."
good,"its a good job for some people, its lacks structuce in my opinion but it is a good job if youu want an introduction to call centers"
good,"answered calls for the company dealt with unhappy and unsatisfied customers"
good,"Excellent paid training but was not a reliable place for a career as your job ends whenever the contract with the telemarketing company ends. The hardest part of the job was trying to help the customers over the phone with out actually being able to see what the problem was, I did tech support."
good,it ok. place to work.   you had to work 7 days a week with not days off.
good,Good for those who have in depth knowledge in Billing & Rating products. Less job security.
good,"Working for Chrysler Financial was a learing experience. On a typical day I would try to set up the right type of payment arrangements for clients. My Managers motivated me that I can achieve any goal they provided for us that day. Which I did, as well as my co-workers. That was the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Work days were decent , as were the customers. Management was always available as were co-workers in case assistance was needed."
good,"Taking loads of incoming calls and satisfying customers, solving their problems. "
good,"i enjoyed working from home, and saving fuel expenses. advanceing a career had minimal opportunity"
good,"I would go to work and log into my computer and phone, then pull up all the resourses available to me that I will need throughout the day to help my customers."
good,"it is a decent place to work, they will train you, and there are some re-occurring issues"
good,A typical day include talking on the phone all day and learning that each call is different. In the project I worked on I had ten to twelve screens open at all times and had to maximize and minimize all those screens for each situation. Learning to let customers blow off steam was something I learned and knowing the products meant gaining the trust of the customer.
good,A good place to learn and build upon customer service skills.
good,"A typical day of work was just answering inbound phone calls for the project you were on. I learned a lot about the project I was working on and how to manage stress ant time management. "
good,"It is a a call center job so it sucks, but there are a lot of benefits."
good,Its my second time that i am working here and convergys is still the same but this is not the company to grow your ideas or to grow yourself in terms of work.
good,Very fast pace and lots to learn in a short period of time. You must pay attention to detail.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,The people were fun and the calls were not that difficult. Overall probably one of the easiest call centers to work for.
good,I really enjoyed the people and the job a typical day at work was a breeze. The managment there was ok the could have had better train to learn how they should respond in curtain situtations. their is no job sercurity at convergys.
good,Nice people to work with..great company...i love my coworkers
good,Not a real opportunity for advancement within the company.
good,Great opportunity to provide excellent customer service.
good,lots of training
good,when we got to work we found a seat at a cubical and put on our headset and got to work for the rest of the day we helped sprint customers on the phone about their bills or phone problems or to sell them phones or accessories i learned alot from this job and im glad i was able to learn wat i did
good,Sat at a desk answering calls for customers - answered detailed billing/troublesome calls/made things good for discouraged customers/made sales for upgrading for better service
good,"A typical day at work you have to answer between 50 to 80 calls per day, you have to answer all the question that customers have and also be able to solve their problems with DirecTv. You learn how to handle different situations and to listen to customers, the co- workers are a helpfull part of the job because they can also help you solve the problems the same as the management. The hardest part of the job is to learn how to listen to the customers and handle the calls carefully without being rude to them no matter how they are talking to you, but at the end of the day the best part is when you are able to solve those problems and the customers thank you for it."
good,Convergys is not a bad place to work if you like a repetitive work environment. Great for students and pays a decent wage. Work flow increases and decreases as a reflection of seasonal demand for services. Each branch of Convergys manages a different client and work flow may vary depending on the location.
good,sales based or goal oriented environment; scripted calls.
good,"Fast paced company with a lot of room for advancement. As long as you follow the guidelines of the company, sky is the limit."
good,"Convergys is a workplace that is very diverse and has several projects available to work on. I worked on the TruGreen project initially and a typical work day on this project consisted of an agent auditing inbound calls from customers interested in having their lawn serviced and also making outbound calls to save former customers. My co-workers on this project were very enjoyable to work with and I became close with most of them, forming a family-like environment which made it extremely exciting to come and work everyday. That would definitely be the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,productive and good environment to work
good,There are good team leads and bad team leads. I had a very good team lead but that still could not keep me there with all the other politics and silly rules. I'm not a robot so adhereing to when I take a break and when I take a lunch (timed unpaid 30 minute lunch) was not difficult just annoying.
good,Its a rough place to work but its worth it. Great compensation and benefits.
good,convergys is not good places to work. i love the customer more than anything.
good,"High volume call center. Technical support help line, warranty representation, full support and technical solutions. Customers would call in about problems with their electronic devices, I would research their issue, probe into possible causes, fix them if possible, and review warranty terms for replacement if within coverage."
good,"A typical day at work was logging into the phones and talking calls straight away, we had two 10 minute breaks a one 30 minutes lunch break a day. We were expected to keep our call handeling time below 5 minutes a call."
good,"You will cussed out on a daily basis and there is little help from management. If you can handle that, then it's the job for you."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Makes customer calls all day as a collector. and you know everybody hates collectors. so some calls can be mean and rude. but just got to hang in there and maybe you'll get a call that actually benefits you and make your day.
good,"I like the job itself, i just dont like the scheduling. The training for this job was pretty intense, but it is a pretty good environment to work in."
good,"A typical day would be me taking inbound calls. I assist with, Cable, Internet & phone Services."
good,"A typical day at work was to be on the phone for 8 or more hours a day. I learned more of computers, how to use a tone to make my voice more reasonable and many things of products of directv. My coworkers made the day easier everyday. The enviroment was pleasant. It didnt feel like a regular day at work. The hardest part of the job was the customers complaints and not being able to please everyone in the same way. It was stressful. There were times that the management seemed to not care but I think they are working on that. The most enjoyable part was the enviroment and the compensation of the sales. It made the day better."
good,That's about the only positive thing about working for Convergys. They require you to use their software which is a pain in the a-- to install and operate. Even on a high end PC it was slow and painful to navigate....and they expect you to field calls and handle them quickly? Forget it. They tell you when you interview that you'll get 2 weeks for training but after I started they told me training would be less than a week before they throw you into the fire. They took a 2 week training course from Amazon and try and cram it into 4 days. Don't expect to remember everything. If their software didn't take full control of your PC and was much easier to navigate it would have made the working experience a whole lot better.
good,"-A typical day at work would involve me answering questions about company products for customers as well as employees. When I am not busy taking calls to help out customers, I am helping employees on my team with company policies and procedures. I learned that no matter how much you do the same job at work everyday, you always learn something new about the job. Management was around from time to time to assist. Management were mostly in meetings through out the day. Most of the co-workers do get along and work well together in order to help out the customer. The hardest part of the job was not being able to help out paying customers right away, or not being able to provide the customers with more specific details when there were problems going on with the product. The best part of the day is to make a angry customer happy by the end of the call."
good,"The guidelines and project changed frequently. I had to be on the phones immediately and maintain a certain amount of time on the phone, leaving very little time for restroom breaks or questions. It was occasionally difficult to maintain the high quality of customer service the client requested and the speed management requested."
good,I liked my hours. Loved the pay. Co-workers were very diverse. crowded but I liked my job.
good,a company that at first valued their employees but as time passed that slowly disappeared
good,"The most enjoyable part of Convergy's would be the people and the environment, we listened to good, upbeat, updated music and everyone was so friendly, there was hardly any drama. On the other hand, Convergy's has a 75% turnover rate due to not making sale goals, as well as losing profit. Before I left Convergy's, I was 1 of the 3 people that were still employed there and I had a training class with 23 people starting out.. That's 20 people just in the people that were in my class that had been fired/quit within a 8 month period! The job is very stressful because you have to make sales every week to keep your job and its just so unstable, you would get written up by not meeting ""Average Handle Time"", ""Hold Percentage"", ""Transfer Percent"", and a few others that really wasn't your fault. I mean, you cant help how long your on the phone because a 70 year old woman calls in wanting to know how to set her ringtone, or someones bill is $1,600.00, or how long the other department takes to answer the phone.. So I don't think its right to write someone up for something that's not even their fault. The management and staff were great but I think they were more or less being pushed to do things they didn't want to do by their boss."
good,"Convergy's is very demanding and fast paced. They do not give you much flexibility. You have to work around their schedule and if you're 1 minute late from lunch, break or clocking in in the morning or if you need a day off, you accumulate points. Not the greatest employer."
good,Learned how to better understand people and how to make the customer happy. Hardest part was answering the phone to a very upset customer and trying to make everything better for the customer.
good,it is a good place to work the pay and bonuses are great but the team leaders are what lacks when you need help with something most of them are unwilling to help even though it is their job
good,The job helped me improve my communication & enhanced my decision making skills. The environment is friendly enough to make a individual work for 9hrs.
good,I am moving to a new area and looking to make changes in my life.
good,"When you first enter the floor after training you have an easier time finding help from your assigned superiors, but once that grace period is over it felt like getting fed to the wolves. You encounter all types of customers with any and all kinds of problems, some even unimaginable. I did not enjoy that just to locate my shift supervisor I would have an extremely hard time, I wasnt even notified I had a new supervisor or who the individual was. Any problems I had were made that much more difficult since I was never told of additioinal resources I had for help, such as a message board, and a direct chat with supervisor. I did however enjoy that the company provides great incentives, and has constant rallies to keep the employees upbeat and alert."
good,"My only issue with convergys is that your schooling must go around their schedule, which is almost impossible to go around. They are not willing to be flexible in the least. Outside of that, it's a great place to work."
good,"The job is your typical cubical job. The patients, doctors, and pharmacist can be a bit outrageous when it comes to controlling their attitudes. The job requires strong minded individuals with stuff skin and patience."
good,"If you have a family especially with small children please be specific with them. you have a shift bid. If you need a certain schedule you may not get it. You will have to talk to the ONE person that is in charge...and they avoid you. Typical day: after the 5 1/2 weeks of training...they throw you out on the sales floor, they help the people they want to. You have to sale Uverse to ATT customers that are already upset. Does not make sense right? Most enjoyable part I loved the pot lucks with our team,"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"was on phone for 8 hrs answering calls about cable service going out, had to trouble shoot with customers to get their cable back up & running plus sell them on different products"
good,Noisy work environment. Good chance for advancement. Average management. Low end wages.
good,"I feel because it has been around for so long it's harder to move up then experience with other positions I've had with other companies. Co- workers are good, some work harder then others and it isn't always noticed by management which can be difficult at times. The hardest part of the job is trying to get buy in from very tenured employees for new changes or implementations."
good,Really didnt trust upper management. The saying working at Convergys is they hire to fire.
good,I have mixed feelings---pay is great but the leadership is clueless.
good,if you looking for a way to make money just to get by while you look for a better job then Convergys is for you
good,"A typical day at work consists of talking on the telephone with customers about billing or programming issues. The hardest part the job would be explaining the issue and why it occurred to a cusotmer who is not interested and only what a quick fix. The most enjoyable part was talking to customers who were understanding and finding out what we have in common. From this job I learned, you can only help those who are willing to be helped, as well as how to multitask in a timely manner."
good,The rules and work hours changed on a monthly basis. One day you might work for one hour without notice and the next you would work eight hours. Unprofessional workplace.
good,A typical day at work for the Denver location was simply learning the ins and outs of AT&T and what the client and company had as expectations. My trainer was a great person and a positive force who wanted nothing more than to further your development and have fun while doing so. I was surrounded by positive influences who were there to work.
good,Not recommended unless you want to play political game.
good,"Overall this job is simple, however, it doesnt take much to get hired at Minacs and it shows with the amount of employees taking plenty of days off work, not doing it correctly, and thus causing the employees that actually care about their job to be forced by management to do double the work to make up for the absent employees. This would normally be okay, if it wasnt 2+ people being absent for more then 1 day a week, every week. Compensation is mediocre compared to other call center's in the area, and while upper management employees are well educated, the basic managers are poorly educated on management, etc. There is a LOT of flexibility, if you're looking for a job to take seriously and you dont mind the stress of doing 2x as much work as you're supposed to be doing daily, and not being compensated any more for it."
good,my experience at convergys was pretty good. the managers are very helpful to new agents because its not easy taking inbound calls and dealing with customers. the training does teach you the basics needed in order to handle calls but hands on is a lot better.
good,"Management did try their best unfortunately, it was disorganized and the communication between us and our clients was not very clear."
good,"At this place you have to deal with peoples issues and problems, in other words you have to baby-sit them because the customers are so hard headed and stuborn and cant do anything on thier own"
good,"There is no pay increase, barely any incentives or overtime, very unorganized, changing call proceedures constantly"
good,Good place to work if you want to get call center/customer service experience under your belt. Lots of favoritism and shady management though. Be prepared for constant changes.
good,This is a company that can really groom someone into being a really good customer service representaive to find better employment else where because most of the opportunity in this company is within management actual agents are not compensated as well as could be and raises and at times hard to attain and advancing into higher postions other than agent under management stay filled with tenure employee's.
good,"During my tenure at Convergys, I was able to gain valuable experience in dealing with a diverse range of situations. The most memorable and the greatest impact was assisting customers who were affected by Hurricane Katrina. At times it was very difficult to listen to their stories and pleas, though I did not mind going above and beyond for them. Working at Convergys has given me great experience that can be utilized in a variety of work settings. However, for personal reasons I was ""forced"" into a position to terminate my employment with them."
good,I only was there for a college placement for 120 hrs. The atmosphere of the work environment was okay. I had opportunities to sit with a variety of employees
good,"If you don't have a job and you're looking to start somewhere one Dublin, it's the right place. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Concentrix provided a good workplace culture, they trained people very well before endorsing to the account. They provided all the facilities that you need"
good,good and fun loaded working environment and there are supportive colleagues and trainers .typical day of work  starts at 7 am and ends at 5 pm .in between very less break time will get.
good,The concentrix (Lazada) Was fast improve that is the reason why the SOP keep changing for improve the product and services so the customer issue will be resolved as soonest.The challenge is there is no 2nd level.Everything was end to end
good,It was a really good experience it taught me how to use a computer how to take critisism well and how to improve in all aspects of the job i was also urged to do better so I could progress
good,Nice to work for but no room fpr advancement. The work with your schedule if ypu ate in school. They work woth different type of people with all kinds of backgrounds.
good,Oportunidade de crescimento; dependendo do produto baixo salários.
good,I really enjoyed working for the company when it was Convergys and I only left at the time because they close the company it had at the moment which was AT&T
good,Good team building for first few weeks but as progressed onto call listening and gradbay teaching is poor. Team leaders were having fights with nerf guns in the call centre. Whole job extremely unprofessional.
good,They offer a lot of seasonal accounts in which they promise you to be reconsidered for other accounts afterwards. That kinda suck since you need to adjust to new environment every 3 months
good,"El ambiente de trabajo es muy bueno, las personas son muy amables. Sin embargo la carga laboral es bastante pesada por lo menos, en la campaña de AT&T, entran llamadas constantemente y los inconvenientes son muy variados siempre son cosas diferentes."
good,Good environment. They conduct a lot of training to improve your skills. The salary was good also for a first timer like me. The HR and TA  team was approachable also.
good,I am not sure what concentric is. I worked at convergys not concentric.unzute what to write. Needs to research company. Cannot answer about pay or hours
good,"Each day was straightforward. There were a load of inbound calls to take which in my opinion are a lot easier to close than outbound. "
good,work place culture was good but according to growth perspective i find it difficult to continue with this organisation and management was also not so supportive in terms of learning and development .
good,"company is good however the areas of career growth is very less "
good,"They are very unreasonable, and they do not care about your life . Nor do they care about you’re children or you’re health . Other than that they are pretty ok."
good,"Not accomodating to families at all... very judgemental and strict, felt extremely repetative and everyone has a chip on their shoulder and shifts are given based off senority"
good,"6 von 10 Punkten,"
good,really stressful and not much support given when struggling. many people in there were not coping with the pressure thats why so many people had to leave including myself when i never got any consideration as i was still in school
good,work place is a little bit stressful but if you get in the right process then it will be good for your career and life support as well. perfect for the people who are ready to work in daily rotational and night shifts
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Great owners that care about their people. Great work-life balance. Excellent people to work with. The company is self-funded and in the black. Leadership's push for continuous improvement of processes, metrics, bonuses, and new benefits is great."
good,Working at a call center has its ups and downs. Sometimes you feel like you belong and others you really don’t. Some people you speak with over the phones are either really nice though frustrated but also can be really disrespectful and frustrating.
good,"Nice place to work. Nice facilities, cafe, and location. Didn't work here for too long because I was in between jobs at this time and just needed money."
good,"poor management, how ever staffs member was ok."
good,The place where convergys was located at that time was old. It needs to improve more on the workplace and some equipments are not working anymore. People there are very professional.
good,"very fast paced environment"
good,The company values their employees as well because they have a lot of programs and activities. They also have a lot of benefits for the employees. The best part about this company is that they have incentives.
good,"i liked the costumers i worked with but most of the people above us like managers i really didnt care for there were more chiefs then indians. i really like the routines, i have learned how to handle people more and how to read them. the hardest part of the job was the wall of shame for those who werent doing that well"
good,"This is a great company to start of the career. People are guided on how they can achieve their goals, though there's a lot of pressure (my opinion). Competitive salary too."
good,Horrible turn over rate. Those of us that begin have to make up for the slackers no matter what you have going on in your personal life. There is little to no care individuals.
good,"Not a lot to say about this company. The work environment was okay. Typical call center experience. Good training, good management. Good place to build cs experience."
good,Generally a easy place to work but this varies depending on team and position. Department I worked in was very friendly but no-one enjoyed their work. Female and POC employees regularly accosted by bigoted clients leading to high turnover. Limited room for growth.
good,"During my stay with Concentrix, I've learned a lot of things. I improved my communication skills that helped me alot in providing a world class customer service."
good,This place is ok if you don't have a lot of job experience and any education outside of high school. It is very relaxed as in you sit all day on a phone.
good,"Worked with some great people and moved up with the company. I was there for 6 yrs before being laid off due to loss of contract. I was a customer service rep, then a team sales specialists, a and ended my career there as a team leader"
good,I learned a lot working at Concentrix ( formally Convergys ) it was a very laid back job management were very helpful I think the hardest part of the job was getting into the computer systems at first.
good,"Can be a fun place to work, some departments work harder than others, it can be stressful. It's all about what you make it. Great advancement opportunities. Only drawbacks, too many young lazy folks."
good,Learned different types of equipment handling and preventive maintenance in the area of responsibility. time management regarding scheduled pm of equipment and at the same time with client visit and managing of Technical maintenance.
good,"I have never thought this is a permanent or stable thing for me. For agents, life is stressful and your Team Leaders and OMs expect a lot from you without considering how it affects you. They don't care if you're stressed, they need to make the hours."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I worked here for 2 years and 6 months. They have to work with the way the management provides a peaceful and healthy environment as this will drive associates to work better at their best.
good,Friendly environment but rather unorganized. Too many confusing issues to handle without clear explanation of reasoning. The pay rate is also a issue because of how stressful and dominant the job can be.
good,Its best to stay with to yourself some people are friendly but they already have a mean look on their face I don't no if it's becuase of the work space or they just upset with life but you shouldn't bring life issue issue into to work.
good,"Being the worlds second largest customer service provider, Concentrix is a company that has abundant manpower and opportunities provided you are willing to relocate. Employee Friendly with Job Security."
good,"If you are looking for a BPO you can join.. I was lucky enough to get promoted."
good,"The management staff is well versed related to work."
good,Anfangs war es ein angenehmes Arbeiten. Man konnte in Ruhe ein Projekt aufbauen. Mit der größe kam die Zahlen und darunter massiv die Qualität.
good,"the account that i had was very stressful, they pressure the employees, tho they are having us the nice and great environment. i gained a lot of friends,"
good,The location is good and work is fine. No stress and good colleagues. They are giving good hours but people are leaving because of less pay if they increase pay that could be more better.
good,"Nette Kollegen, Kundenservice ist leider nicht mehr im Fordergrund, was mich traurig stimmt."
good,"It was fine. Wasn’t a long run due to being laid off though. The people were nice. The job was slightly tideous but nonetheless, it was fun. Apple was a pretty good campaign to learn. It helped me know a lot more about my phone."
good,Always something new to learn always potential for new positions. Always keep an open mind for this type of job. You will learn the company culture as different events come into play.
good,Very stressful job but supervisors assisted w how to call procedures and reminded us that customers weren't mad at us just the situation. But casual place to work. Met some co-workers that became good friends.
good,I would recommend this job mostly to college students it is a hearty place for learning soft skills and teaches a lot of great problem solving techniques
good,This job is not necessarily a bad job.  This is a job that is meant for someone who is content with being lazy and not hardly moving.  You will sit in a cubicle for 8-10 hours a day and do absolutely nothing except talk on the phone.
good,"Overall rating is good, yet for the compensation its to little. "
good,Concentrix took over Convergys and issued the lay over notice. With convergys i served for seven years as customer service and sales agent for american express merchant services
good,"ive had bad days but thanks to the support of the TL's things got better.There were issues that needed to be resolved and thanks to the due diligence of the management ,all was resolved"
good,I liked my job and what I did but I was high risk pregnancy and it got in the way of my work. I enjoyed working from home but I couldn't sit down all the time. I enjoyed helping the customers but I didn't like that sometimes It would be a bad review off of a amazing call. So it was like being judge at all times by your managers.
good,It was a great experience to work with converge he's working with AT&T with telephones helping customers with the issues and the billing questions I had a great experience
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,If you need a job now they’re god for it. They have multiple accounts you can work for and are more thanks likely always hiring. It is a bit ghetto but not to the point it’s unbearable.
good,I learned so much from this company.My manager was very helpful.I am happy with job role and duties in all .They will help you to learn and apply that knowledge.
good,I worked there when it was Convergys. I do not know what concentix is like. It may be better. The pay could have been better for the experience I had.
good,"I didn't like how customers treated me, but that's what the job is. it's very difficult to get incentives here. They sometimes would have pizza as a thank you for working through system difficulties, but never considered vegans."
good,i didn't like working at concentric only because i was stuck at desk majority of the day and i need to move around. the staff wasn't too understanding and the management wasn't very responsible
good,It’s a nice company to work for if you’re looking for decent pay from a call center in the area. The atmosphere is relaxed and the attendance policy is too.
good,"Great team to work with, Ready to plan anything (pot luck, supper, etc). Team spirit was one of the main goal for this company and it was a great job experience"
good,"Concentrix is nice as a company, but lot of people in the management doesn't have core values as they say they are fanatical about staff however in reality they don't."
good,"This company is good in developing its people. It gave me the opportunity to improve on my leadership skills. I started supporting new hires until I was given the opportunity to handle my own team where I have proven the power of teamwork. I realize that motivating a team and ensuring a positive working environment can lead to positive results, no matter what the challenges are."
good,Average 'call-center' environment. Tons of Medicare knowledge is taught before going onto the call floor. Then you are dropped like a new born giraffe into the mix and you either sink or swim.
good,"A regular company but with a lot of a scope for improvement."
good,"Overall ok Company work from home option benrfits, pto, health, vision, dental, sick leave, holiday pay. Advancement only if in California l. Good co-workers"
good,This is a call center job and as you know the customer can be irritating.  The fellow employees are awesome and are helpful.  Management was hit or miss on some things.  I mainly did not like the schedules that were setup and how you got them.
good,"It was my first Customer support service. The job was nice, but unfortunately, the client (TripAdvisor) quit the language support so the company and my manager did not know what to do with me. Eventually, I found I new job in a company was paying more."
good,"Great Company to progress and gain valuable business skills. While the salary is not exactly ""competitive"", The skills and experience I have gained here have given me a firm foundation to grow and develop and successful career."
good,"Need to do what we do to grow. I learned a lot of knowledge by working here. The door to Apple was opened to me and I got to read all about their product. Respect apples work environment but this company was a third party vendor, thus pay was not great for the amount of work. The culture was very much busy and noisy. Once you get to tier 2 though the noise is much handled and a bit more appreciation but not enough pay."
good,The schedule shifting is not great. For me I want a fixed scheduled to balance my time with my 2 little children since I am a single mother.  Fixed scheduled is needed.
good,"N/A. Because really isn’t much to say. Hired through a third party entity and it’s all about who you know. You get good knowledgeable info on whichever client business you work under however the other downside is management, all in who you know.. you get it ?"
good,Work and life balance are a bit questionable. There is a minimum room for growth. There are amenities for relaxation during work hours and recreational facilities to help take the pressure off work
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Troubleshooting for client products.  Fast paced, lots of call and heavily measured stats.  Not particularly competitive salary, full training provided."
good,"It was ok at the time, worked with college schedule, but some days were slower than others making for long slow dragging days, but coworkers made days like those a little more bearable."
good,"The pay is GREAT! You can use your health insurance license anywhere in the US for 2 years. However, the company is basically a temp agency . There are no permanent positions there unless you're in management. It's a contract by contract job, so you're going through the hiring process every time a new project comes. This also means no benefits and work all holidays as well. The work environment is nice, clean, "
good,Concentrix was and interesting place to work. Performing in a call center was a little stressful and quick-paced but i was able to get through it and perform to the standards set for me.
good,"Vaste expérience dans le domaine d'assistance technique avec les grandes compagnies HP , ASUS; Bell , Dell..."
good,"It's great if you like being timed for everything and want no advice on how to improve. "
good,"It was an okay place to work at at time, but than at other time it felt like I went back into time to high school because it was a lot of drama that was going on up there."
good,We did customer support for our client's customers. We handled technical and customer service related calls in a normal working day and we catered to different nationalities and different cultures.
good,"it was a decent environment to work in. stressful "
good,"Not really impressed with the staff or the job, a lot of favortism they allowed a lot things that should have not been allowed to be in the workplace from the manner in which the staff talked to the agents to the dress code and the ineffective manner that could possible be seen was there."
good,"Concentrix is a very integrated workplace with high expectations for little pay. However, overtime is optional and helpful in receiving additional income."
good,"A professional approach in answering calls and provide information about products and services, taking input of issues and their redressal thereof. Maintaining records of transactions and interactions."
good,"Job was fun to work at, hard to focus, as there were a lot of new people working there. The turn over rate was very high so you had to basically be perfect,"
good,"-manage phone calls promptly "
good,Termine disponiert für Techniker der Telekom von Montag bis Samstag
good,I would help customers with their rental contracts. Assist team members with the closings for the day. Answer phone calls and answer all the customers questions.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Orice angajat incepe ca agent si este foarte dificil sa avansezi in cariera."
good,This is a very Average company to work for  and salary and benefits area almost peanuts. Extremely bureaucratic organization. Too much hierarchy and innovation is not promoted
good,"The best part of this job is the support.  There are so many avenues of support that, even though it can be a high stress and high call volume job, you don't feel overwhelmed much at all because of all of the proverbial safety nets."
good,"answering calls per day, how I would handle being in a closed in environment, management could be better, sitting in one spot all day long, making is the best part of my job."
good,"Shift work was good and did not change. Customer Service Associate -Clarify customer requirements; probe for understanding, use decision-support tools and resources to appropriately provide"
good,"Working from home with them was a temporary position. If things happened beyond your control, there was really no one to reach out to if you couldn't get your lead on the phone. You just had to handle things the best that you could to get the job done. You were basically on your own to take care of things and you are in a constant struggle to meet KPI goals."
good,I was basically in an outbound mobile sales team for vodafone Ireland which i enjoyed.
good,People was rude but understood because of different things doctors was ruse and help that you ask for was rude management was okay people had their pe
good,"Average experience working in this company, There no big problems but at some instance there is no proper help which make demotivated and makes fell in changing,"
good,Don't know where to start from. This was my first company and got a good team to work with. But yearly appraisal is not so good in this company. Overall it has major night shifts as it is a US based company.
good,The company relocated after buying out Convergys Corporation. Many people went for work to home opportunities within the company however many were not able to stay on.
good,It’s a great place to meet cool people but the work I mean calls are insane and they want you to go above and beyond and get paid little for it. The managers don’t really care about you they only care about the numbers and what will effect them. Don’t have a emergency because they would ask can it wait so their attendance won’t be effected.
good,Low pay late checks. Employees are great management could be better. Great location many position really not enough room for growth. Schedule and hours are decent
good,I would work here again in a heartbeat this was my ideal job and I will be applying for this job once again and I'm sure I will get haired back management was excellent
good,"It's okay for first-timers, average at best on all aspects. Just like any other BPO company, it depends on your one-up manager. Salary is okay, advancement is okay too, I got one. Work-life balance will depend where you reside, it's the commute that's gonna be the gauge."
good,"I worked here back when it was Convergys. Overall, it was a strange place. My teammates were interesting to say the least- but aside from some petty office drama, they were fantastic. We didn't really have a supervisor, we had a trainer who was flown out here from Florida to wrangle us for three weeks before we were left on our own. We were subjected to the usual call center torments- computer issues, rude people, strange scents, people dropping their drugs all over the floor, and a few 'delayed' paychecks. I left after constant, daily panic attacks caused me to develop some health issues. I'm sure it's better now that they're under Concentrix, though. I don't care to find out, but Concentrix seems MUCH better than Convergys was."
good,"Short training. I was not sure after training what my job consist of. When got on the floor after training, I did notknow how to find my resources to go to. Or how to fins them. Now I Am usually very teachable but seems the training did not help give them a 4"
good,Recently acquired. Hopefully new management is better than the old. They seem to be cleaning house with upper management. That's kind of stressful. Too many meetings in a day for middle management and upper management doesn't seem to understand that middle management cannot be on three places at once. Can quickly become hostile
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,The most terrible training place I am working at currently. Sent to another department and the manager’s in the new position are great. Love my new position and dislikes the possibility of our job closing soon.
good,"A decent job if you're looking for a consistent paycheck with limited advancement. From my experience, the more motivated individuals end up leaving the company due to lack of opportunity for professional development. "
good,we spoke to a lot of wealthy customers because the service we were sailing is a luxury product most people wouldn't pay monthly for. But great experience
good,This company is pretty unorganized. I don't know if it's bc it's merging with another company or what. The left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing most of the time. Training is sub-par. You are on the phone all day very busy place. They hire a whole lot of young people. If you're older you might feel out of place. This place can be very ghetto also. But most of the people are nice. I didn't have any problems just a little lonely bc you don't get to really know anyone. The pay is good if your not temporary and good benefits too.
good,I would have liked the job better if the coworkers i worked with were better people. the people that work there tend to be catty and talk about people excessively.
good,Good environment but minamal hours weekly . They would work with your schedule however there was a dead line on when you can provide them your school schedule
good,To work with Concentrix is great experience. I learned new technology of Voice & worked with overseas clients. Overall i improved lot working with concentrix & it was fun working.
good,It was a good place to work when I was working there. There was slot of overtime offered and there was opportunity for advancement but not as much as you would think.
good,Basic customer service job. Paid hourly plus bonus for meeting metrics. Were quick to fire you if you didn't follow 6 steps. Had to ask probing questions.
good,"Was hired for seasonal work with the belief that it would transition to another job. That didn't happen was terminated without explanation. Wasn't emailed why, just couldn't log in to work email one day called tech help and was told i was terminated."
good,Egalité et liberté en parlant de culture et education
good,"I never give reviews but the job was just to much at a point , it got very difficult to chose schedules ! I loved the people and environment but the management was horrible"
good,"I was at this company for eight years. I went through three different clients and thought I was fine until the last project gave a change up. I would have preferred to have been fired after not fulfilling their requirements, rather than be strung along. I later learned that the project management got dysfunctional and soon pulled out."
good,The management there was great. I never had a problem that could not or would not help me with. It was a very enjoyable place to be employed. I would highly recommend it.
good,Concentrix would usually make raffles and fun games for their employees. My workplace was full of positive attitudes and we enjoyed interacting with one another. We learned many skills such as quality and appreciation and that was what we enjoyed the most. The hardest part of this job was having to make perfect calls because every little thing such as dead air or too much time in the call could ruin everything.
good,A typical day at Concentrix is busy in my department.  I have learned the different types of network topology Concentrix uses as it relates to admin access and user access.  I have an awesome team of supervisors and the culture in the workplace is multi-faceted.  The hardest part about the job is learning the names of new hires and the new client applications that are constantly changing.  The most enjoyable part of the job is doing my job.  I love what I do.
good,normal work ambiance in a BPO industry. a little more stressful at work. the bosses are just to everyone. Concentrix has yearly incentive based on the employee's performance.
good,"The company is not necessarily bad, but it isn't great either. Just at this type of call center work you had to listen to a lot of other peoples drama."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I did not like working there"
good,"Taking in calls and chats with concerns about their bill, services and inquiries about new service. My knowledge in Customer Service increased tenfold and the management is okay. The workplace is better compared to other call centers. The hardest part of the job was when we took in both calls and chats. Enjoyable part of the job is whenever a customer's concern and issue is resolved."
good,"Converges is no longer in business. It has been bought by Concentrix and the management has changed."
good,"Good company to work for, really starting to live its values and invest in people, clear progression plan for anyone wishing to advance their career great people to work with"
good,Too stressful for me. I keep missing work by being sick from stress caused by this job. The hours are inconsistent and the schedule is too strict. The training doesn’t last long enough to learn everything so your stuck struggling after transition.
good,"when i started with the company i was very anxious about how i was going to do my job and if i were to do it properly, however the trainers and the management were very helpful and supportive, when i became a full time worker, there was always someone there that could help, however the hardest part of the job was an irate customer, or having to fight with the computer system when trying to assist a customer, i enjoyed working there."
good,"Daily Activities"
good,"It’s a very easy and stressfree job, at least in the part time department. Pay is pretty good but the hours aren’t the best as far as time and how much you can get. Makes for a good 2nd job for people who work full time; also a good job for college students looking for something not too demanding. Overall it’s a very laid back environment. However, if you want something more demanding as far as labor or need more hours, this isn’t the job for you."
good,This job was okay. I worked for this company when apple was a client. We did a lot of work for little pay. The turn around rate was through the roof so there was a bunch of changes during the time period I worked there.
good,Nice place to work for. Overall good to their employees and flexible. Tries to work with employees and cares about employees. I would work there again if I moved back to Florida
good,Goals were set and accomplished daily.  Supervisors were very helpful and insured quality training. Fun environment to work in.  nice and clean work areas.
good,"The LOB I was assigned before is quite easy than the current businesses. I was blessed not only with great team leaders but friends for keeps. Convergys, or now knowns as Concentrix, is a great place to learn if you are a newbie in this industry. Some down points are the salary and changes in the management."
good,I enjoyed working with the co-works.  Working environment was okay.  Had fun working there. Can't complain and often had parties and pot lucks.  Location was an ideal place for me.
good,"from what I've heard, Concentrix is a very nice place to work, filled with loads of opportunities,  lots of ways to move up in the company. they have a strong willed team."
good,"Convergys was a ok place to work, they regularly had meetings with us to get ideas on different ways to provide great customer service and often provided overtime and schedule switch"
good,Leader nel settore del customer service. Azienda ambiziosa e dinamica.
good,Rusk state could be a very good place to work it’s not the patients it’s the upper management they don’t know how to treat their staff. After you finish your shift sometimes they would make you stay the next shift
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"a good company  and fun workplace specially when your with your friends and colleagues .Though the account is quite demanding when it comes to sales an meeting your metrics, its a challenge to all of us specially to meet our monthly metrics .the hardest part of the job is meeting the monthly goal, everymonth there are metrics that is being added to your scorecard which sometimes you cant control since its customer opinion. When we are having this kind of hardship we always look the fun and bright side of our work..and that is our friends and managers who are supportive."
good,"I learned more knowledge in customer service while working for Concentrrix and was able to work through some challenges along the way that have made me a stronger and more reliable, valuable employee."
good,"My position as EREV (Extended Range Electric Vehicle) Ambassador was also with Concentric, providing assistance to GM electric vehicle owners and helping solve issues or concern with their vehicle.  Limited growth potential."
good,"You need a pay check and they need someone to take calls, depending on which project you get placed on  you'll have a large check in a stressful environment or an okay check in a not as stressful environment."
good,"It was a alright experience working for Concentrix. Had its perks, but wasn't the best. You got bonuses and stuff, but that depends on what LOB you worked for."
good,"Worked full time, annual raises, good benefits. management was nice. room for advancement in the account. good training. If you worked after hours no where close by for lunch."
good,While working with concentrix have learn many more things to handle the team and work are been assigned to me I used to complete in the given target time and acknowledge the client as well.
good,"While I worked at Concentrix I felt under the impression that it wasn't exactly fair in regards to point of sale and terms and conditions truly being comprehended. Other than this, the most difficult portion is bad customer harassment opposing good customer service, which is an ongoing problem for lines of work in customer service."
good,"quick paced, 1-2 minute calls, easy but boring. lots of overtime. flexible if you were going to school. pay was 12.25. they're closing the project down tho."
good,"it is very tough to work with Concentrix when at first the interview has taken place, therefore this company is not just as easy as a walk in a job but rather building up your whole being confidently."
good,Caring employees but training required for the position wasn't enough time. Should be a month if not 2. Didn't get to go thru everything or learn everything needed. Skipped and rushed thru a lot.
good,It is an okay place to work. Unless you get shift you would like your hours may vary. My hours were typically either 11/1130 to 730/8 or 230pm to 11pm the hours do not work for me. Sundays they are not open so you will always have Sunday's off which is great. Most shifts you are scheduled for Saturdays either 830am to 5pm or 1130 to 8pm when they close on Saturdays. Paid holidays after 60 days.
good,"The place was very nice and they put you through training and help you step by step on how to do your job,  although it could’ve been longer!  They did throw us right on the saddle a bit too soon."
good,Pretty good place to work. We work with patients who need help filling there meds. We Take refills and status checks. It's a good paying job. And the bosses are really nice
good,"I really like everything about Convergy's / Concentrix EXCEPT the pay is just not what I am used to and worth. I Need More Money, I Need More Money, I Need More Money,"
good,"Low salary and incentives package. "
good,"Being a total fresher with no experience was little scary. I learned to be polite and soft spoken in a customer service field. "
good,"Easy work"
good,"Just need to be better organized. The pay was not bad. Did not have enough seating in the work area. Was on a timeline. This job allowed me to understand the health care world for medicare for the disabled, poor and senior citizens."
good,Company called Convergys. It was a great place to work until the decision was made to outsource the Information Technology department.  Once the outsourced training was complete the company started letting people go.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"They have all the benefits you could want from 401K, & discounts, to renters and car insurance. The people are fine. We just want more money for what we do."
good,A Job For Someone Straight Out Of High School The Job Itself Is Very Easy And Just Need Simple Communication And Problem Solving Skills. Very Social Environment
good,the workplace is very productive and the staff is very kind they always guide us on what to do in our task. the most enjoyable part is we bond to our superior if there is an event.
good,lunch breaks should be at least 45 min. better pay raises; no salary caps; we should have cardio equipment to workout on on site; some type of grief counseling program on site; better cafe options on site
good,"Customer service jobs are always great for adding experience with multiple skills, I learned trouble shooting, customer services and requests. Handling customer profiles, confidential financial information."
good,"A typical day at was fast work pace, Answering calls with helping customers with their services, Being able to trouble shooting and fixing issues for the customers."
good,"Check out Google and GLassdoor for how working at Concentrix."
good,Don't expect to get your w2's after you leave.They lock you out of the sytem everyway they can.Regularly correct your address so they go to some stranger.Rehires complained to me even before I left.Hr on site is horribly rude about it an practically yell upon entry into the office you have to call costa rica.Who says they have no file..Unless you can provide your employee number you never used when working....The only reason they occasionally mess up an give paper checks to people who have direct deposit is because they have zero intentions of makeing a way for people to see their actual w2s......ever...that story wasnt just mine.
good,It is a stressful job but not a bad place to work. Having to work with people doing tech support can billing questions can be hard but being a people person helps. As long as you're willing to learn it will be good.
good,"This place is okay to work, but it can be very stressful. The main problem with it is not having the proper training. They want you on the phones constantly, which is fine but all the other work you have to do must be done during those calls. so you cant focus on the client on the phone 100%"
good,Was only with Concentrix for a short time after they acquired the company that I was working for. I was with my old company for over thirty years and was let go a few months after.
good,"Overall the pay aligns with the labor of the job and the benefits are great, however the management and some of the people that are put into management roles are far from stellar. The communication is lacking which is what I believe the problem is within the company. All of the meeting and greeting that is done upon hiring do not continue throughout the course of your time at the job because managers within the same departments do not all share the same knowledge of employee issues and requests. It would take far too long to sum everything up and express my dismay with the structure of this company. If you’re hired here just keep in mind that you’ll have to really chase team leaders, mangers and HR down to accomplish anything you request (I.e. sick time off, mistakes on paychecks)."
good,good place to work if you are open to doing long shifts as much as possible. night shift work available also and overtime a lot good place to work overall
good,Excellent training in customer support and sales. Conducive and safe working environment with great facilities. Average basic pay. Recommended for fresh grads without any BPO experience.
good,"Concentrix was a good call center, it was organized and productive. My only issue is I felt less like an employee and more of a worker ant, so to speak."
good,"I loved the people I worked with at Concentrix, but the higher ups didn't understand how things truly worked. They didn't care if you had families and what shift worked best for the employee. They were great if you were one of their top and favorite employees."
good,It is a good company to work for. I can not say much more because I have not been here very long. As far as I can tell it's ok but ever company can use growth.
good,"It's a good environment. With a lot of room for improvement. "
good,"This is a nice place and they mold me on how to be a better agent. They taught me how to discuss bills, fix technical issues provide option to customer"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,job was a cool environment .. met some cool people .. pay was okay you would work overtime .. very laid back but it could hectic when the new iphones come out
good,"Respectful, Considerate and Understanding Leaders . Perfectly good environment, Lots of engagement activities for the employees to joined in for stress reliever and satisfaction"
good,After several mergers there has been a steady decline in benefits and compensation. Company recently lost a contract for IT support and is laying off employees without any severance.
good,"This was my first call center job and I learned a lot from the position. I was even promoted after 6 months. What I did not like was the workplace environment, there was not enough management to keep everyone on the floor busy."
good,"Do not give a lot of support to employees. They are more concerned with stakeholders than employees. They are starting to loosen up a little, though. However, not enough to retain talent."
good,Convergys has been my 2nd home for almost 10 years. i have developed my self as a person and also as an employee. this company makes sure that you have the proper knowledge skills and also the tools that you need to perform your duties and provide further enhancements or skill development program. the programs are not only for couple of session but is a continuous learning for employees. leaving the company was a heart breaker but the move was for my family.
good,"unorganized "
good,"This is a place that will give you the tools to do your job successfully to their standards. The human element of attitude or ability to control your own emotions under stress, will be what determines your success or failure."
good,"Convergys was a reasonable place to work as some days it was okay to be there and others it was not, due to lack of management quality, and progression. Many of the managers that I met at this company did not seem fit to be managers. Progression was always mentioned and multiple times promised, however the progression was given to the ones that least deserved it or abused the 'power' that came with it. Convergys as a company is a very good and very supportive place to work, however the people that were recruited or people who were given progression did not deserve the progression. I left the company due to no progression, leading to a decision of relocating to a new area in the UK and look for alternative work in different lines of work"
good,"Convergys helped me learn many new things and groom my professional life, i was rewarded many times at Convergys, but after i quit Convergys i understood what is work life balance and how an effective Management and Culture of any good company should be."
good,"took calls in regards to tec h support for ipad, ipod and iphones."
good,When I was interviewed for the job I eas only told I was going to answer the phone. No details was given about the job or requirements. It was only later in training a lot of us were explained what we were answering the phone for.
good,"Fast-paced, productive place to work.  Definitely had many accountability buddies.  Most of the managers were great mentors and were always happy to help.  We didn’t see the higher-ups much.  Pretty relaxed places to work as long as you showed up on time and knew what you were doing."
good,"Bilingual contracts dont get the same treatment as the english contracts, yes we get paid a little more that the english contract but we were told its bc we talk in spanish and write in english, but we also have to pick up the slacks of the english contract even after all the english contract leaves at 10pm"
good,If you don't how to type that will decrease your chances because that is the basic form of communication when being on a computer all day. Also verbal.
good,It is an easy job to do. They have several accounts they can have you work on. I took calls for a time share company and also calls from catalogs for people placing orders.
good,Nothing much to shout about. Overall OK. Provide all the basic perks. Nothing wow nor bad comment to be accorded to the organisation. Recommended employers.
good,The night shift is the busiest shift. The people there are friendly and the team leaders are always taking care of your needs. The salary is not that good in comparison with other companies. As I said is a good place to get some experience.
good,Filing papers of the clients and stuff using the shared drive and MS Excel. I learned how to deal with short-tempered clients and also on how to deal with pressure. They have a nice workplace and very clean offices and rooms. The hardest part of the job is they have so many paper works that they need to pass on deadlines.  The most enjoyable that I learned for being an Intern is I learned a lot from my surroundings and people that I met in the company.
good,I can sustain my family needs. But we are having hard time with our vacation leave to be approve. The supervisors are bias. The company is classy. Lots of incentives and benefits. Its just that I need to work at home because of my kids.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I'm being paid well but the practices inside a call center industry are exhausting. It needs more free time and freedom inside the industry or the people inside will always leave.
good,Great environment. Flexible work schedule as it was shift work in a call center. It was temp to hire job so you had to work really hard to prove yourself.
good,"Working here is like working at a fast food place almost. You can get your standard 40 hours a week but when it comes to overtime, its hard to get. the business it self is professional but its not good management team. they have favorite too."
good,It was a fun place to work learned and gained a lot of patience with call center experience. We got along well with others and had several employee activities as well.
good,"have not worked here in 4 years. was a great place to learn how to become a sales/customer service rep, learned to build a lot of value with customers"
good,"Company is high on engagement and employee development "
good,"big on sales and cross selling products too formal  had to read script . metrics were high. and pay was low benefitswere expensive and unattqinqble without giving up your paycheck,"
good,"Used an automatic dialing system; maintained a complete debt collection portfolio using the support framework design"
good,Convergys was a pretty relax place but the management is everywhere and the pay is not all there for what they have you do but with my case I think I was treated very unfairly for the reason why I was let go
good,"The benefits were good, but the daily hassle of dealing with unhappy customers of a major mobile company weren't. You would literally have people cussing you out over issues you either are not allowed to fix or had nothing to do with the cause of."
good,"Calls would come in, we would have to clear the queue. Great pay and even more so the opportunity to grow within the company, they would randomly offer overtime."
good,"Days and hours of schedules change from week to week, makes it very difficult to make plans or appointments. Unable to used accrued PTO for sick days."
good,"Experience with Convergys was not good as I expected this company to be, working hours are long, too much travelling time, incentive are there but due to many riders it next to impossible to earn them"
good,"Many managers that wasn't studies for management peoples, and I wish mush better administration and selected the staff for these are betters.( with degree in human Resour)"
good,ok company to work for. slightly unorganized.  They are very last minute in assigning additional tasks or trying to meet deadlines.  The pay is bi-weekly and now starts people off at 13/hr.
good,Call center atmosphere.  Very busy place to work.  Call center closed down due to funding and out of a job completely.  No place to go back to work there.
good,"Overall, I like the people I worked with. The pay structure is almost non-existent and with very little room to make more money unless you change the campaign you work for. With close to 10 years tenure Ive not received a bonus whatsoever."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,It was an okay place to work. If you like answering phones and dealing with some people screaming at you. But they do the point merit system. Which means after so many late days and sick days you can be fired.
good,"nice managers and staff"
good,Dealing with customers on a daily basis regarding their cell phone account charges. Assisting in the activation of their cell phone when possible or referring them to a phone center if problems cannot be resolved over the phone.
good,"I was an excellent customer service representative at Convergys, but the overall professional climate there began to get worse and worse meaning that they were hiring people who were not doing their jobs correctly or efficiently.I was doing my job correctly, but noone ever made notice of it. I was grateful to have a job, but the management team and the team coaches really need to improve on every level.."
good,"At Convergy's I started as an inbound call representative for AT&T out of the US. I worked my way up to Team Leader where I managed and trained 20- 25 individuals. I would get teams that were not meeting call quality and quantity. I would train and support this team to have them, excelling in every matrix. Then the management would take this team and replace them with another team that needed help."
good,"The people were awesome and helpful the whole time,my supervisors were amazing at there job and was always helping and willing to listen, it was a  very good experience for me"
good,it was something like a lot of drama u know like definitly felt like highschool and management was something else like they was always stressed and angry
good,"Taco bell was a good place to work, lots of hours. Friendly people. I didn't leave on bad terms. I left because I moved to a different city that didn't have a taco bell"
good,convergys is a contract company working with various fortune 500 companies to provide customer service. the training is very well done and the staff is very helpful in helping you meet or exceed expectations and metrics.
good,It was a call center so there were calls coming in constantly.  You had to make sure to give them the correct information or find someone who has the correct information.
good,"I really did not like my time as an agent, it was stressful from the fellow employee, customers and management levels. Constant drama not needed in the workplace."
good,"If you are interested in a sales position or just starting out in sales and would like to get your feet wet, it would be a good place to start for you."
good,"still not get the good opportunity but ill try to upgrade my skill to get the proper job into my field. I know its hard but definitely, I will get the job"
good,"working student"
good,"Flexible Schedule , Friendly People"
good,"Okay company to work for."
good,It was a very challenging position but it was quite resourceful. We were a cancellation retention department so we basically tried to assist the customers with there issue while trying to persuade them to keeping a business relationship some people were unhappy so that made the job a challenge but we saved other customers so it was a positive job as well
good,"It was the best company to work for out of college.  Today, the company is known as Netcracker.  It is only a fraction of the size that it was when I worked for the company.  I cannot comment about recent corporate environment there."
good,"If you enjoy interacting with customers and can handle getting yelled at by technologically ignorant people who have entitlement issues than this is the place for you. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"the job was enjoyable for the first few years, the perks were nice at first, they soon went away, the raises were far and few, my co-worker I loved being around."
good,"convergys was a good job for a young person who is wanting call center experience. "
good,"The culture  and  the  salary really depend on the account. It is great for newly hired agents, but not enough opportunities as you move up the ranks."
good,It was a good opportunity with excellent hrs and pay. As long u organized and please the customers the results are good. My job was to take care of the consumers needs
good,"The training process was wonderful. However, after the training I felt kind of thrown to the wolves. I think a little more mentoring or shadowing could have been done to help with the transition."
good,"always a busy day"
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is its proximity to my place.well not so organized management and the hardest part of the job is to multi task troubleshooting 3 campaigns at the same time.
good,"Learned how to fix a lot of issues with apple products. Meet a lot of new people, Gained new friends, Many opportunities were available as well. But the drama could’ve been non existent"
good,"Company was ok just to far and the pay was not great, sometime fun environment at times commission was ok.. you could advance, altho the turnover rate was high"
good,"Answering sale-related inbound calls and providing good customer experience, making them one of our advocates in our company. Supportive TL's and SME's"
good,"Typical day at work sometimes becomes boring as there is nothing new to do. In this organisation I learned management skills, team leader skills and lots more. Management of this organisation was good. The hardest part of the job was to analyse the situation and respond accordingly, if one mistake then there is lot of impact on the job and in the team performance. The most enjoyable part of the job was there was a lot of time when there was no work to do."
good,"Online pre-screen testing"
good,"Great work experience. Very welcoming company for everyone who simply just wants to work. Training was for 4 weeks which was just fun, they give you some information about products and prepare you for role plays. Then, Academy for 2 weeks they assess you on the phones whether you can do it on the floor or not. Once passed the academy, you're on the floor where you are going to learn everything on your own with the help of mentors and floorwalkers. Most of the managers do not help you or tell you to ask floor walkers or ring help desk which is bizarre. You're supposed to do internet banking, credit cards and other general enquiries all at once which is so confusing for the new beginners. It takes 2/3 months to get comfortable on the phones with the customers if you survive luckily until then. It's definitely a job for First time job seekers to get some experience here, if you get promoted to mentor level or step ups people stay otherwise most people just leave after 6/7 months due to bad and long shifts and when they look other companies paying more for same handwork and they have better shifts there too."
good,"Concentrix is not a good company to work for because they do not know how to communicate with you, and their systems are always down. They need to have more trust in their work at home agents."
good,"The Classes to learned your job was very helpful. Teacher/Manager was helpful, nice, and understanding. They have a policy that you can't miss anytime. I did about a month in the classroom learning the job. The last two weeks of the training you were put in another room and took live calls. They were there to help you along the way. They did offer good insurance and other incentives. People were very nice to work with. I you get stressed easy or have anxiety this job may not be for you"
good,it used to be fun to work at convergys in the beginning but then towards the end it started to get bad. management wasnt doing what they were supposed to be doing instead did whatever or whomever they wanted
good,"Concentrix is a mostly home based employer. They have hire employees to work for other companies whom are their clients. So as an employee you work Concentrix not the client. Concentrix does all of the training and payroll. In my opinion, that's what makes them different other companies. They are able to promote and move employees sideways if need be. Which can be beneficial to someone who wants to move forward in their career."
good,The job is okay but other jobs from smaller companies offer bigger pay
good,"They provide good training at the begin to get you on track with the progress to get you on the floor to make calls or answering calls , okay work place just a lot young people"
good,"i enjoye learning how to help customers solve cell phone issues, understand bill charges.  he diversity was beautiful and most fun part for me.  the hardest part was not always being able to help an upset customer."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Help Microsoft end users with technical difficulties with the software that they acquire. Do installation, virus removal, pc tune up and necessary software repair if needed. Making sure that every call is a good customer experience as well as insuring the resolution of the issue."
good,customer service answered calls for billing and sales for att uverse
good,Working at convergys was a great start to making money as a first time job. It was good that they had a double 15 minute break for everyone. The working environment was quick paced as calls did come in pretty fast but overall it was an ok place to work.
good,"Very productive day never not anything to do"
good,"If you are young and just starting your career, than Convergys may be the place for you. Decent benefit package for newbies after 60 or 90 days. For the semi-retired or retired this may not be the best place to work. Inter-generational concept is not practiced. Some employees and supervisors develop inappropriate workplace relationships. If you ask for help they view the person as ""slow."" Too much talking on the floor. Some supervisors should be re-trained and learn to separate colleagues and customer call center partners from ""friends."" Eliminate the favoritism in the Center."
good,I worked on a variety of different projects and fielded a variety of different calls. I was able to move up to the Quality Assurance department and enjoyed doing  that job for a number of years.
good,"If say if you're good at selling and making deadlines, this is for you. It wasn't so bad until a certain company came into the picture. It's stressful because not only do you habe angry customers on the line but the pressure of your manager telling you that you HAVE to make sales. Very stressful, high call volumes. This job is guaranteed to make you a smoker."
good,"Good work environment, fun place to work. Great work atmosphere. Friendly environment. Extensive training. Management is friendly. Decent pay. Good benefits."
good,Friendly environment. The management is great. Enjoyed being a part of the company since day 1 because I meet new friends. Queuing but satisfying because I would be able to help accountants with their payroll problems.
good,My location was one that had a very unique atmosphere. And that is not being completely negative or positive. It largely depends on whom your team leader is and the connection that you are able to make with them.
good,Workers are unprofessional and do not care about their job. would be a good place to work if workers were professional. Maybe if the employees were paid more they would care about there position.
good,"Call center tech support. I started off taking support calls and moved up to the floor support role where I assisted other reps with their calls, as well as taking escalation calls. The hardest part was handling impossible demands."
good,Convergys is so ghetto they will fight in the middle of the call center and the mangement is poor the people they hire it's like they hire any body it's just not a good place
good,"The company deals in third-party customer service.  Because of the changing landscape of the various companies we assisted with their customer service needs, there was not always a consistent feel of security on what you would be doing."
good,I worked with many of friends here. This was a fun job and  I found it exciting and usually always different. I really enjoyed talking to people from a different country.
good,Ive learned to remain focus .stay concered for customers showing empathy .ive also learned to be kind and be patient especially with dealing with elderly over the phones . I. learned about varieties of medications .i was a over achiever and one of the best sales assoicate based on performance and quality but due to a few absences i had to conclude with resigning because the enviorment wasnt professional around me and it led me to having no friends on the job that slighty made me feel uncomfortable .the most enjoyable part of my job was talking to the members and realizing how good i was at the task at hand .
good,Convergys was a relaxed company you were able to bring food and drink to your work station you were able to get help when needed. Your lead was always there to answer questions to make sure you provide excellent costomer service.
good,The meetings are not within shift. the work is stressful and they're asking for a lot of metrics to passed. I just don't really feel happy working here
good,Loved helping people during tax season. Fun job enjoyed it hated to see the contract end. It was difficult to communicate with the bosses. Mine were training new people and when your computer is down you are not getting paid.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,this company did allow for the beggining of my career in customer srevice there was constant tyrainings  even though some of the assisgments were not very goal focused
good,"If you like people yelling in your ear before you say hello, this is the place for you. If you like getting written up for not being able to find a seat because there are none available, work here. And most of all if you like being told that you are taking to long to deal with a call and you been on the phone for less then 5 minutes...please work here."
good,"I have been working at Convergys full-time (More than a year)"
good,Overall I enjoyed working for Convergys and was disappointed when they closed here in MN.  I did put in a lot of effort for my team when I was a team manager and am discouraged since basically both contracts I worked for ended here due to wages and location.
good,"worked there years ago, was a decent place. Management was lacking and uniformed on what was going on.  It is a third party vendor so the contracts change"
good,"Overall good company to work with unless you have a family and need a set schedule. schedule is always changing, they call it shift bid, based on your performance they will determine how much you qualify for the schedule you want. If you're a leader they will always work with you. as long as your colleagues cover each other's back you would be ok. everyone is always willing to help in the leadership department  and the Operation Managers always try the best to accommodate and help you advance in the company."
good,Enjoyed working from home for over 4 years. Worked in an actual call center for 2 years. Its a lad back place to work especially if you work from home. The supervisors want to help you learn and become a good customer service agent.
good,"I learned a lot here with this company, they allowed me a chance to gain hands on experience in a fast paced environment. Also providing me with on site training making it easy to move forward as a strong leader for the company. So many more things I can add, I had a great time and I am looking to move forward with my next career adventure. I will make a great asset to any company."
good,"atendimento de chamados técnicos, diagnósticos de hardware e software."
good,Busy fast paced environment continuously growing and getting busier without compensation for adapting Concentrix purchased Minacs in 2016 and all previous company practices and policies were changed
good,"On a typical 8 hour shift you could be expected to field roughly 480 calls on average. Each call is only supposed to last an average of 115 seconds which didn't really work well. The role of pharmacy technician in this call care center was supposed to help take pressure off of the in-store pharmacy technicians but with the limited ability to perform certain actions and the quotas we were supposed to stick to it didn't really help the stores' efficiency. The strict statistic adherence pitted everyone against each other in competition for the best work hours and you could be penalized for not making the best ratings. The hardest part of the job was telling customers certain medications that were expensive and necessary for their health were being denied coverage by their insurance and sometimes even their reactions to the news was horrific.Another challenge to overcome was their strict login schedule, you were not able to login to your computer more than 5 minutes before your shift was due to start however logging into the system could take up to six minutes and discrepancies of 1 minute were considered bad. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to dress comfortably."
good,"It is THE company to start your career with but not THE one to spend too much time with once you cross your initial growth objectives (Give it 5 years if you are starting from the grass roots)..."
good,I worked both part time and full time at Concentrix. They had flexible scheduling while I was at school and every week they would organize various events. The supervisors and the employees were very friendly and I enjoyed working at Concentrix. They also provided benefits apart from the biweekly salary.
good,Working with convergys as a customer service representative is not that easy because of its  night shift schedule and the location is quit far from our house but even if that the case I enjoyed working as an agent and I learned a lot from my workmates and clients.
good,i dont want to talk about why my reviews are the way they are. i had a bad experiences with this company. im not going to belittle them on social media that is between me and the company.
good,"The typical day is hectic and fast paced....... As long as you listen to and do what management requires of you, everything will work out but you must be willing to follow instructions."
good,"Long hours"
good,"Overall not a bad call center environment, however management often inconsistent. The hardest part of the job was often learning to deal with irate clients, remembering to remain calm and the goal is of course to give assistance to the caller. It is important to not take the negative issues personally, but to enjoy the idea of helping others."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,You have to have alot of patience to do this job. some customers call in just to cuss you out and some just want to sit on the phone and talk. they have a 12 point system in place and it is a revolving door
good,"It is a stressful place to work at..mainly because customers always call upset and are angry with us.It is fun helping customers at times,so me trainers are really good"
good,"Take inbound calls, assist with customers needs to trouble shoot and fix their equipment. To help them understand the security options. Help with rememebering passwords and usernames"
good,"I have worked with this company in the early 2000, 2002 to be exact and left the first time 2008, this last time has been relaxing more so than the first time. However as nice as this place is especially for those young workers that are starting and those finishing life, but my focus has been more personal and do not really want to leave."
good,"nothing much , work culture is good , disciplined, learned about the Customer service and understood BPO"
good,The company I worked for was very fast paced it was comfortable. Very goal driven and team oriented. Learning was very sentimental and it's a nice place to work.
good,"I assist customers with Comcast business services anytime they may have technical"
good,"A typical day is 30 to 40 phone calls"
good,"When I did work for Convergys they offered all benefits  medical, dental and 401k. They supervisor were kind and helpful. They offered incentives to help motivate moral."
good,"taking back to back calls sometime fun sometime stress, every days was diferent, I used to activities they make for emplayees  and insentive pay every 3 month"
good,Worked there for a very short period of time. Very nice management a few not so nice. The people that worked there were very friendly it was nice to come into work. A little stressful and I did not appreciate the rotating schedules.
good,I took this job because I needed to work.  I learned to do the job but it was not something I want to do for a long period.  The job consisted of answering the phone and assisting clients in setting up repair services.  I did not like the constant phone contacts because it required reading a script.
good,"It was the people that I met there that made the place what it was. The work, at times, could be stressful depending on what type of call you would receive. The day depended on how you would make of it. Some days were better than others and some calls were better than others. I had some pretty great managers who care about their team and others who only cared about themselves. It was a means to an end job and allow me to work full time while I went to school part time."
good,convergys is an okay place to work the one thing that I had a problem with is the fact that the rules and procedures change all the timing but if you don't catch on as quick as they want you to your wrote up for it and possibly fired for it as well.
good,"fast paced, a bit unorganized. pay and benefits could be better. training is fast and somewhat uninformative, some people in management positions should not be, your job is often threatened and can seem like youre walking on egg shells"
good,"This employer was good, but it didn't have a good schedule. The schedule given was always if you had good stats. I liked it, but working under stress to sale an item was too much. Therefore, I had to leave."
good,This was a third party vendor and the client was ATT Wireless.  Very stressful dealing with angry customers on the phone with little support from our Client or the supervisors
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Friendly atmosphere, good team, but no increment, good travelling facility, job security, good HR, good team ...................................................................."
good,"I trained with some amazing individuals but while in training, the job was hyped up to be something that it is really not. "
good,"It's a cool first full time job, but I don't think anyone should consider to as a career unless you're looking to become a supervisor or any type of management position."
good,"I really don't have much to say about this company as well, I mean the company is good to work for it is just some of the staff in the workplace is very interesting."
good,"a typical day was focused on back to back calls, no time to breathe or think. Lack of management support when needed for escalated calls requiring higher level support."
good,Working for Concentrix was a temporary job. I learned how to master customer service skills in the loyalty and sales departments. A skill that I was able to take with me was how to manage conflicts with services customers either had or were  about to buy.
good,"Concentrix started to remove the benefits that we had during IBM days. Like annual increase, medical reimbursement, CTO and banked SL are not being paid during resignation"
good,It's nice company to work with but offers less wages to it's employees. working environment is good along with good Nature employees. One important thing about the company is services are properly delivered.
good,"Overall, we got to work and have lots of fun at the same time. We got a lot of feedback coaching from the supervisors. I liked taking supervisor calls."
good,"I have worked at Concentrix for 4 years, and have made a lot of friends.  Many of my coworkers have become like family.  As far as that goes, its a very positive place to be. "
good,This was a great place to work it payed the bill and the company made us feel like we were appreciated we had prizes given to us weekly and bonuses monthly. Their was opportunity for advancement their.
good,This job was home based it was a temporary job till I could find something better.  The pay was very low for the job but the overtime available helped and the flexible hours were a plus
good,Convergys is a great company to work to especially when you are a newly graduate. Management are also flexible on their people but could do more in taking good care of their people
good,Gaining more experience on the telephone with customers is an exciting way to learn to problem solve.    Making sure to meet all the caller's need's and helped me to value my role as a employee. Taking calls for the USPS was not a very high stress type of work. I was able to advance as a customer service representative and considered a Universal Call Agent where I can handle any type of inquiry that came through.
good,"I started out working at Convergys enjoying the job; I loved talking to customers and helping them with the issues they called in about.  After a while, it started to become very monotonous with criticisms coming from all sides - customers angry about their phone issues, and feeling like no matter how hard I worked, it was never good enough."
good,"I did not work there very long, the company is no longer in business."
good,11.50 and hour for sitting at a desk all day and troubleshooting basic issues is not terrible pay as the job itself is easy. Rude clientele make the situation worse though
good,it is a great place to work if you do your job and remember that you are at work and not a social gathering. They do promo from within and you can be a manager in no time
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,It is an fast paced work environment where you have to work hard and be a team player. If you enjoy a challenge this is a great place for you to work and learn.
good,"I have had a number of years of experience in the BPO industry as a representative, mainly in the customer service and the IT department. This has taught me to interact with not just the management team, but as well as my colleagues. I had multiple encounters with diverse groups of people, which honed my people skills to it's finest. The most challenging part of the job is the constant updates from the clients, which we had to reach in a short span of time. We had to adapt to change as quickly a possible to satisfy the client needs for the campaign. In the other hand, this was enjoyable since I had to think outside the box for solutions, and ways to make the process a lot easier to understand."
good,"the benefits in terms of salary and healthcare are the priority of the company, though the work time is quite difficult due to graveyard shift that the company offers."
good,"a day at work was stressful not knowing if the customer your about to answer is going to cuss you like your not a human being. i learned how to be able to use more than one screen and system, learned how to make sales. hardest part of job dealing with the inappropriate language directed at me"
good,Great environment to work in.  Everyone truly inspires to serve the others not just the patients but the staff with extraordinary service. WE learn everyday.
good,Staying on phone answering phone calls for billing inquiries for Directv selling programming and package updates. Job wasn't bad but you are pushed to sell things to people with no money in the first palce
good,You would hve to show up early just to get a computer if you wanted to sit with your team and then if you didnt show up early you would be sitting away from your team.
good,It was ok. Pay really could have been much higher. Lots of available over time during open enrollment which was great. Managers were all really great.
good,"fast pace job"
good,"Lower management is human, if you examine the policies, they may some sense."
good,Working in those company for 5 months is actually just fine with me. its just that I'm a 5 months contract only or what they call project based due to high workload and high volume of calls.
good,"If you like being busy this is your place. As an inbound call center it is very fast paced. However, if you don't like being treated poorly by a caller on a daily basis, maybe this is not your cup of tea.  Need a thick skin."
good,I was a work from home tech support agent.  I only spent a brief amount of time working in the brick and mortar location.  The culture there seemed to focus on growth and training.
good,Good place to start the career and lots to learn if you want to pursue your career in a BPO. Teaches you a lot on being punctual and work ethics. Good place to work.
good,They tell you your job is secure and then when you get back from vacation they tell you that you should start applying else where. You can get a promotion  but the pay rate only lasts while the tax season is going on. After the tax season your pay rate goes back down.
good,Our job demands a lot of our time. We need to submit different conpliance reports on time while making sire that our agents are properly supervised. The agents are easy to deal with though.
good,"As part of my secondary school work, I got the opportunity to work for divers contracts in Concentrix such as King, EA and British Gas, use different platforms and skills."
good,"Just come to work and show up on time. Take your lunch breaks on time. Come back from lunch on time. Clock out on time, and you'll be fine. Try to be good on the phones, but it isnt difficult"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Training was good but working with the operations department wasn’t a great experience for me. Although this company I would say helped me to discover my strengths and weaknesses and how to gauge my communication skills as a person, it wasn’t good enough for me to stay with them."
good,"Have to take calls from health care providers. Some have easy solutions, and others may sometimes have ill mannered attitudes and that is part of the job."
good,"assisted customer's in resetting password to IOS devices, as well as"
good,"Nice work place and it's accessible, near in our place, one ride only from our home. I learned here to multitask because in our account we are chatting with 2 customers at the same time. The hardest part that I encounter here is when we need to chat to 3 customers at the same time."
good,"As interns, we are assigned in Sourcing Department also part of the Recruitment Hub, whereas we are expected to do phone calls to find prospects and potential applicants and invite them to apply for the available job openings in the company."
good,Unorganized very unprofessional do not recommend anyone to work here . No work ethic or teamwork. This job was great in the beginning until I noticed there was no personal connection within the department what so ever. I was very disappointed because I definetly put out the effort while employed.
good,"Good salary, not so good admins, low change of career advancement, very poor scheduler, schedule changes everyweek so not healthy, no work/life balance. split day - offs, not so good, but good salary"
good,"It is fun working in this company with your colleagues and friends, enjoying you work together and they care for their employees, staff is approachable."
good,working with concentrix is a very good experience. you are made to handle different kinds of people and your skills will be challenged. you are challenged to better yourself for your own personal development and the company as well.
good,"out of business locally , but it was fun for Young people, advancement opportunities a lot of changes, payment good for a student, and great location, place is out of business"
good,"not so good. not so ad company.. not so nice place for working. not so good in providing enefits and salary and incentives... not so good employees,.,,"
good,This company is one of my favorite among all the companies I have worked. Its because they know how to take care of all their employees. They totally know the needs of their people.
good,"I just worked for them it was temporary , that i would help people with their Medicare , when it was open enrollment every year where they can make changes. Fun place , competitive, great pay., and benefits."
good,"Very friendly environment, polite co workers, managers and staff. Easy to talk to, quick with solving problems if you have any. "
good,convergys is not a bad company to work for it is just doing the same thing over and over again and that can get old fast. Trying to help people is ok but after a few times just hard not to feel like it is the same thing you have heard
good,"Good job to start out in if you are trying to gain experience in telemarketing.  They offer freedom, benefits and a decent starting salary.  Great starter job."
good,its a god place to work if you dont like to have personal communication with people because you usually do everything over the phone with the customers
good,The company closed its doors. The shifted all the jobs over seas. The job had a priority to outsource current jobs in an attempt to save money so the culture was very cut throat.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,They were better then ALORICA I can say that much. I mean HR and management still sucked but ehhh! I wouldn't recommend them to anyone they pay sucks and you are over worked.
good,It's a night shift which is the hardest part of the job. I learned to be patient and always stay courteous to customers. You can make a lot of money as they have sales incentives.
good,I've met a lot of awesome people working here and got a lot of customer service experience. I enjoyed the health care they provided and the unlimited overtime!
good,It was an ok job! The overtime was nice and my schedule was nice for me! The calls was hectic! It always was busy everyday! Beside that ok job! Good TL
good,I receive calls from both new and current consumers in need of assistance with recommendations as  well as completing sales orders. I used multiple search tools to also assist with consumer trouble shooting devices.
good,"Started off as a great company to work for, but when Florida passed a law requiring annual cost of living raises, they devised a way to circumvent the law and made it hard to increase their pay with the metrics they created. They fear racism and homophoebic complaints and are given better considerations. Those who were not American Africans or homosexual lived in constant fear they may be terminated if they accidentally offend them."
good,I usually handled the applicants for their written exams and entertained their questions. The food there was cheap. The employees were very welcoming when it came to OJT students like me at that time.
good,"Good workplace, had good incentives but this year they removed some incentives. I Learned a lot like how to engage more to our customers and also  I learned some basic technical support. hardest part of the job if its first week and last of the month because lots of concerns especially if there is an outage. the most enjoyable part is I am able to resolved my customers concerns with full satisfaction."
good,Convergys is an OK place to work. They provide extensive training so that you are prepared to do your job when you get on the phone. From time to time they do have employee appreciation day where they provide food for their employee and treats.
good,"My typical day at work was working 8 to 12 hrs a day with required overtime, resolving the customers' issues. I learned many things because I was trained to different queues, which made me a very knowledgeable employee. But the management did not compensate when it comes to employees' hard work. We have a dress code like from Mondays to Friday, DRESS UP then Saturday and Sunday, ""DRESSED DOWN"". The hardest part of the job was to try to keep calm an IRATE customer' where your patience will be tested. And you need to think that you are always in the customer shoes. The most enjoyable part of my job was having a TEAM BUILDING, where I and my teammates will go somewhere while we're on a rest day, to have some kind of relaxation."
good,Concentrix was and okay place to work but not for a permanent position there was no room for advancement and the way the vacation time was set was unfair for workers
good,Inbound calls with the general public can be very stressful if you're not properly trained on how to handle the calls correctly. The metric system used can add additional stress as well.
good,convergys was a very easy job. i really enjoyed working in a call center atmosphere. my manager was very nice. i had my own little work station. i answered several calls.
good,It was a ok place to work If you are willing to sit in one place for long period of time then this for you. I am unable to sit long period of time so could not do the job
good,"Not a bad place to be depending on the contract you work for. Management is usually decent and try their best to treat you like a human being."
good,I would say working in Convergys is fun however the account is toxic and crucial. Too many changes in a month sometimes in a week depends on the updates from clients. Metrics are changing every month. Incentives not bad. Benefits are good.
good,While working at convergy's I learned a number of things. One of those things was the quality of customer service. How to build report with every client.
good,"The most enjoyable apart of the job is the people you encounter, whether it is a coworker or the customers that you come across. The job is challenging at times because you have to try and save a customer that is wanting to disconnect and may already have new services installed. This can go against your stats in a negative way. I have enjoyed my overall experience and enjoy the challenges."
good,Employed don't feel the urge to come into work on a regular basis as there is no driving factor or motivating factor. Growth is stumped and only is a consideration if you are close with your Superiors. Hard work is hardly recognized. I couldn't see any growth here for myself and hence chose to resign for better prospects.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"To short lunch"
good,Have great opportunities if that’s what you want. I didn’t like the call center atmosphere. I also wasn’t informed it was going to be a sales position and was pressured pretty hard to sell. Just wasn’t for me.
good,the environment is very laid back but it is very hard to up scale. Instead of promoting someone already working in the line of business they hired and outsider the manage which is very frustration when your supervisor doesn't know anything about your work.
good,Work was stressful and there was a lot of attrition. Quick turn over rate. Poor work hours and lack of organization. Management isn’t that great. Not much room for advancement. Some calls outbound
good,I enjoyed this position it advanced my typing skills as well as efficacy and knowledge in cell phones and billing. I was able to get experience in live chat and I enjoyed staying extremely busy all day every chat was different it was a good experience
good,The job was not difficult. I did not feel I was given proper training to better assist the customers. I was encouraged to make sales on every call but most calls were from people complaining; so you can imagine the problem there.
good,It was a good job for me at the time . I stayed on task and got all of my work done . Its a good job to have if you love working around people and in groups .
good,It was business after all. There are very few opportunities for growth. You will be doing the same thing all over again everyday. There is a minimal chance of making connections with the customer. It is very transactional.
good,Great colleagues. Happy working environment. Good and known clients in their respective industries. The best when it comes to training new hires and retaining employees.
good,j'ai beaucoup appris avec concentrix sur le support technique surtout avec les appareils ios.une journee de travail peut ete aussi interessante que stressante dependemment de la demande du client.Le management a mon avis doit etre reviser.
good,"Convergys was basically a boiler room environment where they stuck people in after training and see who stayed.  Mix of sales and product support, the pay did not equal what I was used to getting."
good,Great job if you are looking for a job that can be done in college. You sit at a computer and take customer calls to fix internet connection. Pretty simple but not a career job.
good,"Working as a customer service associate is really hard but it will certainly mold you to be a better person and build self-control, professionalism and patience."
good,"1. My typical day at work, taking large volume of calls as expected in call center, Working at midnight and out of afternoon and stress."
good,The account make up of the call center has completely changed. There were CC companies and banks contracted there when I worked there. None of the same companies are contracted there anymore.
good,"Good people low salary offer"
good,"mangers were very knowledgeable"
good,no review at this time. Worked there for a short period of time and they closed. I have no idea if the company is in business anywhere else at this tim
good,"Healthy environment to work with good career graph and good growth opportunities "
good,"The experience with Convergys will depend greatly on what contract you are on (i.e. which company they are the outsourcer for).  If the client showers Convergys with praise and goodies the situation will be better."
good,"Favoritism is very transparent, although fair and transparent in management and assists employees with government needs and transactions including requirements."
good,"Great job for young students after high school/ in college (with scheduling accommodations for college students). Decent call center experience, good opportunity to learn good skills and great benefits."
good,"Alle Abläufe in Sachen Vertrag, Rechnung,Störung und Kundenanliegen."
good,"It's a good place to work, due to many locations worldwide there is no real interaction with upper management due to size of the company and number of employees."
good,started through quickbooks and training course. once out of nesting no one knew anything about the software no floor support very unprofessional staff
good,"No support from managers, no one seemed to know what was going on. Training was not extensive at all, I guess they expected you to learn on your own. Would not recommend."
good,The place is so much bad where the organisation cares only about making money in all possible ways and does not help out the employees with anything either professionally or personally..
good,"I think they just need to give more opportunity to employees  who wants to grow up with the company , very easy job, good pay i have no bad comments about convergys"
good,Concentrix is a great job I would honestly work for them again if that was a goal. Trainer are great as well aa the benefits. Its a relaxed environment
good,"If you can keep up with your training and apply time to getting to know the systems in place to assist you in finding information, you can do very well at this job."
good,Was hired for phones worked up to team leader and was managing the dell account until it was fully sent over to India. Was with them for several years.
good,it was fun and alittle stressful we was put on floor too soon to me. hardest part was the shift they came me after training. its a nice job just need more training classes
good,"El el area en la que yo trabajé, el trabajo era excesivo, el personal en areas de supervisión y management falto de capacidad y habilidades humanas y profesionales. El tiempo de café y almuerzo limitado y el nivel de exigencia no va acorde con los beneficios y compensaciones que se le dan a los empleados. Doy calificación de tres estrellas en todo, ya que el tiempo en que laboré ahí puede dar cierto margen de error a mi percepción, sin embargo dos estrellas hubieran sido perfectas relacionadas con mi experiencia en esta empresa."
good,I've been in the company for a year and I don't really talk that much in my workmates since they all act like mighty and rich since we're working in a high paying company in Bacolod.
good,"It's a good job to get your foot into the door for call center experience. The staff is more on the younger side, the company has a decent foundation but needs better team leads. Site contracts with vendors which mean contracted rates."
good,"Had a good and bad experience with this company, though  the management here is not so good with managing the staff and stuff. But all an all it's an okay company to work with."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,It was alright they asked for to much. Switched everyone to a new project and didn't even raise there pay. And they are aggravating and unprofessional
good,"Convergys is a Company who help other companies to solve there technical problems. Such as customer service, IT and Data. By in large i learn a lot of new technologies, Especially GSM technology. I learn a lot about Touch Screen Phones (Smart Device)."
good,"Some very great people work at Convergys and it is easy to build friendships there. The job itself can be very difficult. If working on the United Health care program it is the best call center experience you can have. It is a fun, low stress, high commission sort of environment. If working on the AT&T program, you have to be born to be a call center agent. It is very stressful, with no raises, unlikely to have career advancement opportunities, but the people that work there can make all of that worth it. Convergys does have a high turn over rate that people can be concerned with, but people fire themselves by missing too many days and by not doing their job. Many people just don't care about their job so they will do anything they want which is not allowed, this is something that happens in all jobs, but since Convergys is always hiring anyone and everyone due to client needs, it makes the turn over rate that much higher. Overall this is not a horrible place to work at, it is just hard to make it a career."
good,"This is a good place to start out if you have never worked in customer service or a call center before. You are taught how to use the system, how to answer calls and how to document calls. This place is a steeping stone into the call center world."
good,The job was always so busy and customers were always unhappy. They never offered any room for advancement unless you were willing to work over 60 hours a week.
good,"a good nice job with good commission, bonus, supervisors are great and understanding about home and family, i didn't like the nights that i was working that is why i am still working there now."
good,I enjoyed working there. The environment was positive. I worked hard on a daily basis to achieve team goals. I am happy I played a part in the improvement of this company.
good,"The pay is decent, and the benefits are all right as well. The only problem I had was upper management. My direct manager, or team leader, was always helpful and supportive but those above her were more or less uncaring. They would change policy without properly notifying employees, they turned the job into a more scripted phone call and less of a connection with the customer. They were not helpful and while they promised advancement in the company they very rarely delivered."
good,great starter job if you are looking to gain banking knowledge and experience. job also offered unlimited overtime which is a plus due to the low pay grade
good,The job is good and decent pay but the staff itself is stressful. The customers are like any customers you have when it comes to customer service. The job was not very professional when it came to how they would run it.
good,"They need better pay. Working there has taught me what businesses i would like to eventually work for. I really hope i find a  with better employees, management, and wages."
good,The job itself is not bad but the building and some of the staff need to be addressed but i wont hold my breath for it to happen. they do offer some great incentives if you take advantage of it
good,Company is very strict in everything. Employees would be having a hard time expressing themselves due to the strict policies the company have. Awesome teammates.
good,"Laid off due to site closing.  Saved me by forcing me to take my talents elsewhere to the better pay and benefits I deserve, but sad to see an excellent manager and team members go by the wayside."
good,A typical day was stressful the managers only talk to certain people also they are bias to different life styles. the managers wouldnt come in to work on time but they would dicipline the employee if they did
good,I didn't work there for very long due to I had to relocate. The training room was fun. They did offer a discount on Direct TV.  When I got on the floor to take calls it was quick pace and you had to try to sell things and move through several different screens.
good,"Albeit short, my stay with the company had been worthwhile because it has offered a good working environment. With the company building sitting within an environment-friendly park, the company can also boast about having the best view that helps its employees in relaxation while on break. It is also surrounded by different restaurants, some opens 24 hours a day, giving its employees options to where they would want to have lunch or dinner at."
good,"At that time touch screen phones weren't available, so our primary job was to aide those needing directions to whatever they requested.  We were to set their destination into the system, which would download into their vehicle. Also helping in crisis situations for anyone pressing the emergency button on the OnStar panel."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,moved service from one location to another  helped getting people online  to see what was required  for their health saving account  help take supervisor calls
good,"Every group/division can be different in how they treat their employees, but I'd say overall there is very good atmosphere of trust and fairness. There is a strong focus on education, and they reimburse for outside classes taken (Up to 5k/year I think). Benefits are good, and I'd say quite competitive in the market. Good 401K matching (they'll contribute a max of 3% of your 6% or greater)."
good,"It was not very organized. They expected more than they gave you the resources for. Very unprofessional, its like a high school call center. Although if you are just coming out of high school or just need a quick job they will hire you and the pay is decent."
good,It paid good and training was fun but not like the real job at all it was worth it to work there because i met my best friend there but it is kinda a dumb job
good,"Like any other inbound call center, the typical day consisted of logging into a system and taking calls. They had a high level of security to protect the sensitive information of it's clients and customers. Management was about average for a call center as well."
good,Convergys is fast paced and very competitive. I like that we got a bonus for great customer service or the amount of reviews we received. It was a little stressful.
good,The Health Care contract created a high stress fast paced and competitive environment. The Management was learning at the same time as the staff and often times were not very knowledgeable or helpful.
good,"Challenging because I need to get sale for me to get a commision so you need to know your product, be aggressive and be ready for customers inquiry. It was fun because you can wear what you want to wear."
good,"Love that I could watch television while on breaks. The hardest part of the job for me was the hours. Unless you were there for a while, you had night shifts which interfered with raising children and getting them off to school and having someone there when they got home."
good,Very flexible with schedules and was always available to try and help you improve if you needed help.  Offered great benefits and employee rewards.  Very clean work environment.
good,It was fun there my very first job but I did not find professional growth.  We had lots of fun with the activities they had for the employees. Dental Insurance not very good.
good,"For the most part Convergys worked for me as an employer. "
good,environment is more for high school graduates. Training was fun and ok. I really didn't like the environment. It was hard to get a first shift position
good,"negative work environment"
good,One of my biggest beef with this company is that there is not a dedicated payroll person.  The team leaders enter the payroll information.  Already since my employment commencement in July of 2017 issues have arose from this.  The largest issue is that we were overpaid by $2.25 per hour and this extra amount had to be taken back.  This created a major inconvenience.  I believe that this happened because there was not a dedicated payroll person
good,Im not sure what type of person can handle working in a call center but for me it was souless. I could not handle working like a robot. They timed you when you went to the bathroom!
good,"You have to be at least 10 min before check in, in order for you to  open all software and the check in software clock."
good,"I know the company must meet its clients' metrics, but their methods of doing so severely impacted my ability to meet them. That stress affected how I dealt with my customers, which in turn impacted my concentration."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Preparation & maintenance of the MIS Reports on daily, weekly & monthly basis"
good,convergys closed but it was a very fast paced job. it was very stressful as call volumes were high and people were very demanding wanting to get money credited back into their account for any reason. dealt with so many negative customers
good,It has been over 10 years since I have worked at Convergy's. During the time that I did it was a great work environment. I loved the manager that I had there and the people that I met.
good,"While the sales position was advertised as base+commission, it was in reality a base OR commission, essentially a non-recoverable draw @ $13.50/hour OR $20-30/installation of DISH service. "
good,"Inbound calls, lots of questions, no help to agents from upper management you are expected to look it up online. Temporary job to something better, it is what it is."
good,"Productive yet needing managers with ""hands on"" and ""real time"" technical experience in regards to providing and managing resources who will support and provide technical resolutions to network issues for major industry companies such as Microsoft, JPMorgan Chase, UPS, Bank Of America, Morgan Stanley, Verizon, FoxNews, etc."
good,"It was cool, I had fun, they were nice It was a good opportunity and Im glad I had the pleasure of experiencing it. There were alot of growing opportunities."
good,"didn't really like the management because they really didn't care about how you handled their situation, its either their way or the highway.........."
good,"Working here is really a big challenge, its not only because of the work timing (night shift) but also the capacity on handling such problem of customers which you need to give best solutions as the satisfactions of customer is the main goal."
good,Everyone is very supportive. Working at Concentrix is like fun. People are very dedicated as well. Everyone seems to be professional and focused at their work.
good,Really Didn't like Working Their It's Ghetto The People Is Very Rude Disrespectful Team Members Are Not Helpful at all I Only stayed There For 6 months It's unorganized Things didn't go as I Planned They have Great pay & Good benefits
good,"When I was employed there, the starting pay was only 10.00 an hour. Training was 4 weeks, Paid. Being on the phones were not too bad. I had a very good attitude about even our customers who were upset so it was not a bad experience for me."
good,It was a good company good pay and nice hours not to face paced great management loved the company would recommend to anyone and understanding on attendance
good,I have gained a lot of learning from my time in the organisation which will surely help me in the future. The HR Team works as a family and is very motivated and helpful to new comers.
good,"A day working here is pretty relaxed, however if you have kids or go to school you would need to let them no in advance to work with your available time."
good,I think that the company can be a great place to work but it needs to understand employee value.  There are a great number of employees with underused skills.
good,"Working there was always unknown. Maybe there were days with group contest or maybe there were days when it was more focused, but it was good overall. Some managers were eager to help while others were not."
good,"O staff da empresa em si preocupa-se com os colaboradores. O staff contratatado por empresas externas e essas mesmas empresas, deixam muito a desejar, dificultando os processos com q falta de coerência na informação que dão aos trabalhadores."
good,"It gives you a college or high school field, the managent like  TL’s and Om’s are rude. They don’t like too do their jobs, and they help who they want too help."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Stressful! Back to back incoming calls , must meet quota or may lead to being written up. Opportunity for bonuses and cool give aways.  Some of the management was dry and very hardcore."
good,"it was a good experience working there, the only downside that comes to mind when i think about the place is that the management tends to favor certain staff but its fine that kind of thing is common it was a fun time working there."
good,Minacs had a lot of transitional phases going on at the time. So alot of information wasnt updated on time and was very stressful to handle. They were growing with a new client.
good,"Customer service support for incoming calls for Australian time zone Support requires Mobile phone activation, number transfer, number change and mobile phone loan assessment"
good,"Fast paced environment, it was competitive. The hardest part of the job was customers who you couldn't make happy, no matter what you tried. I like making customers happy so i felt disappointed when they weren't."
good,"Benefits and a desk job are nice however, the environment can be quite restrictive. Paperless environment. Promises for changes that never take place."
good,"Great place to work for someone in between jobs "
good,its alright i wouldn't recommended it to my friend or family but a job is a job the people are okay but management is awful thought and very poor scheduling
good,"Convergys was only a  part time job , This have vendor under there services . So once one contract end they would offer you a chance with another  vendor."
good,Company pay is good. Can always ask for help when needed. Great team support. Fast pace business. Everyday you came to work it was something different.
good,It was fast faced. I like working a fast paced environment. Only thing is I could never leave for my breaks on time. But I learned how to work through their software.
good,I worked on a Dell subcontracting project for federal customers. I received around 40-50 calls a day and somehow between the calls we needed to follow up on the calls the day before.
good,An average day at work was fun and not overwhelming.  Small petty rules and vindictive coworkers would make for a bad day but overall a good place to work.
good,"it has a fun competitive family that pushes you to be better at your job ,the managers let you see the fun side and listens to you to make you feel like you really are part of the family which will want you to work harder and be better. I learned that although BPOs are the basically doing the same thing over and over again the whole day, if you work with good people with a good management, it's all fun, no matter how redundant everyday is."
good,They did not tell us that they cannot accomodate us all agents to be transferred to other accounts. They don't have accurate data on each agents. All of their promises before we hire is not true.
good,I worked solving customers issue with the vehicles. Also worked with dealers service providers and rental agencies. Was a very stressful job with customers taking out their frustrations on the agents.
good,"It's a call center. If you like sitting and talking all day, you'd like this job. You basically take calls all day. Not the most exciting job but it's easy."
good,Working for convergys but actually working for AT&T and selling many products for them after helping customers with technical issues. I would work for them again.
good,Employees are expected to perform  and meet numbers expectations. Your are constantly supervised and rated on your performance. Surveys from customers are one of the major ratings.
good,The only requirement for this job is to be able to speak with irate customers for hours on end.  Good facility but lack of leadership within team leaders allows for low moral buildup.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,transitional job to get you by until something better come. working here have help me position myself for something better. I have learned the in and out of mac and ios devices which is a plus for todays world.
good,"Very Stressful and fast pace environment."
good,Going into a call center everyday and hearing people yell at you was not a good time working. I found that out quite quickly. I couldn't work there anymore.
good,"I worked with a large tech company contracted out to Convergys. My office mates weren't the kind to start any drama, and they were for the most part laid-back and a bit nerdy."
good,"I worked for stream and it was bought by converges a month befor I left the company. They were trying to change it for the better. "
good,the job itself is ok answering phones and solving customers issues with bill or phones. The shifts where the problem with me they didnt have any great shift hours to chose from.
good,"Assisting customers over the phone, Adjusted customers accounts as far as telephone, cable tv services. Persuaded customers to upgraded their services and issued promotions to customers to upgrade."
good,The training was good. The training managers were excellent. There materials were easy to learn & fun. Very fast paced. Could be annoying at times because it became repetitive.
good,"I have been gone for 8 years, so I can't reliably critique the current environment, but it was definitely a career builder for me, and a place where I met some outstanding people that I remain in contact with today."
good,My colleagues are the only reason why I stayed with the company for 2 years. The management easily promote people that they think will help them to improve the service that they want to provide but they don't know how to care their people.
good,"non stop phone calls with providers and members about benefit questions and claim/appeal questions "
good,"You have to Answer Incoming calls, from current customers who are either having technical issues or are wanting to disconnect their Directv account due to tech issues, price, programming choices, equipment, etc. If the problem is tech, you can help troubleshoot to your best abilities, or transfer them to tech support. If they want to disconnect, you have to probe and find out why, and try to convince the customer to keep dtv, by fixing any of the above issues."
good,"Me gusto en la empresa la relación que tenia con los nuevos trabajadores, daban desayunos al menos 2 veces por semana."
good,"I  have  been  working   at    Concentrix    contract. Good   growth, transport   facility, Fun at work.  Good   infrastructure & environment to work."
good,"varied shifts and hours. there are several different projects that convergys works with. depending on the project you are assigned to,hours and shifts will vary"
good,"As mentioned above, collegues are nice but due to scorecards and all, at the end of the month people tend to fight and argue with each other."
good,"Concentrix is a great organization with a huge portfolio of clients. However, leadership is a huge gap. This may not be true across all accounts but in my experience, it leaves a lot to be desired."
good,"good for fresh graduates. Fun environment, I was able to develop my customer service skill.. i liked their pay schedule, hardest part of the job is during our nesting"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I worked as Phone Support for less than a year and an Email and Chat Support for more than 1 year. Handled concerns from professional sellers. Got promoted in less than a year with the company to which I am very grateful about.
good,"They hire too many high school kids, which makes the work environment very hectic. There were too many glitches in the system, computers would shut down. Way too much drama."
good,working for this company was very streesful i feel they asked alot from a person and the program was difficult to grasp and at the end they ended up letting go of everyone and closeing down
good,The hours were very hard to obtain and to schedule around. The management tried their hardest as they are under paid for the job they do as well. No OT was offered
good,Environment of the team was great. Team was always willing to help each other. Team had a lot of fun which made it worth going to work. Would love working with the same team again.
good,Good place to work if you are not able to mobile or active as others. It can be a mentally stressful workplace. The can be simple at times and on occasion can feel rewarding.
good,Convergys is good and has training that agents under go to be able enhance their communication and leadership skills. Converygs also has nice benefit for their agents.
good,"a typical aay at work "
good,Good Place to work for experienced and Freshers.         Management is also good.                                                   Seniors are approachable.
good,"Training was thorough, the trainers gave you plenty of time for questions to be answered.   The coaches on the floor helped tremendously when you got onto the floor to take calls"
good,"I just started but it seems okay. The floor is a little chaotic at times, and what you learn in training sometimes is not reflected when it's time for the floor. It can be a bit overwhelming but, we will see."
good,I personally don't like doing call center work. People can be mean and rude. Some people can be nice. I want a different job description. It would be a good place to work for someone who likes that line of work.
good,I liked the environment of Convergys.  My coworkers were friendly and nice.  They were very helpful to new hires.  Management treated their employee with respect.
good,Easy going job to gain work experience. Good positive atmosphere and relaxed work environment. Pay could be better for the work required but a good start for young people.
good,"You get a lot of angry callers, and that can make your day stressful. You also have goals to meet every night. Supervisors don't really help either. You do win a lot of prices and can earn nice incentives. Not a bad job, but definitely not the best."
good,"Working at Convergys was pretty good, they welcome their employees with a big hand. However, I am not satisfied with the salary, no incentives, and benefits will be provided after a year."
good,A fairly common example of a call center. That being said the staff does make an effort to make the job more bearable. It also isn't a bad call center.
good,"Managing large amounts of inbound and outbound calls in a timely manner"
good,"Working in convergys for 4 months was really fun for me i developed my confidence and my communication skills, the training is really helpful for me I didnt regret working in convergys."
good,"Well, working in Convergys Telstra site was okay.. . I was assigned in An Australian account. It was less stressful because I work on a regular working hours."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I'm a person who likes physical work. Sitting on the phone really isn't my style but its something I can deal with. I love the environment and the people I am around but some people just take the joy away from the work.
good,"Fun place depending on the managers. They want a lot of Metric to be meet but the pay is very bad and the hours aren't that great. but you can rack up some money doing overtime during peak seasons and if you are favored you will move up quicker. Gotta be apart of the ""it"" crew or you will not elevate. They have good people that are apart of their team but they will not move up due to management have clicks and favorites."
good,Im on a night shift account with an Irish account. I have learned to be more of inclined with business and deliver number. The culture is great with a fun and friendly environment.
good,"Responsible for Customer accounts"
good,this was a good job. I was able take the customer service skills i learned and apply them to everyday life.the environment was relaxing and laid back.
good,"A lot of nice people there, but pay isn't great. Health care is available after 90 days.There is a fast paced environment like any Call Center job would be."
good,"There was no structure training for the position. You have to sit with different employees and learn from them.  Which made it somewhat stressful and knowledgeable all at the same time.  You would learn something from someone, then the next day someone else would say that is the wrong way to do it  and vice versa.  But then you learned different ways to do the same job"
good,"Typical call center, steady incoming calls.. casual business good pay. Friendly environment if you're use to call centers it's a good place to work .."
good,"Great place to work if your just starting a call center job. It really gets you in the zone, and throws you out there. But once you get a hang of everything it will come to you naturally."
good,good place to work it was along time ago but I never had an issue with this place okay pay they work with your schedule ad great pay that work their as well
good,"Salaries are not that great, growth is also very minimal, but the company is good provides all the facilities. have a cab facility uring only 7pm to 7am which is not satisfactory"
good,I had fun working there. I love customer service jobs and this was a great opportunity. I didn't like the upsell where you had to lie to the customers.
good,Clients and work change frequently and regularly. Employees should be comfortable with managing change. Client will often be larger companies outsourcing work for customer support.
good,Convergys is a good company to work for temporarily.  You have to be liked to move up and there really isnt much room to advance. The environment isnt really professional.  Ive experienced a few fights in the facility.
good,"This is a call center. The environment is fast paced and changes often, but the coworkers and people around you are always supportive. The workplace can be stressful at times but any job can be."
good,Concentrix is a company that allow you a chance to advance in the company from being an advisor to management. The company is always hiring and looking for new advisors
good,A typical day would start with a warm up session such as playing a game or working out a problem. It was mostly computer work and discussion. I learned each class was unique. Management did not get involved unless there was a problem that needed their attention. The culture was relaxed and I always took time to answer any questions. The hardest part of the job was keeping the pace going all day. The most enjoyable part of the job was watch the representatives get the basics of the job they were training for.
good,"The training you get is sufficient. This however is a job that you have to have the right attitude to do. Not everyone is meant to be in sales, and I was not. I enjoyed working with the people who trained me, as well as my managers and co-workers."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,It is your average call center.  You get what you expect.  The hours the choose you are stuck with even if hired under a different plan. It is   just a call center.
good,I enjoy that a lot of activities and events are provided to employees. It really helps to boost the moral. It also allows the leadership and agents to get to know each other during events.
good,"Nice environment with challenging growth as its a call center. Good training & development team. "
good,I enjoyed my co-workers and enjoyed the work. The hours were steady. I would recommend working here. Would be great for anyone. Insurance was nice too
good,Convergys is a good organisation to work with. It is a great place to learn communication and inter-personal skills. The hardest part of the job is ever changing shifts.
good,"Very fast paced, but have training and meetings to help if you need or require it. Plan to reapply and work for this company again. Great benefits, everyone is friendly. There is potential to grow."
good,They dont pay the salary as they promised. Tax is a bit high. Workplace looks good. One month waiting for the first payout and we have disputes but hr didnt mind are disputes
good,"Concentrix is a fast paced call center with low pay and minimal opportunity for advancement. You will pull your hair out if you work here. If you need a job they will basically let you work all of the overtime you want which is a plus. The workplace culture is like going back to high school. It's unprofessional to say the least. But if you need a job hey, go for it."
good,The worst at about working with this employer were the set shifts. At the time I was working there I was only looking for part time but there were not many part time positions.
good,"Has taught me my soft skills and sales. Great customers service skills. Provided me with training skills. Its a pace pace environment, but it enhances your multi-tasking skills. The hardest part of the job was getting use to the telemarketing aspects. This was difficult at first trying to sell people products that they may not need. But it was good to  learn about the techniques."
good,"Not bad people to work with. It's a call center, they are all the same. Sitting all day answering phones and having customers yell at you for 8 hours."
good,typical day at  work was  answering  phones  for  while  time  you were  there .There  is a lot of  management there .Start  you off usually with late  shift and  does not  try to change  it. Puts  you on a  schedule  and  doesn't make  sure  it  will work for  you first-just  expect you to work whatever  shift  they give  you. They do have a  good  training  program with good  instructors.
good,The company was there for me when  I needed them most.  The pay was ok but was looking for more and or advancement.  Nothing terrible to say about them.
good,"Convergys is a good company in India but work pressure is way higher than other company  so I would definitely not recommend any candidate to work in this company. Only the training period is the honeymoon period after that you will be pressurised to work in odd shifts, no increment in salary and you will feel like slave."
good,Typical days consisted of whatever the clients and card holder's needs were. I would come in clock in and start making phone calls for customer's that wanted to do settlements.
good,"If you enjoy talking on the phone for long periods of time, this is the job for you. For me it was too slow paced and it wasn't exciting nor challenging enough."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Convergys is a good company to get a strong foundation. It not a company I would suggest working for years. The opportunity for advancement isn't that great. Convergys isn't a company that tends to care about one's personal life or life struggles. No company morale at all.
good,"most of the people were nice, the department I was in was unbearable, and just overwhelmed with the amount of inconsistent shift bids................."
good,Some of the managers are okay. Some take their job way to serious and others don't really care about it. Mandatory overtime every day for weeks on end.
good,"Through a long journey with my previous employer, I've learned that happiness an inside job not based on anything or anyone in the outer material world. I've become a better person but still a work in progress."
good,Was a tough job since its my first job. Learned a lot during trainings and stuff. Management are ok. Workplace is good. HArdest part is working at night and traffic. Enjoyable part is i met a lot of people and were able to deal and help cx
good,"Convergy is a fine place to work but had little opportunity for advancement. They are an outsourcing company, so depending on the client account you are working, you may have a vastly different experience."
good,Work life in Convergys is always bustling with life. Being in this company taught be to be independent and you will learn to stand up on your own to have a better work-life balance there is always something comes up to challenge your capacities and push you to strive hard.
good,I worked there for 4 years and enjoyed my coworkers and my job. I liked the fast paced environment but was unable to advance in the company as I would have liked. I needed something new and fresh with more of a challenge.
good,"Working environment is good"
good,Planned to work here temporarily. Job is good for young people looking to make decent money. Constant sitting all day with 1 hour lunch and 2 fifteen minute breaks. Stressful.
good,a few things could be fixed with the type of people they hire. pay was good benefits were good managers were ok they hire a lot of unprofesstional people it was kind of like high school which didn't intrest me at all
good,Working for Convergys was not a bad Call Center job but not the best either. You would answer calls back to back all day and pretty much most of the calls were the same. With that said after a short learning curve period the job became pretty easy but very mundane and the call floor rules were to strict and counter productive.
good,"This job introduced me to new technology and products which I didn't realize was going to help me throughout my career.  Management could have been improved at times, but overall it was an enjoyable culture."
good,"perform customer service for incoming callers for whichever company you are working for at the time. two weeks of training, very strict on schedule and keeping phone time"
good,Dealt with customers all day. There was a bad management within the company. Very little communication between employees and management. This caused for lay offs.
good,"Pay and benefits are pretty typical for a call center. They have a pretty generous time off system after you've been there a couple years. People are nice, but at the end of the day, it's an outsourced call center."
good,Its a good company to work with. It offers a great work culture and transparency. You can move within he company and change profile to suit your interest.
good,if you're a people person and you like taking on the phone this is a easy place to get in. I've been hear for a while and I'm a work at home agent. I just wish they paid more.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Nothing so much to say but Convergys is a good company. I didn't stay due to personal reason . However, the company offered a better health insurance to their company which  I believe shows that they protect their employees so much"
good,Friendly representation and comfortable work place. Breaks are allowed. Strict rules are in place to keep the work place in order. Technology yo to date.
good,A good career starter. A very good training ground for you to start and build your career. People are professional but the pay is not synonymous to the stress or does not compensate with the stress level that you've been getting
good,"On a typical work day everything is fast pace, co workers are energetic and ready to work. Lots of overtime to work and room for growth within the company. The workplace culture is unique because of organization character and personality provides trust. The way leaders communicate and interact with their employees."
good,Good entry level company to begin a career in accounts management.  A too relaxed dress code and culture.  At times this culture seems too unprofessional and contradicts the mission statement.
good,Cannot comment on the company as I did not work for them when they moved from Minacs to Concentrix.  Applications are not responded to as I have submitted to them multiple times without a response.
good,it is a good place to work but it is not the best place i have worked. the lunch room food they sell is not that good. there is alot of coworker drama
good,I learned phone etiquette and how to handle and resolve customer issues as fast and professional as possible. I enjoyed that you were in a fun eviorment as it was mainly filled with university students working part time.
good,Like a booming business in the country they also provide a good job and opportunity to grow within the business and pursue a career in the business process outsourcing.
good,Above average company.  Some but not all managers are friendly. Above average company.  I don't know why you are asking too much of a review of the company though. Above average company.
good,"A typical day at work involves supporting multiple customers at a time over a chat based forum with account and billing issues, or supporting the first tier inbound level advisors with issues they need assistance with, or customers they are unable to work with."
good,"Good place to work"
good,"Convergys was a dear company."
good,Inbound customer service calls. Pretty flexable schedule. Management was fair. Taking in bound calls from angry customers can be very diffacult at times.
good,I have been working here since 2015. Times have changed so have policies. The management is not good they are money minded. The work life balance get ruined as you have to spend 12 hrs on work including transport. No increments but incentives are good. If you work honestly there are higher chances of promotion bit no guarentee of increment. But think twice before joining.
good,I was able to work with the direct tv department. it was relaxed and fun. we were given free premium for our use at home. the schedule worked great for my home life
good,"Convergys will take on too much workers, and then cut everyone off, when client account is short term. That's what happened in April 2017.  That wasn't cool for I'm still disappointed about it . The work environment is great."
good,Job could be lost at anytime if you do not sale product to customer over the phone. And it was not a company to build your career at. It was a day by day job.
good,"**I've learned a lot from this company."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Typical Call Center. Fresh out of college and needed to get experience in the field. Worked night and weekend shifts dealing with upset clients for each department.
good,What I love convrgys is they value their employees like if there's a typhoon while we are at work they will surely inform us that we have shuttles or letting us stay in snugggle area and also provide us free food or meal.
good,Supervised a team of customer service representatives.  Helped our Training department with new employees and with seminars.  Answered questions of other supervisors.
good,"Being a call center agent, a typical day at work is full of excitement and patience.Giving my customer the satisfaction that they need,I learned that,I need to give my best to give them the easy way of advising and option for them to avoid encountering the same situation or problem.The management and the workplace is good. They provide all the needs of their employee and the site where I assign was very refreshing, you can view the Pasig City.The hardest part of my job is when I got sick and I can't really focus on my tasks and the most enjoyable part of my job is meeting a different kind of people and getting advice and learn from them."
good,"not a horrible place to make rent money. definitely not a career most people would say. very strict on meeting quotas, which is not hard yet it can be exhausting"
good,Nice work place . Workplace environment is too good and specially the training period is the best part as the trainers are awesome and you will be well equipped to work after a month of training
good,"It wasn't a bad experience, it wasn't great either. Very fast paced, so you would have to catch on pretty fast if you want to really succeed. I did enjoy my time there all in all."
good,"Very fast paced work depending on your contract and where your positioned, can be fun, can be stressful, sometime mean customers can get to you but that's what happens here"
good,The company itself is one of the BPO companies here in the Philippines. They were so caring about their staff and they provide the needs of the employees
good,The job consists of handling difficult and angry customers solve the issues they have with their service.  Management might not work with you when it comes to scheduling.
good,Being a Customer Service Representative or a Call Center agent is quite a taxing type of work where your patience will be your utmost virtue. It is a place where you learn to value patience and perseverance and enhance it more each day as you encounter different types of people to deal with.
good,you meet people from different nationalities. Management was supportive. Every month they change commissions structure so you have to increase your sales number so you ended up with a lot of stress
good,i stayed for 7 months within this company because i need to support my family and my study. i was a full time employee and a full time student at the same time. my managers were very considerate though i wasnt given a chance to enjoy the workplace since i was still studying that time
good,"It depends on the account but we handle DISH Network which is a big company in the US and we handle lots of calls. I have learned a lot especially in handling customer's concerns and how to fully empathize with them. The management was okay but I was not really satisfied with it. I made a commitment with Concentrix and it's only fair that I comply with it. The hardest part of the job, probably would be not being able to get a time off work at your desired date. They rarely approve vacation leaves. I enjoy going to work because the people are nice."
good,It was good to join as fresher. But again Ctc was way too low. It was my first job so every single thing was fascinating to go across. I worked for less than a year though.
good,The company is a good training ground for people especially for new comers in the BPO industry. Its a good stepping stone for communication skills and discipline.
good,Company went out of business years ago. the staff was great and made sure their employees were taken care of. This was a great place to work ten hour days.
good,"This was a good and stable position to have when I was in university. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I worked as a customer service representative handling customers' calls at a call center for ATT&T where I worked in customer service handling bill payments, rescheduling of due dates, past due payments, future payments, and technical support such as activating or troubleshooting phones and devices.  I also worked selling services such as phone, cable, and internet services through ATT&T."
good,This job does a lot of seasonal hiring. Job stability not dependable . The management and staff are great. The hours are set but supervisors are flexible to personal needs.
good,I really do not have any comments about Converges the work place is not all employee friendly.  Customers are rude and disrespectful to the employees due to product dissatisfaction.
good,the most enjoyable thing about this job was that you could make sales the person with the most sales gets some type of an award. the hardest part of the job was dealing with very rude customerrs
good,"They make sure that agents are enjoying their job considering that working night shifts is never easy. I will never forget my team leader in Convergys, he always pushes us to be better and encourages us more."
good,"Had a great team to work with who made downtime fun. Work was fast paced most times and most days, but was enjoyable. The management team was very understanding and friendly. The hardest part of the job was getting yelled at by customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was having a great team to work with."
good,Convergys was an average place to work. You have to be willing to commit to different things and depending on the projects you are expected to meet some goals. I would say most of the management is willing to work with you and easy to get along with.
good,"Working a Convergys was a great experience to gain knowledge of a call center workplace. We had to meet different adherences, percentage, and sales points."
good,a typical work day at Convergys you can take about 30 calls day you will get some customers that are irate mostly because they don't know how the security system works most of the time but it is nice to help them. the management is nice and they care they will try to do what ever possible to keep you around they will work with you if you are having problems at home they will try to work around schedule if needed. honestly the hardest part is dealing will a angry customer but its nice to hear that they are happy when we have fixed there problem that's they most enjoyable part.
good,Really enjoyed working with the team they had there. Lots of problems arose after they purchased Stream Global Services though. They would up laying me off the day I came back from bereavement after my wife passed away.
good,"Lots of fun people,  lots of fun activities to keep agents entertained.  Bonuses for top performers include trips and motorcycles, etc.  Hard to grow."
good,It is a fast pace environment but worth the time of coming in on a day to day bases. You get help when it is needed. The higher ups are very concerned and will help if help is needed.
good,"The company is good,  i can say my first bpo experience in convergys is very great and helps me a lot be grow and strenghten my potential in technical scope of work."
good,"not the best place to work at, but definitively a good place to work."
good,"do not expect to get payed the bonuses or commissions that are promised.. worked for company for 2 years..they set satisfaction goals and sales goals but an average time for a payout would be 6 to 8 weeks for me to receive them, then  usually the dollar amount was half of what I expected . I started out working under the AT&T CS contract.. then  Convergys LOST that contract.. Then ATT  gave them a tech support contract  . All reps lost commissions  and then were regulated to earn only Base pay,, 24k a year... DO NOT EXPECT any compensation other then hourly wage here.. Co workers and management were pleasant and they are flexible with hours..."
good,"Its a lovely place to work, slow pace great coworkers and management. Its a mix culture. A typical day at work would be when the system freezes in the middle of a call."
good,Management could be upgraded. Having a fair pay for the requirements of hours done. Rather than that i believe it's alright. Also on keeping the professional tip needs to stay at its high and just a once a week jean day.
good,This is the top of the tree when it comes to the customer service industry.  They are always analyzing data to better position themselves to their private contracts.
good,A good platform for starters who want to have an insight of the corporate environment. A BPO enterprise with good culture. You cannot make carrier out of it.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of an average call volume with calls have easily answerable questions, I also learned a great deal about how health insurance works."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"It's a call center, most days it felt like I was back in high school. Most of my managers were really great and easy going. If you don't mind the same call one right after another then it's the place for you."
good,Initially I liked the work environment in the company and the process I was working with later on the process were merged and our office loacation were changed which was inconvenient for a lot of employees.
good,they took on a mulimillion dollar account and it killed employees due to website problems and horrible managementiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiidddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddoooooooooooooooooonnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnntttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllliiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiike them
good,I wasn't her very long but the training experience was enjoyable and educational. The training for this call center is about 4 weeks long and the hours are reasonable with good pay. The dinning area is exceptional.
good,was not a horrible place to work except we got surveyed by customers at the end of every call and was forced to sell to them until they said no three times. So that usually resulted in poor survey scores. so it was hard to get commission and bonuses.
good,The job was tech supoort for a cable/telphone/internet provider. Was supposed to do just tech support for phone and internet issues. Then they added sales.
good,Everything was okay but during that I am still studying in college. The time management is so tight and I cant deal with my body. The most enjoyable part of when I done my very best and achieve the satisfaction rating from the customers
good,"while working at convergys I have met lots of people and made friends for life, I have learnt how to balance being sociable and hard working, while being on the phone there is a lot of waiting for calls to come through, so having a chat with people next to me passes time quickly. the hardest part if the job for me is to be compliant on each and every call without breaching as some campaigns sell insurance so its very important"
good,"It's a good organization. Good chance of getting promotion if you work hard."
good,A typical day at work includes answering the phone to answer any and all questions and concerns the customers may have while providing the best customer service and  understanding to each individual customer.
good,"Convergy's  i have worked with this company for about 6 months over all its good experience to work here."
good,"Being able to work from home was enjoyable to work for Convergy's It facilitated the home work structure. My phone cord wasn't very long ,so I had to comply with the rules of the Company to keep my self readily available at every moment."
good,"Good place to work. Lots of hours, but paycheck was compensating. Lot of ""Office Space"" style politics to wade through but over all was a good, PC place to work."
good,"People are so nice not judgmental, everyone was so friendly loves to eat and to go to everywhere, anywhere under the sun. So fun to be with and reliable."
good,"Although the position was very doable, the management and lack of professionalism was very hard to deal with. The customers were fine to handle, it was the people in higher power who did not know how to treat us."
good,Very fun place to work but very frustrating work environment when it comes to customers being jerks. It's a lot of information to obtain but it pays off in the end.
good,"just fyi this is a really shoddy excuse for a review. the job, it's okay. i think i like it some days and others i hate. people sometimes suck and sometimes people are great."
good,nice people loved this job l just looking to expand work experience. the reason i left was because of maternal reasons. I was breastfeeding and once you are out of the training phase of work you have to bid for your schedule which did not accommodate my particular life
good,"If you have no call center experience, think this one over. Expect ALOT of shift and Supervisor changes. Constant change is warned, trainers are awesome though."
good,"Work culture is casual and easy to adopt. The job has great incentive to offer for freshers. One would like to grow in position after years of experience."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Job was good for college kids"
good,"It was great pleasure working in Convergys. The company treats its employee as an important asset of the organisation. They help you to grow and helps to showcase your talent in from of others. "
good,"The pay is typical at about 10.50 per hours. I had great management but work/life balance is terrible and your schedule will be at any time of the day they feel necessary, forcing you to chose work or other important things in your day."
good,"Loved the people that worked here. Wish I did a different job there. They had Cisco, AT&T etc. I did timeshares and it was really hard. They did not fire me no matter how much I messed up, I tried but I just wasn't a sales person. The people who owned the timeshares were the most nicest people I know and for rich people. I always made connections with my employees and kept in touch. I mainly helped than sell."
good,When I began my career at Convergys I was a customer care representative. I was able to advance to a fraud agent then a trainer and prior to the center closing I was an escalation supervisor and finally a team lead.
good,This company was good. They understood that life happens. I would've stayed longer but that ended up shutting down the company. I would've loved to keep my employment there if they would have payed more.
good,"good working place. salary on time. hr management are good, managements are good. for girls excellent working environment. interview pattern are easy."
good,"Great place to start your career growth. There are a lot of opportunities if you stay there and work hard. The projects are usually fun and interesting, and they can come with a lot of perks."
good,Convergys is a very friendly environment & the business will keep you going alday .. They have flexible schedules .. Outgoing coworkers .. & typing on the computer everyday will give you the best work experience
good,Liked this position as i learned a lot about tech support and working in a call center.  Was not fond of every call being monitored for my stats.  Would like to go back here to work.
good,working here was pretty cool coworkers and mangers were very understanding and nice I learned how to be better at customer service hardest part about the job was finding a manager
good,"Its not too bad to work here if your into inbound call center type work. Management is there to help and monitor your progressions. It is fun at times but are expected to do your work. Very repetitious work day in day out, but you do get reconized for your good work."
good,"Very good Place to Work and learn , growth will be there if the performance is very significant "
good,A workplace where your sure to learn something new everyday. The work culture is great and the people are the most interesting part of the job . Overall a different experience.
good,"My day consist of constant inbound calls. Solving and experiencing different issues. Helping members get the best understanding of policy or accounts. Usually take about 35 to 40 calls a day, on a 8 to 10/hr schedule. Processing orders, taking payments, making account changes. Of course making sure to keep member trust on every call by reassuring that we are always here for them at anytime."
good,Working in Convergys will give you an opportunity to communicate to different kinds of personality. They have activities for employees that you may look forward to.
good,Overall my experience with convergy's is not good. Management is bad especially their HR. When it comes to your pay there are a lot of discrepancies. The superiors don't respond right away to your concerns.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Job are doing good and the workplace too. Co-worker are fun to be with  also helpful for each and everyone. The communication with the management are doing good too.
good,"Good Established Company, Honestly not doing anything different as a BPO compared to other Centers. Wide Array of Programs available. On time crediting of Salary which is good."
good,"I worked for sales and that is where I build my confidence"
good,Very unprofessional  payroll issues managers were very unorganized as well as immature adults as employees. The environment was not a setting to want to be in
good,Good company and good work for employee and it gives on date salary.Incentive  give on  employee work and promotion give on all test with talent. Fun on every Friday and two months one trip.
good,"I can't complain to much about Convergys. I worked with Directv thru them. I had good benefits, and a great discount with my TV service, but they really didn't care about the US employees."
good,"- a lot of information to remember which makes it stressful"
good,"Great place to work however looking for better prospectus , Got to learn a lot of things including improving team management skills , The company gave great exposure to various team management functions"
good,"This job is no longer available"
good,"Enjoyed a good environment in concentrix nearly an year."
good,It is a call center and the attitude of most call centers holds true there.  although management will do their best to help employees it is a high turnover job.
good,"Alright company, learned alot throughoit the course of training and i enhanced my communication skills. Friendly environment and sociable people. I enjoyed my stay"
good,You would have to see for yourself.  I worked at home.  Its not for everyone but some folks may enjoy that type of environment.  You did receive training and frequently preformed self training activities.
good,"was your average call center with your average call center pros and cons, they were flexible and easy to work with but there were clear staffing issues that were in need of fixing that were not fixed"
good,"Working environment is good. Can have fun at work.Nice place to work. "
good,A typical day is mostly being with a team to work together to achieve the company's goals and getting to bond with friendly co-workers for a fun workplace experience. Learning to be a team player is essential in surviving in a fast paced work environment. The management is good at accommodating workplace/individual needs while still conforming to professionalism. The hardest part of the job would be shifting schedules given to you depending on the account you handle. The most enjoyable part would be having people to work with who are always willing to help or mentor you as you grow professionally.
good,"At the time I was working there this job paid well. It was your typical customer service call center job. Did not work there that long, company closed down."
good,Convergys taught me on how to deal with the customer's inquiry in a timely manner. The management was able to give their support to each representative in order for us to resolve customer's requests.
good,Good company but there are things that needs improvement.  Salary is good but the environment needs some improvement.  Management can be reachout but not that easy.
good,"On 31st december the call flow was very high nearly double what we used to get on normal days , it became very difficult for me to manage the calls ,i then talked to my team leader during break about how to handle the situation and was able to cope with the situation and resolve 90% of the calls."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Customer service at it's best. Challenging customers with high stress however always finished my shift feeling quite satisfied that I was able to solve issues for my customers
good,"I enjoy the company itself but the nature of the calls is what I don't like. It's part of the job to deal with angry customers who are wanting to end their services and the job is retention. So if you can't handle being yelled at and talked rudely to by customers than this won't be a good fit for you. The amount of people that quit right after starting is crazy. Our training class was about 25 people and once training was over with we only had 4 people in the group left. It's very stressful no joke. The client we work for is what I really dislike, they suck as a company. It's hard convincing customers to stay when I my self don't like the client. I've come to not like them by my experience working here, it's ridiculous how many mistakes are done by employees. I can't handle constantly getting yelled at by customers.  Overall Convergys I like but the client I do not."
good,"while in the small city growth rate is low."
good,Convergys is an okay company. It doesbt stabd out from the other call centers I know. Offer is marginally higher than what is offered from other companies but benefits are not good. You have hmo but youd have to pay a certain amount to add dependents. There is no work-life balance.
good,"My work day consist of, being on time at and clocked in five mins early everyday. Always ready to help customers needs and help them fix whatever problem they may have, I have learned a lot about all different cell phones also I have learned all sorts of ways to fix phones if they are not working properly. The management is very nice and welcoming and really care about your security. The hardest part of my job would be you never know what type of day you may have with a customer, over the phones you just have to sit and listen to what the customer wants and needs and help them the best to your ability. The most enjoyable part of my job would be helping people out and making there day better by fixing there problems."
good,Recommended for BPO newbies. This is a great company that will boost your confidence in communicating or dealing people of different culture and tradition.
good,Before concentrix it was running by IBM...That time every thing was good but when concentrix take over this atmosphere is not good for growth of employees
good,Convergys is a ok place to work. But I don't feel like the pay is fair to be doing what you have to do. I loved the people I worked with. Peter Petersen was a awesome Sup. and I would work for him anywhere.
good,was a good place to work until the company lost its lease and decided to move everyone to a work at home environment then could not seem to keep WAH projects
good,The people around the workplace is great. The office equipments are of good quality despite some items have technical issues. The office location is also great.
good,I've been doing the same type of jobs for over 12 years. I liked the culture and the upbeat management. They allowed us to take movies home  and enter in drawings. There was not many opportunities for upper management possibilities.
good,This was a call center for at&t but it was seasonal so the job ended in the department I was in. If you like call center experience then I guess it would be a good place for you.
good,"There was nothing great about this job. I am loyal to it as it provided me with health insurance. It could be a stressful place to work. I had fun with peers. Your  job security is always in question and the work/home balance is minimal. However, it is a job a source of income and benefits."
good,"Competitive pay,  good working environment, relationship toward head management and employees needs improvement. Medical insurance in not that reliable."
good,"Concentrix is a mnc company so there are various people who belongs to different culture work together  as a unity. There is no discriminations on the bases of colour , caste ,gender and religion in this company. Working environment is friendly.Management is good."
good,"competitive and fun, detailed documentation has to be done. Representitives must reach thier required goals, weather its average handle time or hold time or the nrs."
good,Working at Convergys for Blue Cross Blue Shield was very informative and a great learning experience. I gained a wealth of knowledge how insurance works and was able to assist family members.
good,"A typical day wok includes Managing Deliverables like CSAT, Quality, Cases Per Hour, SLA, Shrinkage, Production Hours, Conducting One-on-one sessions, Preparing roster, Appraisals and Incentive, Performance Review, Ops and Client reviews, All adhoc tasks like conducting training for employees and completing all the company surveys and sharing process updates. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,The leads are really understanding people. All you have to do is talk to them and let them know what's going on. And don't go to work looking for friends.
good,The job itself was an okay job consider it was customer care and help desk. It is a job in today's today and age which is more than some places have..
good,"They completely focus on customer service."
good,I used to work for The Monacs Group and haven't worked there since they have been bought out by Concetrix. I did enjoy working for Minacs and hope that I can find a Career with Concentrix.
good,Working here was great! The environment is very laid back and there are many things you can do on your breaks. You also get discounts on many things!!
good,"it was a good Environment to Study more about the apple product rather than just helping customer on the phone, although i might Say not one my fav job, but i had a Good time"
good,"at first the company gives a very pleasing promise as for employee insentives and a lot more, all staffs are approachable, only concern is the salary is way to low to support my family thats why i left the company and look for a better pay."
good,"Answering inbound calls. would assist customers with payments on their pay-as-you-go phones, provide technical assistance and assist with billing issues,"
good,"Convergys is a leading BPO, where you get very good salary and growth chances are very high if you work for at least 2-3 years. It is also a good platform for freshers"
good,"did not work at Concentrix, not sure where this came from.  Not much to say when I did not work for this company, so I am just filling this in to get it done."
good,"its been a long time, I'm currently looking for a job quick,, but I have to do a mandatory survey about a company I haven't worked for i8n years.  I would suggest indeed do this anymore to anymore people."
good,"Satisfaction in workplace,security and pressure in work and less leaves.Less satisfaction and no proper facilities and only one weekly off and less facilities and low salary.Best bpo in vizag and mainly looking for a growth in this industry.But now fed with work and no satisfaction."
good,It was a good job when you first start off but after awhile your TL forget about you.You have to come with your A game everyday the push for sales very
good,"Convergys is the world leader in customer experience outsourcing. We infuse innovation, insights, and operational excellence to make every experience great for your customers and your business."
good,"Every were we can learned"
good,"we were supposed to do what was a 6 week course in 4 weeks, which was fine.  But then when you pair that with the server and login issues that set us two weeks behind; lets just say, it's a more then a little stressful to attempt to help a customer, when you don't know how to use half the tools needed to do so. other than that, the pay was nice, they had decent benefits, and they"
good,It's a good company to work and grow. Shift is changing every month and sometimes finding hard to manage it. Most of the time I am working in night shift but there is no nighr shift allowance. Threatening from supervisor and HR that you may be out of the company if your CSAT score is low. So little bit insecure.
good,A good company to work with. Joined as Team Leader Operations and was able to enhance my knowledge from Operations perspective as well as people management perspective. Enjoyed being around with the team and getting involved with them right from work related stuffs to fun filled sessions.
good,"Convergys is a great place to get the foundation you need for success... When management is on the ball, all is well however when management drops the ball, the blame is then moved to others."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Daily challenges to achieve your goal.  Every day is different. Overseas oversees our work and are not trained the way we are so...... daily challenges
good,good experience working with concentrix . friendly environment .appropriate breaks . friendly staff .    helpful seniors . would love to work in that envirnment again
good,Convergys is a typical call center environment and can be stressful but its easy to get into and can be quick easy money. There are opportunities to move up from a sales agent to a Team Leader but after that you seem to come to a stop. There are no raises for time or experience but there is opportunity to get bonuses if you are a great sales rep. If you don't plan on selling this is not the job for you. There is a constant push and someone over your shoulder to meet sales goals and even once met you may feel as if your performance is not good enough. This is coming from someone who was a top seller on the site and moved up quick to TL.
good,"I've enjoyed working in the Convergys site; however, I am not happy that the site is closing and there are no offers of help in searching out other positions. The Standard Examiner said we were given options, but there were none given in the meetings held on site to tell us it was closing. I also didn't like that employees who've been there for 10 +years are to be given the same ""bonus"" the rest of us will receive when the site closes. I believe there should be some way to thank them for their loyalty. Incidentally, I am not among the employees who've been there more than 10 years."
good,"Its a good company to work for , day to day I would be answering calls and making offers to customers according to their accounts. I learned sales experience how to properly make an offer to a customer without selling it to them . The workplace can be distracting alot going on around you with all the calls. The hardest part was having to be pushy and not fully just helping the customer with their needs. I loved talking to the customers."
good,long hours no time to do anything kind of job sitting for so long especially if you do outbound you just leave voicemails all day for the mist part...
good,"As with just about any call center, the job isn't overly hard. The people were actually pretty great. Unfortunately, the pay doesn't really match the mental drain associated with out-bound calling people at their homes for a survey. Some are quite nice, but you have to get used to some very frustrated customers."
good,"To work here, you must be a person who is in to technology and loves everything about it. This job could be difficult for someone who is less knowledgeable on technology."
good,"The company is very flexable about schedule for people that are still studying. The good part you are not just a number everybody get along even the site direct knows everybody by name, so ot feels personalize."
good,"I loved the people I worked with, but the requirements you were expected to meet were almost impossible to achieve which made me dread coming to work."
good,"Customer service is very good for the subscribers, we make sure that they understand everything they are paying for as well as if they need further assistance."
good,none of their products work but they expect your to leave customers happy. How can i make someone happy spending their money that doesn't get what they pay for??
good,"Good company,"
good,"I start my day by logging into my computer, and pulling up the systems I will need to complete a day's work. I unlock devices for AT&T, so the job is very repetitive. They provide the employees, with two 15 minute breaks, 45 minute lunch, and two 5 minute health breaks. I enjoyed my time with convergys, unfortunately now I am forced to look further due to the lay off of my department."
good,This is for entry levwl call center work and you have to be a certain type of person for this job its all about your metrics on the total numbers of calls you take and what happens on those calls are you trying to save this on the account did you offer this on every call its alot to take in all at once
good,Pay was good and bonuses were good. Management  kind of had a lot of unrealistic goals throughout the day. Quotas of sales and keeping people in the company that just wanted to plain leave.
good,"I worked there from 2007 to 2016 off and on.  My problem with concentrix is that it's not a stable company.  You never know when the program you are on is going to end.  While I was there, that situation happened several times.  They kept calling me back but you did not feel secure as to how long it will last.  Also the culture went down over the years.  You never get pay raises and the pay has never been more than $12.50/hr."
good,"The account I joined was easy but usually, employees like me are having problems on our salaries. There are also overtime applications approved but were unpaid and you need to wait for 1 or sometimes more month to get it."
good,I do not have any review to offer for CNX. I am looking for better opportunities due to my movement to a late night shift. Was part of Minacs initially which was taken over by CNXC
good,"recently Training classes // Facilitating , but before dealing with angry customers looking to cancel but turning that around and earning their business with good customer service and retention offers"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Good place to work with, A typical day can offer you lots of learning. management is ok, Work culture is good and transparent. There is nothing like hardest part anything till now for me here."
good,"Personally dont like working at night, felt like no improvement, im more of a hands on person though i have experienced remote access which is the best part all in all i have easily learned about the troubleshooting."
good,I was in charge for tracking packages and helping customers with their concerns and questions. It was a very fun environment and days went by quickly because you keep yourself busy with all the calls you recieve
good,"Minacs is a job where you are on the phone talking to people where most of them have had their car break down and are not happy, so you have to deal with the angry customers."
good,Convergys provided great training and support for employees.  I was able to take many training courses in programming and management.  I became an expert in UNIX system administration.
good,Good company to start your career. Not a company to stick with for long time. Too much office politics. They act like a typical call centre . Make you work overtime without your consent.
good,"I enjoyed the work I was doing but the politics of management was not always appropriate. My assessments usually gave me the rating of ""key contributor"" which was the highest rating and you received a bonus. The team leads were not permitted to give that award to me more then three times even though they did not have any fault with my work. I was told they had to rate ""on a curve""."
good,"I've been working at Convergys for almost 6 months.It's a decent place to work at. Pretty easy, but the pay isn't enough to live on. If they paid a little more I would probably stay."
good,"Convergys is conversant in the languages of outsourcing and relationship management. The company provides business process outsourcing (BPO) services designed to help its clients manage their customers and employees. Its customer unit provides inbound and outbound call handling for sales, marketing, and support through about 70 contact centers (and in about 35 languages). In addition, Convergys offers bill processing services and provisioning software to telecommunications companies through its information management unit. To focus on its primary operations, it sold its HR unit to NorthgateArinso in mid-2010. Convergys was formed as a division of Cincinnati Bell and spun off in 1998."
good,"Able to work in different projects, helping customers with problems they may have with their service or accounts.  Hours differ depending on worker and length of interaction with customers."
good,"When I was there I felt as if I was back in high school, there was just constant drama, when I would receive my checks there was times when I was paid incorrectly, I received a raise due to moving to a other position but I didn't see the raise on my check until about 2 checks later, other employees would take lunches from the break room, I'm not to sure how it is now, I've heard they have hired new people"
good,"I thoroughly enjoy the people that i work with, including management. Its a very relaxed environment. Convergys offers great benefits and the Corporate perks are very useful.  "
good,The work environment was okay. The hardest part of the job was the unprofessional customers. They were very rude. The management didn't really help and you could never find a supervisor if you needed on.
good,"Atmosphere in the floor very good, teamworking, young people and international environment"
good,Convergys was very good to me over the years.  It was a good starter job that helped me get through college then it helped me start my career as a call center supervisor.  I ended up working there for 18 years.
good,I enjoy talking to people as well as helping them. This is a job you can do both. You get some good callers and so very upset or just plan upset ones. but key is they just want to be helped and if you can do that then that is what makes it all worth it.
good,"Taking phone calls all day long for 9-10 hrs. Assist customers with their accounts while providing great customer service. Overall, team leaders and managers do their best in making sure we have all the necessary tools, so we can do our job effectively. Customer driven/customer first, but they try and incorporate fun games, activities and contest to keep us motivated. My opinion, there's nothing hard about the job. Just know you'll be on the phones all day, besides the odd time you have training. Interacting with coworkers. There are some really nice people that work there and partaking in the fun activities they offer."
good,"I worked in Convergys for a few years and everyone there was extremely helpful and considerate. Office was very neat, clean, and staff was very professional."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"If only there are a lot of sanitizers in the hall  way, that would be great! The trainers are so knowledgeable! The pantry's workers should be replaced. They are not serving good foods."
good,There are things that we need to let go if we are not growing as an individual professionally and that there's a need to move to a different work environment.
good,Just the typical call center atmosphere.  In my account there was this culture of Team Leads keeps on yelling to agents while on call.
good,I learnt a lot about training and development at Concentrix. Met a lot of interesting people and discovered various fun and exciting training concepts here. My colleagues were friendly and helpful too.
good,Learning part was very limited. Guidance for the growth of an individual laterally was not clearly provided. Growth opportunities were very limited.However I enjoyed working there.
good,"i do not feel like i should review every company that i have worked for this is private information, i do not wish to disclose."
good,If your looking for a company with good people. Try to apply to Concentrix. Currently I'm working for this company for more than 10 years. This company is my second family.
good,"Working as a technical support associate at Convergys was my first job here in Dublin. "
good,"Good company. I like the environment and my colleagues. The salary is fine, however, Its hard to work during night time especially if you have a family."
good,The days are long if you are working on the pharmacy technician point of view but the money is alright. The company cares more about the amount of time you are on the phone then the amount of time that you are caring for the customer. This is a terrible example of a customer service job.
good,"Everyday work is stressful expect multi tasking on everyday shift. Team Leader are supportive, HR office are always reachable, facilities are not complete like recreation room."
good,"Our management is very competitive, so I work hard every day so I can be an asset in our company."
good,The most intriguing and challenging part was when I was given a chance to represent our team and handle tenured agents while our immediate supervisor was on maternity leave for 3 months.
good,"Monotonous"
good,"A minimal of work pressure with good supports allowing the agents to learned the new ideas gives a good confident."
good,"Concentrix davao cares for their employees. provided recreational facilities like ping pong, billiards and a very comfortable nap room for the agents to rest their weary eyes from a long shift"
good,"working on a night shift"
good,"I've worked there for 9 months, at the beginning it was cool you know be making good money and everything but later on i started hating that job so much the costumers can be rude af so be ready to get yelled at mostly every day be ready to figure out how to solve the costumers problem by your own they barely help you there they only help the new people, be ready to sell directv, tablets because that's what they only care about making sales they don't work with the costumers it just sucked"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Great place to work short term. People are great and fun loving."
good,"This company was nice it you got to meet with you supervisors to know how you where doing weekly "
good,It is a fast paced call center with challenging software platforms as well as challenging employees to meet different statistic criterias in order to make the best call in the least call time.
good,"I actually enjoyed this job, I just don't like that they typically do not rehire past employees not matter the reason the employee left the company"
good,"The most enjoyable part of my job is when doing crazy things with my co employees and when there's a program in the company  though the work is so stressing. In my 1 year and 5 months in converys, I've learned how to communicate with my co-employees and team leader as well.  I've learned how to be socialized with them because if you know how to communicate and socialized with your workmates, leader and bosses the company will be successful."
good,doesn't prioritize agents and gives mandatory ot's that are unforgivable. team leaders and coaches doesn't really care about the opinions of other agents.
good,was a fun and comfortable environment. Had amazing co worker who never let you down. Good teamwork. A lot of opportunity to grow and expand in the company.
good,The trainers make sure you are fully prepared before they leave you to yourself. The offer Tuition Assistance and FMLA. The due periodic training to keep you up to date.
good,"one the fastest growing BPM company today meeting all  basic need of  it 's  employee .If  your are looking for growth in a particular vertical ,expect a slow advancement till  your highly connected"
good,I enjoyed the team that I became part of in Concentrix. We were a close-knit bunch that helped each other achieve our tasks. The downside of my experience is the lack of accountability from the manager then.
good,"Typical working day shift hours but company site is very close and accessible. Sometimes no available supervisor to keep in touch with specially during climate issues. Account was very easy to handled and learned, customers very friendly and appreciative. Management, had enough about it. Workplace culture is very friendly, air condition fair enough to nearly freezing; work station nice and clean, so to speak since site building is new. The hardest part of the job was when service towers were down due to weather issues, customer may not have enough patient to wait but some understood how the service worked; where on the other hand, the most enjoyable part of the job was when we though that issue is with the service but instead some devices were not plugged in, not turned on or otherwise customers forgot where these devices were placed"
good,A good place to work for...You get to interact with alot of great customers that call in - and the staff and management are mostly great to work with.
good,"Customer service representatives interact with customers on behalf of an organization. They provide information about products and services, take orders, respond to customer complaints, and process returns. Many customer service representatives work in customer contact centers."
good,"Although I had a good experience here and I was able to advance through the ranks, I was not thrilled on how they treated the CSR staff. The pay was good at the time and when I became management, I disagreed with some of the staffing policies."
good,This was a great place to work. They really got me prepared for any call center job. Once the day starts you know that you expect the same call flow but different variables. Management was helpful with assisting with any concerns you have about the job. The hardest thing about the job was finding a solution within a timely manner depending on the matter at hand.
good,"I did not receive all proper training in systems that were needed once entering production floor. Due to this, it took me a little longer to gain proper knowledge of the systems but the pay and benefits are great."
good,The work environment is fine but the culture is too hard cause you were working on a night shift. A lot of adjustments are needed but the salary is very great. Colleauges are fun to be with.
good,"this was a good company to work for. there was always someone there to encourage you to keep up the good work. alot of support from the staff, wish they wouldnt have closed really good job to have ."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Productive and no fun in workplace very High restrictions in work place And no good environment and also very tough process to work huge targets in work place
good,working here i did love it the different types of problem each day were fun to me miss the friendly co workers and some of the customers. miss the way the tm (team managers) helped you out when you needed them for tough call or a simple yet common question. surely do miss it. but had to leave for medical reasons
good,"I worked with the saves department, my job was to convince customers to stay with the company. I enjoyed doing so because it gave me a since of pride knowing that I helped someone better their service and make a good decision. I learned patience, and empathy working for convergys by understanding and finding a solution for customers problems."
good,It was hard dealing with angry customers and then having to try to get then to buy something else. If i was just customer service it would've been fine. The supervisors are hard to deal with if you dont do the impossible
good,They were not as organized as i would've liked. For the work that they put us through 400 hundred to 500 hundred short calls a day I dont think we were paid enough.
good,"Things change too quickly. High turnover rate. Everytime people start to achieve the goals, they immediately change them. Schedules are inconsistent. Pay is decent. Health benefits and 401k."
good,"Convergys was a decent company to work with, my co-workers really became my friends. Unfortunately the client our site had a contract with was awful, and the tasks changed from assisting customers, to obtaining as many sales as possible using less than desirable tactics."
good,"Good work environment if your willing to do a lot of sitting. A great way to help the in store pharmacy to cut down on a lot of work, great point system for attendance and tardiness ."
good,A 12 week training program is great. You have to be a sales person if you want to keep the job. They go off of a quota and if you don't meet it then they let you go.
good,dont really give you your hours.. they force u to work sometimes on your days off. good start place for non experience workers getting out of highschool
good,"You might as well be invisible at this company. talk to co-workers? nope. Ask for help? faceless nobodies that you call out to, and they love to give you attitude. Coach? Didn't meet the guy for two months while working there. Isn't that fantastic?"
good,"An ""OK"" to work organisation"
good,"answered calls and resolved problems. managed customers accounts. set up appointments for alarms, phone, internet and TV's. made sure the customers were pleased with their services."
good,"It was mostly answering calls from customers which I actually really enjoyed, I learned a lot about how to keep your tone level when speaking with a rude customer, I also learned a lot about patience. The management team could have been much more supportive but they were always concerned about getting their sales which made it hard to receive help when approached with a conflicted customer. My coworkers were all amazing we were like a big family never had any social issues with any of them. The hardest part of my job would probably be offering a sales pitch to a customer who's call was most inappropriate to offer to. The easiest was talking to the customer and helping them with their problem or helping them understand why their bill is a certain way. It really was an easy and enjoyable job for me."
good,"Teams are supportive, very large company, always hiring, supervisors are very helpful, constant changing environment, co workers are very nice and helpful as well"
good,The best part of working with this company is that the customers where very nice and another thing is they have a nice place outside that you can go outside to enjoy the sun when it is warm outside along with picnic tables so you can enjoy your lunch
good,Duties included working in a busy environment operating telephone 			calls. Multitasking between telephones and computers. Dealing with 			customers inquiries and arranging appointments.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I liked the actual job and my coworkers but the company is very hard to work for if you have children or basically any kind of issues outside of work if it's not a school schedule.
good,I would recommend this job. The people are great and the environment is wonderful. A really good place to grow. If you are looking for a great start up job this is the place.
good,I worked there as an intern. The job culture there was good. I can suggest to other job hunters to try the company out because I believe that the company has good opportunities for everyone.
good,"Able to assist customers with their billing issues, was able to help customers activate their new phones, helped customers when they needed to cancel or suspend a line on their account."
good,this was a fun palce to work it was interesting the staff was very friendly and the atmosphere was very inviting the shifts where easy and you did get to pick your desired shift
good,gc  services  is a third party collection agency  run  by a great hr staff  and management  team   I enjoyed  employment a gc services   the pay  could be better  and  the hours could be less demanding  other than that  they are a fair place to work
good,"Fun workplace, not so fun workmates."
good,"Enjoyed working here..culture is good..learned many things here which helped me to excel my skills..had lot of fun in team outings, pot lunch..got 3 promotions in 3 years..its amazing experience here.."
good,The pay was fine but the job itself was hard work. There were a lot of angry customers and a lot of yelling on the other end of the phone line.
good,"answering phone calls"
good,i do not like to sit in front of a computer and talk on the phone all day with back to back calls the pay isnt great and everything is micromanaged
good,"Work Environment is good, Productive"
good,"I learned a lot from this experience, but i had opportunities pursuing my career in business at Northern Kentucky University"
good,Ok the management is ok depending on who that may be. The breaks are good don't really learn nothing in training until you hit the floor.
good,"There are many complexities; however, the tools are there to do the job correctly. It takes much time and practice to perfect processing these medical claims. Opportunities to advance are numerous and promoting within is big with this company."
good,"Good company, there are a lot of different projects to work on and room for advancement. They are a very diverse company, and super friendly."
good,"nothing special coworkers usually helped make the day better."
good,"Well we can earn as knowledge, and challenges in our job , and we use to sale credit cards as executive . only for the people who r working in the Bangalore."
good,"I worked in a french process dealing with financial databases for concentrix."
good,work is so enjoyable.i have learned many things.how to work in an oraganisation.mananagement is good.my co-workers are very friendly work location is also good.nothing much i have to improve  my skills.every weekend they are conducting lot of fun activities.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"It was an ok place, but quality of staff was below par. Management was more into number management than people management whereas ideally it should be a fine balance."
good,"Good training and orientation. Good experience with handling phone queues. However, not much opportunity to progress, or much chance of pay raises."
good,Assisted customers with troubleshooting on either their cable or high speed internet. If the products failed then a technician is scheduled to go out to the home and correct the issue.
good,Concentrix is one of the company that i would recommend to a friend. Most of the people that i had work with in this company is very approachable and friendly.
good,the job was fun and i met the best co-workers in my life and everything about it was good except some stuff the over night shift wasn't that good but everything was somehow good
good,"I do enjoy this job but it doesn't seem like there's much opportunity to grow. You also have to kill over-time in order to receive a nice pay, meeting incentives for other people said, it was too much, its very easy to me."
good,You do banquets you set tables take down tables entertaining guests take out food prepare food help with drinks also help the kitchen with anything they need help with
good,"	Responsible for improving the team and facilitating the communication among the members of team."
good,"Convergys is a call center company. Employees take calls for intuit and help intuits customers solve problems happening in their Quickbooks Online Software. A typical workday can range between 8-10 hours a day and schedules are on a bid system. "
good,I recommend for people looking for job. They pay for training. They have flexible hours and health insurance that begins at day one.
good,"Great place to work its fun, and everyone is a joy to be around. training was easy and it is definitely a starter job into a career"
good,This position required dealing with a high number of calls and covering a large amount of information to help customers with a variety of issues. It is a high anxiety job.
good,Leider nur Mindestlohn. Oft wird selbständiges Denken nicht gewünscht. Sonst okay.
good,it was an ok place just bad mangement. i enjoyed the on site lunch room. the cleanliness of the building could of been better. The pay made it all worth the while
good,I like working for the company   you have a chance to make great money but they don't care about your personal life. They will trick you into switching departments just so they don't have to come out alot of incentive money!
good,"The best part was to help the people. The difficult one is that the environment is stressful"
good,Company provides incentives. Occasions for all employees to get together. Games that makes the environment more fun to work at. Also gives care/health benefits.
good,Good company to work for. Hours and pay were wonderful. The employer employee relations were wonderful. I would recommend this company to anyone.
good,"I have spent many working in various telecommunication projects, given the opportunity to work inside a project was exciting  to learn a different skill set."

good,"A day in the life of a Team Leader or Supervisor begins with reviewing performance reports from the previous days and analyzing trends and behaviors that increase productivity. If an action is not working, a Team Leader, with the help of her subordinates, must formulate a realistic action plan that will boost performance."
good,"I enjoyed working there good hours willing to work with you"
good,If you need somewhere to start your journey in the call center life this is where you want to be. I wouldn't make this contracted my permanent job but hey that's your choice.
good,"no one telling you what to do every min."
good,Its an ok place to work at. senior management has no control for the agents that work there. they need to look very closely at who they hire to work in that place
good,When promoted it was always sink or swim never any guidance. Some of the managers were handed the promotion out of training without any experience on the floor.
good,"Great company to work for, plenty of room for growth. Staffing is pleasant and supportive. The supportive team members, pleasant advisors make going to work a joy."
good,"This is a great company to work for and accomplish your dreams."
good,Convergys was my first big call center company and the hardest account by far. My customer service skills and skills in de-escalating a call was developed in Convergys.
good,"* A typical day at work"
good,"This job had its advantages such as unlimited overtime. However, since it is outsourced to several companies policies tend to change and sometimes the change is not what was initially sold as the job. The management was good and makes the job worth while."
good,"I truly enjoyed working for Convergys for the time that I have been employed here. I have met great people and increased my customer service skills. The company itself needs some improvement in recognition of hard work. Although, I was asked multiple times to apply for a higher position. My reasoning for not was that I could make more money in bonuses as an agent than I can in a higher position. Rio Rancho is far from home and I can always use the extra money that is paid by the clients for our stats and sales."
good,"The sale plan of handing everyone a shoe to try on.  You get ""graded' on whether your customers actually try the shoe on or not.  They were very demanding on this even when it is crazy to do this."
good,"Good hours, good pay, good-ish breaks but calls are not fun. It's better after you get through training if you can make it that long!"
good,It's one of the biggest Company in terms of BPO. The salary is good. Work environment is fun especially if your friends are around. Each LOB has teams and of course you have goals to meet the target (metrics).
good,"this company can be a better company, if they respect there employees more.  They go by the point system thats really strict, but other than that its a alright company to start with"
good,"Didn't change shift time after training/nesting as promised. Great learning experience as well as great team members and some management, I will hold the things I learned here for years to come"
good,"Working as an inbound phone agent for a contracted company.  I learned how to better my typing and navigation skills on a computer.  I got a better working knowledge on how to use different type of computer systems, Microsoft Office.  I enjoyed being part of a training team that was focused on the success of the new hire agents.  I had a hard time with the constant change of my daily duties as the company was not very good at setting proper expectations."
good,"i work everynight for 5 days a week, i learned how to handle stress and communicate to other nationalities confidently. the management is consistent in giving the incentives to the deserved agents. the co workers helps each other so that every one will gonna have sales everyday. the hardest part of the job was taking a call that is not concerned with sales and those irritated costumers. the most enjoyable part is when your closing a sale in a very hard call."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Training was sufficient with good staffing and very bad equipment to work with was the hardest part to overcome but informed about sales perspective and sales training
good,Nice place to work & i learned how corporate company functions. this was good place to learn & execute. Apart from these not much i would like to share...
good,"A typical day there you can expect the calls to be at a high call volume. What I learned at the Job is that not all Supervisor’s has the same rules for when they run their team. An also learned that you have to research things that were not cover in training. Management there can be unprofessional at times, and a few supervisors lack knowledge. The co-workers there are helpful for the most part, and cheerful as well. The Hardest part of the job is when the software goes down and it makes it hard for you to help a customer at times.  An also, when you need help at times it’s hard to get help for questions or even for sup. calls. The most enjoyable part is lunch or break you can play games, ping pong, and go on computers to relax."
good,"Nice working environment"
good,"Worked here a few months, there was no structure, everyone did what they wanted, took advantage of management, was a very unprofessional environment, people show up in there pajamas for work, starts at $14/hr with no raises, no room for growth within the company..."
good,"My experience at Convergys was overall good. I have learned a lot in customer service, improved my communication skills, learned how to become a productive team member and most importantly, improved myself as an employee."
good,It was not a very employee friend job. Overworked. The management was chosen by who were favorites.You only got promoted if you were well liked by the management team
good,"Management is fantastic, the try to take care of their employees as best as they can.  They run ""fun"" events often to improve overall moral."
good,"It is good working here, management need to improve, Work environment is average, Management need to recognized guineine workers and should give them career growth."
good,"Work setting more than adequate. Ergonomic chairs and adjustable workstations. Culture still developing. Lots of challenges from customer base determining the most appropriate resolution. Best part of job, for me, was the coaching and development of our employees."
good,"Going into work."
good,It's all about answering questions instead of answering questions and your performance as an employee. Overall I don't recommend anyone that is an adult and wishes to keep their personal life personal not to work there
good,Don't pay enough for work that is required lots of work required have strict guild lines not the greatest when it comes to understanding family and issues that come up with children
good,"Great starting job with a friendly group of people working. The management however needs some serious assessing. The managers definitely have their favorites, of which they often get priority with days off, preferred schedules etc. Certain situations were handled unprofessionally while I worked here. That being said I absolutely enjoyed the crowd of people that they employed to work for them. They are the ones that made the jobs tolerable and less repetitive on a daily basis."
good,This is regarding my first stint with CVG which was great in terms of work and the management. The role and the support were both good and chances of advancement were ample
good,"typical call center job too about 75 to 100 calls per day, contacted employee for travelers account so it was based o production, overall good experience. learned home and auto insurance, manangement and co-workers were fine, most enjoyable part of jb ws solving problems"
good,my feelings on this company dwell in indifference and i'd rather not review this company. work for Minacs at your own volition.
good,"Requires a lot of patience, take calls and help customers. good pay and good hours. Manager's are understanding with hours."
good,Work/life balance here is the best I've ever had. Benefits are decent. Coworkers are a pleasure to work with. Building facilities are excellent. Positive work environment. Management seems to care a lot about employees.
good,Enjoyable place to work with a broad range of different people to work with and around. A very fast paced work environment.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"it was a dreadful place to work in. customers complain too much and when sales reps tried to solve issues, it never seemed good enough, customers always found more to complain about, just to get a few cents knocked off their bills"
good,It has given me additional skills needed for a career and a great stepping stone for your future. The management and my co-workers are amazing people. The best part of my job is the social media engagement with customers!
good,"It is my first job and i can say that I learned many things. Being responsible is the most important thing; responsible with your actions towards the people around you. I was able to encounter different kind of peoplewith different experiences."
good,"I have learnt a lot from Convergys as I got a chance to work on different platform and also how to work under pressure."
good,Customer service and assisting customers is foremost in every call. Listening to the customers and giving empathy to their concerns are important to assuring the customers you are there for them. Being able to interact with co-workers and addressing similar issues that come up also helps to provide the customers with the help they need. It allows you to explore different ways and avenues to assist the customers with their particular concerns. The most enjoyable part of a job is knowing you have left a customer fully satisfied.
good,"This company you had to be a fast worker and know how to do more than one thing at a time. At first I thought I wouldn't be able to do being the fact that this was my first call center that I had ever work for. However, after training I became very good at what I was doing."
good,"- great team with good management"
good,"Decent job as long as you left your personal life at home, came to work and did you job. Constant changes, training and etc. Base hourly pay plus sales commission. Sit at desk job, with repetitive duties."
good,Convergys is a call center. I assist in daily needs of managers and other employees. I reset passwords. Keep up with multiple spread sheets.
good,Very competitive place to work as well as very friendly managers. Every day was an opportunity to earn extra money as well as sharpen verbal skills.
good,working at convergys gave me a lot of things that I could carry to a real job this job had a lot going on once we got a new operations manager but overall I enjoyed working there for the 2 years I was there just didn't like the pay
good,"Typical work day involved dealing with over 200 patients, I learned many drugs, management didn't seem to care about their employees, the most enjoyable part for me was the patient interaction and being able to assist them"
good,"No benefits, hence friendly staff. Could have better working conditions"
good,"Always guaranteed hours, and really enjoyed having my weekends free. Feel that I'm not paid enough for a supervisory role."
good,"sehr schlechte bezahlung & unpünktlich dazu ..."

Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Like most customer service jobs. Definitely required to try and sell on every call you take. People are really nice and understanding of difficulties and willing to help.
good,Helping out customers in their connection problem is very uplifting in this kind of job. SUpervisors help out in your job problems.
good,"If you want a job that will give you the skills needed to move to higher paying call center this is the place to start, but don't stay to long, nor expect it to become a long term place because the changes of hard work paying of are slim."
good,"A very stressful job but its the only job that can support my family as of now. I enjoy and love my job."
good,"Fun work place had different incentives each month, bbq's  tv/music"
good,"I learned how to set up the TV and how to fixed it when it has a minor problem, i also learned different types of TV there specs. The hardest part of my job is when a Granny calls and seek for assistance regarding on her TV issue, because sometimes they can't understand the technical terms for example the wiring's of the TV and DVR. But the most enjoyable part is when we fixed or resolved the issue over the phone and the customer is very happy."
good,I am thankful to my colleagues for helping me in every way. It also taught me how ro be patient. Overall my two year stay with convergys is good.
good,"Sit at computer all day and take calls from customers calling in to ask questions about their account, bill, data usage, etc. "
good,Minacs is a good place to work at if your looking for a full-time job because you have to understand that they're schedules aren't really flexible for someone who wants to go to school.
good,"Learned how to answer inbound call handle customer disputes."
good,Typical day at work would consist of logging into systems and taking dual chats. Assisting customers with an array of needs. The people here are great to work with.

The job is very enjoyable very satisfying to know that you have made changes in peoples lives.
good,"Hard to get a good schedule, very customer service oriented. Very high job turnover rate. Constant troubleshooting on the phone about 10 seconds in between calls"
good,"Working in Convergys was definitely a milestone for me as I was promoted to a team lead position in this company, which I did not expect. My co-workers are fun to work with and we get along. Management though can improve a little. Hardest part of the job would be client visits as Convergys strives to give them the perfect experience. Undoubtedly, hanging out with my team is the most enjoyable part of my day."
good,"The floor support we had available was always very low compared to the amount of representatives on the floor at any given time. Even when we got the support, the majority of the floor supports were reluctant to give full support."
good,Amazing job until management messed everything up. Lost over 100 jobs including myself because they couldn't run the place properly absolute joke of a company....well certain contracts anyway!
good,"This was my first call center job. i expected more than what it really was. it is unprofessional, it seems like no one takes their job seriously."
good,"My last company was Convergys, It is a good company to grow career with very good work environment and supportive management."
good,It's a productive work place as long as you set your goals and strive to achieve where you want to be. Put in your full potential and you'll love your job.
good,"It's a great place if you want to start somewhere. If you never have any Customer Service Experience its a great way to start. Co-workers are great, the hardest part of the job was having to deal with really really angry Customer who continues to misbehave. Most enjoyable part of the job was the environment and the people around you who continues to help. Management is also fantastic as well as they are well organized."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,good learnings. Good bosses. one of the best brands in their times. Gave me the real experience and ground of recruitment. Good set of people that i worked with.
good,Fast paste working environment. Multicultural. Appropriate working hours. Friendly environment. Plenty of breaks and lunch time. Equal opportunities.
good,Its hard and your pay is worth every dime. Your customers are not just the daily grind but the previous as well. you really take responsibility of every action you do.
good,"Great work environment, Great training provided  Many hours provided to be prepared to start on the floor. Great work schedules available to help with families"
good,Fun working with my colleagues. Good environment but the salary is not worth it the stress and hard work.
good,Convergys is a global company and competitive in the BPO Market. The company initiated activities towards succession planning speaking in terms with career is good.
good,"My opinion is:"
good,"Convergys can be a great and fun place to work but the upper management sits just a little to and feel like they are better than everyone else. I would recommend the company to a lot of people, but I would also warn them this place is tough and there is going to be times when you just want to walk away but you have to look past those rough times and think about the future."
good,"Different contracts. Good pay, good benefits. Management works close with employees to make it a better work environment."
good,"Concentrix as a whole was a good company to work for, but the management was not what it should be. They did not care for the morale of their employees."
good,"Strong work ethics, days can be long as in any call center.The pay is good,the material is up to date,overtime available and some times mandatory"
good,"I have not worked at convergys very long, however, I have learned a lot about technical support and the job duties of a customer service representative. I have learned basic troubleshooting steps as well as how to navigate logging cases on the computer. My work day is 10:00 pm until 6:30 am with Tuesdays and Wednesdays off. The hardest part of the job is working overnight and having to drive so far."
good,"It wasnt that bad the employees were childish but the money was good. The commission was always a plus everything else I couldve lived without, I guess thats why i left"
good,"I liked it most of the time. I hated the sales requirement. The people are decent, most of the team leads are good. Comcast sucks."
good,Customers are extremely rude. You answer calls from customers about their bills and changing services. Most customers don't talk the scream and cus. Its very taxing. You have to find a way to calm them down. Managers only talk to you a few times a week to go over your performance and any issues with how you handle calls. They pay is good and its easy to get extra for commission.  You get off on time easily and get two days off. The down fall is they are not always the same. You can be off Mon and Tues one week and Wed and Thurs the next week and sometimes you days off get split up .
good,"A typical day at Convergys is very hectic, unorganized and unprofessional. Although I found my way and succeeded at the tasks given to me, the things I had learned in training did nothing to prepare me for the work floor."
good,Minacs was okay to work at. The staff was nice and the pace of the job was okay but it was stressful and the hours were very long.
good,"If you dont mind the stress, this can be a good job to build experience that can then be taken to other companies, or sometimes other accounts within Convergys."
good,Convergys is a calling center where you can grow and move up in positions if you put in work. base pay was reasonable and you have room to make commission and bonuses.
good,"Your best allies are your peers. Even if the job is hard, there will always be help from your team mates. At the end of the day, you can say that you've done a good job even if things did not go well for you because there will always be someone to have your back and help you."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"They treated me as a family member and they taught me how to manage things well. I learned a lot on how to process recruitment requirements, assisting applicants on their assessments, filing, auditing of applicant's pre-employment requirements."
good,"My job consider helping OnStar customer with directions, and etc. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping people get around all over the U.S. and Canada."
good,"Although it was a bit stressful working in retention, I learned a lot from it and gained wonderful customer service skills."
good,"Co-workers are very helpful. I am new to technology but with the team co-operation till now I have not faced any remarkable hard part in job. "
good,great job I becaem a coach and trianed employees I worded a  lot of hoursand the people show i wokred with were great day good company to work for
good,A typical day at work is a moderately fast-paced and upbeat customer service sales environment. There is an abundant amount of information to be learned here and any time spent with this company sets a firm foundation for future endeavors.
good,"Typical customer service job with decent hours and clean work space, since I worked from home.  Only problem is pay which comes with customer service."
good,"The pay isn't great, moral is at an all time low."
good,My cal center experience was great! I was able to meet a lot of people working in this busy environment. This company taught me how to manage my time while at home and at work.
good,"The Atlanta Site faced numerous challenges. However, my Quality Team was able to strive to meet our site goals every week. Some management however, was not up to par and were very unprofessional. Other sites I cannot speak on, I'm merely basing this experience on my time at the Atlanta Site. The site is in need of new management."
good,"Lets you work as many hrs as you want, not stingy with overtimes, so I heard its easy to advance. Semi works with your hours. Breaks are a little too short"
good,"I started my call-center life with Convergys. Everything was totally different for me then. It was my first job and first time to live away from my family. I first learned my foundation of customer service in Convergys. It taught me how to be independent and honed my critical and analytical skills. I easily got along with my team-mates and had fun with the environment. I had a hard time coping up with the graveyard shuft then because it was as if a totally shift from my usual routine after college. Eventually, I got used to the routine and I am already able to exercise flexibility. I learned a lot from Convergys, from the most basic stuff in communications training down to the nitty-gritty of the product specifications."
good,A fun place to work.  The employees are nice and involved with the clients/customers. Overall the company needs to improve process controls and reporting.  The lack of correct procedures for multiple areas leads to employee dissatisfaction.  The management cares about your career path but is limited by budget constraints.  The most enjoyable part of the job is working directly with all members of the staff from agent to CEO.
good,"As long as you dont mind, having your schedule changed without even 24hrs notice then its good, but if you have any responsibilities outside of work do not apply."
good,doing customer service for time warner cable billing department also did floor support which means helping other agents with questions and taking supervisor calls
good,"Took internet calls for connection, emails, and server issues. Walked customers step by step to correct the problem and then upsale customers to more services."
good,"it was a call center job, it was exactly what you would expect.. the people were amazing and at first so was the HR team.. But the company keep restructuring and replacing management.. They also did not provide adequate training for some things"
good,"Above average pay with bonus structure, room for advancement, plenty of training, somewhat decent benefits, overtime as much as you need or want."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,pretty ok money was always to be made overtmie hours were really good i have no complaints about the staff or anything else
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was learning about Starbucks and their products. This position entailed troubleshooting the coffee machines and products for Starbucks company.
good,we are stalling a produce and services but they not provide intensive.and not provide good system to work batter. supervise  behaver not good.
good,"You went to work, clocked in, did you job and they only marginally cared about you and showed it by paying you only a few dollars over minimum wage. When the contract for the client corporation you were providing service for cancelled, Convergys didn't give any warning or anything.... You just showed up for work one day, were met at the door by a manager and a security guard, told to hand over your security badge and asked to leave the premises."
good,Typical call center job. benefits package is pretty nice and health insurance is nice. call center job was not for me as the calls are repetitive as most of the inbound calls are similar in resolution. co-workers do assist each other in support chat
good,"Answered phones, and tried to help customers as well as I could. Management and Co-Workers were nice.  Hardest part of the job was dealing with customers that called in upset."
good,Quiet workplace. It has a professional tone on the production floor. There are quite a few other employees working right along side you so they are there to help you at times as well. At times the calls come back to back and it can be over whelming at times.
good,"The training was very hands on they make sure you know all the ends-and-outs before hitting the call center floor."
good,"Concentrix Daksh Philippines has been a good company for you. They have a good working environment which is conducive to work comfortable. Every time that you'll deal with a difficult customer, staffs are always open to provide a real time assistance. Even if we are taking escalation calls everyday, life becomes light whenever you see your colleague's smile. Your managers will acknowledge your small things as a big contribution towards the improvement of the company."
good,I enjoyed my time working at this company.  Its a good position for a young person needing to attain professional experience.
good,"answer phone, make changes to customer credit card account, update accounts, make unhappy customer happy."
good,"The managers is very easy to approach, I enjoyed my 3 yrs. experience working in the said company. I have learned that we have to work smart if you want to work in a BPO Company."
good,"Mostly Monday's are the busiest day of the week."
good,"I like being able to help the people I talk to answer the questions I am asked. The experience is great as well as the thing I have learned thus far. Management is not that great, things are accused towards people that haven't been the things that are being accused. They are not professional and don't know how to properly handle situations with the agents. I believe they are great people outside of the office but in the office they just don't like their job so they take it out on the agents."
good,this job need to hire older people becuse the coworkers ae very childish and this job does not excuse you for anything if you dont have doc notice
good,Call Center. Taking Calls. Learned Customer Service. Learned to work with management. Got along with co workers and had friends from work. Hardest part of the job initially was ancillary selling when working the Cable TV Repair Queue. The most enjoyable part was solving a crisis for a customer.
good,The environment was a great one to work in however the training classroom lectures did not match to real life work load. would have preferred better training.
good,Provides prompt and efficient service to Amazon Sellers and Merchants including the appropriate escalation of Sellers’ issues.
good,Great Place  for starter career . teaches loads about the customer service culture .Promotes from within and rewards employees on great job .. Too much micro managemet
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Training for job was a bit lacking, I felt somewhat unprepared for some of the requirements of the job. I did gain quite some experience and knowledge in interpersonal skills, and my ability to handle angry and disruptive customers on a daily basis became very tuned. That was a great skill to also incorporate into my own personal life and personal relationships. I also gained quite a bit of knowledge in billing and technology of modern devices (phones, tablets, hotspots, etc). The management was very helpful and always willing to work around personal responsibilities. The most difficult part of job requirements was the schedule limitations. The shifts available were limited and shifts were also not very easily swapped. The most enjoyable part of the job requirements was the co-workers and workplace facilities."
good,"Job is ok if you want or like to work talking on phones all day,other than that its really just another job nothing out of this world"
good,"I worked for a certain company that was within Convergys.  Our department was shut down due to the management not completing their jobs correctly.  I loved what I did within the company, but I would not bet on it being a career place."
good,"it was fun and enjoyable work place."
good,A typical day at work is you come in you log yourself into your computer and you take calls for your shift. You really dont get to speak with coworkers unless the queue is slow the hardest part of the job is calming down an irate customer who hasnt received their package and youre the 6th person he/she has spoken with and nothing has been resolved for this person. Which as a Customer Service Agent you will have to handle calls like this from time to time
good,"job was face pace took inbound calls all the time"
good,Convergys is an okay place to work as long as you're working in the right department. The sales department is where I worked and it wasn't half bad. I didn't alway agree with the sales process but either way you have to adhere to the policies. There are weekly evaluations on your calls so you get feedback often and the supervisors are pretty cool. The only thing I dislike it the scheduling bans. It makes your schedule fluctuate instead of it being steady.
good,"Working at Minacs has been a great learning experience. Made me focus on my soft skills especially when dealing with frustrated customers. An average day at Minacs is ""something new everyday"". No two customers are the same and it is always fun to resolve their issues over a phone call."
good,"I worked  for this company while pregnant with my child, this is a okay company to work for but I left after giving birth, they are not good about rehires because I've tried to go back."
good,The staff there is very professional its a good company to work for . some of the pros are the rate of pay and bonuses available.
good,"day at work is always productive in convergys, learned excellent tips about windows operating systems troubleshooting."
good,Not a lot of helpful friendly people. its truly a dog eat dog world. HIGH turnover rate. They do give out a lot of overtime for those who can stand to stay longer than needed.
good,"answering phones dealing with customer complaints."
good,"Convergys was a good company to work with, but the opportunities were limited. Not due a lack of ability, but due more to very low turnover in the management team."
good,job culture is good but management don't work good for me dont know how to take care of good hard workers  . make lot of friends and new experiences
good,This place is an intense atmosphere. There is so many different programs to learn and things to remember.  They are very helpful in trying to get you trained properly it just takes a long time for some.
good,"The summary should say it all"
good,the workplace can be a lot of fun there. however the management is hit and miss. the higher up you go on the ladder the more corrupt they get. other then that. they hire anyone and everyone. just keeping the job is another story.
good,Fun employees and workplace but management made me feel uncomfortable due o the rate of hiring and firing individuals.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Concentrix provides many platforms to employees to present themselves in front of world. "
good,Company could use better communication to employees.  Constant shifting around of Team Leaders makes it difficult to maintain a relationship with management.
good,"Being able to assist families with wide variety of services like cellphones, internet,U-Verse and basic cable. Friendly area to work! Learn a lot on a daily bases."
good,"My shifts were in eight-hour increments, as a CSR I would receive incoming calls and address the customers issues or needs accordingly. I was given two fifteen-minute breaks and one half hour lunch. I worked six months with a core schedule and than we’d have to chose to stay on the same schedule or change it for the next six months."
good,"Ok job atmosphere, but laid us off after promising a long term contract. Friendly work environment great coworkers and great incenetives"
good,"typical day at work is answering inbound calls and dealing with complaints. coaching sessions with the managers. interacting with co-workers, there is generally a good atmosphere between the co-workers"
good,"Lacking work life balance, more inclined to work only. Salary was lower than what was expected. Management was not very good for the account which I was placed into."
good,"Convergys has been my second home for almost 6 years now. Within my stay, I have a made a lot of friends. My friends have been my motivation to go to work everyday."
good,"The company and work environment were great, but the management and policies kept changing without proper updates or training. There was not enough Management."
good,"being with this company at my time is really amazing because of the people there, in my time of working there the hr persons are so cool that they are like with the ""level"" of ordinary and newbee in the company"
good,"inbound calls troubleshooting problems with DTV dishes and programming"
good,"i really like the job just not how they don't accept doctors notes when someone is sick. The job is not hard you just answer the phone for people who are calling to make a payment on the insurance policy, change there doctors, look up a doctor ect"
good,"Found if you worked with the management team on a give & take basis they will work to balance the job against your individual needs; you just need to be willing to step up and ask."
good,As per my view when i start working in MINACS i was very much afraid of the process and the work culture there because it was my first time working in a BPO. After i i have done with the training and started taking call's all the fear which i had has vanished. The colleagues i worked with they helped me a lot and also enjoy a lot working with them. In the company there is also lots of extra curricular activities being organised time to time. And every year there is a grant party. It was really good working there however as the process was shifting i had to search for a better job.
good,"The day starts with clocking in 5 min prior to shift, followed by our manager advising us how the work flow is going for that day and recapping the success stories from the day before. After clocking in and opening all of our systems we take phone calls assisting a variety of customers all over the United States and sometimes international as well."
good,The first few months working at Convergys was smooth and very interesting. I gained a lot of experience in customer service. My typical day at work was basically answering calls and reviewing billing and charges.
good,"had very good experience in this company but looking for best position and better salary"
good,"I had worked at Minacs for 9 years. When I first began working there, it was a great establishment. When it was bought and changed over to Aditya Birla Minacs, the company went bad. "
good,Nice company that is providing the best experience for their employee and customer. Has nicest staff and guards to assist the employees.
good,"Fun to work if you like to play video games or pool and ping pong on your breaks and lunches. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Kiss butt here and you will do well. This company will not look to put you in a better place but look to trap you where you are. They will never go through with what they promised but they will hold you accountable for actions of others.
good,A very diversified place to work with a lot of different people!  I learned a lot of new computer skills.  It was difficult sitting for long periods at a time.
good,"aprendi a como manejar un grupo de clientes, el uso verbal de las palabras y ademas de eso tuve una buena relación con mis compañeros"
good,One of the leading companies in BPO section. A wonderful place to work for. A good work culture. Unfortunately the process I was working for got shut down.
good,Call center for OnStar on a daily basis you wold give customers directions and help them with their accounts. Not very leniant on missing days they go off of a point schedule which is very laid out.
good,"eight hours a day and 40 hours a week."
good,"I have been working at Minacs full-time"
good,A typical day at convergys consists of taking consistent inbound phone calls to assist customers with account issues. I learned how to deal with angry customers and to show empathy about their situation. The people I worked with were very supportive and helpful in all areas. The hardest part of the job was maintaining positive statistics. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to talk to people from all over the world.
good,"I enjoyed very much working for Convergys, I talked on the phone a lot, all day to be precise, learned a lot about the United States Postal Service, tracking packages and other mail, submitting complaints to the post master general,"
good,"I have been with English queue at the beginning, then I have been promoted for bilingual position as supervisor. Good place to work for students."
good,"I learned a lot of systems, but I didn't have them down before being put on the phones, so it was very frustrating when people were looking for answers, and it took you awhile to find answers or get help. The most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers and the good pay. But unfortunately it wasn't my cup of tea."
good,A typical day at work was answering and making phone calls. I learned how to multi-task. Management was fair. My co-workers were cordial.
good,Overall a very good and diverse company to work for. You meet great people and establish long term relationships within the company. It all depends on what program you work for; Some are great programs while others are not. Benefits can be better and pay in some of the programs. Flexible schedules and great management staff. Co workers are like family to me.
good,Answering incoming calls related to member's medical benefits and medical claims from both members and providers. I learned how to perfect my multitasking skill. I learned to deal with different personalities from both management and coworkers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the call volume during the open enrollment period. The most enjoyable part is the bonds I built with people.
good,Cashier at pollo loco learned to keep charge of my cashier and assist customers in person. the coworker their were great and easy to get along. hardest part was having to be a cashier and also prepare the food and get it out all at the same time but overall the job was a great experience.

good,"The environment can be taxing and isn't for everyone, but the hours are pretty good (guaranteed fulltime) and there is always overtime with incentives available. Middle level supervisors aren't treated the best and salary is $35000, Upper Management is moved around quite a bit."
good,"This company is good to start out at, they do spend a good amount of time on training and to help you understand before getting to the floor. They could be a little more hands on and helpful for actual work though, and the benefits could be a little better."
good,"Good pay, steady, terrible hours. Very scheduled lunches and breaks. Good management, fun environment and people.Good if you enjoy typing and talking to people and hrlping"
good,A fun work place with lots of activities throughout the year.  Prizes and free lunches a constant event throughout the year for different events or employee appreciation.  A stressful job but lots of training and management support.  Acceptable benefits.  Constant change to match the changes of the culture and diversity.  The pay is metric based and so fluctuates.  Lots of opportunity for advancement.  What I enjoyed most about the job is the teamwork mentality instilled in everyone and 360 feedback is encouraged.  Everyone's voice can be heard.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Internally a great bunch of people to work alongside. Great learning opportunities and change for internal advancement.
good,"I loved the customers, sometimes the systems didn't work there were soe crazy rude cstomers but what job doesn't have that I just kid of wish I didn't have to lease to start school but college at the time was very important to me"
good,"Company is growing bigger each day, new hired applicants are fully supported; fun to work people and very supportive teams and approachable. During the day and night, security guards are very cheerful and energetic,always there to ask helped with and report incidents to avoid chaos within the company. A lot of things to learn such as company updates, benefits, health concern programs and charitable works to share and experience how living and economy status is within the city. Co-workers are fun, caring and approachable, always there to share new ideas and opinions; the hardest part of the job is the resources, higher supports don't have enough time to respond when needed specially during high volume of calls. The most enjoyable part of the job is when issue is not as it is specially device is not powered on, Ethernet cable is not properly plugged in or mobile devices are not charged."
good,It was ok nothing to much better than my last job ; it paid the bills ;co workers are funny and cool;customers being rude hardest part of my job
good,There is a lack of organization but can be a great work place. A great place for college students or professionals in between jobs or rethinking career goals.
good,"Call Center where calls range from needing directions, doors unlocked, to airbag deployments and need of emergency assistance.  The employees and Team Leads were all like family here.  Did not enjoy  mandatory Overtime."
good,Convergys was a customer service driven company. They could use more training on the actual service that they are contracting for.
good,At Wal-Mart I put out new merchandise and marked down old merchandise. unloaded trucks of merchandise in the back. also ran registers upfront and zoned jewelry and apparel.
good,"Fantastic company , excellent HR rules, Good Payroll system. about  my manger and team leader nice work experience with them."
good,"I took incoming phone calls as an AT&T representative and assisted customers with various issues.  I took this job just after the housing crisis in 2008 and was grateful to have enough to provide for myself and my family while I finished my Bachelor's degree."
good,"It was a good place to work in terms of job security they were really willing to work with you in terms of attendance, if you had something that brought you up to termination status they'd work with you and find out what is going wrong and do the best they could to help you because they valued you as an employee and tried to keep you happy. The bad part is there isn't really and chance for raises or advancement. When you're put in a position you're stuck with it until you leave."
good,"We dealt with a lot of customer complaints, I learned how to handle multiple customers who were upset in different approaches, I learned new computer systems, co-workers were good and always approachable."
good,pay was good enough to support a family on the hours were long the customers were rude learned alot about cell service and u verse products was easy to sell nothing to challenging for other people
good,"Working at a call centre is VERY stressful, finding information for callers as quickly as possible. Typical day at work was going on the phone and taking one call right after the other. Being on the phone and constantly being timed for everything and also being recorded is hard.  I enjoy helping people but definitely did not like getting penalized by their point system (which supposedly resulted in what shift and any bonuses I was eligible for) when I took the time to resolve the issue.  Many times I was told I could have/should have done it faster...and that seemed to be the focus, not that I resolved the issue or gave out accurate information, but how quickly I was able to do it. The hardest part of the job wasn't in fact helping those who called, it was being reviewed and the pat phrase used by all managers was ""What could you have done better?"" so you are always feeling your best was never good enough.  My co-workers were great tho and tried to help when needed,although they were also busy trying to meet their own metrics, and they did help relieve some of the stress.  The benefits were really good tho, that is one thing I will say, as we had prescription, dental, vision, and things like massage therapy etc. Most companies seem to hire for part time and don't provide any benefits, so that was definitely a plus.  I did learn that I can multi-task and handle using all kinds of different programs and could use my knowledge to find a 'back way' of finding information whenever one system didn't work. I also learned that I can be very polite and helpful on the phone even when"
good,"being an employee of convergys is a privilege because of the training that they gave us, the management is always there to support us an employee by giving all the materials that we need during training so that we can provide a customer satisfaction to the client or subscriber"
good,This job was a very valuable learning experience for myself. Started without very much experience in a call center and left with allot of confidence knowing I could accomplish any obsticles and new endenvors.
good,It's a call center. What can you say. Most T/L's are very friendly and willing to help. Schedule bidding Co-workers in your teams are usually friends as well. Employee incentives. The only downfall to this company is that it is always changing so this week your title might be customer service the next week technical support. You just never know.
good,"This job is nice because it keeps you up and moving, you socialize and help customers get what they want. It is a good job for those that like to socialize."
good,This was a type of job where I had to service customers over the phone. I took inbound calls. I enjoyed answering customers via email. There were times I was yelled at because the customer would not recognize transactions on their credit card (The call center at this place deals with Capital One)
good,Answering calls for customer service - cancellations - to provide customer with exceptional customer service provide first call resolution. A lot of our issues with working from home it was hard to get any assistance when needing often times calls that should have been a simple call turned into long calls due to there was either not enough TL's working or not enough TCC working to assist all the reps that on the phones.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."

good,Fun work place with supportive supervisors and co-workers. I usually taking in calls for 11 hours with 1 hour for lunch and 3 breaks for about 15 minute each break. The management is good. The hardest part of the job is that you need to negotiate with your costumer to upgrade their package if ever there have some changes with the services the company is offering and it will increase their monthly bill. And the most enjoyable part of the job is when the costumer I am negotiating agreed to the services I am offering them despite of the increase of their monthly bill. And I got good incentives to that.
good,It is a fun place to work but I think they still need to make sure that they have recreational activities so that you have work life balance.
good,When i worked here at the Brownsville location it felt like a mouse in a maze. I did not like it whatsoever. I wold not reccommend working at the Brownsville location. But no one will because it closed.
good,"It was fun going to work few months back since the management was really good in handling their people. As a Team Leader, I am the mediator between the agents and the management. Aside from balancing work and fun, I need to make sure that the scores being asked by the clients are met as well. Since we changed our Operations Manager, it became different already. No fun, rapport was not even established, agents does not even know him since he does not mingle with us, Team Leaders, and also the agents."
good,This job required answering inbound calls. what I enjoyed most was that you can never not be busy. The most challenging part was back to back inbound calls. The co-workers would all help one another as well as the supervisors if you have problems assisting customers.
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Decent amount of red tape and politics. The most enjoyable part was working alongside my colleagues and learning from them.

good,"Typical day at work, making sure that you are logged into the phone at all times, make sure you are available at all times for the next billing or retention call, I worked for the AT&T home security billing and retention department, loved all my co workers and team leaders. navigation through various systems to properly identify each customer and resolve any issues or concerns at hand with customer.  I wouldn't say that there was anything really hard about my job at Convergy's it was smooth sailing as long as you did pay attention and maintain customer friendly attitude."
good,"conditions de travail moyenne, mais bonne société pour faire ses premieres armes"
good,I handled router support for wifi issues( Linksys). I learned for the first time about wifi connection. People are friendly and approachable. I gained a lot of friends and they're team player.I did have hard times in the company and company would find ways to have party time if needed.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes!

good,"the management is poor though the company pays sound."
good,I enjoyed my time working for Convergys.  I loved having the opportunity of working from home and assisting customers.  I worked for AT&T Mobile providing customer service for customers mobility bills.
good,"Its a very fun and casual environment but I wasn't satisfied with the training. Comcast department has many complaints so you get calls from frustrated or upset customers. If you cant take the stress from constant calls like that, then its not recommended for you."
good,"They dont keep there word in what they promice you, and they will push you to sell even though the cust. does not want anything."
good,"convergys management was awful, it was rare when to open time was available, hard to get a day to be approved for doctors appointment, point systems regarding absence was absurd"
good,I enjoyed my days working at Convergys I've learned a lot pertaining to skills enhancement. The management was good as well as my co-workers they always encourage us in our lives.
good,They're very easy going. Not to strict. Very hard on attendance policy. Don't care about personal problems. Have a cafeteria. The trainers are very nice. training is 5 weeks. Attendance is required. Need a lot of patience dealing with calling customers.
good,The Job description was clearly defined along with expectations for a successful career path.  Unfortunately my position was sent offshore.
good,"A typical day at work is normally 8-9 hour shifts with two 15 minute breaks. The breaks are used to make a phone call or use the restroom. You receive one half hour lunch as well. We are normally at the same cubicle everyday on a certain team taking inbound calls being aware of our call handling time, transfer rates, or sells on a designated computer."
good,"Answer inbound call, assist caller with his/her medication. help caller set up web registration or unlock account. fax doctor to get new RX for members"
good,"At Concentrix the environment was great but the upper management could have had better guidance, the sales program base pay was good but the commission fluctuated to much."
good,"Lots of room for advancement, but customer can be difficult to deal with on a regular basis.  Customers can also be very rewarding and provide positive feedback for good employees."
good,This was a new project with convergys A lot of the systems had troubles seeing this was the first year of the program. The work environment was unprofessional at times with lack of management and majority females working there.
good,"Decent place to work if you enjoy customer service, excess workloads and constant changes. I recommend this for a started job for anybody needing to get by."
good,"was an over all good experience . Helping people I like to do, but when your trying to hurt people and not giving the best services for customers."
good,"Convergys is an decent company to work for. The employees are good people and are fun to be around. The management although never around when needed, are also good people. There is bonus structure but Convergys has made it so that they can take it away at no notice and not give you an bonus that you worked hard for. They also have incentives like gift cards, electronics and things like that to keep you going and reach your goals. Occasionally they will feed you. The job is tedious, the customers are usually rude but you do have your nice ones that come in. Moving up in the company is possible if you reach their very hard but attainable stats. Over all I would give this company 3 stars as it is an job that pays the bills and it does have its moments, but personally would not work there my whole life."
good,I worked for Direct TV and took incoming calls for current direct TV customers having questions about their bill or wanting to switch their programming. I enjoyed talking to the customers.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Very unprofessional job establishment "
good,"The BEST part of Concentrix is they are flexible when it comes to hours. If you have a doctors appointment in the afternoon you can work an earlier shift. If you have to call in one day or need to leave early, you can make up your hours and save your PTO. They are almost always willing to work around your schedule. "
good,A typical day is answering technical questions for customers. The hardest part is being on the phones all day and dealing with angry customers. Management and co-workers are ok.
good,job ended up laying everyone off because the client no longer wanted us as their provider. Luckily i as able to land another job that offered higher pay and did not have much of a lapse in payments. Was a great job while it lasted.
good,"I took numerous of calls for all kinds of stuff and patience was a must, you really have to love what you do to work for this company and have tons of experience because the callers will definitely test that patience. Hardest part is by far is staying professional when getting cussed at by callers."
good,One of those few companies that honestly really try to make their employees happy and treat them well but fall slightly short. They don't take into account the fact that the job is high stress level and sometimes you need a few more breaks in order to get your head level again.
good,"Integrity is the virtue at Convergys."
good,"Overall it was a good job. Typical day would just be signing into your work computer and began taking incoming calls. We had teams, team meeting to discuss our performances. Co workers were decent also, good to get along with. Most stressful thing was not getting paid on time."
good,"A day at work as a Quality Assurance Specialists starts with reading numerous emails, starting my daily task of reviewing and rating performance of customer transactions on all support channels (phone, chat, email), coach experts with the most opportunities observed and attending a meeting with the clients."
good,Answer phones and assist customers with billing questions. Assist customers with step by step walk through trouble shooting to ensure all technical assistance is basic and understood to resolve any problems with Direct TV products. Consistently achieved monthly sales goals with focus on up-selling enhanced offers.
good,Even we are in the production and taking calls the OM still provide some activities to join by all employees. The management always provide training 1 or 2X a week. The hardest part of my job is when the caller / customer never listen or follow your instruction to them and the most enjoyable part to the job is the training because you will learn something more.
good,"Everyday was fun, had music playing. Great co-workers. Had a cantina inside walking distance to other places for lunch. Hardest part was management asking for sells when consumers were calling to cancel services."
good,Great company. A job to help you find a job in the meantime. Great group of coworkers. Customers were very irate. Late shift was always quiet
good,You will learn new things everyday because of the business owners that you will encounter. I find this job difficult at first because it's a accounting software but I find it easy when I got used to it.
good,a typical day at work for me is mostly relaxing and comfortable i learn new things everyday about how to navigate through my systems and solving problems without contacting an resolution expert. My Manger  always says I'm one of the best agents that she has and that i deserve a raise. As for my coworkers i get along with everyone I'm a very friendly kind of person i mainly stay to myself and focus on my job so i have never had an issue at work. I would say that the hardest part of my job is telling members that there patients have no active coverage and that they would need to pay out of pocket
good,The concerns were addressed but not to the degree they needed to be. Basically if you made a complaint it was shrugged off. When a person would have a medical issue the top manager would be conspicuously absent and when the person was there they acted as if this was ridiculous that a person was not an automaton
good,"I worked for Convergys for 20 years and I loved the ability to move between industries and positions all through out my career. I liked the people I worked with and the teamwork we embraced to please our clients and employees. However, there is a good deal of politics in the upper levels and if you don't mind working over 110 hours a week consistently then this may be for you."
good,"you'll discover fun, challenging work, surrounded by talented, supportive managers and colleagues, and you'll enjoy"
good,I worked as a coach for four years and a team leader for three.  I loved being able to help my people develop and promote to positions of greater responsibility.

good,"busy taking incoming calls for AT&T customers, learned about the different plans and features  AT&T offers, management was rocking at first then once they met with employees to see what they can do to make working there better, the change was good, they showed that they care and appreciated there employees."
good,"My experience with convergys was not very good. I did not make it past the training stage. I tried to learn as much as I could, but when it came time for me to be on the phones with a trainers ""help"" my questions where ignored, the answers I did get where short to the point of being rude. I was terminated with little or no explanation after trying very hard to do my best."
good,"at morning shift - received and response email and phone calls, medical certificate validation of employees, caring and assess employees if there is any complaints and refer to the on duty doctor."
good,it is an alright place to work if you can deal with your standards constantly changing. lacks consistency but is alright if you are just looking for full time work
good,Concentrix is the company which works as the client requirement and provides the complete flexibility to the workers demanded by the client
good,"typical day is sitting and waiting for phone calls to come in, then having to deal with the same customers over and over. having to sit there and listen customers cuss at you and call you names. I do have an awesome boss and co-workers"
good,Convergys was not a bad place to work. I spent most of my time there helping customers out with technical problems. The rest of my time I spent mentoring newly hired employees.
good,"- Need to provide the reports needed or asked by the requester"
good,Answering calls to help customers with internet. at times it was very simple and other times it was pretty stressful. it was just a job to suffice while i went from point a to point b
good,"On an average, Convergys has been a good company to work with. Past 11 years of my carreer has been both learning experience and rewarding carreer and that can be only possible when there is support from the management and the team working under you."
good,"Stay at home and answer calls...Convergys is a great place to get experience and to learn the BPO industry, or get experience in the many industries they support their clients in. In many locations you can work with several Fortune 500 companies and have the opportunity to build your resume. I do believe they care about their people and people development."
good,handling inbound and outbound calls from customers about their account and bill. Provided technical support. My co-workers were very nice and I learned from those before me how to better handle a call. The hardest part of the job was offering high priced premiums to  irate/impatient customers who were trying to lower their bill. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting/talking with the different customers and getting to know them on a more personal level.
good,"Honestly, the co-workers are the best thing about working at Minacs. The job itself is stressful and most times you end up telling the ""no"". If it weren't for my co-workers I would have probably quit a long time ago."
good,"It's like attending high school everyday. There's always been drama filled work environment and favoritism among the managers. The pay can be better for most of the programs as well as the benefits. Can't trust certain people here, since there's been a high rate of theft."
good,"Weird company, sketch site, technical support work, very unorganized, easy work, not enough pay. big company suck. I hated working here"
good,"Call Centre environment"
good,"Answer tech calls"

Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Was able to communcitae with customers as I was able to send directions to their vehicals for a family trip, to the store, or back home. Inbound calls over 100 a day."
good,"The company would build each employee a confident human being."
good,"I have worked at Convergys for 19years and been in many positions.  Right now I am the lead coach, which consists of: tracking attendance, training, quality, coaching the coaches to help them with the transition agents, trends tracker, run 3 debriefs a day based on the trends or questions the new agents have, make sure the TL's meet their agents, get the agents ready for production while they are in transition. "
good,"Must have very good communication skills, quick to learning the systems that they have available, and be able to sit for long periods of time."
good,"The people overall are great. "
good,"Was a good place to work at, at the time. No longer in buissiness tho. wasn't any room to grow and the pay sucked but other then that, the people who worked there was great so it made it manageable"
good,"angry customers all day, supervisors were not a big help they would always say that they were going to help but never did. it was a sink or swim kind of job"

good,"•	Receive inbound calls "
good,"Lots of ex-cons, deportees, and low lifes. Don't work there if you don't have to. If you do, try to find something better quickly!"
good,"Excellent entry-level job. At the time wages were average, however lack of benefits were noticeable. Problem solving was the key skill in this job. I answered phone calls at a inbound call facility for Hewlett-Packard assisting their customers in computer related issues. From software installation to hardware troubleshooting. "
good,I learned about customer service here. My senior and co workers all were very helpful and nice. The most enjoyable part of this job was to solve the customers issue in the best possible manner.
good,Very busy work environment.  Challenging every day.  I am passionate about the work I do.  It can be difficult to work in a Corporate enviroment.
good,"As a chat agent, a typical day involves remote troubleshooting. Troubleshooting could involve remote connection via GoToAssist or guiding customers step by step in removing components from the system to isolate a point of failure. Management mostly leaves us unsupervised as we are very self sufficient. The hardest part of the job is the constant flow of inbound traffic and the most enjoyable part is my team. We all share like interests and bounce ideas back and forth for different issues."
good,"Very hard work, customers often brutal, but in the end most issues were resolved in the most mutually agreeable way. Was told more than a few times that I needed thick skin to work here."
good,"The job is a mixed bag. Comes with benefits and you are almost guaranteed to move through the company to different departments. Pay is bi-weekly. Hours are all over the place, so don't get too comfortable what times you work. "
good,"have a good working place, people are friendly, salary is fine. Enjoyed work but sometimes it is stressful. Learned how to communicate better and work as a team."
good,A typical day at work. Learn to interact with different people. Management is good. Co-workers are very friendly. Nothing hard as such
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,It was a good job until new management got involved and it brought the atmosphere to being more stressful. I enjoyed the people I worked with like my immediate supervisor and team members but the higher management level employees brought stress so I looked elsewhere.
good,"Call Centre environment in Chatham, ON with several areas of specialization in regards to automobiles.  Team environment working under american dictatorship."
good,"Lots of manditory overtime. And a general sense of not being valued. "
good,At this company I had to train for 6 weeks and the classes were fairly easy. As I was on the floor the call were intense and some made me feel like I needed more training. But overall I think that if you have the experience that you can survive doing this job

good,"A good place to work for advancement in a career with multiple departments, coaches and supervisors who push you to be the best you can be."
good,Working at Convergy's was an ok job. The typical day working there was slow some days and very fast paced majority of the days. The co-workers there were good people. We each had our own cubical so it was different not actually working along side one another. We did have team meetings that helped the co-workers to get know one another. The hardest part of the job was staying consistent with sales over the phone to build your commission. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to be yourself and talking with different types of people from all over the United States. Management was ok but they were also not really on top of helping you meet your goals and coaching you on what you were lacking of.
good,"Some team lead could be a bit more helpful when assisting call rep. Management should be able to work around single parents child care providers. "
good,The company offers many incentives for reaching company set goals.  Several weeks of hands on training is substantial for the work required.  The downside is sitting in a chair all day and being confined to a small work space for the majority of an 8-10 hour shift.  Work hours can be late and shifts are unusual. Not ideal for college students or busy parents in terms of scheduling.
good,I rather not give my opinion regarding this company. I wish to keep all comments to my self regarding minacs. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.
good,Good for people looking to work from home. Limited or no career and salary growth. Lack of training opportunities. Not able to retain experienced employees
good,"During our training the trainers took the time to make sure that everyone understood the information that they were learning.  Team leaders were all great, fun and understanding."
good,Privately owned company with many tasks that may vary from a typical work day.  Good work life balance that works around your school schedule.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"As a salaried supervisor i was asked to work, off the clock, without compensation, numerous times. This resulted in my departure."
good,A great place to get CSR experience. I will say attendance is KEY. Overtime is excellent. Convergys goes by the book and stay by the book.
good,"Tech to chat for AT&T cell phone service, worked on a 445pm-115am shift that was impossible to move off of, they often had system down time."
good,Managements tend to make mistakes in regards to your salary and benefits. I rate this company as one of the better company I worked for. People are very nice and facility is very clean. The food in the canteen is very good and price are not bad either.
good,"This position was in a call center which had its pros and cons. The company I supported was OnStar and it was contant phonecalls; not much of a break between calls. I prefer it to be that way verses sitting around and waiting for calls to come in. "
good,"Convergys is a great place to start a customer service experience. A typical day at work consists of answering roughly 20 phone calls while adhering to call guidelines and stats to maintain. "
good,I learned about different medications and what people have to go through in order to get the medicines that they need.
good,"Take incoming calls from customers concerning there cell phone service from bills, to trouble shooting there product also a lot of sales."
good,enjoy being on a team for short time there.. learned groth  within the company
good,"Pay was decent for a starting position, but upper management was a mess, had three different supervisors within 4 months. Also, there was issues with the comp plan; consisting people were not getting there full amount of not even understanding how the numbers broke down."
good,Its a call center so you will be on the phones for 8 hours taking at least 50 calls within your shift. Management and some TL don't have a clue about customer service. Most don't understand that we as employee's are their customer and need to be spoken to with respect.
good,The work culture is good... but it hinders your work life balance
good,"The usual taking calls about bills, billing dispute, payment errors, automated machine not working and all other things. I've learned that I need to let them talk their anger out, listening patiently. Acknowledge, Empathized and provide solution to their issues and their anger will simply drain away. Management motivates through coaching. Gives clear directions and they are firm and fair. Co-workers are sometimes MEAN but everything is ok though. Dealing with irate caller. Self control and maintaning composure. less reactive, the more I can use better judgment to handle the situation."
good,"I really love what im doing here, speaking with clients and all. But since it is a call center and i am on night shift, it is kind of tiring and no social life. All the co workers were also kind but has a bad habit of smoking."
good,"This is a fast pace work environment. It is a call center so every day is different, except during training. The training was fairly intense; we had 5 weeks to learn seven systems and also learn the customer service aspect of the job."
good,Too many changes preventing representatives to make commissions they were either used to or are told they can make.
good,"When working for stream you learn so much and i enjoyed my coworkers. Most are very helpful. A typical day would be to get on the phones and answer calls. Take care of problems , help customers to pay the bill or find out what is wrong and how you can be of help."
good,Everyday is different.  Basic Admin Asst duties.  Call Center; we had alot of contest.
good,Like most call centers. This place is a hot bed for drama on and off the phone. On one end your constantly getting cursed out by angry customers and then by some co-workers on the other end.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"enjoyed meeting an greeting customer"
good,"Everyday is a new day, from time to time i learned a lot from the system and from the customers. Thou as a Retention Specialist is not easy to stay long for this this job, because must of the caller i am handling with are irritated costumers, i always tend to listen first and give empathy, then i look to find resolution to address the caller's concern, then at the end of the conversation, a simple Thank you from my caller would make my day complete..."
good,HR Advisor/Lead Recruiter is a very fast pace job.  Always new people to work with.  Enjoyed the work.
good,Convergys is a great place to work if you can handle the rude customers all day. Co-workers are friendly and helpful. You work with computers all day and you sit in cubeicials. It 8 hour shifts. Hardest part of the job is talking to the customers when they decide that you are the bad person and decide to cuss you. Enjoyable part of the job is the fun environment always music playing and there is always a game or some kind of prize being given away.
good,"The job itself isn't that difficult but you do have to keep up with MULTI screens and programs. It's very hard to provide good customer service, also, when you're constantly being monitored for your time."
good,"works in an 8 hours job a day, without the overtime we help costumers on a daily basis on their concerns. i have learned to be more flexible in any situations. and how to deal with people in different walks of life. the management boost our interest through continuous training and offers on promotion. my co-workers are very helpful and friendly. the hardest part of the job is when giving your best but your still unable to help the costumer. most enjoyable part of the job is when you get praised by the costumer when you were able to help them after giving your best."

good,"- Great co-workers."
good,"1. Day Shift"
good,I learned a substantial amount about technology services contracts.
good,"Important days of life outside Air Force, which is sort of adjusting to a non-disciplined life.  It was fun learning and understood the importance of facilities management.  This exposure led me to move out and seek more experience in the service provider's side."
good,This was a great place to learn to do very repetitive work. Fun events during the year.
good,"Took a long time to prove my worthiness under a constant stressful environment, and I felt that I made my contribution a valuable one  and had been recognized eventually."
good,"took calls from customer "
good,"* busy in numerous calls"
good,"Fun environment, great people. There can be a little bit of drama issues. Call centers just aren't for me."
good,"It's fun to work at Convergys the people are nice and friendly always willing to help.They should start paying there employees well. It's not just a job you have the opportunity to connect with your customers and truly be able to say you give excellent customer service. I would say it's like any other job it has it stressful moments but because you have a team you can depend on and will help you get through it to reach your goals.I was part of employee engagement team which used to manage the events and employee oriented activities.Co workers ,management is very helpful,teach you a lot.working at convergys was the most intresting part of the job"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,The work place was fun because of my coworkers but once you knew who to talk to in management then it seemed like people got fired from left and right. Management has an issue in enforcing rules to those they were cool with but for those management didn't really care for they wanted to write you up or fire you.
good,"A typical day at work, would be assisting pharmacists on the phone & helping with rejections they were receiving. I learned numerous of things such as how to utilize my tools to the best of my ability. As far as management goes, it was organized, my co-workers makes a good environment for a work place. The hardest part when it came to my job was not being able to assist every pharmacist that call. But I did enjoy helping everyone I could."
good,"My duties consisted in helping customers with various different postal matters such as change of address, tracking mail, complaints, and ordering mail supplies.  Also score a 95% and higher in Quality Assurance"
good,"Probably the best call center I have worked in. Easy going environment and pretty great people, but it's a call center. It's not really like any other call center I have worked in."

good,"Good company for freshers, pay good however alot of work pressure and targets to achieve"

good,Answer inbound calls to assist customers with their accounts to better understand. I learned how to build repport to calm irate customers. I enojoyed speaking to people from across the states as they invite you to their city when vacationing. The hardest part at first was navigating through so many systems.
good,The company has a very productive environment. I learned that not all things are achieved easily. You have to work really hard to earn money and specifically abide by the rules. The hardest part are the metrics you have to reach and the pressure that one mistake can lead to being jobless the next day.
good,"I know this is nearly impossible, however I strive to for perfection."
good,"I did most of the times night shift due to BPO sector."
good,"Convergys is a great place to work the only thing is that you need hard skin to work over there, more for the pay. One of the most difficult department is the apple one and is not for the management is for the customer most of them are difficult to deal. Converges also have an attendance points that the way that they deal is not worth it. If you het 12 points you get fire and that make tp other coworkers work when they are sick to no add a point to their attendance and that sucks because they make other coworkers sick too"
good,Clocking in and taking 2 15 min brakes and one 30 min lunch if you so choose. i learned how to communicate with customers that were very upset with me. the management was ok they were sometimes no where to be found. the co-workers were okay some of them were very rude and thought they were better then you. trying to get along with most of the co-workers and trying to make friends. the most enjoyable part was to learn new things and to have the chance to grow with the company.
good,"The company is no longer there"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"It is a call center, that is just that.  It is a good place to work for a paycheck, but little room for advancement in general.  Depending on the client group you work on depends on how much you will like or hate it."
good,I worked using the phone and computer to respond to customer complaints and worked to resolved their cell phone problems.
good,The work was not easy but the company was always promoting from within the company.
good,"Co-workers make the day go by quickly."
good,"Every day I get into work I say hello to my staff, set up my laptop check my email to see if there is any assignments from the client I may need to complete and send off. I then conduct 4 Team huddles delivering any new process or steps from the client to the staff. I also address any of the employees concerns. Then, I start my daily coaching sessions. Once those are done I then attend my, if any, daily meeting with my direct manager and or program manager.By this time my co-workers has come in which I have filled in with any new changes. I then finish up any reports then head home for the day."
good,"Most of the time call volume is high"
good,"Its a fun place to work. The people are nice, And you get free food"
good,"Advanced twice within the company."
good,"Providing great customer service at all times, even with irrate customer, also troubleshooting customer devices"
good,Job is good but pay is horrible for work required to do as manager with no bonuses.
good,"Good learning environment and fun place to work at."
good,"I really enjoyed talking with customers on the phone and providing them with the correct information about their plan and how they could save some money and make changes and order new devices and give them all their options even if it took more than 14 minutes to answer all their questions, which is why I was let go because my phone calls were more like 25 minutes. Convergys said it was my job performance, because of not meeting their goal of 14 min per call."
good,A typical day at Convergy's is logging in and accepting inbound calls. I have learned to multitask and take disrespect from customers. The management mostly mind their own business and didn't really try to make the job easier. My coworkers were all on the same confused level like everyone else. The hardest part was trying to make sells to customers that were calling in to downgrade services or to complain about the service they are receiving. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to have two breaks and an hour lunch to calm down from the calls that were being taken.
good,"Convergy' s is a good company to work for, they treat there employee's well. Have great benefits and reward employees with food . Weekly staff meeting to vent if needed."
good,"It was ok, but the people could be really mean to you since it was an on the phone job and the company expected you to up sell everything with little flexibility.  It was a fun place to make friends and chat in-between calls."
good,I do not wish to further review this company and do not feel it necessary in furthering my career search
good,"- Benefits are limited. Pre- Existing will not be shouldered by the insurance"
good,Being able to work at different places gives you the edge of having an adaptability to various work sites. Working at Convergys was a very different experience for me. It was a little dull. The management was never available when needed. Convergys was a very draining place to work at.
good,"Receive payments and post amounts paid to customer accounts Arrange for debt repayment or establish repayment schedules, based on customers' financial situations, making adjustments and credit applied to accounts, offering customer plans/mobile phones and handling fraud on customer accounts"

Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,was able to grow by personal one on one with manager had group meeting to know where we could improve our quality and better ways to better help customers
good,This company is a team environment in which each one of us helps each other on a difficult customer service call. Everybody is friendly. I learned a lot on the Rogers products and services and how they will benefit the customers. I would receive over 30 incoming calls per day and would efficiently resolve each call in a professional manner. The hardest part of my job is dealing with irate customers and being able to assist them.  The most enjoyable part of my job is when a customer acknowledges and appreciates my assistance and my ability to resolve their issue. The would ask to speak to my manager and tell them on how wonderful I have been on the phone and how well I resolved their issues.
good,"Worked during the holidays for the Harry and David company helping customers order gift baskets for friends, family, or co-workers."
good,Was not given the tools to be successful because company information given to follow to resolve customer's issues was not complete and able to resolve.
good,"It is very good company to work with"

good,Took phone calls phone credit card sales and activated  the credit cards and upsold additional benefits
good,"I loved my position, just not the environment. Since August 2013, I've witnessed loud arguments and even a physical fight on the call center floor."
good,"At Minacs we were providing sales and support for PC's, finding the customer the right PC package for the right price."
good,Learned a lot about Telecommunications with this position.
good,My topical day at work in is helping clients in their credit card problems. identifying f the client is a fraud or now
good,This was a great job and it taught me a lot about providing excellent customer service.
good,"worst jobs ever, no good pay didn't even have a supervisor, didn't have reasonable breaks and the scheduled hours were over night and weren't steady"
good,"inbound call setting, making sure of giving great customer svc and making sure that every problem was resolved and the customer was happy on every call and before the customer is off the phone"
good,good job while I was at college. only worked here for 9 months
good,"The facility was a nice place to work, its just the manager that I had at the time she was unfair and wasn't good at her job"
good,great oppertunity to advance inside. easy work and they look to get ou promoted quickly
good,Convergys was ok just somethings are not acceptable. the time frames are very good you have may to pick from and the job inst that hard you just have to be very dedicated to the position
good,"I was given the opportunity to explore without restraints.  An organization driven by pioneering new technology.  A great platform of software usage.   "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,My co-workers are great. I do order modifications and customer service.
good,"Not a very good place to work. No opportunity to start a ""career"" or move up in company."
good,I enjoy helping people. I learned being on the phones require a lot of patience. I am a people person so I loved my co-workers.
good,"Convergys is a very busy work place as the phones are constantly ringing. However, there is no incentive for how hard you work due to advancement opportunities being extremely limited."
good,made a lot of good friends and was a great workplace. Wonderful team atmosphere filled with joyful employees.
good,Good company for someone with no work experience lots of incentives. The work hours are sometimes hard to accommodate.
good,"It's a decent job that pays the bills but there isn't chance to grow with the company and there is favoritism among leadership but you just have to know who to stick to. The best part: The free food, the bad: micromanaging and the constant rule changes."
good,Not much to say. This job pays the bills. Bitter sweet place to be. co-workers are great but management could be a lot better.
good,Working from home is great but the salary is poor compared to industry standard.  No annual raises given based on length with company or gained experience.  Its a good job to get a start.  Can be very stressful.
good,"Receive inbound calls from new and existing AT&T customers inquiring about products and services. Assist clients with technical issues like troubleshoot basic and visual voicemail; reset voice mail password ; can’t send and receive phone calls, SMS and MMS; Poor voice quality and frequent dropped calls; Add and remove features; Help customers understand their bill; Upgrade phones;  Make payment arrangements and schedule payments"
good,"busy on phone learned customer service skills on phone, co-workers nice and respectful,"
good,Convergys is an ok place to work for a call center that deal with technical issues.
good,"Convergys Corporation was a fast paced environment in which i learned many things about customer service, such as assisting customers with billing, programming, technical issues, moving, customer retention, and sales.  Early on the job had more sales incentive opportunities such as winning cars, trips, televisions and etc. I had a long productive experience during my employment with the company. The part i enjoyed most was helping customers who felt they disliked the company's client Directv and changing their opinion and also assisting fellow agents to become productive employees."
good,"A typical day involved me taking lots of phone calls. I learned that taking incoming calls all day wasn't for me. I didn't care for the management style. It seemed as though favoritism was the style of choice during my time there. Some of my co workers didn't like it there, others didn't do much work so maybe they did like it. The job itself wasn't hard but dealing with team leaders and supervisors when they disagree with you was a bit much. The most enjoyable part of the job was when I earned my incentive."
good,"Even though I dealt with crazy phone calls, this job was a pretty cool place to work at."
good,i enjoy the people i work with. I have been there for 2 years I am ready for a change
good,"	Communicate real time with all managers and team leaders regarding any issues on the company which may negatively impact service levels"
good,It's a great job for a person that likes to troubleshoot cellular devices.
good,"Fit for technically advanced roles"
good,it was good days and bad days no major issues came to work everyday when need to do my job
good,"Good people, good manager, fun place to work, handled inbound calls on a day to day basis."
good,"Management at Concentrix is different than just being on the phones, but you do get to work with a lot of great people!"
good,"Job was ok asa starter job if you can handle a high stress, low pay job"
good,"Great place to work and go to school. However no opportunities to advance, no benefits and pay not good."
good,I'd rather not include informatino on this as there is a non-disclosure agreement as part of our contracts
good,"speak to elderly beneficiary educating each caller on their drug formulary, patience is a virtual take the time to listen, temporary assignment"
good,"7.5 hours a day on the phone performing technical troubleshooting and providing customer service. I learned to manage 5+ programs at one time. Customers are the most enjoyable part of the job. Poor work conditions, unsanitary and no amenities at job site."
good,good workflow but the enviroment was to restricting and had an overly abondant amount of rules and regulations that would resrict you from completing your task appropriately.
good,Must get in 15 min before scheduled in order to prepare as a rule. Most callers are angry or having a simple technical problem. Most enjoyable part of the job is assisting the eldery with any technical issue. It may take twice as long and require simplified explanation but it worth it in the end.
good,good place to get job easly if you have basic knowledge about what you learn in life. Salary as per work is very less. cab facility is provided by company only. working hour spend on company will be more than 11 hrs + per day. which will make your life little stress full also in case if you having personal issue. only one day holiday you will get per week.
good,"-Graveyard shift"
good,its a job to pay the bills nothing more and nothing less they use you to make money.
good,"The customers are pretty harsh at times, but as is for all call centers."
good,"To manage a metric surpassing team took extra hours and working on materials at home."
good,"Training department is new. Training last about 4 weeks and then "
good,"1. Friendly work environment. "
good,"It is a nice company but some limitations like "
good,management is helpful and so are the co workers they are there to help you with anything that you may need help with. its an easy job and you will be able to catch on quickly!
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Take incoming calls dealing with cell phones. Learned how to troubleshoot cell phone issue, account issues, and resolve billing disputes. Management did not train, and provide adequate information. The environment their was toxic due to no one would stay longer then a couple of months."
good,"fun to work there ,meet lots of new people, management was successful setting goals and meeting them, hardest part of job was not being able to always help customers, great part of job was the setting of the work place."
good,Customer service call center with a lot of people beside you..
good,"Typically we are most of the times call after call assisting customers who call in regarding any billing questions. In the job as a customer service representative you learned multiple things. By working here I learned to be patient with everyone and put myself in their shoes. You also share a lot of experiences with the customers in all aspects. I also have learned that I can figure out a way to resolve problems by researching and looking what is the best for them and for the company. I had made a lot of new friends while working here at Convergys, some of them go and new ones come. It is a fun play to work because of the people that can make your day at work. I think the hardest part of my job is all the stress and things the superiors want the agent to do because no everyone in charge are in the same page. I enjoy working there because of the flexibility schedule with school and of course the new people you meet while working there."
good,this company does not really seem to care about its employees. you are replaceable and they will replace you if you want a raise or anything. good first job.
good,I go to work and take calls. Answer customer's queries then help them solve it. Offer resolutions and handle call professionally. Then the I get help from the Team leader and Coaches. Of course from team mates as well. The environment was fun because there were activities that would allow agents like myself to join or participate.
good,Convergys has great support when you first get there but some of the managers are difficult to deal with.  The hardest part of the job is when you are promised one thing and they do something else
good,"Convergys is a good paying job and has great benefits. You can learn a lot of good skills that can be used in different work environments. Learning new skills is the best part of working for convergys. The co-workers are also helpful, they work together and help out one another. But the most enjoyable part is not always do you have to work your full shift sometimes there is vgh. which is voluntary go home. Its an awesome place to work especially for students"
good,It's a great place to work to begin your career. The management is very micro-managed but the overall day is great. It varies from day to day and there is always new excitement.
good,Many sales commission descrepancies make this job not so good
good,"A normal day is sitting at a desk staring into space until a customer calls.  Help the customer to the best of your abilities, and afterwards repeat this process.  Be prepared to be pulled aside to hear about everything you're doing wrong, and rarely ever be recognized for what you're doing right as this is the worst part of the job.  Co-workers are very easy to get along with, and are very pleasant people.  The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to interact with interesting and easy going people."
good,Company has a very high turnover rate. Company does not pay employees for the job done.
good,the most enjoyable part of my job at convergy's was my co-workers.
good,The environment was okay at convergys. I had a set schedule averaging 80 hours a week. I really had no life working Monday thru Saturday. But the Hours were good. However I Could not find anywhere to grow within the company.
good,"work load was manageable at times, coworkers were great to work with as a team, managers were awesome team members as well, the hardest part of the job was trying to figure out what the customer wanted and didn't want. "
good,"typical day at work included logging in to all systems and phone at the same time. I did learn a lot from working on the U-verse program but it is very intense and not for someone who doesn't like to do tech support. The hardest part of the job was taking on too many responsibilities for the tech support role including some sales, placing orders, contacting techs (which we don't if you are suppose to be tier 1) and listening to rude customers who curses you out on a daily basis because there service is always out with u-verse. Even get calls right off the bat for customers who just want to speak with a supervisor because they don't what to talk to someone on your level. I most enjoyable of all is that i got to work from home. But even that was getting boring because sometimes I would just like to take the drive to the office and be around other co-workers. They do have good benefits but the pay per hour for all the work that we did in tech support is not worth it unless you are looking to make extra money. However they do work with your schedule if you are in school so I would recommend if you are a college student. Management really depends on who you get most of my managers were great people not snobby at all and was welling to go the extra mile to make you the best you can be. My managers always recommended me for other opportunities."
good,"Primary Duties:"
good,"Clear expectations given by management allowing for efficient and effective outcomes"
good,"hardest part of the job is the fast paced environment,  was an overall nice place to work"
good,"good learning experience stepping stone for further success,had opportunity to work good hours"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I learned to troubleshoot with customers over the phone. It was a full time job that had it's up's and down's.
good,"Worked with customers to activate their new service and devices, processed payments, changed service plans."
good,"Responsibilities include administrative tasks for the Team, real time support for call center agents, creating reports and presentations and taking inbound calls for technical support if needed."
good,I would have likes more trainings and better managerial interactions. Otherwise the company has good policies.
good,"Company not to organized and no growth opportunities, Co workers are nice, friendly and determined, the level of respect given is low."
good,A good brand and company to work with but too much of unncessary pressures
good,"Immediate coaches and managers are excellent, benefits are wonderful, HR is horrible to deal with, Outsourced HR be prepared to explain yourself multiple times. HR denied my maternity leave three times before explaining that the leave does not actually start until after the day I give birth and you have to call and report yourself absence everyday until they decide if you are approved or not. Great job to have if you never have to do a leave of absence."
good,"Customer Service type of work , self supervised , great team"
good,"A typical day at work involved answering hundreds of calls and emails from customers with questions and requests regarding all the departments involved in the business (Customer Care, Billing, Retention, Emergency services, Activation, etc.). The co-workers were great, always getting along, always open to criticism as well as providing it. Management, in terms of the supervisors they were great, almost on the same level as co-workers, but with the added responsibilities. The upper management on the other hand, always seemed hard to find when you needed them, and when they were around, they often seemed to be looking for ways to be getting rid of seasoned advisers."
good,"My overall experience was fine. A typical day there would consist of sitting and troublebleshooting technical issues over the phone. The most important thing I learned on the job was the inner workings of iPhones, iPod Touch, and iPads."
good,It was a fun work environment because of the people who worked and that I became friends with
good,"Work profile consists of making daily reports"
good,"A typical day at work is answering calls from patients who want medications filled, troubleshoot issues pertaining to insurance, or medications. "
good,"The working environment was nice to work in, they give you plenty of training to make sure you are able to handle what you need to do."
good,"Assisting customers to all their needs with quality care. Managers are very good at maintaining to professional company. Co-workers always on task. The hardest part of the job is getting used to the headset when you first start working, it made my ears hurt but I'm now used to that. The most enjoyable part was the pay, it paid very well."
good,"Always learning, great workplace from employees to management, great start call center"
good,need a bit more organization.. Not what its seems to be in the description.
good,I completely love my job and what I do on an everyday basis. The problem I am having is with advancement within the company and the  pay.
good,It was what I expected. The pay was average. The management teams were unorganized. My coworkers kept to themselves.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I had a great time working with Convergys for USPS service. Diverse workplace. Fun.
good,"Training"
good,"Depending on the day the call flow could be heavy or slow, you are graded by metrics which are based on Convergys math, which means they set these ridiculous numbers on top of a non mathematic grading scale so they can negate paying bonuses. But if he do meet the goal it's a 3 month delay in receiving the bonus. The TL's are nice when management is around, some are naturally great and some avoid work asking you to do more research or asking someone else to help you out, avoiding any type of work. The break room is full of bugs crawling from underneath the water dispenser and the refrigerator but they don't want people eating while at their work station"
good,needs better mgr training to show respect to their workers.start with a bit more pay and keep paying your workers for what their worth.
good,"Very calm and really easy to bonus. If the bonuses were larger it would have been a great job. As long as you don't communicate with the others around you and have a good phone voice, you could make a slightly subpar amount each month. Yet the dialers you are assigned to make a huge impact on the bonuses. Inbounds always made more due to the customers calling in usually wants to make a payment. The co-workers are very fun but can distract you easily if you let them. The hardest part of the job was the competition, which wasn't that hard. The most enjoyable part of the job is the calm atmosphere."
good,"Great Company! Contracted with GM Onstar! Full time benefits, flexible hours."
good,Power half hour is the reason I could deal with this job its very demanding.
good,Sceduling technicians for customers and m tultitasking between computer operations. While handling the customer on the phone
good,"I met a lot of cool people there, and it was a pretty easy job, but HR and management is very shady. I put in my 2 weeks notice cause I got offered a better job and they came and took me to HR and said I wasnt following a process and fired me for it, yet I hadn't even gotten the first warning....there was a holiday coming up so I felt they fired me to not get me my holiday pay, but I witnessed them fire a lady who couldnt make it in for a few days cause of a bad car accident and another cause her kid had a high fever, and i got in trouble cause i missed a day when my sick 80 yr old grandma was havin a risky procedure they do NOT care about you"
good,This job was probably was the most challenging for me since we had to take calls from customers during the analog antenna issue. We would answer calls order coupons for several people so they could receive free converter boxes. Some would call because they had issues setting up the box so I would help they step by step and made sure everything would be in order. It was a good job but short actually it was a temporary project was supposed to last a month and got shortened to 10 days. After that work was over for me some people got another job but I didn't I liked the fact that I got to meet alot of friends.
good,"Convergys is one of the best organisation in the market.Management is cool and transport is the best part of convergys,its well organised"
good,The pay at this workplace was adequate yet leadership was unorganized with little direction toward the future of the business. Working with loyal customers was enjoyable yet the lack of support was frustrating.
good,Very good training and internal support groups. Very good bonuses. Only bad when the project didn't meet sales quota
good,A typical day at work involved helping customer trouble shoot cable boxes and going over billing issues.  I learned a lot about understanding bills and issues with multiple types of cable boxes.  Management was very understanding and helpful.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers who weren't willing to listen to billing solutions.  The most enjoyable part of this job were my coworkers and the cafeteria.
good,"They don't care about your personal life and will most likely not accommodate your school schedule, if you have one. The pay was only $9/hr. Not much at all.Co-workers are nosy, selfish, and act like high-schoolers. It's a soap opera, and you are back in middle school. CSRs lied to customers left and right."
good,"1) See resume."
good,"Although the job is stressful and the people are katty, the decor was lively.  The motivation from the management was great! The space was used wisely and there are benefits from working with Onstar.  You get trained to excellence with some of the trainers.  The pay is off majority of the time though.  My check was short a lot of times and the answer I got for it not being what my other co workers that were making the same as me and with the same hours was ""no one is getting paid the same""."
good,I started off on the phones with the goal of advancing.  I soon became a trainer and team manager.  I enjoyed all my training co-workers and most of all loved creating my own training manuals an materials.
good,so many calls are going in at once one call after another. i learned a lot in the company. customer serivce. how to reinstall cable service. and how to take cable payments. managment wise was not to decent. the hardest part of it was to know every program in the system. the most enjoyable part was the good pay check.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"A typical day at work on a daily would be a little tense. Not only are you taking multiple calls back-to-back, but some customers are irate and supervisors were not so understanding or helpful. I learned how to handle irate customers and difficult situations. My co-workers were very helpful and the members on the team actually worked as a TEAM. Supervisors would leave it up to us to help each other rather than seek them for help. The hardest part was time-management as far as calls based on the type of environment but the enjoyable part was being able to meet a customer's needs and resolve their issue leaving them happy and satisfied."
good,Learn how to handle angry customers. How to find customer's needs and tie with their wants. Learn how to be patient and control the call when customer is rude or when customer talks so much. Teach others how to handle calls and training dozen of new people to get the knowledge of customer service and sales.
good,"Boring"
good,Convergys is a great company but I started when it was still up and coming in Texas and the management had no prior training or knowledge of product and services and that made it difficult.
good,"I like the fact that is was a relaxed environment, job security isn't there."
good,Very demanding job which in turn allowed for improvement in customer service skills where they may have been lacking. Received much recognition for great service rendered and how calls where handled. performance recognition gave way for more responsibilities.
good,Job required excellent communication and customer service skills
good,"Once into the office, I will ensure that the attendance register is signed by all the employees. If not, I would the request them to sign it.  I will just have a few words with them to know if things are running smoothly.  If they face any difficulties, would try to resolve the same. The management was friendly and good.  We co-workers used to work as a team and share our work.  There was nothing such as hardest part of the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was we co-workers used to help each other and finish everyone's work on time."
good,"Every phone call is different. You can get people that even if you can't resolve an issue of theirs accepts that and moves on. Others, however, will yell and cuss at you over the phone over something that you can NOT fix or help them with for whatever reason there may be."
good,"The job of dealing with the angry customers constantly was not to enjoyable. However the company seemed really well put together, employees stuck around for 2+ years and were very friendly. Management was very friendly and did their best to make the call floor enjoyable with games and activities."
good,Was first introduced to workforce management at this place of work.
good,great job if you don't have small children that you have to provide for alone and can work any given day or hour
good,Convergys is a standard call center and doesn't have much to motivate employees.
good,"long hours, management could use some training.. most enjoyable part of the job was the co-workers"
good,exceed customer satisfaction goals.Provided accurate and appropriate information in response to customer inquiries.
good,learned how to navigate through several different systems at once while handling customers request.
good,"co workers were in and out"
good,i liked the people i worked with but just had to deal with a lot of crabby customers
good,"they also available for team work training new, project new contract"
good,"Concentrix was loaded with monotonous telemarketing jobs that afforded very low pay.  There was very little opportunity for any true job growth, especially if you weren't one of the managements favorites.  There was very low employee morale with a high turnover rate.  This was due to the promises that were made but were not kept for commissions.  They would promise a particular level of commission for hard work, but then would make it almost impossible to reach that level once within that program.   Favoritism abounded throughout only to a small inside group;  Management was tightly interconnected and only allowed certain people in.  It provided me with a paycheck for about one year, but was miserable trying to get beyond the grey fog within."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"1.Started as a CSR for Credit card industry."
good,"fast paced environement, always busy and requires mulit tasking"
good,"It was a good place, everyone friendly and pay good. They ask for to much though"
good,I learned how to walk customers through fixing their issues with their DirecTv equipment. Co-workers were beyond helpful and there whenever I had a question. Management was hypocritical and chewed me out because I followed my training and took care of a problem. The job was fun but very stressful.
good,Worked at convergys for about 4 to 5 months very fast pace work place.
good,"The overall company I worked for isn't managed very well, and it was hard explaining the awful policies to customers."
good,"I received calls from customers calling in about various issues or questions they had about their devices and I did a lot of troubleshooting with people over the phone. Sometimes I had to escalate the calls to another advisor who was able to troubleshoot more complex issues with the customers, sometimes I referred them to their phone carrier, sometimes I referred them to their closest Apple store. I like being able to help the customers with their questions they have and getting their device to work again. Sometimes it was challenging because I wasn't able to see firsthand what trouble they were having. I like that I got to learn something new, learn about new products, gain some new experience and knowledge, interact with all types of people (not only on the phone, but with my co-workers and management as well)."
good,Co-workers are fine to work with but management seemed like they had no idea how to manage. The hardest part of the job was just dealing with upper management.
good,Took inbound calls from AT&T mobility customers with questions about their account and/or bill.
good,"A typical day at work would start by coming in, then to log in to my phone and my computer, opening my software and the chat to be in contact with members od my team and my team leader so that they can help me handle calls if necessary. I learnt how to troubleshoot computers and phone services, also to stay calm and try to understand why the customer on the line would be frustrated, and do all that I can do to help them."
good,This was a contract type call center.  It was difficult dealing with some of the customers over the phone.  I would much rather be able to communicate with my customers face to face.  Much more personable than a phone conversation.
good,"Good work environment, day shift job, had job security, no work pressure"
good,"Enjoyed my work and management was very good."
good,"• Managed a team of 15-25 associates and coach them regularly to meet company guidelines and goals. "
good,"Convergys has several different projects they offer for an individual to be hired on to.  Chrysler Financial was a good project to work on until the company decided to transfer the work load to India.  ATT was not a good project, most of the personnel was of the 18 - 22 year old age group and there were floor policies in place to control that type of age group.  Mercedes Benz Financial, for which I was trained on and never worked on that project is a good project to work for.  Since the economy has become worse, Convergys has not been giving raises to their employees."
good,"“Growing within Minacs has shown me a lot of opportunities, not just to grow in terms of skills, but as a person as well"
good,Very intense days of finding resolution for wireless issues and presentation to make a product sale.
good,Paid the bills for many years. Meet some great people that I call friends.
good,The best part of working for them is being able to assist my customers with there concerns. I enjoy working with my coworkers. The hardest part of my job there is being on a point system. I have a very good attendance record so if I am absent or tardy for my shift it must be an emergency and i dont feel they are understanding to those who are dedicated to their job.
good,"Some days I like it, some days I hate it. Typical day is logging into your computer and taking calls for 7hrs. Cubicles can be nasty, agents leave their trash behind. Have to share headsets. Takes at least 5 mins to log into the computer, slow system. Lots of problems with systems, mainly slow software which then cuts into your handle time. Handle time seems a bit unrealistic for me, can be done but only on a really good day. Point system is a joke, they dock you if you are a minute late. No flexibility as far as getting time off for personal reasons, PTO is available but nearly impossible to take. I have had three team leaders in the 6 months I have been there. SOP's are always changing, only know about it if you are pinged for it in your quality monitors. The food in the cafeteria is pretty nasty. Not the worst job I had, but not the best either. Currently looking for something else."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"It is an outbound call center in marketing. Surveying different customers and ask them about experiences they been having with other companies in customer service. "
good,enjoy the work but the way the company trains other reps isn't too good. also there is a lot of unprofessional things happening at work for some of the projects.
good,loved everyone I worked with I just hated dealing with stupid people that always yelled at you because their phone didn't work!
good,"This is a Callcenter job like any other, there are your ups and downs , speed of advancement is contingent on the  program and more personal feelings than job performance."
good,"Good place to work "
good,My every day task was to give the customer a great view of what the company was sold.
good,"Everyday work is challenging."
good,"Great place to work, got to meet and talk to a variety of people from all over North America (Canada/US)."
good,For a call centre it is very good.  things change a lot mostly for the worse.  the worst part of the job is not being paid to go to the bathroom.
good,"Great with customer Service, and Employees and Management."
good,"A typical day at work involved sitting in a chair, in a cubicle, in front of a computer, with a phone headset on helping AT&T Customers with there customer service needs as well as selling AT&T Products and placing customer orders."
good,"Work days went by quickly! Customers were at time, a little tough to manage, but the good customers is what made you continue to help them, as in any job. I did not like the hours or my schedule."
good,"Cordi nation Client communication"
good,My team was full of great personalities and there is a sense of passion for good work among managers and agents.
good,"Typical day was to come to work sit down at computer take calls, go on breaks. There were somedays though that it was really fun to work there. We would have little things we could win, have food brought in for us. It was way fun with that."
good,"I learned alot concering the graduated licensing system.  The people I worked with were very friendly people.  "
good,"Cashier for Churchs Chicken, made orders, and cleaned areas."
good,"I've learned a lot during my stay in this company. I've enhanced my communication skills and I easily adapt to new things (eg. environment, people, workplace). I can say that the job isn't easy as what other people (not working in a call center) think. Here, we face daily challenges from all sorts, may it be pressure from the management, the customer, personal statistics, advancement rivals, friends and family."
good,"Long hours and a tedious work process."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Just a call center. Had to deal with difficult customers which was a good challenge, but overall not a very fun job."
good,"I answered phone calls and helped customers that had problems with their phones. I learned how to use systems that I have never used before. Managment was ok. My supervisor was'nt very pleasant. Loved my co-workers. The hardest part of being a customer service rep for convergys would have to be dealing with angry customers. I could handle the calls very well but its just the fact of pleasing them at the end of the call which I did very nicely. The most enjoyable part of the job would be getting those customers that are really nice, and at the end of the call they ask you to talk to your manager to put in a good word for me because I solved all issues in a timely matter and kept them satisfied."
good,Handling an average of 300 calls per day can be very challenging as well as exciting. Mutitasking while meeting goals as well as going above and beyond for every customer!!
good,"A typical day at work involved, answering between 50-100 calls per day, talking to a variety of people, dealing with a variety of problems. These problems could range from something very simple, to very difficult. I received payments, and did a lot of the work on the computer. There was a lot of work that needed to be done with minimal supervision."
good,Worked here for only a month. Call centers wasn't my type of work. I just took it to  make money but shortly after accepting the job I received a job offer elsewhere. Seems like a great company to work for though!
good,"Ok company to work for. Not the best."
good,"taking inbound calls, sending out emails, updating systems if they went down, assisting the team lead with management duties, and coaching the agents."
good,"This was the first job that i grabbed on my own, the org has an open culture and you can walk upto your head fir any suggestion/concerns that you have wrt the work that you are involved in."
good,"Real easy going and fun to work at, days do get long and boring though."
good,"Ok place to work, constant pressure, but was able to handle the pressure."
good,"The staff and management at Convergy's were very approachable and helpful in all ways. "
good,Working here was fun at times. It was a very challenging work environment. I feel that the Team Leads did not receive sufficient training. I loved the freedom we had to make decisions on our own.
good,The pay is not very high but its not minimal wage either. Schedule not really felexible when first starting out. its hard to do if u are trying to do school too..
good,"It was ok, the people that have been there for years act as if you are doing something wrong by coming in and being new on the job.  They actually bid on schedules so they are mad if you come in and get good hours such as working first shift with weekends off....other than that it is ok."
good,Assist new hires to perform their best. Speak to customers as the supervisor to meet their needs within the guidelines set by the client for a typical first call resolution.
good,"pros:call volume"
good,"Convergys is a good place to work but you have to be the right person to do it. I like to stay busy at work; move around, clean, organize, etc. "
good,"It was a pretty boring day, I answered phones all day.  I took my two scheduled 15min breaks and my 30min lunch."
good,"I would get to work, put on my head phones and computer and their would be 100 people waiting at least all day long.I would answer a customer call and attempt to resolve the issue which I usually could or escalate it to tech support or management. Notes detailing entire call had to be written with customer on phone and as we changed technologies, each page took 6 times longer to load, frustrating the customer. Every call had a protocol and was monitored as well as your call times, hold times, bathroom breaks and even with the new slow system we had the same expectation. My co-workers where wonderful but also frustrated by our lack of resources to help the customer."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,If they hadn't fired me for a bogus reason I would probably still be there to this day.
good,Made outgoing calls to E-Bay users about specials that had been selected for them. We would call Top Sellers
good,"Convergys had good pay, good hours, and good benefits however the days dragged. It is a call center not made for the slow individual. Always on the phone call to call and little to no time in between to catch up on work from previous calls. The atmosphere was great. Management made sure we were comfortable and understood the job before placing us on the floor."
good,"Excellent place to work, great work environment. Very stable company to work with."
good,A fun place to work in and a good company but not enough pay to take care of family.
good,Convergys will train you and put you to work and allow you to work overtime often. The training is great and actually probably the strongest part of the job. Training was very technical and provided a lot of useful information. The job itself isn't that exciting as you sit in a cubicle answering phones for x amount of hours every day. However it is a paycheck and as stated you can work overtime frequently if desired. 
good,"- Great Training"
good,Answered calls for billing issues and technical phone issues for cingular / ATT wireless customers. Provided customers with technical assistance by phone for cell phone issues and also placed online orders for customer purchases. Provided customer service to Cingular customers
good,"Just like any call center it is busy through out the day, but the systems the provided helped made our job a littl easier"
good,"A great place to get call center experience. "
good,I work a 10 hour night shift. Currently I take calls from testers and engineers because our product has not launched yet.
good,I enjoyed this job a lot as I am a technical savvy person.  It was great interacting with the customers and helping them to resolve the issues they had with their service
good,I enjoyed the classroom setting which made it alot easier to learn the things that I needed to know about the company.
good,"Convergys gave me a different aspect on how to deal with agents and customers all at the same time because i took supervisor calls along with regular calls. I expanded my knowledge on how to operate a satellite box and handling all sorts of calls from billing, scheduling, ordering equipment, troubleshooting, and just answering general questions. "
good,"The hours weren't too bad. Training was pretty easy for those who paid attention. Recruiting and Corporate were kind of sketchy though, offering promises they had no intention of keeping. The pay was pretty high, even for those without work experience."
good,It is work from home but I am looking to find a full time job outside home.
good,Overall its an easy job. It just seems like they are doing everything in their power to keep employees from making their commission.
good,The experience was also good but certain business ideas and systems are not up to par good experience on what not to do most importantly.
good,Everyday there was actually great. the only issue was the pay. extremly low. i personally felt most of the owrker deserve more thn 9.00 hourly
good,"A typical day of work was to clock in and sit at a computer most of the day, and answer incoming calls. You retrieved the customers information and answered any questions regarding their cable. Once their cable was fixed, you then proceeded to sell them more cable or a different package. Then thank the customer and went to the next call."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"This is of course a review of over 3 years ago, when i was there they where very unorganized, there was times where you would wait over an hour just to sit down and start your day, with no guarantee that your chair will be there after lunch or a break."
good,This was a newly growing site. Overall it was great. Co-workers easy to work with. 
good,"Come into work sign into your computer check emails that might relate to your LOB (Line of Business). My time working there I learned that business world is fast paced and things can change in a heart-beat and technology can stop working. The management I personally worked with were great, however getting to their manager when you as the employee needed something to be signed off made it difficult to get a day off approved, vacation day etc. "
good,I enjoyed the fun in the environment and the whole atmosphere. was a great place. students can work very flexible schedules
good,"When i started almost 3 years ago, I loved going to work. I would start my shift on the phones after training, and begin taking calls. Went on schedules breaks and lunches. Try everyday to make sales goals. After a while it was hard for them to keep everyone motivated. I'm not sure if it was the lack of leadership skills, or pressure from other sources. Before i was released from the job, everyone would talk about how they were in fear for their job. No one knew when they were going to get fired, or put on a written. "
good,Long training process that was very beneficial. Learned how to interact with customers to resolve a number of technical errors. 
good,"This company represented ""On-Star"" in all GM vehicles.  This was in a call center setting addressing those people whom had an interest in retaining or upgrading their services."
good,"However, having a point system like they do is one thing I don't like. If you get sick too often and miss work too many times, there goes your job. It was nice pay, but the project wasn't even going to last and everyone I was working with has to find a new job too. As a single mom, being unemployed is very stressful not knowing when the next good paying job will happen."
good,Convergys is very understanding about it's employees and those of its customers. It's a good place to work. 
good, Love the Challenges. I have learned a lot about call center functions and have had success in pursuing multiple opportunities to grow. It is a high stress environment with constant change. I love developing people and seeing them grow. 
good,The job was a very loving job to work at. It was a typical job everyone got along. Each day we would go in and assist each other with internet repair.
good,some day it was cool but some days it wasn't I pull though I had fun with co worker's we laugh at each other the hard of the job get amount out a day but I never had no problem may I add but I enjoy the sitting down in the work was not hard at all
good,My co-workers are great and I like some of the management. My health benefits are good so I'm happy with that. But there is too much pressure in the sales environment. I was not prepared for this!
good,Everyone was secluded in a way on their own because we all had our own desks. Everyone would recieve such a high number of calls a day there was simply no time for communication amung co-workers.
good,Ideal work environment for SAP consultants.One would enjoy working in minacs.
good,If you are a hard working person you can get a lot of benefits by your hard work.
good,I talked to customers to what's going on with their credit card if they didnt like something we tried our best to help them so they will keep their credit card
good,Hectic typical work day supervise 22 customer service agent
good,"The only bad part about Convergy's is the work you have to do with just one customer. On your computer, you have to pull up at least four separate screens and type notes in all of them before you start another call. It takes too much time and management gets upset."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,This company was very unorganized and they had a very high turn over rate.
good,"average 8 hour shift, forty hour work week, worked as a sales representative and customer support for AT&T. Learned more about customer support and sales over the phone."
good,Taking back to back calls for 8hrs straight.
good,It was a different experience then wjat i was used too. I enjoyed my co workers and enjoyed helping customers with any questions or issues that they called in about
good,"good to work, but no time for personal life and no rowth in professional life. should not excpect more in appraisals, responsibilities may increase but nothing confirmed on paper."
good,I enjoyed working there. The people were friendly and helpful. I also like the pay at the time.
good,-Diverse working environment
good,"A typical day at work can be very fast-paced, or slow depending on call flow. the hardest part of the job is keeping up with selling quotas."
good,Process orders for Sprint Cellular phone Company and sell features for the device.
good,A typical day at work was fast paced. The hardest part of work wasdealing with irrate customer and the pay could have been better.
good,"answered phone,data entry, sold company products, scheduled installations, and handled complaints."
good,"A typical day at work involved sitting for the majority of your shift, with a 15 minute break every 2 hours. Friendly co workers and good management which made sure customer service targets/stats were reached. Goal oriented job."
good,I did not feel the company found in value in their employees.
good,Decent time off. Large facility with multiple vendors who bring in breakfast/lunch .Several upgraded quality vending machines. Laying people off at random. Typical no recognition for hard work type environment. Promotion from within more may inspire staff to work towards a goal.
good,Convergys provided adequate resources for employees use in enriching their employees personnal and managerial capability.
good,I learned alot at convergys. I learned about putting your fellow co workers and team in general before your needs. I learned team work and I learned stability. Management is meager at best. Request must be made over and over. Follow ups with management must be made to get anything done. The management team will make a promise but only follow through half of the time. The hardest part of my job is dealing with angry customers and indifferent co workers that do not take pride in their work. It is also dealing with management that likes to criticize but seldomly thanks or appreciates your effort. It is also expected for you to do your job without the necessary resources and/or tools. The most enjoyable part of a job is the prizes and incentives they give out. There is raffles for overtime. I like having overtime and working with co workers who have same work ethics.
good,"Configure Cisco 2600s, 2800s, 3800s, and 7200s"
good,"There were several weeks of training with good hours. The hours given once out on the work floor were nice as well. You do pick up on a few things, in reference to the products they offer."
good,It's a quiet job with friendly co-workers and supervisors creating a productive and positive attitude to help customers completing capital one credit card application even when they are frustrated. The different rewarding programs organised produce implication and hard work.
good,"I've appreciated the time and relationships that I have made wt this location. However, it doesn't seem to have any real continuity. Things change on a daily, sometimes hourly basis."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Typical day would be fixing errors and dealing with
good,Not a bad place to work if you don't mind sitting for long hours listening to complaints.
good,"A typical work day for me at Convergys was, I answered the phones and tried my best to resolve any issues the customers may have had with their insurance coverage."
good,great learning experience flexible hours but the company shut down due to bank rupcy
good,A typical day would be sitting in a cubicle answering calls.
good,Customer service for Sprint
good,"Get on the phones, take phone calls, assist customers, learn how to be patient with irate customers, sympathize with customer's misfortunes. Manager was reasonable and co-workers were fun."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of servicing client with banking needs from a-z. I use several computer systems throughout the day. Most of my day is spent on the phone. I have learned a great deal about Banking in general. I also service loans and lines of credit. The management at Convergys truly needs improvement. Most of the staff lacks professionalism and sometimes are not able to assist the agents when they need a hand, whether it be due to lack of knowledge, or un- willingness. Most of my co-workers are fun and easy to get along with. Most of them are not able to do their job correctly due to mass- hiring, without complete training. There really aren't any ""hard"" tasks at my work place. The best thing about my experience at Convergys is that I have truly everything there is to know about banking, and some. I get to help people and that makes me the happiest."
good,WAH is great but the pay isn't great and it is very overwhelming - especially early on.
good,Learning and growing is what this company wants from each employee!
good,"Worked in 4 different calls centers with 4 different product markets... technical support, internet support, workforce support, cable company customer service. Of the four, my most favorite was technical support."
good,"Assisted excellent services and explained the customer’s issues. Answered incoming calls for service requests in a timely, professional and courteous manner and ensured that customers were satisfied with their account."
good,"High volume Call center. could take up to 100+ calls a day. team work. payment taking, problem solving and transferring"
good,Good to work at Aditya Birla Minacs. Good support and encouragement from Manager and Team Leaders. Fun activities once in month to relieve stress.
good,"A typical day at convergys would include handling inbound and outbound calls.Working at my position has taught me how to master different things and how to multitask. You never know where they will need you and plug you in.Management is alright,sometimes you have to pester to get things done. The hardest part of the job is easily having to take back to back calls all day sometimes. The most enjoyable part is sometimes they allow people to go home early"
good,"Convergys provides Customer Care, Billing and Techinical Support for ATT wireless customers. A typical day is very fast paced, solving customers issues Fast, Friendly, Smart! My people skills have become even better. Co-workers are very friendly and helpful as is Management. The hardest part of the job is dealing with angry customers when their service is not working. Also, the work scheduling is erratic. The best part of the job is is the gratitude I receive from a customer when I have been able solve their issue."
good,I Used to enjoy the work everyday.People were friendly and helped each other when problems.The enjoyable part was there used to be team outing every week which lead to good understanding of each other who worked.
good,"Good team of employees. Good management, Good pay. I enjoyed helping out others and the atmosphere was very welcoming and pleasant"
good,"everyday was the same,"
good,The job was actually fun and the pay was decent. I got to meet a lot of different people and develop my communication skills.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,ok job slow and easy very helpful place although to much policys and what to do and very hard to follow up with
good,This job provides individuals with experiance of the working enviorment.
good,"At anytime you have a team of 18 to 25 agents. You are responsible for all coaching, monitoring and disciplinary action as required of these agents. You have scheduled coaching times for these agents during this time you coaching the agent on behaviors that impact performance. Outside of coaching your team you are responsible for a client feedback, any customer call back requests and credit requests. You are required to attend weekly calibrations and weekly meeting with all management staff."
good,Selling AT&T products and services via incoming calls to potential customers.
good,Good company to work for
good,Work atmosphere is good. Management is friendly and very helpful.
good,"I took inbound calls from customers doing everything from, starting a new account, changing programming, bill payment, to technical support. I learned how to difuse upset customers by explaining things in a way they could make better sense of the issues they had. Managment was always availble to help with difficult issues I couldn't resolve on my own. The hardest part of the job was sometimes not being able to help a customer resolve an issue and them wanting to close the account. The most rewarding part of the job was fixing someone's technical problem successfuly. They were always very greatful for the help I provided."
good,Pay rate is low and commission changes month makes the income very unstable. The work is comparable to all call centers and management isn't the same throughout the building. Concentrix is growing and will be a great place to work soon. Fun place for beginners and not set up for the serious employee.
good,this job was just not for me i really really hate talking on the phone especially to people that already dont like your company but it paid the bills
good,"My days at work where very fast paced, and i loved it. I loved talking to the customers from all over the world."
good,Typical day was on the phone making sure customers was happy.
good,A typical day for me includes monitoring live calls and recorded calls and evaluating them. I reinforce good behaviors through various methods of mentoring. I identify the agents needs and problem areas to provide feedback to team members. The most enjoyable part of my job is seeing someone grow and progress. The most difficult thing can be the constant fast pace atmosphere. I learned a lot about myself and that my best work is delivered under pressure.
good,"Worked with customers all day, had breaks only for 15 and 30 minutes for lunch. Poor help with needs and schedule work out."
good,"Experienced 3 reorganizations and an acquisition in just 1 1/2 years there. Despite lots of chages, I was able to accomplish my goals and the company performed well with dispersed teams all over the globe."
good,typical call center work environment. low pay. average benefits.
good,The company is on a contract basis with an American health insurance company. When working there the standards are very high and there is a lot of testing and up training.
good,Typical day at Convergys consisted of either answering the phones and going over Medicare claims and benefits with medical providers or assisting other CSR agents via the Chat Support team...
good,Love the contest and the competitive nature of the employees and managers
good,Answer phones assist customers with managing billing accounts while provinding quality service
good,i like this job bacause u work atyour own past andu geyt to talk to all kinds of people and u also getto learn new things everyday at work
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I would come in everyday and look for a seat and log on to my computer and all the systems used throughout the day. The hardest part of the job was meeting quotas and that for me was still not very difficult. I was a top sales agent on the Home Depot account. Co-workers and management were friendly, of course we all have our days. I learned how to take rejection way better and not to take things personally."
good,"Overall, working at convergys was a great experience. It helped develope my oral communication skills and i enjoyed assisting customers to the best of my abilities."
good,"Good job for a college student. It was years ago that I worked there, but at the time head sets & mouth pieces were shared amongst various workers."
good,The work is always challenging and thankfully all my coworkers are more than happy to help. Management could be a great asset if they learned to be more proactive and communicative with the client and allowed their employees to be as well.
good,I only work here for a short period of time til i move out the state but is as great place to work
good,Helped customers with internet problems for charter communication. All inbound calls. worked late nights
good,Minacs is great company to work for but the job can be very demanding and consuming depending on what branch you work for. I personally work for Netflix it is very time consuming and schedules vary because that branch is 24 hours.
good,"If you like sales environment then this is the job for you, but they push sales more then life itself. Customer service expect gets lost to some of the employees because your job depends on sales."
good,"Working at Convergys I took different types of calls. I would assist customers with a variety of things from programming, bill, troubleshooting equipment, ordering equipment, moving, and customer retention. I learned many things such as listening to customers concerns and being able to assist them to the best of my ability. Management was ok, not always available to assist us. The co-workers were great, always happy to assist with any questions. The hardest part of the job was learning how to assist the customers with out going over the guidelines given to us. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to save the customers."
good,"Activated accounts, add/changed programming, ordered equipment, explained and reviewed customer billing, processed payment. De-escalated customer complaints by providing excellent customer service. Attended regular training classes to advance and become aware of constant changes with service provided to the customer."
good,A very hectic and busy call center envrionment. With excellent management. A good place for those who are just starting out to gain experience with corporate America.
good,"This is a great company to work for. They offer medical, dental, and life insurance. They do pay the less than other companys in the area however."
good,"Because it is a seasonal call center, there is never the confidence that you will continue to work."
good,This job was ok to work for but they had there up and down with any company we had good time and fun and we all wroked well with each other
good,Its a very productive place however it also did have a somewhat high turnover rate. they also have overtime which is good
good,Holding interviews talking to the residents of Utah getting information to confirm the 2010. I learned more about what the census was. The management didn’t prevent me from providing the best I can for each resident in Utah. Hardest part was not being able to find a seat at times to start my job. Most enjoyable part of each work day I knew that I was providing 100% in each day I came to work.
good,Highly competitive work environment with little opportunity for growth.
good,"I would login in to my systems for my clients. Ability to clock in five minutes early and start at nine o'clock. Had an eight hour shifts. Listen twice and speak once to address all concerns and all sales were documented. I learned how to adjust clients packages to bundle by adding additional services(internet,tv,homephone,and wireless). Learned better negotiation tactics. I had the best co-workers ever we were lke one big family. The hardest part of the job would be getting assistance from supervisors. The most enjoyable part of my job was having my clients happy at the end of the call regardless the situation."
good,Convergys was ok to work for just wasnt alotof room for advancement.
good,This was a job I obtained in high school for job experience for VICA in school.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"It was very relax and laid back work environment. One thing that may fall negatively about working there, it felt all to repititious day in day out."
good,typical day at work is very busy
good,Constant call flow
good,"Other then it closing it was a good place to work, you delt with technitions on site compliting orders or starting new ones"
good,"3rd party call center, high turnover rate but different projects to work on."
good,This employer has enhanced many of the soft and hard skills needed for me to excel within my career. I enjoy helping customers and the people I work with.
good,"This job was the most tedious position. The concepts into what was required to learn in a short time was amazing. However, they do make sure you know the information prior to putting you to work"
good,Convergy's offers great training however when it comes to having support while on a call there is none.
good,"I got to work, and checked all of my e-mails from the night prior, to see if anything had come in from the Hiring Managers. I had to make sure that all of my 4 hour contact calls were done to the hiring managers that I was going to be working with. I would then have to make sure that all of my work was delegated for that day, to make sure that I had enough time to complete everything. My co-workers were the greatest people that I had ever worked with, because we got each other. If someone was out, and needed help getting their work done from the previous day, then I would always be the one to help out.The most enjoyable part of my job, was when I would get the e-mails from the hiring managers about filling the positions that they had advertised. That meant that it was taken out of my work load as well as off of the applicant website."
good,I felt like I imposed on the customers I was supoose to be providing assistance to. In this economy saving money is essential therefore pushing uneccessary electronics on patrons didn't make me feel like I was doing my job which is meeting their needs.
good,Work from home is the best option working in the brick and motar is not fun. Time consuming and costly. For the same amount of money just working from home.
good,•Assist and educate customers on the use of the website
good,Convergys is an excellent company when it comes to contact service opportunities. It does not have the mentality of a software sale company. It is most oriented to outsource of contact center solutions.
good,I didnt like convergys but their pay was okay alot of drama at the workplace
good,"Convergys was a fun place to work the only problem I had was I never Got paid on time, took 2 months for me to get my first payment. even when giving them the correct address I never Got paid on time I tried to do direct deposit and for some reason there system would not take my information, I was at a lost ended up loosing my home because of late payments and I still had to be at work on time so I would not get fired, I moved in a hotel stayed there for 4 months and payed 800 a month to stay there when where I lived I payed 400 a month. then one day I came to work and I could not log in cause my information was removed I was never told that I was fired or that I was going to be fired they sent me away with no pay or explanation other than to keep calling in to see if the situation was fixed. wile still not getting paid what was I to do other than leave I been through it all with Convergys and they expected to much, how could I be happy at a Job that made my life a living .... and left me homeless."
good,"Employees are easily replaceable there for not very important. It is hard to move up in the company or get a raise. When you get to a certain wage they start looking for reasons to fire you. Benefits as far as health insurance are one of the best out there, however after 16 years of service for this company I only had just over $5000 in my retirement plan. A typical day at work was log in, take your calls, go home. I did enjoy assisting in supervisor duties when needed and assisting in training classes. Most management seen you as a number not a person. The hardest part of the job was working hard without hope of reward (raises, bonus etc...)."
good,The bonuses are very attractive for this job. Convergys however is no longer in business in this area.
good,"Convergys has a few of what they call ACCOUNTS. I worked for the AT&T account and I learned a lot of things from this line of work.... basically it's just helping customers with their accounts, helping them understand their bills, upgrading or downgrading.... among other things... The hardest part of the job is listening to customers complain like if it was your fault that they went over their minutes... i think i learned new curse words while I worked there... Another thing is that they record every call and most of the thing you have to say them verbatim, which means that if you don't say things exactly as they are in ""the hand book"" they will take points out and if you score too low you will get a warning and eventually get fired.... But since I'm smart it didn't take me long to memorize most of the things, but then I felt like a robot"
good,Great place to work in. Team buidling techniques used. Training provided to go to next level. Distant education option given(Management)
good,Provide Excellent Customer Service to Members.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I liked troubleshooting for customers and fixing their problems. I did not like the transit to this job.
good,"In an 8 hour shift, you get 2, 15 minute breaks and 30 minutes lunch."
good,"A nice place to work for, was not for me. It is a call center and I am not good at call center work."
good,I would answer incoming calls
good,"I enjoyed resolving customers issues, but the hardest part was dealig with the customers when they became irate"
good,"Sorry, Confidentiality agreement with Minacs."
good,"Helping people on an everyday basis, solving peoples issues, offering alternatives if problem can't be resolved, co-workers were very helpful, management very helpful, pay could have been better."
good,The work was challenging doing outsourcing. I learned a lot about smart phones and technology.
good,"It was ok. It was very stressful. They always disciplined employees for having too long of a call time, but they have to consider, it takes time to wait on customers to get a one call resolution."
good,Good job but got repetitive and boring after doing the same script over and over again.
good,The company started off ok howerver once i found out that we werent getting any raises or performance bonus things changed. The tell you what you want to hear and never stay true to there word
good,A typical day was listening to my agents calls and reviewing them with the agent. Daily coaching.
good,helped at&t solve issues with there cell phones and took payments for the bills
good,"I learned how to use voip, amongst many other items. I also learned how to manage customers accounts, receive payments and troubleshoot equipment all from home."
good,Good call center. Paid very low. Training pprovided. Good entry level job.
good,I work at a att call center assisting customer with there wireless service.
good,it's like working in grade school. The upper managment quotes the rules but do not read or follow them. For a call center the people running the place don't know how to do what the agents do but are supposed to tell agents how to do there job. The upper managment needs to get a clue and get in the trenches once and a while exp when they come to reps to ask questions on how to help the customers they don't want you to sound like a robot but that is what they expect
good,co-workers was the best part part of this job & the very different customers I spoke to & helped...
good,"Convergys took 2 things I am good at, and used them simutaneously. My love for the interaction with the public with cellular technology. I have mastered the world of cellular service; using it with customer service. I have learned to seek the customers needs and wants and targeted what I can provide them, while gaining in the process."
good,I enjoy completing required tasks. The hardest part of the job is dealing with the difficult customers. The most enjoyable aspect of the job is the level of comfort and relationships with other coworkers.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,It was very fun working here. I received a promotion within 6 months of working there. The only bad thing I have to say is the projects may not renew their contract leaving you to look for another job or they will force you to some other project with completely different vibes then what you were used to
good,Good for customer service and call center experience. Be prepared for lots of constant changes. The job isn't hard but can often at times feel like a dead end. Lots of favoritism as well.
good,Good overall for anyone whos looking for good work with nice hours. Cares about family and employees
good,Not a bad place for a second job if you want to make extra money.
good,This job was one of the only jobs I've had that once you have finished training for the job the opportunity to advance was immediate. Team leads (supervisors) were amazing.
good,There are so many opprotunities to pick up extra hours and earn bonuses.
good,Convergys was overall productive and fun workplace slightly unprofessional
good,This is company is great. I liked the common areas they had. There were a lot of perks.
good,"Worked with customers to meet there needs for there cell phone plans, bills and other phone needs. Technical support and ordering equipment."
good,The company is good about promoting their employees from within.
good,"Convergys is an OK company to work for. It is more of a ""start-up"" job than anything. Good way to get your foot in the door as far as call-center experience."
good,"I worked for the Capitol One account and it was great. Then was moved to ATT and it was the worst. Everything was constantly changed. Dirty headsets, sit at any desk, and gradually they decided to get rid of everyone who worked the way we were trained..since they decided to do everything a new way...worse for the customers. After 4 years I was laid off with hundreds. Got many accolades."
good,Convergys was a great place to work I gained alot of experience working there. They offered flexible hours and even excercise equipment at a low cost to promote a healthy work environment.
good,"I worked at Convergys, which was the company that would be bought by Concentrix?"
good,Pays fair and has good incentive procedure..good for people who can travel on their own. Have weekly rewards which might differ process wise however. Incentives are good.
good,Découvrir Belfast au travers de la possibilité de travailler et vivre grâce à l'implication de cette entreprise à faire découvrir cette région est une chance à ne pas laisser passer.
good,"They are willing to work with your personal schedule as long as it doesn't conflict with their main objectives in general. "
good,"Other sites don't have the same amenities with the others, you'll be lucky if your site has complete facilities such as big sleeping quarters, huge pantry and clean comfort room"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Very well in trianing people. If you are a newbie this company should be your stepping stone. Always learn and develop through your talents and skills and also stepping up your own career growth and needs hard work to be in the management, if you wish you are aiming for supervisory."
good,I enjoyed working with General Motors. It’s just a matter that sometimes even though you have everything for work they can’t recognize you fairly. The management wants to elevate you because you are qualified however you need to wait for at least 6 months to 1 year to have salary increase.
good,"It was nice working in concentrix. The stress level at work is not that much if you efficiently and timely complete your work."
good,"This company really paying good for the salary, this company is really a good and stable company, however, i would like to shout out to the management not really the company to give more time and space to the agents i can feel that there's a lot of agent are really stress out because of the management, Just be more friendly to the agents. Yeah account is really toxic but let the agents feel they are happy and excited to go to work every single day. Number is normal for the management to look for the agents but let them feel that they are special and friends to the management."
good,Didn’t like she shift that was offered to me but I would’ve stuck it out. Had internet issues was the only reason I left. Nice to be at home and the equipment they gave us was perfect.
good,"The work environment was fast paced and lively. Turnover rate was high. Plenty of literature was available in the online database to help with job performance. The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customer however, that's also the part that was most fulfilling."
good,"If you are strong enough to withstand the demand of the office life, and still be able to give fair outcomes to the clients or the customers, then, Concentrix is the best choice for you."
good,"Empresa em constante mudança entre as estruturas, mas estavel, os funcionarios são bem colocados."
good,It was fun for the most part. I learned 2 different companies while working there. If the contract ends you have to apply for a new job within the company
good,"You have to work so hard but earn nothing in Convergys... Salary was less pressure was higher than sky! No good incentives... But you have to work overtime alot sometimes even on weekoffs! Your hardwork is of no use if you don't meet your targets! And that spoils everybody's moods and you will lose the interest to work cause once you can't meet your targets even after worrking so hard spending atleast 13/14 hrs in the office, you could harldy earn just a lil bit above your in hand salary.... Its such a relief that I left this company otherwise I would have had a lot of problems"
good,"The organization was good, Unfortunately, i have to look for a better position for my personal and professional growth. "
good,"During my time with this company, I was expected to make a certain amount of outbound calls to customers, and maintain a certain level of service that with various customers was not easy to achieve but still made the effort to reach those goals."
good,"Overall the company is good when it comes to co-workers and management, but it's a very stressful line of work and not for everybody. Good starting wage ($14.75/hr), with ability for pay increases yearly, depending on job performance."
good,"It varies with the group you are on, some are customer service and some are customer service with sales.  some of the sales come wiht no incentives other than if you do not get the sale you can lose your job, but no bonus or commission from sale"
good,Management was good had to deal with a lot of rude people. Classes were easy to learn but you need a longer time frame to to make sure you have a handle of the job
good,"Great benefits and fellow workers,  had great experiences and was mostly treated fairly until was only Att projects.  Then supervisor was not around to assistant when needed"
good,"It's ok, but ~30 miles from my domicile. Realized Medicare telesales was not my forte. Training was adequate. Did not like the commute so found a temporary job closer to home."
good,It was nice in the start big office big people nice job but it cause mis happening your life when you have to leave at 3 pm for your job and come home at 3 am it’s just good money which comes with it.
good,The job can be stressful at times just because you are dealing with several personalities throughout the day.  There are multiple systems to learn but you can get the hang of it if you just give yourself time to learn  them.  The support from other staff truly helps and makes the job bearable.
good,"This job was just like being back at college, it was very laid back as we was on web chat so we could still chat to the person beside us, the job got challenging when things didnt reboot but there was always help"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Good company management was not that good. Disputes are never taken care of. Unable to reached out agents who needs help. But co-agents are good. But Overtime is a must with no lunch and that's not a good idea.
good,The culture was one that was inclusive and diverse.  I learned a lot about full cycle recruiting.  I can say that I gained skills that I feel will carry me far in my career.
good,"Good place to work but working hours is 9 and half hours shift is so long and sometimes you don't get break on time."
good,"The job is  good, you gotta learn how to be patient with the customer. Yes they will give you attitude but it's just part of it. You just help them out as best as you can."
good,"As we had international shifts so we were mostly given the night and graveyard shift and minimum to no day shift and every month the shift is rotationaL with rotational offs."
good,"Very inconsistent management when it was Convergys. Not much to complain about other than the employees come from all walks of life, which could be a good and bad thing. Very unprofessional managers, the pay is alright but most call centers usually pay more in that area. The benefits kept me there for three years and then they gave us two months to find new jobs. Concentrix is now the new management company, hopefully they do a better job with management training on professionalism."
good,Productive and easy jobs if you can sit for 8 hours. Have alot of incentives for doing good free life insurance. Like1 I said good job alif your willing to sit for 8 hours
good,I took my job serious I was always on time never liked to miss days I like the    incentives they had I worked with a good group of peoples we had the best supervisor you could ask for but overall i would recommend someone.
good,"As a representative in a BPO industry is indeed full of toxicity because of the high volume of calls that we are receiving and that is already given. Apparently, even though we are being trained to have another skill, the amount of our salary has never increased. The workplace is fine but not the company itself"
good,"I thoroughly enjoy the actual work that I did at Concentrix. I really like helping people the only problem was you were on a time limit and it kind of held you back from actually giving them good help and good customer service. A lot of the people there that were supposed to help you were petty and refused to do it. I also became very sick, they were constantly moving us around to different computers and you couldn't take your headset with you."
good,I can honestly say this job has helped me through school and has showed me how to become an outstanding customer services representative. It also has wonderful health coverage for their workers as well as their family members.
good,"An adaptable place for every individual who wants to gain more knowledge regarding Customer Service. Good management, easily to work with, but sometimes has strict management."
good,"works with the public"
good,It was not a horrible company to work for. They had there ups and downs but so does every company they did there best to accommodate everyone. Concentrix was a good company is more like the 3rd party call centers that were the hard thing to work for.
good,"I worked with Concentrix(Convergys) for three months at the end of 2016.  The job was not a rewarding job.  They did offer free DirecTV, but the headache was not worth it.  Racism was rampant as well as favoritism.  I came from that with my job I had before that."
good,The  the company was stellar in my eyes until on the 91st day of my employment they decided that they're going to cancel the contract that I'm on and give me separation date of June 30th 2019. it is a good company but it is your transition from convergys to concentrix which has sort of upset the apple cart. All in all a great company to work for if you have a contract that is stable.
good,could wear what you were comfortable in  had a ugly sweater day in Christmas.  also had bbq lunches could not do they job per there training they did not tell this was also a sales position
good,There are some great people that work for the company and the TMs are great when you are in a time of need. It was a great opportunity but the time for advancement took too long
good,"Calls come through back to back, sometimes might not get a breathe to take, schedule changes every day as it is never the same each week. Breaks given but when logging out everyone uses the same computer to log out"
good,good place to work. Management is fantastic. the benefits are good if you can stick around long enough. over all was fun and i enjoyed my time working there.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,Working with them is the best especially the managers thay makes you feel better and the TL. VERY helpful sometimes the helper aren't that good.. Thay have a good benefit
good,"This company provide us how to be a good agent and answering some calls and provide us how to deal with the customer in with the phone in a time a frame. on how you handle work under pressure scpecially to the customer with attitude or irrate  because they experience some errors with the product,. we provide them a good communication skills that they understand what they need to understand and provide them a resolution on that problem."
good,The best part is the workmates. I had fun and I enjoyed working with my wavemates. The pay was premium for a provincial rate. The account was okay as well as the management.
good,"Covergys Directv was a typical call center job, where you are rewarded handsomely if you are willing to put in the work. Most enjoyable part of the job was free tv services."
good,"Supervisors are always accommodating, friendly and understandable. Best and enjoyable part was meeting colleagues to whom you can call friends and count on. What I have learned so far would be not giving up until the end."
good,"Not the best place, as sitting on the phones isn't really my thing. However, again, it was a job and as a younger person it is defiantly a good starting-job. Defiantly not a permanent position due to wages being so low."
good,I liked working the program I was on. The company we were working for pulled out and I was training on the new program. I was a hectic turn around for the company.
good,"Management were not sympathetic to my health condition, and despite medical documentation did not take me seriously. This was a theme across the company."
good,"This is a high stress environment job, if you don't eventually catch on after 3 or 5 months you might as well forget about. I will say this though. I did enjoy the perks they offered from time to time."
good,"A typical day for me was answering questions for DirecTV customer, helping with billing and sales of programming. I learned a lot about customer service and billing. Management was fair and kept up with coaching and reviews on a regular basis. The hardest part of the job was angry customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers and reaching a good outcome with the calls."
good,The people I worked with were very nice and the work itself usually wasn't bad but there wasn't anything to do when you weren't answering the phone and I felt like I was wasting my time.
good,A typical day at work would be answering the phones and meeting all customer needs. I've learned people skills while working at Concentrix. It's very easy too move up at this company due too great academics.
good,"As a call center agent, you are expected to go at work on time, avoid malingering, over breaks, and follow all the policies of the Company otherwise you'll be issued a disciplinary action. "
good,The job itself is fast paced and interesting. Management leaves a lot to be desired.  The atmosphere is sort of cliquish pretty much not what you do but who you know. The pay isn't great.
good,pending closure in Welland location.  Sad that so many people will be without work now.  Did customer care with a focus on sales for a Fortune 500 American Company
good,"Typical day is highly repetitive, you transfer members to correct departments, enroll their prescriptions, and answer any questions you can. You'll be faced with many complaints and will constantly learn something new on the job."
good,the jobs is manageable but the transportation is a huge burden for me for it's always traffic every time i go to work. it exhaust me just by going to work.
good,What I learned from this job is you have to stay calm and positive on calls. Never let an customer get to you 'cause at the end of the day you're there to make a living.
good,"Typical call center environment. Promotions are almost always internal and the turnover rate is high. Pay is lower than other area call centers and not generally in line with the amount of information you need to learn to support their clients. LGBTQ friendly. "
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,My opinion about the concentrix is good but not best.that is good company but growth of employees are very poor.and working environment of company is Little bit lazy.
good,low salary but managers very friendly and helpful very professional business really good organization great shifts and good multicultural interchange.
good,"Pelo que vi na Concentrix a maioria do pessoal é porreiro e promovem um ambiente multicultural sem discriminação. Existem tambem algumas dinamicas periodicas nas quais fazem ""ofertas de mimos"" aos funcionários subcontratados como parte de uma politica de incentivos o que é interessante mas não é constante nem suficiente para garantir satisfação com uma profissão é reconhecida como trabalho exigente e desgastante. "
good,"The culture is good. Managment needs some improvement in terms of communication but compared to other jobs in the area, it's better than most. Pay is good, lot of employee engagement activities, respectful, ton of growth opportunities. This place is good for people who like to interact with others, take part in various activities and can handle stress. Management does their best in their scope to ensure employees are valued."
good,"When I worked at Convergys, the program I was on was for Internet support for AT&T customers. It was I first heard a customer smile on the phone, it is an incredible feeling. It was a fun job."
good,"Well it was a temporary job for 3 months , i would go  to my computer and put my head phones on and turn on the computer get everything in order to start my day then i would   say hi to the people close to my area of work, would answer phones calls,  i would have to read a script to sell phone services in the USA. I was a  call agent. The people most of them were nice  my coworkers the customers not so much so it was kinda of stressful. You know most people don't want to buy a service all the time."
good,"It's not all about the job and the salary but it's also about your team. Although it's stressful. You will gain a lot of knowledge both in interacting with the customers and developing skill in multi tasking as well as technical support."
good,it was a fun pl;ace to work i think its a a good job after you live high school and it it a good place to get customer services experience and you will learn a lot about sales
good,"Log in at 08:00 having unstoppable phone calls for 8 hours straight. 30 minutes Lunch time and two 15 mins length breaks (unpaid). Convergys gave me the opportunity to become better in customer service and handle very stressful situations by myself. I learned to show empathy , avoid conflicts at all costs, sharing information with my colleagues and ways to provide better customer experience. I was assisting also in financial management of properties, suggested ways to increase sells and escalation of cases to other departments when the subject didn't concern us. Hardest part of the job was that we had insufficient training due to Booking.com request to finish the training earlier, and we had to learn the software by ourselves while we were unexperienced on the working floor. The best part of the job was the love I received from the customers and my colleagues. Could not ever imagine that I could meet so many friends in such a little time."
good,"By no means a dream job. But prepared me enough to advance my career. It was a great location, the culture and people I worked with definitely made the job."
good,Concentrix is a joke! They steal hours from you and you go through high waters trying to get paid for them. They charge it to your hours for their equipment malfunctions and things beyond your control like an electric outage. They're not fair at all.
good,Working at Convergys was a good experience if you really did the work but i became a stressful job over time with them no working with people to make sure everything was done and no work piled up
good,"The compensation is good but it's not easy to have any sort of work life balance. If you need work off for a medical appointment, it's almost impossible to get off. When employees all express dissatisfaction, I will give the company props for trying to change the policy, but they really just make an even worse policy. Also, it's almost impossible to get things done. If you need help from management, you might hear back within a few days or you might just get ignored. There are certain things you need manager approval for and sometimes you just can't find anyone. Management is almost always nice and their intentions are good, they just expect too much from them and I don't think most of them are properly equipped to be able to support us and do all their own things."
good,"My experience with Convergys was they gave me the job easily, without making me wait long to hear back from them. The classroom training was lousy; a waste of time for the client, and taught us absolutely nothing about the job or the company. It was like preschool. After playtime was over, the hands-on training was good. The job itself was enjoyable. The pay was fair. The health insurance was ridiculously expensive, and not beneficial. The overtime opportunities were great, and were not mandatory. The company assigned members of our US based location to train workers in a Philippines location, and as soon as those workers returned to the US, our entire location received lay-off notices."
good,"Has free online and classroom training for the employees. Events are held every year for the employees and their families, perks are given, as well as medical benefits."
good,I would say that a typical day is calling customers trying to get them rescheduled and doing this all day repeatedly it gets old and boring; with out many option to do different things; Because of third party stipulations; Such a high school atmosphere with a lot of drama; Management some are fair and other are inconsiderate; rarely cares about employees
good,The agency seemed to constantly have an increasing turn over rate; rarely did I see employees stay on past a couple of months. Work staff appeared to be friendly.
good,"This was a great job for me while I was in college and paid well as well as worked with my schedule and gave me a lot of hours, however upper management has issues and treated employees poorly."
good,The pay is pretty decent but thou have to hope and pray you get paid the correct amount of hours at the correct rate or if you get paid at all. Good luck!!!
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Its like high school through out the entire building. So many people are unprofessional and nasty.  Drama drama drama! If you keep your head down and focus on your work, you will not get sucked into the whirlwind of high school drama. And they are not good at communicating or relaying important information."
good,"Call Centers do not have the best reputation for being good work places however this was a great start for me. The Managers have a good relationship with their team members and offer a ton of room for error, they make sure you are comfortable and make the place feel kind of like home. I would have stayed if they had continuous raises and had better benefits however that was not the case, I recommend this job to anyone who likes Tech and likes to be surrounded by others who like Tech as well."
good,"IT Tech Support, with computer software, and interacting with clients to correct their hardware and software problems. Via different states and cities making customer happy with good tech support."
good,Good place to learn basics of Pharmacy products and prescription ordering and tracking. Multiple projects going on at any one time. They have a fairly liberal attendance policy.
good,Outbound call team was in a relaxed family atmosphere. Worked hard but wasn't stressful. No room for advancement unless you try to become a manager. Flexible and management is understanding of family commitments.
good,The most enjoyable part of Convergys was being able to help people resolve the issues that they were having and making sure at the end of my calls that they were satisfied with the service they were provided.
good,Convergys was an ok place to work for. I enjoyed working with my co-workers but too many constant changes in what was required made it difficult to succeed.
good,A typical day at work was pretty easy I have learned the most patience working for Convergys. Management was okay but not understanding of peoples life's. The hardest part of the job was dealing with angry customers but Convergys taught me to have patience. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to talk to people from across the world.
good,"It was a good place to work for a long time, but of course things were always changing and you had to do more than just your daily  job.  We did learn from that, and management worked with us.  We always had a fun time, always celebrated birthdays, had breakfast specials and things like that for good morale."
good,I was just an intern but I learned a lot. The hardest part was that it really stressful when we got a low volume of applicants. Yet it was somehow good since we are exposed in the reality of business.
good,"Overall is a stable place to work at but if you are anything like me and like to be somewhat active at the very least this might not be the right job for you. This job requires a lot and I mean a lot of patience, you can even count on sitting for a long time and staying in the same position for a prolonged amount of time."
good,"Convergys ehemalig buw holding gmbH hat bietet mir ein umfangreiches Aufgabengebiet. Ich bin in der telefonischen Kundenbetreuung für einen Telekommunikationsanbieter tätig, und bearbeite telefonische Kundenanliegen wie z.B. Störungen, Reklamationen oder Rechnungsanfragen."
good,"Convergys is a good job for students just getting out of high school, but not for adults with kids I dont think we are paid enough for what we have to deal with with customers and your pay raise is only by cents not dollars."
good,if you are willing to work this is a good place to just put your head down and work no real complaints of wait except for having to pay tax on the incentives that are given to you during your shift but such is the law
good,Good overall company with lots of opportunity for growth and career advancement. Left for a position closer to home and with a higher compensation package
good,"Worked on technical issue and learned lot here."
good,"Work is good, management is valuable n supportive to the employees, promotions are also good. Cab facilities are also fine. Overall to work with concentrix, that was a memorable work exp with that company. To learn things quickly."
good,"The work gave me the skill that I needed for me to advance in life and that is in communicating or getting your point across."
good,"its a ok job if you go to work to do your job and go home"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"I enjoy my stay here in my workplace because of the people around you. Most of my colleagues are fun to be with. We are also provided free foods and access to internet."
good,"I personally live quite far from the location, making it difficult, and my opinion being biased, If i were to live closer, I am sure to have enjoyed the location much more than I had."
good,"Working at Convergys a a wonderful experience, the call center worked on normal to fast pace with a exceptional crew of supervisors andsecond hand team leads"
good,I like the job and how it is on a typical workday. Working in the place I work in is peaceful. The managers can sometimes get beside themselves. They need to pay more.
good,"One of the biggest BPOs, it has more than 2000 employees, it is a company that provides customer service support for Amazon and other companies, if you looking for great kick start for your career in BPOs you must try conentrix."
good,you get a lot of hours and good benefits. its place where you can make money to pay bills.and they good at hiring people who don't have any high school education.
good,Good. Accessible. Good environment. Good management. Good engagement activities. Good faciliies with pool table and karaoke rooms. Good incentives and programs
good,can be stressful due to sales quota. calls are mostly ineligible for uhc but the employee is still held accountable for not meeting enrollment goals. schedule is not consistent. can be changed at any time.
good,Offers good benefits but comparatively low pay and can be stressful depending on the client.  Advancements seem to be fairly appointed and the atmosphere can be competitive.
good,I worked at Convergys for 20 years.  When the management changed they outsourced my job to India and provided me very little in the severance package.
good,"They support a large range of contracts from companies globally.  Call, chat and email support mostly, from customer service to technical support.  They are not always able to pay competitively to similar types of work, but are good to get your foot in the door for similar types of work as they are willing to hire a broad range of people."
good,Assisting applicant with getting hired at call center and assigning them to new projects. Making phone calls to pre-screen applicants and schedule them for interviews.
good,Would love to be able to go back if possible  but I would have liked to choose a different department to work in and would Like to see managers that actual enjoy their jobs
good,401k makes you wait a year to get a company match. Bonuses are like a state secret and not paid in a monthly lump sum. Not a horrible place to work but you could probably do better.
good,"you were only rewarded if you could go beyond the limit of the sales, the management was no good. they did not know any more than the reps. the job atmosphere was great."
good,This company has a lot of young people working there. Management is ok but there sick day policy is horrible. If you get sick at work your first day counts against you even if you have a doctors note.The company has a lot of germs you will always be sick.
good,"Not bad, hours are worth it, not a job for everyone. A little further to travel, and travel options such as ride sharing programs are not always reliable."
good,"It was a place to work if you needed a job.  It was hard to move up if you wanted a management spot.  the communication wasn't what it should have been either,"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,very strict but its very easy to pick up on what you have to do fast pace can get very busy but long hours work place kinda crowded hard part is angry customers mad at company but not at you
good,"The job itself is wonderful. The company makes sure that you have all of the tools needed to complete your job. The only downfall is the fact that there is a 90 day shift bid that you have to do and you must be flexible just in case you don't get what you request. However, it is working from home, but with the aforementioned, if you have kids or even a small life, you will have to constantly change your life's schedule to adjust to your work shift."
good,I dreaded going to work. It usually consisted of 12 hour days 5 days a  week. A lot of favoritism and office politics going on. Went to HR to complain and nothing was done about it.
good,"Convergys is a place where you have every opportunity to advance, once you put your best foot forward you will see a big difference in work environment."
good,Working for Convergy's you talk to customers all day which can be very stressful at times. When you need help with something the management isn't helpful and they are extremely rude and hard to reason with!!!!
good,"They don't really care for you as a person, they only view numbers and if it will save or make them money they wont think twice. Managers are always amazing and understanding, the site I was at closed because they couldn't get enough clients to stay in the building, because they care only for quantity not quality and we as agents and the vendors (clients) knew that too and it caused the site to close."
good,"Laid back atmosphere with great management. Easy work, calling customers and doing satisfaction phone surveys .Comfortable atmosphere and no one looking over your shoulder. Great place to work independently . Casual dress too. Paid training is provided."
good,"Being my first ever job, it was a really good place to learn a lot about the workplace. A typical day would be answering various calls and adhere to daily sales targets. These are achievable if customers are calling to purchase new products or if they are eligible for an upgrade. However, it is very difficult if calls like this are not coming through or the wait time is high."
good,"most swing shifts are slow, with 5-25 minutes between calls. Management allows books for reading and conversations. If you are looking for a after school job. this is it. flexible hours 30-40 per week."
good,"This is a contact center and although the program I worked on was technical support it was ran like a call center which doesnt work."
good,"Im currently working at convergys, im handlinv the one of the biggest  wireless provider in US, (AT&T), as a customer service and especially sales, i can say that the atmosphere in my workplace is very toxic, aside from you're working at night, you have to be multitasker. But working there is a privilege coz i learned how to deal with the customer with diff attitude/personalities and especially enhance my communication skills."
good,"Fairly relaxed even though high volume of calls. "
good,"They tell you one think when you get hired, but those things change once you get hired.  Its a pain trying to get days off.  And communication from manager to workers aren't the best.  And you just feel more like a number, then a person."
good,"The company itself has many helpful guidelines and rules set in place. Across the board in all positions, most of the management seems to be stressed out and underappreciated by their upper management. As agents, the job is relatively easy regardless of which department is worked for. Transitioning can be done very quickly between positions as well."
good,"Personally, I enjoy working for Convergys. As long as you do your job then you are capable of advancing and making extra money. Just make sure you are focused on the customer rather than your own personal statistics. Although those are important, you are there to serve your customer and as long as you meet all of the key points on every call, you'll do fine. I could care less for the point system, but it is also good because they can't tell you whether you can leave or not. If you don't have excessive attendance issues, you're fine."
good,A place where one can have the job security and explore new options for oneself as a professional. A multi disciplinary environment with scope of growth for everyone and plenty of opportunities to look forward. It taught me time management and provided me with healthy work environment balancing between work and recreation.
good,"- Annahme von Kundenanliegen im Bereich Telekommunikation"
good,The company taught me how to manage my time wisely and be able to cope up with on the spot problems and issue. It also had enhance my english speaking.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"It's a good first job and the beginning wage is fair. There are great benefits, if you can afford it. It's an inbound call center and it's extremely busy. Raises was rare due to a wage freeze. Best part of the job was the people you work with and there were some very good team leaders,who strive to help you succeed. There is a very good holiday meal and yearly employee party,which was very fun. Paid time off is earned on how many hours you work; it's hard to get a full weekend off; the parking is good and there is security there. Your schedules can change from week to week. There is a large break-room with a televison and several game machines. It's handicapped accessible with an elevator."
good,"All MIS And AP and Budgeting and other work aspects involved."
good,"A typical day at work was making sure that the agents worked with their customers efficiently. I was able to learn how to manage 15-20 agents. Management was always there to talk to and ask questions.  Management was very approachable. Each project is like a family, you work with these people everyday, they become friends. Terminating employment with a person was the hardest part of the job. Telling someone that they no longer work there. Most enjoyable was letting the agents know how well they are doing and what their customer's were saying about them."
good,"Happy with yearly appraisal and employee appreciation events but don't like mandatory ots, split rest days and no shift bids.gets more responsibilities but the salary does not go up."
good,I enjoyed working for Convergys. The work environment was ok but chaotic due to two companies working on the same floor. Unfortunately Convergys is no longer in business in Moore.
good,"Unless you have family support with your children this is not the place for you. Otherwise, great atmosphere, learn new things, meet new people, great pay and benefits."
good,The only thing bad about working for this company is that they are not geared towards single mothers AT ALL. Your have to have a great support system if your children is under 14 yrs old because you won't see them certain times of the month.
good,"too much stress from some of the  managers and very little positive input on how to better oneself. Some managers were excellent and if you were fortunate enough to work under them, you got a lot of good feed back.  I feel they need to have workshop on how to be a manager and be able to connect with the employees."
good,Easy job just a lot of ghetto people work there no paid sick time off you ethier call out and get a point or use your PTO which really sucks lots of the customer who called were racist (CABELAS CLUB MEMBERS) so you definelty have to be able to handle this job
good,i enjoyed my time working there as my co-workers were great the build of the company is great the work is easy and fun and a fair amount of the staff were helpful
good,Concentrix offers a stable work day. The work day is a fasted paced and co-work are very helpful. Diverse culture and celebrates differences cultures.
good,Good Pay Good Benefits Friendly Co Workers N Management.N Learn Alot As You Go Dealing With Different People And Attitudes You Learn How To Work With People And Gives You Good Experience In The Long run.
good,"It's kind of stressful. Management's desire to really help their customers is nonexistent. I can't really speak for all of the management but most of the ones I've encountered. Overall, It's not a hard job to say the least but you can do without the unnecessary stress."
good,"energetic ready to get a productive day over with the help of everyone surrounding you, lots of incentives and give always when there was major sell outs"
good,The work hours allow you to work full-time and still have time for family and friends outside of work. There are a few different incentives a month to keep the energy and competition flowing. The supervisors do a good job of being there for their agents and helping them out when necessary. Being on teams also builds teamwork and you have a group of people there to motivate and support you to reaching your daily goals.
good,"high call volume, very strict with how long you take on calls, not a stable job. No time in between calls............................................."
good,This is a get you by job. I only recommend this job to people who really needs  work  or who looking for a job while going to school. the management is very poor. There is no professionalism in the work place. The managers are not  on the same page .
good,"It is a fun place to work, however, the management and the staff need to improve the way the schedules are worked out. Allow more flexibility to the agents that work there."
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,I was a part of Minacs which is now been acquired by Concentrix. It was an amazing experience to work with our previous management team and also current management team also is very strong. I was able to gain good exposure and valuable learning  through out 3 years and running here.
good,"unless your actually looking to get into customer service i wouldnt recommend it."
good,"Convergys, as a whole, seems the be a great company. The managment was okay, and the environment was good. The contract we had was not my thing though. Answering calls was dreadful, the customers were almost always mad and made it a personal issue, directing it at the representatives."
good,Management was great in working with people. The hardest part of the job was the sales calls. Rebuttals were basically required with will annoy the general telemarket-shopper.
good,Work schedules were very flexible and the culture was uplifting. The company valued their employees and always found ways to motivate their employees by offering incentives.
good,The workplace was good but the process management was very terrible and no body was ready to take responsibility for anything going wrong with the process...
good,"•	Provide excellent customer service while influencing prompt payment of the past due account"
good,"If you have ever had a call center job then you can understand my review if you haven't then all I can say is good luck. For a call center job, I will say that Convergys is a great place to work. Number one reason is that they are actually reputable, I personally know that there are call center jobs out there that are garbage and have even failed to pay people as much as 3 or 4 paychecks before they went out of business and declared bankruptcy, I'm being completely serious. So in that respect, I can promise you that Convergys is legit and will pay you every penny they owe you but it is call center work so if you're cool with that then it's a great job."
good,Job is good. But the management and salary hike are poor and no night shift allowance no two ways cab. Overall less benefits for employees and no growth
good,"I would like to tell earlier Concentrix was known as Minacs. I worked for approx 2 years over there and it was good experience in Minacs regarding my job, management , work environment and so on."
good,"Prior to joining Convergys, this company is one of the known and competitive in BPO Industry. Thus, after merging with Stream (different BPO) drastic change happened."
good,"I'm very satisfied working in this company . I have learned a lot and gain more experiences in this company. They have a good management and employee there. If I have given a chance again to apply in this company I will love too ,"
good,"great company to work for the wage is also good, very busy environment the only bad thing about the job is it is to repetitive. the hardest part of the job is when you have to do a really long shift."
good,Stable organization which provide advancement to everyone. Fair compensation & benefits. Fair rewards and recognition. Provides social programs for employees.
good,"Excellent opportunity to gain customer service experience. There are plenty of opportunities to grow with the company.  A few clients of Convergys are Humana, Apple, and US Bank."
good,It was a good training ground for a newbie like me in the bpo company. I learned a lot specially in dealing with other people. It helped me to become flexible and responsible.
good,Good experience...the main issue is shift hours..salary issue overall nice environment cooperative staff fun activities are also there I enjoy my company..
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"Convergys cares"
good,"I feel that Concentrix should be more sensitive to the stresses of the job and the effect that it has on an employees work and home life. Do to the nature of the jobs, they should provide time off for employees to get their mind back in order to provide 100% customer experience"
good,Before concentrix it was running by IBM on that time it was good for growth but when concentrix take over this atmosphere is not good for growth .. Not so much friendly
good,"I have learned many skills in this company."
good,"All day were enjoyable for me as good place to work."
good,"Working environment in Google ad words is good. Everyday during work we learnt many things, latest technology, current issues and so on. Management provide training day to day basis."
good,This contact center is one of the top bpo company the only problem is that they don't have good management and they are areas that need to be improve in this company.
good,"Apart from just being the Fun place we where also able to learn quiet in no of things.We had full support from our trainer, managers etc."
good,I have worked in Convergys operating the telecom field. The work ethics was fine. The work culture keep improving as they keep inventing new software to work accurately and get less or no delays in proper functioning.
good,"The relationships made at this company were okay until it came to scheduling. I had left the company because of the heavy scheduling and added mandatory overtime. The job did build my skill set when it came to managing time to solve an issue as well as having to research in order to answer questions. The hardest part of the job was the mental strain of being screamed and having to provide a solution for the customer where my manager wouldn't know the outcome. We had help on some call but in order to keep our average handle time down we had to come up with solutions in difficult situations before our floor support could help. It was enjoyable when i was able to close a sale, when i was able to help a customer learn something new, or even just able listen to a customer along with giving them a positive experience."
good,"It is a decent place to work, the people are great, they have messed a few things to with my PTO (PAID TIME off) but for the most part its an easy decent place to work."
good,Gives you a good sales and customer care experience. You will be trained in-house and TMs do coaching if you struggle with anything. Basic pay and commission structure based on hitting your monthly targets.
good,"Convergys is not so fun to work for as a rep, it's like you're in high school all over again, you canto do this or that without asking for permission."
good,"*You spend the day working with customers"
good,The team is so fun to be with. Even though we work during odd hours we still make sure that we are productive at work and have fun at the same time.
good,"Work environment is fun and pay is okay. Great position for someone in college or fresh out of high school, but not for someone looking to grow within a company."
good,The workplace was an easy setting and was nothing to hard to adjust to but I was looking more for comfort and a more professional environment it's hard to be yourself in this environment honestly speaking its not really about the job you at it's how you interpret yourself and I worked hard and cared about making my job great that was all I could do .
good,"It is a decent job as far as a call center goes. Almost no room for advancement, so good as just a temporary unail I found something with better pay. Very strict on some rules that shouldn't be there."
good,"Very Low Salary"
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,The management is caring and understanding. The job itself pushes you to work hard for yourself to build yourself. It gives you the right skills to the right road if it is taken. Gives many opportunities.
good,"This job is overwhelmingly easy. The only real stress came from drama between coworkers, management, and the odd angry customer. The pace was frenetic at times, but as competent employee could handle it with ease."
good,"The work itself wasn't difficult or challenging, the main drawback was the interactions with management and your superiors.  They lacked empathy, as well as people skills needed for keeping a positive work environment."
good,ok I felt converges could have done a little better. It is more of a sales geared salary. I perform at my best when my salary is not dependent on sales. I feel my efforts are more honest that way.
good,"There is lot of opportunities to learn and grow, work life balance average, job security and repetitive job, co workers are cooperative, management is supportive."
good,"If you don't mind customers screaming at you constantly, it can be an okay job. Management is varied, depending on shift. Nights are much more relaxed."
good,"managerment is good, very work friendly enviroment, coordinated staff, work here never ends, so lot of learning, the hardest part of the job is it never finishes hiring here never stop,"
good,A this company I received calls from numerous of different customers . I worked under an insurance company named Humana. Our daily goal was to put as much interest into our customers as we can to make them spend more money...
good,"it can be stressful because they make alot of changes"
good,"I worked for Home Depot settlements department. They got rid of my department, my management staff was amazing!! I would recommend working for this company!"
good,I learned many things during the training especially on the Internet technical support but i learned more during the actual work. It was fun but it would be better if they have the right person to handle employees in order for the employees to draw their true potential and to make them feel they are being taken cared of.
good,Convergys  is a great place to work as long as you are committed. Great starter job but there is always room for improvement with policies and incentives.
good,Gathered lots of knowledge ..Even the Managers were Good and helpful...Canteen and infrastructure was clean and healthy..People working there were Inspiring.
good,"At Convergy's I tried in a call center environment to help people having issues with their Apple portable devices.  It was interesting work and most of the people were nice but it is not the easiest thing in the world to help a customer get a device working properly that you can neither see nor put your hands on.  "
good,Everyday at the job was simple and fun. it felt great to be able to make the customer happy by being able to troubleshoot the issues they have had with there equipment.
good,Working with Concentrix was good.Concentrix is a good company for a people who are willing to work in call centre or in bpo
good,"Typical day at work starts on the first beep of Avaya, being able to talk to different people with different personalities seeking for assistance and the challenges that comes with it."
good,it's a grate place to work for when I worked there it was only customer service based now sales is involved with the change in the way the job is done those who do not do will in sales started to leave  or do poorly so if your not into sales the job sucks.
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"For the company it self it is fantastic, good atmosphere, and good frendly environment. Pay is good benifts as well. Training is very in depth on the topic on what you are learning."
good,It was my first job and it was a lovely experiance cracking the interview.I made many new colleagues and in wipro the cafeteria is just awesome.
good,"Some days went good ,somedays went hard and tough,there was pressure but learnt lot of new things and gathered a good experiance.Management is ok not to bother.In this two and a half years I made many colleagues and some wonderful friends."
good,Great pay. Great family environment. Scheduling bids need improvement though. Overall a great job. Hardest part of the job is dealing with the people that call in. People make things harder than it has to be.
good,I have learned alot of things and i did overcome my Fear in talking to foreign people most of the time when they get irrate.
good,"At Convergys I picked a lot of skill that I did not have a first. They had great pay and good benefits. The only thing with this company was it kelp changing(because it's a vendor company) the value of customer service it will like for us to drive for. One day for sale, the next day drive time, the next day customer  satisfaction. Even though your sale be on point and extra money coming in the company pocket they will dock you because your call time was high. Some times in order to get the sale you have to talk them into it. And ""No"" the customer is not always right."
good,"A great company to work for. Trainers were dedicated and ensured that trainees were ready for the job in which they were hired to perform,."
good,"Co-Workers are very helpful , i also enjoy working here because my Team Leader always here to listen whenever im in doubt , just have a problem with the pay , feel i do more work to get paid $12 an an hour"
good,"Une bonne emploie, mes beaucoup de problèmes dans la supervision sont souvent pas honnête se couvre envers les autres"
good,Workplace was nice as we talked about sports and other Nike related things.  Management and HR was terrible. No job movement
good,"i was scheduled in night shift and there is no problem on that. i learned about dealing by group and time management. my co-workers are nice. the hardest part of this job is to be involved on sales in which has a quota everyday,"
good,"To many restrictions, no cell phones, no paper towels, no pens, no pencils, no paper, no electronics. Too many snitches."
good,Learnt about Team Work and management. Hardest part of job is maintaining 100 percent quality and productivity. Most enjoyable part is learning new things all the time while working in each region.
good,"I was a call center agent with my previous work in a graveyard shift. I worked with the number one business processing operations in my country which is Convergys for 1 year and 9 months. The work molded me to love pressure, thought me to understand people and to communicate even in culture boundaries. These experiences trained me to develop a skill not just in customer service but also in impromptu writing. The experience to be assigned in Chat support trained me to be excellent in sentence construction, spelling and proofreading. The nature of the work demanded me to construct sentences in just few seconds and to be articulate well. Although there sample templates were given, most of the time we needed to tailor fit the sentences or create a new set of personalized template still in business like manner for it to complement the status of the customer. Because of these experiences, I learned to become resourceful and widen my understanding. I was also lucky to be transferred from one department to another thus broaden my understanding and passion for customer service. Plus our scorecards were fused with sales this means we were obliged to do up selling while giving quality customer service. These experiences have also let me work with best professionals that helped me to be who I am today."
good,"good salary but disappointing health card plan."
good,It is an extremely open workplace with room for advancement but you have to stick around for a tremendous amount of time before anything is able to take place.
good,A typical day at Convergys is anything less than fun and energetic. Management is great and the day runs smoothly when you're busy. Coworkers are awesome!
good,This job is not in my kind of field range the schedules are really flexed their its not organized correctly for the time of business it is they expect to much but don't give out a lot as far as meeting the their workers  half way they have unlimited overtime but its never available I have been there for a year soon my personal email doesn't work 6 months out of the year its been broke so I miss out on important info ive asked a numerous time about it and im only getting feed bck about then sending a email
good,"My time spent with Concentrix taught me to better hone in my time management skills, taught me about the importance of understanding your employees, and the value of being able to adapt to new changes! Working for a company that changed line groups and clients alot was great, it provided a chance to learn new things and understand industries better, and more importantly, how one company can impact a community."
good,"We have to answer all calls and provide high customer satisfactory performance. "
good,Answering technical questions for Samsung customers. Walked the floor and answered any questions agents might have to assist them on their calls. Took sup calls when there was no available supervisor. Listened to agents calls as a QA and graded them based on policy and procedure. Helped come up with incentives for employees. Co workers were pleasant and close. The hardest part was getting to that point in the call when you have done all you can do but the issue just can't be resolved. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping my fellow agents in becoming better at what we did as tech support.
good,"Concentrix is a good company, I had an amazing time working as a case worker, my team mates were awesome and any manager that I had ever encountered went above and beyond in order to help with holidays or time of or any aspect of the company that I was unsure about"

good,"Friendly people, very productive place to work. very street when it comes to rules. work area well spaced, lighting and excellent ventilation. good incentives"
good,Everyone was very helpful and supportive to each other. The working physical conditions are great. I have learned to handle customers who are very sensitive and demanding regarding their accounts. Management was also very prompt in addressing any issues which may involve their assistance. The hardest part of the job was the trying to pass the required grade despite the frequent failure of the tools that are required to service the customers' request. The most enjoyable part of the job is by just being with great people and being able to achieve the required grade despite the challenges.
good,"Always graveyard shift and not so friendly environment, but enjoyable while supporting co worker's issue. Hardest part is adjusting time of sleep due to day off shifting schedule."
good,Typically you are on the phones all day. I learned how to help customers effectively withtheir everyday needs. Management was not really willing to help everyone. Co-workers were very unprofessional. The hardest part was dealing with the immature people.
good,"overall it is a good place to work"
good,It's a great job for those who have more than a year's worth of customer service experience and/or face to face sales experience.  It would definitely be a learning opportunity for those who have not ever had to tell a customer no. It's sometimes hard to go into work but you have to be dedicated to your position and always be open to learning something new or be versatile.
