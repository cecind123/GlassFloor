good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,Bad attitudes. Bully others. And have favorites. Theres no hours available for us already working there but will keep hiring more ppl. Never worked for a worse comp
bad,"however, the management there plays favorites with other works. I just felt at my location it was all about who liked who, and never about the job at chipotle."
bad,I did not enjoy working at Chipotle. Most of the management at my store was girls fresh out of high school. Too much responsibility for not enough pay
bad,"They need better management and better employees. I was disappointed on how they put all the work on me, and wouldn’t have somebody help me out on prepping and on dishes. I was working harder than what I was getting paid and the managers are no help at all."
bad,The managers are awful and do not care about you. They insult you instead of teaching you. If you don’t know how to do something they just cut your hours.
bad,Mal distribución del trabajo favoritismos de Manejadores en cuestión de horas.
bad,Don't work here if you want to have fun while working. Corporate doesn't care about you or anyone but the almighty dollar. They don't care if you are feeling like garbage and they are understaffed half of the time and the other half they are staffed with incompetent people.
bad,"Coworkers were mean "
bad,"Chipotle is one my favorite restaurants to eat at. So I thought it would be cool to work there . But I was completely wrong , for my training I just watch a couple videos but after two days I was thrown on the line and then move to cashier. It wasn’t too bad before we had our bogo it was a disaster, I was on the line all day without no break, or lunch break.  The mangers showed favoritism at work. It just honestly not worth your mental health."
bad,"The chipotle on Lexington Springmill is terrible, I do not recommend working there. The employees are rude and disrespectful. The managers are lazy and do not have the maturity to run the store"
bad,Worst place I ever worked in all my 49 yrs   The only thing nice was the employee meal  their culture does not promote a sustainable business model and has only gotten worse with Steve Ells being made to step down  no future growth as the hours are extremely long since you will cover any employee who claims they are sick and threw up as that is their policy  so many better jobs out there
bad,The hardest part is you get to do everything once you learn everything. The management is messed up. Don't follow laws' on scheduling and at the same time... they do favoritism.
bad,"So this place is toxic terrible training management hours and benefits. They backbite managers are lazy the trainings a joke and the management dont even get me started. Wow you get 3 paid days off a year and free food. Watch out though they cut your hours and automatically enroll you in medical, This place went from 15 workers to 30 because the district manager whos there 2 times a month would rather hire new people at 3dollars more an hour  than invest in current employees. The gm lacks discipline character and looks out only for himself and management"
bad,"Had to give e a starbut if I could would give them zero stars. I started at Chipotle in January 2019.  At first it was good, but when the Assistant Manager transfered the store went down extremely fast.  The so called manager does not have a backbone, doesn't know how to run a fast food restaurant. He makes others do his manager job.  Then an aprintence came to the store, even a bigger loser then the manager."
bad,"this job was horrible. It was my first real job and I swear it gave me new job anxiety. They treated me very poorly. Management was cliquey, they talk down to their workers, change clock in time and end (even if you come in early or leave late), they expect you to do more then you applied for, pay not worth the emotional abuse, they start drama among eachother for no reason. THIS WAS THE WORST JOB EVERY I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYBODY TO WORK THERE!!!"
bad,Little pay for so much work. Management sucks and usually end up picking up everyone else paces cause everyone calls out. the good thing about this job though is the free food
bad,"Horrible job horrible Field Leader Horrible employees Worst customer service I've experienced in my years of working Never Had full menu always running out of things customer complain they didn't care closing store for hours on hours, the staff didn't was hands serving nasty lettuce guac was old chicken was old, ran out of meat every night, lazy service managers thasaid their job was to sit"
bad,"worst location ever, meanest managers all except one & she ended up leaving! the managers are old and bitter, angry that young people are in college & doing better. overall rude!"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,Not the best experience. Ok. But wasn't comfortable working with the company. The pay rate wasnt the best 11 an hour. And not much of a flexible schedule
bad,Trash company to work for and I would recommend everyone no longer eat there for the remainder of the Chipotles existence in mainstream fast food industry
bad,This company plays favorites to yes people!! The management absolutely sucks!! If you are a lesbian as the general manager is you are fine!! If you are normal you do not belong!!
bad,At chipotle if your not Spanish speaking you will never move up. Almost all the managers for the company are Spanish. It’s very unprofessional. The work is mostly easy and you get free food
bad,I didn’t like how chipotle was ran very unorganized and unprofessional. Didn’t feel welcomed so much drama before I got there. They didn’t put work first
bad,Chipotle is probably the worst place I have worked at in all my experience for working with people and providing customer service. The management sucks and everything about that place is toxic.
bad,"Hostile work environment. Manager was unprofessional, wasn't trained properly. Work schedule always changing when it was supposed to be a set schedule. no benefits"
bad,"THEY DONT CARE ABOUT EMPLOYEES..."
bad,"Hard work for really bad pay. They also were so strict, which I felt was kind of a lot for a job so low paying. I called out and they said I had to come in or bring them a doctor note by the end of the day. I did not enjoy working there."
bad,I have been employed with Chipotle and it's just not what you think. They expect too much for so little. I had manager duties for regular pay. It wasn't fair at all
bad,"this is a great job for teens who are looking to make money especially if it is their first job and they want to learn to multi-task, be under a manager, and learn the importance of money."
bad,"at chipotle manhattan ks--get off at least 2 or 3  hours late, or more, every shift. shifts are always at least 10 to 12 hours long. 1 short break, working 10 to 12 hours, or more, sometimes no break at all. impossible to even use the bathroom. always short staffed. turn over rate very high. pay $10 an hour. not worth any amount of money to work there. absolutely no training for new employees. expected to be perfect with no mistakes. very strict and particular how things are done. very hard, unreasonable and ridiculous. underpaid for the stress and workload. workload extremely heavy, hard and stressful. super extremely stressful, like walking on egg shells. so stressful, you get bad headaches and cry a lot. managers and most coworkers are rude, hateful and lie a lot. will say mean and degrading things to your face. extremely busy everyday, long lines to the door non stop. with unsafe working conditions. had to quit. stress is so bad, can make a person sick. cant have a personal life. too stressed out and exhausted from work. have to do a wellness check for every shift. makes no sense. constantly washing and sanitizing hands. a clock on the wall goes off thru out the day, telling employees to wash hands. hands get raw and sore. constantly smell like food. especially very strong onion smell. lingers to you, your clothes and everything at home. food splatters in face, eyes, and everywhere else. food gets caked on clothes. never satisfied. constant non stop threats of getting in trouble or being fired. the job itself is too much. would much rather live in a forest and eat berries,"
bad,Farmington Ave is Rachet. Food is never ready & chips always Hard. Dining room never clean. Manager shows favoritism. Manager never on time. Where rip jeans to work. Chipotle is a hot mess
bad,"Terrible management. Unfair treatment even to pregnant women. Stealing wages etc. If you want a sh*tty hourly pay to get you by, work at mcdonald’s before you settle here ."
bad,"Short staffed, lack of communication, underpaid, you couldnt ever leave line, the line never stopped and when we didn't have anyone to work we ubered other managers to our store and when the day was done they felt sick and overworked."
bad,Management treats you poorly they your forced to work past your scheduled time. Your schedule is constantly changing . You can’t speak to higher management without going through the management chain so problems were never taken cared of and I was a salaried manager that was forced to work over 55 hours a week with no compensation for the extra hours
bad,"They were racist cause I’m black"
bad,it is bad. work environment was terrible. gm always yelled and cussed. district manager didn't care about the store or employees. no one got breaks and everyone look tired and sad.
bad,Not a good place to work had to do others jobs no one would help me I do not recommend this location to anyone in food service stand clear and good luck if you do work there
bad,Don’t even consider this as your first job. There are plenty of other locations that pay better and are less stressful. You will only wonder why you took the job in the first place.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,the mangers are nice but they dont have the patience totrain anyone they dont want u take other people places at the job and they want u do learn everything on your own
bad,"what i mean by that is that is not worth it managers are lost theres new rules every week pays way to little not worth it, everyone there wants to be a manager no one wants the responsibility. Also ive quit so many times and they just keep hiring me over and over"
bad,Horrible corporate office. Pretend to promote within and to give people a chance but do not care about employees or anything but making money. Use leftover food from the previous day and try to pass it off as fresh.
bad,"I have nothing good to say about my time at Chipotle Mexican Grill. I worked there because they paid me, that's it. I don't buy into their mission statement, they have a terrible training program for managers to be, and I would absolutely never recommend that anyone ever should work here. Thank you."
bad,"I would not advise anyone to work for this horrible company, they hire people that are rude and racist and promote them to managers, then even if you report them nothing happens because the company is so backwards and all the managers are good friends with their boss so he doesn't do anything. my location specifically should be closed down with all the food and health concerns that went on there, but Chipotle doesn't really care about the customers at all so they don't care about what happens to the food. Managers and crew members would constantly smoke in the walk in around raw food. whenever the food would start to go bad they would change the stickers so they could get an extra day out of it and not have to make more. they found mold in the rice and would still cook and server it. I Would not recommend any to work for this company they don't care  about their workers no matter how good you are."
bad,"I am reviewing Chipotle in Sunrise FL next to IKEA. The only positive is that you get a free meal while at work and the food tastes good. Other than that DON'T WORK HERE because it is run like a sweatshop. "
bad,I had to work 40 hours to make just a few hundred dollars. The management took away work hours not based on performance but because of personal vendettas
bad,"It's indeed very similar. Incompetent management, low staff and rude customers.  The pay is garbage for the amount of work you are expected to put in here"
bad,"First off I’d like to say I didn’t enjoy my short time here. The very first day they assigned me to clean the bathrooms without any gloves, that’s all they made me do. I didn’t even get to do much other than clean when I was scheduled. Another thing problem would be the hours. My first week I had “full time” hours, than my next two weeks I was cut to only two days a week for a total of 8 hours a week. They barely put me o; the group text message to receive the schedule for the week. When it came to training for being a cashier and the girl who was training me wasn’t all that professional, she seemed distracted the entire time. My gm was never on the same schedule as me, but I know she choose favorites. None of my other managers weren’t professional, they were all on their own, nobody was a team.. it was a fight for yourself. Nobody ever made me feel like I was supposed to be there. I wouldn’t consider replying here or suggest to anyone either."
bad,"If you apply to this job, withdraw. You got an interview cancel it. If your friend says it’s a fun job, they are lying. Don’t apply to this job or company. Run away when you get the chance."
bad,"I worked for chipotle for 2 + years, I have never had a complaint, I had regulars that I loved and that loved me. I was 100% loyal to my job. I risked my life to make it to work an hour away in a blizzard. I went over and beyond for my job. Until one day my GM was having a bad day, I asked if it was possible to leave for an hour during one of my shifts a week in advance. My boss was so rude about it cursed at me, yelled at me and sent me home.(which I thought was just for the day.)On my way home my field leader calls me asking why I walked out and quit my job?. My GM lied to my field leader and said i walked out and quit. I would never do that I loved my job so much. and also needed my job!. So I told my FL I was really upset and want my job. So he told me he would investigate it and see if he can just transfer me. So I called him and texted him everyday desperately wanting my job. So 2 weeks later he tells me that my job was terminated. So I was completely in shock and asked him why was I terminated?. He told me I abandoned my job, which I was sent home. So I tell him I was sent home. Then I ask again so what is the reason for termination?. He said because you said you were not going to come in on your scheduled shift! How is that even legal?. I only wanted to leave for an hour. And it was a week notice!! And if I was unable to leave then I would of rescheduled my appt. How can you fire me because you think im not going to show up a week from then?. Im very upset with this situation and I am thinking about getting a lawyer involved."
bad,It's fast food. That constantly has issues with E. coli. It's because they store food too long and you'll get fired if you do the right thing and throw it away.
bad,"I worked for chipotes for 2 months.When I was hired I was told that the position was a grill cook.that never happened. they honestly expect you "
bad,I was let go because l couldn't make it in on my day off. I only missed one day they called me in on a day off. Luckily the manager put in his two weeks and was fired the day before the two weeks were up.
bad,"Very stressful. This jobs is a really fast paced type. In my location, they made us do tasks after tasks after tasks. They don't give you time off if you've already taken some last week."
bad,I was informed I would be full time and then was scheduled less than 16 hours a week. 4 hours shifts knowing there was a long drive to get to the store.
bad,"This place used and abused you in every way, =after tricking into the whole we care about our people thing. Even managers made close to minimum wage and was even forced to work off the clock numerous times"
bad,"I once worked at the Willow Grove, PA location. Our manager got fired out from under us during a lunch rush. Regional manager told me explicitly that he didn't care that I hadn't been paid, because it wasn't his responsibility."
bad,This company is poorly ran and there is no job security. You can be fired for absolutely anything and you will be wasting your time. I highly recommend for everyone to work for a different company.
bad,The managers only want to promote those they favor. They don’t give enough hours and definitely never happy with extra work anyone does. They don’t rehire anyone.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,Terrible management that treats employees like garbage. They do t care about their veteran employees. Management is the biggest issue. Lack of communication and lack of food safety was always an in store issue.
bad,Might be because of the one I’m working at but the gm sucks. People quit and get fired and call off faster than they are hiring people. They don’t care about your mental heath which is ok but when you’re being depressed from your job then it’s a problem.
bad,I was a manager there and they feed you a bunch of bull. They say they care but if you call in sick they start giving attitude.  If you want people to work sick then don't give them sick pay because at the end they still question it. I was working 80 hours a week and promised to get back vacation time sick time and at the end got nothing.  I would not work at this job no  matter how desperate you are go to qdoba instead. They say you make so much but realistically you don't. They throw you the free meals and tuition  but half the crew members I had couldn't even get the reimbursement.
bad,"management does not care about their employees. only their favorites. yes favoritism is a thing there & management is not afraid to let it be known . horrible, horrible managers. if you get sick you HAVE to be off at least 3 days after getting sick & the next week they will only schedule you 12 hours. if i could give 0 stars i would. i asked to transfer to a chipotle not 2 hours away I got told no. I quit & 2 weeks later I asked why i have not received my last check & the manager actually says ""oh probably cause I have not terminated you yet i wanted to see if you wanted to work part time downtown"" like no dude i asked to transfer there months ago . so much more to say but I'll leave it at that."
bad,Chipotle wants you to do too much for so little money . It’s not worth it . They make you work long hours and some managers don’t even want to pay you for the  .
bad,"I worked for this company on two separate occasions, under two completely different managers and it is by far the worst food service job out there. They want to be an extraordinary company and the pay is decent for an entry level job, but they lack in so many other departments. At my location we would get our schedules one to three days before the week would start, making home work life balance impossible. Multiple managers would come in under the influence of drugs/alcohol. If you're female you will be treated like you can't do anything. The stress of this place has caused more than one mental break down and I hope no one ever has to work here."
bad,"Honestly the location I was at sucked it had bad management and always lacked in following policies . Manager was rude , most coworkers spoke Spanish around me and I didn’t speak or know Spanish which is against policy . Also I was harassed and picked on as an outcast and wrongfully terminated.  Fruit Flies everywhere in store . Nobody washes hands every top of hour . Line members barely smile . Food is wrongfully cut causes our proportions to become bigger ."
bad,"boring, lame, sad, this is what life is like in the chipotle restaurant, you are surrounded by racists mexicans and stripped of any human dignity you might have"
bad,"Worked there for only a short time.  Very poor management,  no help to new workers. The night manager stood in the window eating WingStop every night while the workers slaved to cleanup for closing. Talked to new workers very rudely and she was very unprofessional. Wouldnt suggest this job for anyone!"
bad,"The manager I dealt with at the Chipotle in Pittsburgh PA was one of the absolute most incompetent managers I had ever seen in my life and I have worked in the customer service field for over 6 years! I was switched to another location to ""train"" because the manager couldn't properly handle even one new employee and at this other location I got let go after only 3 weeks for doing what I was told but being yelled at by the assistant manager there. I was already not that big of a fan of Chipotle to begin with but now I know this is what to expect of the management of all locations and I will NEVER step foot in a single Chipotle as long as I live!"
bad,Management sucks. The GM didn't know what he was doing AT all he was scared of everyone so he bands you from all chipotle's till his contract is up. He makes grill cook spoiled chicken and if they refuse they get fired. No breaks! He's racist and he calls people out of their names! They don't pay you anything! DO NOT WORK AT LUTHERVILLE TIMONIUM AREA!
bad,"While working at chipotle, it had its ups and downs. But I was told I was going to get a raise numerous times, but did not receive one. I busted my behind all time without any recognition."
bad,"Absolutely would not recommend working for this company. Management is extremely incompetent, judgemental and not understanding, the hours were HORRIBLE (I generally worked 2-4 hour shifts for a whopping total of 12 hours a week) and the customers are the absolute worst. Corporate policies and practices are completely centered around profit and they do not care about you at all as a person."
bad,"In a Seattle location, They hired a number of 16 years old kids and cut the hours to the adult people that were working there.  The schedule was a mess, for the 16 years old, they would tell us to come for 2 to 3 hours and send us home when it's slow.  They promised up 5000 towards college if we stay 5 months but that wasn't true"
bad,"- Just complete awful management."
bad,"The Restauranteur was sexist and picked and chose favorites. You had to be careful talking to him based on his mood. He could either be really happy or really angry. He was very passive aggressive towards certain things. He didn't want you to call out if you were sick, he'd rather you work and not tell anyone. When you would call in he would not report the sickness."
bad,Not a good company to work for. They overwork you and they pay doesn’t match all the hard work you do. You work as if you are 6 people and only get paid for one job.
bad,They work you to death without a paid break they tell you you will get. They told me they paid weekly. That was a lie. The manager's do nothing but talk on the phone literally all day. The employees are way too overworked and usually doing up to three different positions all day long. Hand wash 600 pans a night by hand. Just a terrible terrible place ro work.
bad,"In the beginning, Chipotle was my favorite job I have ever had. Over time, the company lost its morals and with it, its management. The company was no longer the same and as a result many people also stop eating there."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"I have worked there for over two years, and have had minimal raises with no opportunity for advancement.  Despite constantly trying to improve my personal skills, Chipotle did not set me up to succeed."
bad,"Worst job i have ever worked . Was terrible , the staff , the people , the job experience was horrifying . Staff was racist and didn’t suit the workers ."
bad,"Not worth the stress and drama for 9/hr? Joke. You constantly do all the senior employees jobs. No one takes it seriously. Bunch off kids working there with no respect, no professionalism, managers are a joke. Look elsewhere"
bad,The entire time I was with the company it was a carrot on a stick scenario. It is extremely stressful and I felt undervalued. The culture structure sounds very nice but the execution is almost nonexistent.
bad,I’m tired of getting bullied and management changing the hours I worked in the system to less than what I worked. I’m not being compensated for what I worked. They are taking my money! Why? Because all I do is come in on my days off to help them out and this is what I get in return?
bad,"Worked for them for almost six months, on the terms that I wouldn't work weekends. Five months in, they decided to change me to ONLY working weekends. I went from 37 hour weeks to 12 hour weeks with no explanation. When trying to have a discussion with the manager about this, he brushed me off and refused to speak with me. Horrible management. Very competitive atmosphere in order to gain hours."
bad,Very unorganized with extremely low standards.  There is a low level if accountability but the new CEO and COO have it headed in the right direction. There has been some much needed middle management changes as well.
bad,"If you really need money, go for it. But that's the only way I'd recommend working for chipotle. Management is bad. Health code violations like crazy. The employees are lazy and the place is dirty."
bad,In the beginning it was a great place to work and a lot of fun but they changed the general manager to a woman who would only give hours to people who bought her things. She’d purposely put you to work shifts you didn’t want just for you could call out and she could have a reason to fire you
bad,Working at chipotle made me very sad in life . All of the negative energy around me was starting to make like that also. Everyone was in competition to see who was better . No one ever worked as a team
bad,Chipotle is honestly the most disgusting and disappointing company I've ever worked for. The management sucks. Corporate doesnt care. I got threatened to get fired if I reported an injury. On top of that I did not receive my tax returns for months after MANY MANY calls
bad,"Completely horrible company , lack of standards lack of management lack of motivation in every location hands down a straight disappointment. I wouldn't recommend at all ."
bad,Every single staff member was rude to people that were not Hispanic or Latino. The managers talked behind each other's backs and were very disrespectful to the employees. There was no sense of community and the hours were unfair. The managers scheduled people for full-time hours when they were part time employees. The staff never wanted to help other staff learn how to do something that a person might be new to and the managers did not mention a lot of important information in the training sessions. This was by far the worst job experience I have ever had and I would not recommend it to anybody.
bad,Chipotle as a company wants to constantly grow while promoting management from within. This can be difficult to do when people are pushed into positions they were not ready for and ground up and thrown to the side.
bad,"working at chipotle is horrid. Barely any training. Serious THREATS if you are found even asking for a break on an 8 hour shift. And no consequence to a sexually abusive manager who was reported multiple times by many different women. They simply relocated him. This company has no values and will squeeze all they can out of you. I wasn’t even allowed to have a lunch break, and if you were caught with food then you were threatened by means of termination. Terrible company with an even worse work environment."
bad,"Chipotle is a good company but the individual stores are full of drama and petty people. I have never worked in such a negative, fearful environment. I would not recommend working at Chipotle."
bad,"Not worth it. Management is uptight, the store is always understaffed because of a high turn over rate, nobody wants to be there and the pay is terrible for the work you have to do"
bad,"managers are rude and abuse authority, compensation is minimum wage, very little raises, no benefits, ask and expect too much and the pay is not worth it."
bad,"Went through four general managers in the 2 years I was there- took two years of prodding to move up. Long days, mismanaged shifts, and lazy managers.  High stress environment due to lack of management leadership."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,I recommend to ppl that working in chipotle is drama you not gonna have a life they are poor with training and they don’t give two s**t  about you or your life only about them self
bad,"I hate this job I wonder work, here again, my manager did not know what he was doing it was a very low and poor job experience, I just personally didn't like this job sorry"
bad,it was a terrible experience and i didnt even start yet but i went to an interview and they show discrimination towards anybody that didn't speak spanish
bad,"They constantly complained about times, if you didnt finish you wouldnt get a lunch. They didnt care about you only cared about the company. Constantly overworked and so much favoritism in this company its ridiculous. They want you to buss your butt off, work hard and long hours, finish everything within a certain time frame etc etc and pay $9.50?"
bad,Chipotle gets packed to quick for me and people are way to picky for what im getting paid for .. on top of that the employees are very rude so i cant sorry
bad,"SPEND YOUR WORKING AGE SOMEWHERE ELSE YOUNG PEOPLE."
bad,Worst job i ever had. Everybody got over worked there. Management treated the employees horrible. Managers would push all employees to work faster and faster everyday.
bad,traumatized after working there. get chills even trying step into a chipotle store. bad management and eff you tara oops you are fired already ahaha ha
bad,"Not only was it a waste of my time, did I not get paid accordingly, have my tips stolen, lied to and blatant disrespect. There was also a lot of sexism and crude behavior."
bad,"I worked at Chipotle for a total of 7 years. The management is horrible and they down managers that properly execute their jobs, it's basically every man for themselves."
bad,I do not recommend working at a job that expects so much out of a person and receives little to no tanks for the job that is done. Working at chiptle was the worst decision of my life.
bad,"The Mangers are extremely disrespectful and will scream in your fade in front customers and employees. Training is poorly done, so much drama everyone works against each other trying to be the best while back stabbing pending law suit recorded inappropriate comments made to me directly to me management that were discriminatory"

bad,"ITS A CULT "
bad,"I worked at Chipotle for a year and I can honestly say it was the worst job experience I ever had. The management was questionable, the hours were very limited in my case, and overall I did not have a good time being employed here. I asked for a raise numerous times and was never given it, even though I worked part-time and literally worked nearly 30 or more hours a week. I was also a junior in high school and could barely juggle work and school life since I was most likely working. Unless you're a manager or an apprentice, the pay is poor and the work that must be done isn't enough with the pay."
bad,"Workplace wasn’t taken serious, managers let workers do anything lack of any work being done , always complaints from customers. managers cut hours to certain individuals to offer to ones they liked. Favoritisms at its finest . Offered a better position and it never fell through."
bad,"bad service, no breaks for the cashier, everyone is the boss, staff puts their hands in the chips whenever they want a snack, they make the cashier do all of the cleaning and stocking."
bad,I have nothing good to say about this particular store very unprofessional. management was very unprofessional showing up late and the staff waiting outside for the store to open which sometimes opened an hour late
bad,Lack of communication and poor management and employees were never on time for their shift change schedule was always changing without notice poor customer service
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,My GM was catty and played around too much. told me I was going to be put on probation and then didnt even tell me he fired me. Because he didn't like my answer ..
bad,it was an ok job that was fast paced and required a lot of multi tasking. Me bring on the grill position I  did the majority of the heavy lifting. I made sure everything came out as it should.
bad,"GM would constantly flirt with girls less than half his age, "
bad,"My opinion on chipotle is management from General managers thinking like they’re above the rest. while Service managers don’t care about crew. In my eyes if you’re not in a click you don’t belong and they make you feel like you don’t belong. When  comments are thrown around about your last check being ordered is not something a hard working person like myself that has never called off, or has never came to work late, or has never said I couldn’t work a day that I was scheduled. I literally revolved my life around my schedule. The general manager at the location I used to work at was a BOSS not a LEADER not someone that empowers and elevates his crew instead he made you feel small like you weren’t good enough like you didn’t matter. He would always come to work late say hi to the people he felt like greeting."
bad,Racist and discriminatory company/management. I never get appreciated as a crew member; and often felt shunned away by managers due to favoritism reserved for certain parties. I was specifically distanced based on my culture Islamic dress wear(hijab) and even let go off at a certain point for requesting my great at a certain time for the month of May-June of 2018 so I can pray and break my fast since it was Ramadan. A religious month for Muslims.
bad,Always run out of food and put too much pressure on team members who work there. Staff does get along well with one another It’s like a family . Managers need better help managaing
bad,That's a slavery job a little bit of pay I would not refer Chipotle Mexican Grill to nobody to work there that place when they get shut down cuz their food don't be hard they food be warm the rice behalf cook the beans was hard and dry looking all the time will poor management and under low staffs
bad,Working at chipotle was an ok job until the manager changed now with the new manager it’s all going downhill l. We always run out of items and need to go to another store to borrow something. You work extremely hard  just to see the manager give all your hours away to some new hire who doesn’t know what they’re doing.
bad,"I wouldn’t want to work there again even tif the pay was immaculate, terrible managers and terrible conditions. There was always a shortage on food by the end of the night and the cook never wanted to make more"
bad,Day's at chipotle were busy but nothing I couldn't handle. Used to man the grill and prep area all alone throughout my entire shift. Would do anything that was asked of me and anything that would make our team run will a well oiled machine.
bad,"The environment promotes benefits of working there, but it's a harsh place to work at. Everything's quick-paced and I learned that sometimes a job like that does not benefit in any way"
bad,The off times were consider suggestion. The hours were unreliable. You didn't know you schedule until a few hours before you had to work. The management was poor. It was a very stressful environment for how low it paid.
bad,"Chipotle was not a fun place to work. The workplace culture was not right, it was very poorly managed and the management at the time played favorites and didnt actually care about the people working there."
bad,"In a typical day, it starts with everything being behind due to understaffing to ""save on labor"". This sets up for a poor night shift and everyone is always eager to clock out instead of helping the closing staff, especially upper managers and apprentices. These managers refuse to acknowledge the issues they create and instead put it off for others to deal with. The pay is low considering the added work for the staff to deal with. Employees are also not properly trained and rarely ever reprimanded when they do something wrong and in turn, this causes more work for those who know what should be done who don't want to hear management complaining all shift (which they do). I have worked in this company for over three years and am just now getting trained in prep and grill positions. This is due to management being particular about who they decide is or is not capable of working efficiently, specifically against younger women, even when those they do choose are unable to do so. I have worked at three different chipotle locations and while this experience is not the experience of all Chipoltes, in the ones I have worked at it is not worth the stingy pay. I have always done my job quickly and efficiently and know what to do to complete my part of the work but management is unable to do the same and does not recognize the employees who are also doing their job properly. I, working for this company for three years, had to fight to get to what is considered starting wage. My experience and work ethic are taken for granted and I get no benefits out of it and can assume the same will happen"
bad,the manager i worked for was a down right dirty and not one i would like to work for . he managed to work his way up the chain by cheating the system and cheating people
bad,Unless you can chop food quickly and correctly within a few days this is not the place to work at. you will lose your job if you cant cut food to the correct size everytime as fast as possible.
bad,"wouldn’t recommend to anyone with any sort of mental health issues who might need any accommodations, such as needing a few seconds to breathe, or needing to sit for a few minutes due to any sort of medical issues, also would not reccomend working here if you have any physical health issues"
bad,The store was overall very unorganized as well as management did follow proper protocol regarding to food safety and state employment regulations. I was just completely unsatisfied as a employee.
bad,"I loved the job but they pay low then what you work hard for. like they expect you to do three different types of jobs at once while your grilling cooking, and pre cooking."
bad,"Food is great, horrible to work for. Amazing culture is preached, but this is your typical fast food joint. Over worked and under paid. Good starter job"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,If you are applying to the KENMORE location in Chicago. DON’T. The managers are cliquey and if you are not fortunate enough to be in the in crowd you will have a terrible experience. The managers also lack the ability to speak to their employees with basic respect. They chastize you for breaking the rules but will turn around and break them.  You are not even allowed to take your employee meal home.
bad,"Chipotle takes care of all employees and customers. Our opinions and happiness matter to them. We enjoy free food daily, great hours and great pay. Happy environment."
bad,Chipotle isn't what I expected at all working for them was horrible and it was a constant battle about race and sexuality. Nothing about working here was a positive experience for me.
bad,"GOOD hours to work fast pace work , good to work on knife skills. Working there gave me a love for food and serving people. There a need for working with staff on food handler knowledge."
bad,"Chipotle in Oxford is the worst job on the high street. The managers were very rude to employees, which created a very volatile work culture. Furthermore, every shift required you to work longer than you were scheduled, and management seemed to not know what they were doing at all."
bad,They overwork you when you're underage. They fire people over nothing. The management is not good whatsoever. But all their food is freshly made. But it's a suckish work environment.
bad,Horrible manager but an awesome team...worked allot of hours for a little pay and advancing wasn't an option..I was suppose to be kitchen manager but due to not having anyone to work prep I wasn't able to go any higher..
bad,"Working here is a joke."
bad,Management here is by far the worst. Forced to work more than 50 hours without compensation. No opportunity for work life balance. Physically demanding and workers comp claims were never attended to.
bad,"working for chipotle would be a last resort if your in need of a job. worst company ever! a lot of drama at the store I was at. the GM was sleeping around with all the help and even managers, a lot of drama between the managers. a lot of favoritism was shown among the crew members when it came to time off or let go early."
bad,"Its an ok place to work, but only if you really have a thick skin. My time there was not exactly the most enjoyable there. They did not listen to me when I tell them I cannot do something due to a medical reason and they bi passed it and made me look bad. I did not get enough support in my job at the time."
bad,I really dont even know what to say here...you will work 12 hour shifts with no break and the 9 bucks or so an hour will not feel worth it when you spend more time at work than home. Upper management doesn't have a single clue on the realities of keeping up a store. They like to tell you your wrong but will almost never put on an apron and take a hands on approach
bad,"the management is poor, from the general manager and up all are disrespectful and curse at you on the daily. Chipotle need to fire everyone they have in charge and hire new people"
bad,"i worked at chipotle for almost 3 years and i was given little to no respect. anybody i worked with could tell you i worked hard and good at my job. not only did i handle my job tasks but also spent most of my days helping others. management at my location was unprofessional, didnt control his store and what was going on with it, when o would bring these situations up he would acknowledge but would never actually fix the problems. i was pregnant and they knew i was so good at my job they would let me handle situations alone, i wasnt given help to the line not until 5-6 people came in. i would bust a line out alone , and when i asked how come i dont get help i was told "" i figured you could handle it, but since you cant ill help next time"". i understand people trust im good at what im doing and i can handle alot because i did, but being 8 1/2 months pregnant it gets hard to pick up everyone elses slack on top of mine. in the whole 3 years i was there i received 2 raises, and was told i didnt deserve a 3rd because i didnt come to work to help others, but in the same sentence was told "" dont think i dont think youre good though, theres a reason why you hold the most hours in the FOH"". bottom line i wouldnt recommend this job, take it from someone who spent three years there and wasnt appreciated."
bad,I use to work for chipotle for two years and they didn’t take my development seriously I got transferred to another store that was terrible I was a kitchen manager in training and I was helping manage the store by helpings managers out that didn’t even take their own positions seriously and it use to make me upset coming into work to a sh*ts how and made the second shift work environment terrible and the area manager William Armstead was terrible he’d never answer my calls nor get back with me on certain topics in terms of my development I never got my review raise and I was under paid doing manager duties also I would come to work early to put the truck away but I would always have to clock in late because the managers were late and they never would even acknowledge that they were late nor set the example to be on time nor edited my time back which was severely unethical to me and I highly recommend no one work for this company waste of time and lots of work with little to no pay
bad,The management was horrible.They do not schedule you especially if you're a student. They treat you badly when you confront them about your hours. They don't pay enough for the stress.
bad,"Worst place to work for. Don't getpaid for work thatis done. Wants everyone to clock out on time, but keep working after. Can't take free meal out of the store fot break."
bad,Chipotle uses and abuses people and then throws them away. Chipotle is a cult that preys on people who don’t know what their next step in life’s will be.
bad,It was a real disgrace to work in an environment that had no type of control or self help . Just management took there positions to the head . No team work
bad,"worst work environment ive ever been in, will work you like a slave i was scared to call out anytime i was sick, poor managemnet, just dont work for corporate ever."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,Don't work for them . They will slave you until your bones fall off of you. They food is nasty as I don't  know what. Please save your time from there
bad,Work environment is not welcoming at all. Cannot be late or else you will be written up without any warning. Often make you stay late without considering your time.
bad,"I would wash all produce, and prep it to be served. All the meats were to be marinated and prepared for the grill cook. I had to keep my area clean. They had nice cutlery and everything needed to prepare the food with."
bad,Poor store management an co-workers were disrespectful  short breaks change of job function everyday an da cleanliness was very poor an everyday co-workers called out
bad,I really thought that this would be a great career but the bossed are cut throught. They lie about Food safety. My Supervisor Faked all the auditsand I felt like I could say nothng because I didnt want to get fired.
bad,"Just dont even try. It's not worth it. If you're that desperate go to McDonald's. I'm sure they will treat you better."
bad,Horrible place. The managers treated the employees unfairly. You had to suck up to them in order to get decent treatment. The tips were only given to the managers' favorite employees. Once I was almost even forced to work while off the clock; didn't give in though. Glad I left and never looked back.
bad,The management is poor at best. There is very little cooperation between managers. They have issues with hiring worthwhile employees. You are expected to pick up the slack if others call off or management fails to schedule someone properly.
bad,"Chipotle and all this new regulations are makin the company to fall apart."
bad,It's a pretty fast-paced job and I learned how to pick up my speed on a lot of things. But as I go on I realize the job is no longer for me. It's no longer worth the pay and I am searching for better opportunities.
bad,The job itself is okay but management is the worst. I don’t recommend working there at all . The store i worked was not sanitary and did not abide by any of the safety and cleaning rules.
bad,"Management was super poor, gave 10-12 hours a week? Lots of favoritism & unfairness VERY unprofessional. Chipotle is a “train yourself” kind of environment since no real training is actually given and then when you “slack” it’s your problem. It’s a joke of a job."
bad,I hate coming to work now. We need to be paid more. Work is so intense.  Managers are ok but they expect so so much out of us. Making minimum wage for this is stupid
bad,"Not only are they constantly going through new employees, but also with management. They absolutely do not know what they are doing. They have discriminated against me with my disability, and then proceed to cut my hours for no given reason? The hardest part of the job is everything. If they weren't so disorganized and tried to care for the employees they would be better. PLEASE do not apply here unless you have no other choice. Honestly its not worth stressing and giving your all for. dont make the same mistake i did."
bad,It was once a great place to work. due to the breakout two years ago its just been about money. As a company should be about but they once cared about their workers but thats not the case anymore. It turned into every other restaurant.
bad,"They are very demanding but would pass you for a promotion even if you been working hard and deserve it . They make promise they know they won’t keep ,make you relocate but when you actually get to the job nothing is organized and don’t even have a schedule for you ."
bad,"The worst job I’ve ever had. They present you with this little book claiming you get 30 minute paid break, opportunities to advance. It’s all a ploy to get you in the door. You get excited thinking you have a chance just to find out it’s not like that. It’s a revolving door. No one stays they either leave or are fired under outrageous circumstances. The management is poor. They think because they are managers they don’t have to work. Won’t help their own employees with a line out the door. They just stay in the back. Unless upper management is around then they’re swarming like bees to put up a show. This place is ridiculous and it’s a joke the standards they expect but won’t and cannot do themselves."
bad,"I mean if you enjoy working your a** off for minimum wage, this job is right for you. this should just be a temporary job for college/high school students. The manager was on our a** to work faster when I'd barely been working there"
bad,"The company is biased.  I worked there for a very long time and was about to become a manager until they fired me under false pretenses.  I filed a lawsuit against Chipotle, for 6 years and lost my case.  The employees I worked with were awesome and friendly, management was just very awful."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"They never have enough people on a shift. You don't get a break even if you work more than 6 hours. The managers don't try to help out but will blame you for not moving fast enough. Managers and employees have relations with each other,"
bad,They lie and as a gm you will work 13 hour days know crew or managers.   Plan on doing everything.   Traing  bad  there is not much.   Pay is not good for what you have to do.
bad,I get stomach aches just thinking about my time spent at this company and nausea thinking about the food. Advancement was a lie and a deceitful tool used to get employees to work harder for a menial wage.
bad,"they want to know reason why this company has such a big over turn. it because they (management) don't respect the people that run their stores and don't even say ""HI"" to there employees when they come in for their shift"
bad,"lack of management skills, poor training, and no opportunities offered. I worked over a year at Chipotle (full time) on the grill and was offered no raise and no opportunities to grow."
bad,Cool for a first job. I wouldn't recommend it to friends but i would recommend it to anyone who needs a job. I liked the face paced environment and all but also the customers love come in 5 minutes before you close so keep that in mind before you apply to this job.
bad,n/a. horrible place to work. management has no respect for their employees and its a fend for yourself enviroment. i would not reccomend working here to anyone
bad,"Too much work expected in too little time. Pay is nowhere near an appropriate compensation, and most of the benefits they provide only apply after you've worked there for a year or more."
bad,"Never work here honestly, you have a biased GM thats gives attitudes with workers as well as customers.  Lack of communication and humanity in that restaurant and I refrain people from applying there at all."
bad,Working at chipotle has changed me a lot i was bullied there and would never5 g back to working at a fast food place i was foreced to do so many tasks that was impossible and that were only given to me and i was only new
bad,"I cleaned the dining area and the dishes, sometimes i was put on the line to serve customers. I wiped down tables, i cleaned the bathroom, restocked forks, knives, spoons and tissue. Washed dishes and made the burritos."
bad,"This was by far the worse place to work. "
bad,"Working ere has been so exhausting, physically, mentally and emotionally draining. Upper management has never worked a day in an actual restaurant, so they make rules that make no sense. All mistakes are treated as attacks on them personally and you get in trouble if you're not made aware of every minuscule rule. Upper management could treat their employees better and give raises and promotions to people who ACTUALLY know what they're doing rather than how ""cute"" the customers or the managers themselves will think they are."
bad,This was my first job and the management asked me to cut corners in my duties and orders. Felt stifled all but a few higher ups and had been told by multiple employees they felt the same way.
bad,The culture has died and the company has turned against itself now the teams are being led through fear and intimidation. The officers have all been replaced with fast food members from Taco Bell and Arby and they are moving the company away from Chipotle's original vision.
bad,Honestly it's hard work but a lot of fun. It's a deal free place to work and they are understanding for the most part. It's super fast paced and can be really stressful.
bad,i will never work there again because it was a hostile work environment if you weren't involved in there little clicks then you had no business being there
bad,"Bad place to work"
bad,I've worked there for a nice chunk of my early 20s and I regret it. The only thing I loved the most is the friendships I've created throughout the years.
bad,"Training is terrible."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,I have been worked at job for 1 year and not have learned anything new due to bad management i didn't really enjoy it because i wanted to learn new things and do more work not just frying and serving people food
bad,I worked for them for awhile. That job was draining my soul and abilities. Working hours are very long as a salary manager. They will officially make you work 10 hours and than you will have to work like 12 hours per day.
bad,This was the worst job i ever had. Not because of the work itself but because of management. I was full time when the old General manager was there then we got a new one. I went from 30+ hrs a week to 15hrs or less a week. And he gave all the new hires all the hours. They messed up my pay and made me wait a month to get the pay i was promised.The other managers dont do any work and they talk down to you like youre less than. Management at chipotle is so corrupt i wouldnt recommend anyone work for this company.
bad,"There was no room for advancement, and for the amount of work expected of each employee, the pay was no where near what I feel to be deserved. Overall did not like the experience"
bad,I honestly hated working at chipotle. the management was extremely inconsiderate and did not care about following schedules. they were very rude and did not care about the status of an employees work ethics.
bad,"Had to be done at certain time even when I started, if not I would loose my job. Breaks weren't given at times, management was unprofessional, and unreasonable"
bad,"Managers at this Corp are terrible and cause a destructive workplace making it impossible to fully do your job. All work is placed on the shoulders of the employees without proper training, and no management to help oversee. Poor service woth little care."
bad,"this place is trash, its super horrible, the people that work there are trash, the portions are ridiculous , the managers never stay for long its always"
bad,"The management is terrible, they constantly would slack off. They don't stress training enough, so people who work there often do not know what they are doing. There is no job security, 4 people got fired within a month, without any warning. One of them was a manager, maybe every other store is different, but the store I worked at was a mess."
bad,Chipotle was a great place to work up until the patch leader made poor decisions with management such as promoting employees who's work ethic was questionable.
bad,"The management at chipotle is the worst management I have worked under, the general manager was cool but once he left my job security was gone, mainly bc one of the managers could not speak English so there for every person she encountered a language barrier with she did not like. Every thing is expected to be done by hand cutting wise you youse your hands for cutting 8 hours a day which can lead to the result of carpal tunnel or worse and that'll lead to the result of having improper cut sizing."
bad,"Extremely poor management, They fired me without giving me any corrective action and even questioned me about my weight. Bad place to work very rude and unprofessional."
bad,"Not worth the stress. They make you take 3 + unpaid days off if you are sick, then say u never show up and then they fire u without even telling you. just awful"
bad,Honestly the worst job of my life. It was a very dramatic and biased place to work. I had terrible hours and no one lasted there more than four months.
bad,They never respected my availability.The managers would make inappropriate comments.I was treated with disrespect on a daily basis.Worst job I have ever had.
bad,"The job description and company's  values are very well written on the paper. But the management is executing it very poorly. The typical day starts dealing with low performing managers. The higher management is collection of unprofessional people who only care about their bounces, not about employees. When the management faces any problem within stores, they just fire the whole store employees and start hiring new team. This is showing how unprofessional approach the management has to the company's values and finances. The management do not give proper training to anyone. Because they do not like to spend time training people. My recommendation is do not even involve with this company. This was the worst place that I had ever worked."
bad,Didn't like it was extremely stressful but maybe it was because of the location. I am not sure how it is at other locations but I was stressed everyday.
bad,"You can never be more then a line worker. Can never move up. Drama all the time. I never got paid enough for all the work i had to do, and on top of that, the managers kept pushing me to quit because I didn't smile all the time. I would always come home so upset. And the way they fire people os very unprofessional First they don't day if you're fired. Then they go and tell the whole crew and laugh about."
bad,"My husband worked here and they fired him for simply telling a customer the truth. A customer asked have you gotten sick from ecoli? He simply replied ""not yet"" boom fired. They always hire new people and fire quicker than they change underwear."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,A day at chipotle would go like this -I would come into work and instantly there's attitude being thrown my way even when I'm being nice. No one respects each other.
bad,"Honestly, after years of giving my time and patience to this company, I was placed in a store that was so strict they would make their employees brush the floor with a toothbrush because it was slow and they needed to maintain their perfect image. Absolute garbage."
bad,From start to finish I hated it. From the way people talked to each other to the way the company puts up a front about caring about their employees. Food was good.
bad,I was let go for have to get my child from school and I informed the managers that I could not work Tuesday Wednesday or Thursday and was scheduled to work wed till 3pm my child gets out of school at 2:30 my manager told me to choose my job or my child
bad,"Being a person of fast paced well organized job experience, working at chipotle was awful. Everyone there cut corners, and didnt do their jobs how they were supposed to be done. I was injured several times on the job there and when i told the managers on duty at the time, they didnt file a report about the incident. they laughed"
bad,"Ghetto, unsanitary, and extremely unorganized.  The workers are all screaming the entire time.  It's just a very unprofessional place to work.  The job is not worth it."
bad,"I worked my way to the top. Sadly me and another manager could not see eye to eye. So I put in my two weeks. I was a very hard worker. I always did my best to show respect, but I never got it myself."
bad,Very stressful job for minimum wage. Management and service can be much better. Expected to train people to perform your job but not compensated. Not hard work just a hard environment to work for.
bad,"I would never recommend this job, EVER! Unless, you want to be rolling burritos for the rest of your life! I worked 15+ hour days everyday, I only had one day off a week and I even sometimes worked that day too! The management were unfair, the employees were unprofessional, the job itself was very stressful, and I was only getting paid $9.00 to work myself to death!"
bad,the management at chipotle was bad. once you made it known you were not trying to make a career out of chipotle your hours were cut and feedback you gave was not taken seriously
bad,"poor management , everybody competes instead of working together, customers are rude, they are dirty, managers lie on employees as well as on other managers, just a big playground for drama."
bad,This is not a good job if you don't have patients I liked working there but the workers and manager had favorite and if u wasn't one then u don't belong
bad,Manager was very mean and condescending mostly because her job was always on the line so she took it out on the employees. I felt they only hired people of latin backgound
bad,"The pay is not worth all the work they make you do. They expect you to run 2 to 3 stations and make you do all extra stuff. Won't work with your schedule, manipulative, they lie and make things look good when big bosses come into town then treat you bad every other day."
bad,"i hated the managers that saw over me. not only did they make me feel uncomfortable, they brushed off my issues like i was just some guy they could replace if they needed to"
bad,"Managers were rude , unprofessional, training was non existant, employees were misreble, no culture, no lunch breaks, hard labor tedious repeated movements of , chopping , cooking etc etc , hard on the body suffured from neck and back pains, on feet all day , just horrible no full time hours, no affordable healthcare."
bad,general manager made me work while I was sick with salmonella. didn't follow state law on anything. the walk in fridge was absolutely horrifying. raw meet was above prepared food.
bad,When I was hired I was poorly trained but given that I am a very fast learner I learned how to get my job done Efficiently but working there I noticed that everyone like to pass the blame down the ladder and nothing gots accomplished
bad,Chipotle is a terrible place to work. Mine specifically is horrible because I was not trained properly and now they aren't scheduling me anymore because they say I'm not capable of working in other areas of the restaraunt even though I was never trained properly. Worst job I've ever had by far.
bad,no one wanted to be there and there would be fights in the back of the store. people would be one there phone all day as we were working. you were aloud to talk how every you wanted to
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"Its very simple. Chipotle will run you into the ground as an employee. After you're burned out, and you're working days on end, they do not care if you are sick or dying. You better come to work. Once you burn out, they replace you like you we rent there to begin with."
bad,When you clock in be prepared for the chaos. It is really fast pace and the space in the kitchen is very close quarters. Everyone has there role to paly weather they are working on the line or working on the grill.
bad,They make you believe that your development is important to them. While they offer much in the way of training you soon find out that you are just a throw away employee that means little to them. The pay is bad and the hours are horrible.
bad,Horrible place to work world never recommend anyone work there they don't pay you all your money they work there workers off the clock and depending where u are they can be very racist.
bad,"Bad Company, the Ecoli crisis was the first blow, the employee/management communication suffered from there on forward. They push people up to the rank of ""GM/AP"" when they are not ready and then scorn them when their store is not ""meeting standards"""
bad,"A lot of labor and cuts. management was rude at my location. Hardest part was not having a team to get through the rush properly."
bad,"I was fired without notification and had to be transferred to another store quickly, because they knew what they'd done was illegal, for my first job at 9.50 an hour I was excited, but was rarely given hours because I was never trained on their strict routines... until my sneaky transfer, terrible company."
bad,"I enjoyed my time at chipotle Signal Hill in the beginning, however, with all the new management and changes, it has become horrible.They do not pay you or give you enough benefits to deal with what management makes you deal with. They are so unprofessional and have broken many labor laws. Making myself and several others quit."
bad,"Horrible place to work. Understaffed, bad management, no breaks, unsafe working conditions. Horrible standards, not upholding what chipotle is supposed to be about."
bad,"Uppity people coming in getting mad at you for whatever reason. Lunch hour is chaotic. you get free lunch but u have to eat it in the restaurant, u are NOT allowed to save it and eat it later or take it home. You have to throw it away even if u only literally took 2 bites!!"
bad,i didn't like it i didn't receive my raise like i was suppose to the business was very unprofessional and they was not organized . and i was suppose to be a full-time employee but yet i worked 30 hours
bad,worked here a long time ago in Texas. glad i left because workers were very rude and so was manager learned cashier. cleaning the bathrooms was one of the hardest part of the job
bad,"Aside from typical retail service, management did not work well with the employees to create a stress-less work environment. Schedules went unfollowed or overbooked, overall more communication was needed."
bad,"i did not work there for a long time, they would fire people left and right without a real good explanation. i learned how to make salsa and make chips and work the line. i would mostly open"
bad,from the managment down to the cleaners were all bias very rude and racist i wont refer a animal to work there it was horrible plus they werent as clean as they clamied to be
bad,The company takes care of there team. The expectation is that you work hard. You leave you personal life at the door. Great work environment. Would go back in a heart beat.
bad,From inexperienced managers to the favoritism that was played when I worked there im shocked that they still have employees that want to work there. The shifts were bad and not well run. I worked there for 11 months and was told many of times that I would start training for a promotion and then it would never progress even though I was training for the position still.
bad,"Typical work days at Chipotle consist of wasting time. Over staffed shifts, filled with lazy, rude, employees standing around doing nothing. No cleaning or other tasks implemented, so 90% of your time is spent standing around waiting for customers. Manager hires staff according to race, & ethnic background, then distributes hours accordingly. Employees have a huge attitude problem, that even when brought to managements attention, is swept under the rug due to favoritism, employees play the race card regularly--a example being when they spoke poorly of me in front my face in Spanish. Hardest part of that job was trying to get alone with the staff/management, as well as receiving proper training & hours. The only mildly enjoyable aspect was the free food."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,hours are horrible. i wouldn't get out of my store till like 12am. whenever someone was sick it would be a lot worse we had to detail clean everything
bad,"they set high standards but don't accomplish them. they don't conplete tasks productively and efficiently like they want others to do , management is terrible"
bad,"Horrible general manager, unprofetional staff and horrible parking. Staff is over worked, underpayed, and treated like dirt. I wold not recomend working here"
bad,"If you love yourself do not work here, trust me you will thank me. There is a reason they have a high burnout rate and always have new employees. Terrible company to work for, not worth it."
bad,"A typical day at Chipotle is walking in and right away serving food to customers. Chipotle allows customers to pick and choose anything they want on their food and this method causes ciaos within the employees and customers. I learned how to time manage and complete multiple tasks at once. The management is terrible and so is the workplace culture. The employees, environment and management is a complete mess. The hardest part of the job was keeping a fast pace and unfortunately there was nothing enjoyable about Chiptole."
bad,"bad and hobblie and nasty and sad “Gave us timely service, exactly what we needed to have ordered, and was completely professional despite a long line of hungry customers and a bustling kitchen.” in 12 reviews"
bad,the pay starts low. but there is potential to get more. but tips are split between all those who are on the clock at the time. the do give you one free meal when you are on the clock
bad,I used to work at chipotle midtown charlotte. they are horrible as managers. they dont know how to manage a store. I feel bad for whoever decides to work here
bad,"I've worked for Chipotle for 2 years, been through countless crew members and 4 General managers. People quite because they are being treated right by management. People get fired over the smallest things. or the managers drive you to quite... they lower your hours, treat you like you live to work but dont understand work isnt life. People work to live! the managers have no respect for workers... and maybe its just my store but i cant take it any longer. i waited to see if the ""chipotle"" culture would come through but every new manager they brought in was one horrible person after another."
bad,"The people were rude, customers and the people I worked with. They overworked everyone and fired everyone I worked with for not being fast enough or something that could easily be fixed, I don't know one person that has worked there and liked it."
bad,Do not like it at all. I don't get paid enough for the effort and work I do. The managers don't respect the employees like they should. The pay should be higher.
bad,"The job was easy, gettting promoted was hard. They always played favorites. I did not like the management team they were always buddy buddy and the crew members often turned on each other as a result to win over the management. Fine first job, not a career."
bad,A typical day working at Chipotle would start off pretty rough with one or two crew members mysteriously calling out sick from work... I learned how to lead a team efficiently and effectively. Management was very up and down during my time there with very little structure. The hardest part was finding a balance between caring for the team and caring for the well being of the storm. The most enjoyable part of working there was the satisfying feeling you get when watching the crew members that you had trained being promoted.
bad,I worked at chipotle for about two months and it was not a good experience at all. From the time I got there I was just thrown on the job and scolded for doing things incorrectly when I was clearly not trained well enough. Most of the managers were rude and unwilling to help. One of the managers was almost always getting into altercations with the customers and it was very embarrassing to even be seen working there.
bad,"A typical day at work consists of thousands of customers coming through the doors and my job is to provide an excellent guest experience and work with high standards. I learned how to cook, prepare, and serve food. The hardest part of the job would be the getting out so late at night and the environment isn't the best. There is a lot of hostility.They expect a lot of you and pay you very little."
bad,They are very cliquey so if you are not the management's best friend you are going no where even though you might be the most qualified for a promotion.
bad,I dont like the way chipotle treats its workers. A typical day is very busy. Working there I learned a lot of time management though. Management was hypocritical.
bad,"They never work with your availability, if your a college student this is a bad job for you. You're always being threatened that you will be fired if you speak up about things being done wrongly (even though they tell you to speak up). They over work you and the managers are always on their phones."
bad,"They dont go with your school schdule. Some of the crew members are nice and also some of the management. They dont train you at all and they expect you to learn on your own,"
bad,Worked for them for two yrs too many chiefs not enough cooks they want you learn and do every thing in the store too many shift changes all around for all employees fast turn around job they tell you to do one job rushing the heck out of you then pull you to do some thing else right in the middle of doing what they were rushing you to do in the first place stressful place to work insurance is terrible have to work week ends and holidays.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,Chipotle Mexican Grill was a fun environment fast pace wonderful and great environment to learn new different ways to cook and I would recommend Chipotle to the youth
bad,I personally had a bad experience with this company. I was fired after letting the management know I was pregnant and never received my final paycheck due to lack of effort on managements side.
bad,They are very nice at first till you cant keep up and that happens in a week! Very aggressive program with a promise to management which is very hard or mostly impossible to reach. within a month you realize what a horrible program and execution of that program. To much to do and not enough people to get it done. If you want super stressful environment that if you get upset your on the chopping block job wise this is for you.
bad,"worked there twice, food was over rated, its precooked steak now like come on. and the hours and pay for all they require is crazy"
bad,"I worked at the chipotle in Stuyvesant Plaza in Albany NY & Green Acres Mall Valley Stream NY. Chipotle is honest about its food policies but they started to get out of hand with the food safety policies after the Ecoli outbreak. It's sad I started out with $9.75 and after a year I received a five cent raise which is disrespectful. I only stayed there for a year thinking I would receive the Tuition Reimbursement, justto find out after a YEAR and SIX MONTHS i was not eligible for any refund money at all. They use EVERY COLLEGE STUDENT EMPLOYEE and they don't even realize.  As a succesful company like chipotle the employees deserve wayyyyy more than what they make and it sad because we settle. But as college students we should have went on a strike or protest against the exploitation. You got people in there that take the job too serious like all the older people that have been there for years. I HATE THE CIGARETTE SMOKING POLICY WHY DO THEY GET A BREAK ALMOST EVERY HOUR... a chance to sit down relax and smoke a cigarette... what ifi wanted to just take a break relax and check my phone ... NOOOO you get in trouble. Coming into work things change EVERY DAY! The line in Stuyvesant plaza wraps around the store and ur boss expects everyone to get the line throughin a short period of time. Megan Who is one of the bosses has a very disgusting attitude! She treats employees with no respect. EVERYONE HAS COMPLAINED ABOUT HER AND TARA DOES NOTHING nor does Kyle. She has been there for a long time and with all the complaints doesn't manage to get fired or demoted. The green acres chipotle"
bad,Management was quick to judge and be angry about small things and not willing to teach. Crew members were in cliques and made me feel very left out. Management didn't care to follow specific recipes and told us to do things their way instead of by the book and when higher ups would come in and catch someone doing it not by the books management would act like they had no idea it was going on and let employees take the fall often times resulting in getting fired. A harassment complaint was made against one of the managers and nothing was done about it.
bad,"Long hours, I was in management and my managers were in the business of terrifying everyone who was no in their clique.  Not a supportive environment and everyone worried about losing their jobs all the time.  Horrible place to work."
bad,i work almost 100 hours every two weeks which was ok because i was hands on and the management i  had work with was very hands on about everything so it was cool.
bad,Don't get suckered into their culture. If you are a natural born leader with ambition then look for a job that will cherish that. The job requires you to work split shifts that will be inconvenient to your income and time. It's the pyramid scheme of fast food.
bad,"I had a lot of fun working at chipotle but that was the problem, there was no productivity. All of the managers were people i went to high school with and they all acted like they didn't know what they were doing. it took an entire month for my application to go through because they forgot i applied and deleted my application. They define the word unprofessional"
bad,"Good honest hard work isn't rewarded at Chipotle, sucking up and playing favorites is the only skills you need to move up in the company."
bad,"The demand and workplace was the least of my worries. I thrive in high energy enviroments. The staff was horribly crude to me, they push the idea of bettering eachother by positive enforcement and encouragement but any good energy the give you they quickly take away with insults and harassment. Also was over worked many times off the clock and told to keep quiet about it. Employees were not trained properly including myself and were held accountable for our mistakes despite our training. Also people were promoted without being ready due to favoritism and wanting more money."
bad,Chipotle was not a pleasant place to work at in my opinion. None of my co workers were welcoming or helpful to me at all and i felt lost the whole time. I would not recommend working at Chipotle.
bad,"Working at chipotle was like working at a sweat shop, they would work the crew long hours and if any of the crew asked for a break they would be met with lies about the labor laws of my state and when the crew member persisted on taking a break the management would berate them with harsh comments about being lazy and how the crew member didn't deserve to have a break because of their work ethic. Chipotle is a company that claims to be the savior of fast food but really all it is, is that a company that has many high horses and has no touch with the ground."
bad,"really good company, if you ever get the chance to be a part it, you should! you really wont be disappointed. The company has a great vision, and is on a mission to change how people eat and think about fast food. definitely a fast casual success."
bad,The work environment is fair.  The management is satisfactory.  The co-workers are fine.  The hardest part of the job is the immense amounts of multi-tasking.  The most enjoyable part of the job is payday.
bad,"I had to make the salsa from 7:30 am-10am on my second week.  Even though I felt that I was accomplishing my goals I would always finish by 10:30am and would not be able to take my break when everyone else did before the store opened.  We were supposed to get a 30 minute paid break, but because I finished late I was ""punished"" and only got to eat for 10-15 minutes.  Also, coworkers were drinking and doing drugs on the job so I left because it was an unhealthy working environment.  "
bad,Helped create a team of top performers who empower to achieve high standards. Lead through empowerment. Started as crew and worked my way up to Service Manager in 5months
bad,"I worked at Chipotle for about 2 months, thinking I was going to be given the opportunity have a great job, when in fact where I worked in Murfreesboro, my management team sucked, I was supposed to be given 40+ hours a week at $9.25 an hour and they only gave me 12-17 hours a week. I would ask and ask, time and time again to get more hours and they said they would and didn't. They never made an effort for me to want to work hard, when in fact I was working my butt off. I was also tired of the favoritism amongst the Management those who worked more than I did a lot of the time it was female employees kissing the assistant managers butt and they got whatever they wanted."
bad,"The people who work here arent inspired by the vision of chipotle. They do not follow safety procedures of chipotle, managers arent empowering, the room for advancement. They think theyre a great store but nope."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"Management at Chipotle on Westover is some of the worst team leadership I have ever seen, not to mention the unprofessionalism of the Apprentice and Restaurantuer."
bad,"Both the GM and the Apprentice (the second in command at the store) are overbearing and terrible at their jobs.  I loved that job in every aspect except for the management.  The schedule was very commonly made outside of ones availability (the GM hadn't learned to write a schedule until about two to three months ago) and whenever it was brought to managements attention they generally would tell that employee to fix it because it was their job to find someone to cover their shifts, despite it being a managerial mistake. Advancement at that store is a joke, I worked there for 8 months and saw one person move from crew to management, and that was in my first month. Typical promotions for crew at any other store vary from 3-6 months if one is serious about their job and shows promise. "
bad,"The amount of work you do for the amount you are being paid doesn't work out. There is a lot of work to do for all positions , but they sometimes make new hires do the majority of the work load."
bad,"These managers do no investigations on the work or improvement of workers aiming to do their best. It seemed the more the males oriented into the structure acquired bettering themselves through empowerment , the more the one holding position kept the foot on their necks. This company seemed only interested in elevating women of Spanish descent or similar."
bad,"I left my industry to pursue a position with chipotle, upon being hired, I was offered 35hrs of work a week, at my second week, i was given 2 days of work, at which point I decided to search for a real job, in a real company with real opportunities."
bad,Working at Chipotle can't turn into a career for most people. It's a good temporary job but you are overworked and not paid enough for what the job requires.
bad,It was a very unorganized environment where almost every worker was afraid to lose their job at any moment. It also didn't help that the management didn't act as managers should. Instead they cliqued up with many of the crew members and showed favoritism.
bad,"What Chipotle WAS, and what Chipotle is NOW, are on opposite sides of the spectrum.  The ""culture"" they rave about, no longer exists.  The company cares about one thing, and one thing only these days.  And that's MONEY.  If you visit Chipotle for lunch or dinner, you'll find it painfully obvious how much the employees don't care about their restaurant.  No passion.  No drive.  No care.  Very little customer service, if any.  And you'll be lucky to find a table that doesn't have garbage from the previous occupants.  I loved working for Chipotle...THEN.  But once they became a publicly traded company, money became their top priority and they've never looked back.  As my summary states, free Chipotle is NOT worth employment."
bad,"Upon arrival on second shift I would have to pick up slack of 1st shift employees, thus setting me back on my shift and causing me to be overwhelmed on a daily basis."
bad,Employees do not wash their hands and are very rude. They do not care about any personal issues going on. They give full time hours with out full time benifits. The co-workers are very prejudice.
bad,Required too much for little pay. Customers are very rude. jdijfeownfkjdbfjhbfvilweubd ghewbdkweh vcuwej Management is untrained and doesnt know what their doing.
bad,Poor management for example arriving late which a crew member has to wait outside for them to arrive to open the store this is what causes for a crew member to lose his/ her chance to go on brake cause of there tardiness.
bad,"horrible experience. short breaks and long hours, not leaving til 12/1 in the morning when u are scheduled to close at 10. just horrible."
bad,I would not recommend working for this company. Hours were not satisfactory nor would they want to work with you and give you a chance to grow with the company.
bad,"No life/balance."
bad,not bad I enjoyed it for the most part it was ok for the most part I had fun for the most part. but for the most part it was the most park
bad,"Not great at all. managments demands to much, over works you, the poeple and culture it brings are great but managament is very unprofessional."
bad,I enjoyed my family crew and customers. Chipotle has better food options. I do not approve of certain management. The hardest part will be leaving my customers and crew. I enjoyed the fast pace and good food.
bad,"A basic day at Chipotle involves customer service, patience, maintaining organization in a timely matter. The job its self is not difficult for the most part prepping is extremely easy because your provided with measurements to make the food. Management is horrible when working with student."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,I did not like Chipotle. It was a hard place to advance lots of empty promises. Staff was hard to work with a lot of favoritism a lot of changing managers.
bad,working for chipotle was so alsome i loved being there working. the culture was fun to learn working with diffrent people was fun learning diffrent foods an drinks an how to be a better custumer server.That was my first job i was there two years.
bad,"coming to chipotle i had no idea of the culture and environment that i would experience. they made me feel like family and showed me there was more to chipotle than i knew. i learned how to stay patient, and work under pressure."
bad,"chipotle is a horrible place to work at, you can show up to work and maybe an hour after you clock in they send you home they promise you all these hours but never give you them. They never keep their word on anything"
bad,This job was fun because the people I worked with nade it very enjoyable but this is not my cup o tea. This place is busy all the time!! Very little time for down time and very little room for mistakes
bad,"My first clue on how bad this place was ( Vero Beach Florida) was the fact they hold job fairs every Tuesday. What small business has job fairs every week? One that fires and hires and has enormous turnover. That's what this place is about. They are rude, insensitive, provide little to no training and support, and if your don't do everything perfect, with little or no training, you are fired instantly. They do give pretty good hours for fast food, but I personally know several people who were fired with no prior warnings, no feedback, just they weren't fast enough, or scooped too much meat in a bowl. It's the most bizarre work culture I have ever seen, and I have worked at several fast food restaurants and never have I witnessed such poor management. It may seem great on paper, but don't drink the Kool-Aid. This place is toxic."
bad,Start by prepping and cooking food for the day. Serving the food to the customers. Sometimes it would be hard to keep up the flow when we had a lot of people.
bad,The company lacks in people culture the tend to keep drug addicted personalities in the workplace.
bad,The company is unorganized and the managers are horrible to say the least. Workers are slaved and sometimes don't even receive a break after working eight hours straight. After working there for two straight years I would never recommend this job. Chipotle only cares about CHIPOTLE.
bad,"ive learned to work hard,train new employees and have a positive attitude and oulook on everything."
bad,"exploitation of felons, immigrants and illegals. promise promotion and follow through only for favor rather than merit"
bad,"Assisted cooks in preparation and service of various foods in assigned work situations including pantry items, and with pre preparation of ingredients for entrees."
bad,It was an okay job but i didnt like it becuase i didnt recieve any training at all so the only thing i new was to clean the lobby
bad,"Not a nice place to work if you want to work drama free. Management is influenced by crew, not a happy place to work at"
bad,I managed the whole shift and motivated my crew trained and inspired gave excellent customer service and coached many new employees
bad,great and fun time with my team and i like them and hope to find another job with my goal
bad,the most enjoyable part about working with chipotle was assistanting customers. I would offer them to try diffeent meats and toppings on their food.
bad,"BAD MANAGMENT! She screamed atme for EVERYTHING. I was only there for 4 or 5 months because i DREEADED going into work.. It was TERRIBLE. I went to work for 6 hours 5 times a week and HATED it becasue the entire time I was getting yelled at for everything. RUN, CLEAN, SERVE, SMILE, RUSH, SLOW DOWN, ROLL THE BURRITO BETTER! TALK, DON'T TALK. LAUGH. QUITE. OMG SHUT UP!!!!! PLEASE!! "
bad,A place where you will work and work and they will give horrible work criticism. Management is inexperienced and have no sense of urgency. Co-workers are unfriendly and use derogatory comments and belittles others. The worst part of the job is that some co-workers would actually served raw chicken.
bad,I did not like working here at all. Simply because i was black and all the team member would only speak spanish. I didnt understand that and i had a hard time there so i had to quit.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"I got fired due to a drop of salsa, no bigger than a dime, on a table that was OUTSIDE! And when a manager gave me the heads up that i was going to get fired, I called the General Manager to confirm and he told me that that Manager was a no good liar and told me there was nothing to worry about and when I came in the next day, he had a diffrent manager fire me! He didnt even have to guts to do it himself! And still to this day if I walk into that resturant, the second he sees me, he quickly ducks off to the back or leaves..."
bad,be ready to sweat. free meal. with throw you under the bus in a second to advance.
bad,"they had too high of standards for people to meet, the staff werent that great of people"
bad,"honestly I hate it here!!!! the hours suck, I work 8 hrs a week sometimes a little more depends. they work you like a dog. There super strict with everything! Chipotle asks for to much I feel like they should be paying the crew members double for all there work we do! But the thing I hate the most are there hours. All the managers get at least 47 hours(I counted) we have 5 managers so the crew members like me get sucky hours. The line has to always be cleaned at least 50x times a day. Floors swept constantly and God forbid you serve someone a little extra meat! They are so strict about proportions when I first started we were able to serve people 2 scoops of rice now they get a mini scoop of rice and we charge them extra for more. The burritos are getting smaller and smaller! The only good thing there was the free food THATS ALL! managers are lazy and always preach about being a top performer with high standers and being empowered towards others but they don't even do that themselves!"
bad,"I am astounded by the amount of unprofessionalism there is at this company. I would rather work at mcdonalds. The only reason they're still in business is because they try to brainwash you into their cult-like team. Don't drink the koolaid!"
bad,"I applied to chipotle through indeed because I am a single mom on welfare and I was required to do so by the state ,I started working in October 2012 and was only employed until January  29th 2013,i was terminated on the spot with no verbal or written warnings.......I was one of the only white girls there and the only one that couldn't speak a lick of Spanish.....I honestly feel like I have been discriminated against"
bad,"I worked here for about 8 months and at first I liked it. When I first started there was a girl general manger and she was a complete idiot. Everyone got away with whatever they wanted bc she was so dense. She quickly got fired after I started and then a male general manger was hired. At first he was really polite and helpful. Then he quickly became a nightmare. He made fun of everyone behind their backs and constantly gossiped with the other managers. He once told me that one of the other female co-workers looked like Freddy Krueger as if that's okay to say in front of me? He was constantly bragging about how much money he made and about the free toyota prius he drove as a company car. He offered me a position as a kitchen manager but I declined. He then asked me to join him and other male co-workers to go to bars ( I was the only female invited) with him a couple times after work. I politely declined bc I thought it was inappropriate. After that he constantly harassed me and everyday at work was hell. He would come in and say hello to everyone except me, if I needed help with an angry employee he would literally ignore me and not speak to me. One of the assistant managers constantly made inappropriate jokes in front of everyone and the general manager encouraged it. The same assistant manager had 2 DUI's and didn't own a car. He used my car every day to take bank deposits and I was to scared to tell him no bc I thought he would get me fired somehow. The job load was ridiculous. I had to get there around 7am (even tho I was scheduled at 8am) just to get my work done. I had"
bad,the job is a fast pace environment. there are standards that an employee must meet otherwise they will let you go.
bad,"During a typical day, I walk in and it a complete DISASTER!! I have to hurry to clock in, ( which is always thirty minutes prior to my shift ) in order to help with shift change. This constant back up took a major toll on my health and education, but I put up with it because as a full time student, I needed the money. Despite it all, my co-workers we great and very easy to communicate and talk to if there was a problem that needed to be addressed. The downfall was that my co-workers were not as hard working and dedicated as I was. I constantly had to pick up their slack at the end of the night because I wanted the morning shift to have a much more smoother opening/set up than what I and the night team had received. Overall, there was an extreme lack of communication amongst crew and management and I feel that it needs to be addressed soon before the restaurant fails."
bad,a typical work day i came in and started preping salads and dips etc.
bad,"Horrible place to work at, they are rude and treat you really bad for everything you do for them"
bad,you'll get treated very bad there by management and the expertations there are extremely unreasonable.
bad,"I can't say enough bad things about this company, they wrongfully terminated me under the american disabilities act."
bad,Always short staffed. They want one person to do the work of three people. You are suppose to have 11 people each shift and you are lucky to have four.Can't find any way to contact corporate it you ever need to.
bad,"At first this was an amazing opportunity for me. I was hired in off of the street and given a substantial wage increase from my previous job. I was really happy to be there. They also helped me work around my school schedule and lack of car. It was this way until I started having problems with two, dating, long term employees. When they started bullying me in the workplace things shifted very quickly and it became a horrible work place."
bad,"Its hard work and its under paid, there is room for promotions but depends on who you know or if the higher ups like you, all they care about is the money the customer brings in so suck it up and smile."
bad,Not a good environment to work in. Long hours and severely understaffed every day. Management care mostly about the store and not the employees. Wouldn’t recommend working here
bad,"no work life balance"
bad,"Management Terrible"
bad,"They’ll have you learn everything, even though some other workers have very little experience(so you can pick up they’re slack). Managers will let it be known that you’re easily replaceable giving the employee no type of job security. They’ll over work you and not increase pay or give more hours."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,My days consisted of dealing with rude customers and no support from team members.At times I'd be left alone when I'd just began working.Completely alone to handle the whole line of food and line of people.Managements expectations for me were excessive and had favoritism towards other employees.
bad,"Working at chipotle as a manager is a horror story. The higher ups only care about themselves. We were not allowed OT or any functioning equipment because they didn’t want to pay for it. They only focused on the things you did wrong, rather than encouraging you and complimenting what you did right. If you call in sick, get ready to be threatened to be fired. They threatened to fire me and another manager because we couldn’t come in on our days off. Also for not replying to the GM’s text message in a few minutes. The GM never followed the rules, kept food when it should have been thrown away, made people  go in sick, made people lie about being sick, etc. They expect you to give your soul to chipotle. Don’t work here."
bad,"They care nothing about their employees. It’s all about the numbers to them. They can’t keep employees and hire teenagers as managers. They spend so much money on outside companies coming into make sure we’re no longer serving food that makes people sick, but pay their employees nothing."
bad,"Unprofessional executive leadership . They manage through a culture of fear and intimidation . Since their last Food Safety issue , they care nothing about people. There is no culture . You are just a robot and not important , and executive leadership tells you that frequently . I have never seen such unprofessionalism in my entire career . Executive leadership is sneaky , vindictive and not qualified to lead others. Only positive thing was great health insurance. Other then that , an utter nightmare"
bad,The company makes you drink the kool-aide to make you think it's a great place to work but it's really not that great. It's demanding work for not enough but they make you think it's a great place because they pay above minimum wage. Once I got a really bad burn and let my manager know. He didn't let me leave to go to a urgent care because we were short staffed. I didn't want to lose my steady paycheck so I stayed and worked the whole day. This place is terrible to work. The company doesn't care about you.
bad,"if your thinking about  applying to chipotle STOP the chipotle on baltimore pike is not for you stay away do not apply. the other employees are wonderful and great but the general manager TG is not. if you want felxable hours go to another one stay away from this one!!!!! can not stress enough!!!! the GM is terribile at their job. they put down their employees and do not treat them fairly!!! "
bad,The actual job wasn't bad but I didn't think management did a good job. I also don't like some of their policies and the way that they run things at times.
bad,"I was a former employee at chipotle Mexican grill, and the management was terrible, and corporate never did a thing about the things that were reported. it's hard to advance at this job, especially when the manager laughs in your face when a manager position is mentioned. Save your time and mental health and work somewhere else."
bad,GM was insensitive and refused to work with my school schedule (college student). My hours dropped from 20+ hrs a week to 5 hrs in 3 weeks after I told one of the assistant managers the kitchen manager was harassing me.
bad,The day I was hired I felt awesome based on what I was promised. That soon changed from me going to NJ for training to me having to drive two hours each way from New Haven to Greenwich  CT daily without any compensation for mileage. The location where I trained was ran by a mediocre general manager who wasn't there enough to train me. I'm very proficient in operating a restaurant all I needed was operations training on their systems and I was golden but being left fend for myself was a horrible experience
bad,"Chipotle is a trash fire. Managers pool in the office to gossip and trash talk workers, even just sitting in the office and playing video games. Managers are always making the next guy do the work, managers will make crew carry the shifts day after day. Miserable place to work. Zero manager communications paired with micro managing and threatening people’s jobs. The pay is next to nothing and career advancement is an idea not worthy of any dignified future."
bad,If they got rid of the management crew that is there now maybe it’ll be a better place to work. The GM got bad reviews just about everyday since she got there. And she’s rude and very inappropriate.
bad,I worked here and I was there for 2 weeks and the manager was sexully to me I report he left and told me go home they will call me and they never did 3 weeks later I finely talked to someone and they quite me and did not give me last check. They put on my leave papers I did not show for work but they told me to leave they will call me
bad,"The work is fast paced and difficult. Management is often understaffed and underpaid, which doesn't motivate them to make the shifts any better for the crew members. The Corporate management is often unrealistic in their expectations of the crew and have no kitchen experience. There are better ways to make minimum wage!!"
bad,"in my experiences Chipotle is a company with a lot of opportunity and a great mission stand-point but has an employment market that is governed by forces that create unequal, discriminatory, and biased practices.  For some the compensation can be great but for most the culture in the northeast is unfavorable due to unethical promoting practices."
bad,The managers pick favorites. It is blatantly obvious. If they do not like you they will talk about you behind your back. Employees talk about each other.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"The worst job I have ever worked!!! The manager show a lot of favoritism. They are very judgmental but, claim they are so positive and understanding. The managers at the Flint location is not even fit to be managers. They don't even know how to be professional or not to get so flustered when we get a bum rush of people!! Most of the managers are rude especially to the blacks. They are understaffed and they don't even know how to treat the new workers that come in. A lot of people have up and quit. They ALL gossip about each other like little high schoolers. But, claim they are drama free and so positive. I do not recommend this job for no one. The way they treat the new people that come in they just expect you to do all the work. A lot of them are lazy and complain how they don't like they job. They show a lot of FAVORITISM!!! So watch who you associate with because if that person don't like you they will try to get you fired. The managers will go off what their favorites say."
bad,"Chipotle was my first job. I enjoyed the first couple months, but then it went downhill. I had to work 40 hour weeks (which is technically a full time job; mind you, I was 16 at the time) while being a minor because the schedule was a mess. One time, I had to work 14 hours straight with NO BREAK. Another time I had to stay for closing till 1 a.m. in the morning, they forced me to work off the clock. This Chipotle that I was at broke so many laws it's crazy. I could sue them for all the unfit conditions they had going on there, except it's a little late for that. Make sure that your location has a good crew and good working environment if you are looking to apply. Make sure there's not too much drama. There were tons of unjustifiable terminations (thanks those greeeaat managers) and tons of petty drama. The part I miss most about Chipotle is getting the free meals on shifts and discounts!!! But even that wasn't worth me spending another minute there."
bad,"It was a fun and fast paced work environment at first, but the mangers would throw you under the bus to save themselves from getting in trouble. they were very lazy as well as deceitful. Some of crew members that I worked with weren't very friendly. Also the location that I worked at they went through a lot of employees mostly because people quit and I don't blame them."
bad,"This job was not the most pleasing job in my opinion and no disrespect to the other locations but the location I worked at was absolutely unprofessional. I learned that everything isnt what it seems on the outside. Management was horrid, I've witnessed  managers say things about the people who would come in for interviews. Extreme stereotyping in one instance a employee called the corperate office after one shift to report the stores managers for disrespect. This store would disrespect customers and much more. The hardest part of this job would be remaining sane. the best part would be the free food."
bad,"When I first started working here, I had high hopes. They pushed their ""restaurateur"" gimmick on everyone (and still do to this day), and made it seem like as long as you work hard, you'll be recognized and promoted. So when I first started working there, I had my eye on becoming a kitchen manager. I was pretty motivated. Training was fun, I got to do things I've never done before at a job. Putting salsas together, mashing avocados, working on the line, it was awesome."

bad,"A typical day of a Chipotle worker turns into what could be a possible day and night. Often, you will work doubles. I learned plenty of important things while working there, mainly life lessons. The management throughout my two and a half years was horrible. It was very disorganized and changed rapidly. There was always some sort of gossip within the coworkers up until my last few months. The hardest part of the job was trying to impress your managers when they expected ""top performers"" however every time they would write in your development journals, they wrote like kindergartners. Most enjoyable part was the free food."
bad,"Company is poorly run. They promote from within. Which is great in theory. In reality they recruit young kids into the management program, give them a set of keys and leave them to fail with poor training and leadership."
bad,"First store was great to work at but the second store was a joke from the RM down to the shift leader. A racially biased environment for non-spanish speakers, no raises or chance for moving up if you weren't mexican"
bad,"I learned a lot of skills that now equip me to do the job that I have now— my food handling, customer service and teamwork skills. In that sense, I am glad I had the opportunity to work there. The management; however, created a very bad work environment. They did not uphold their own policies and expected workers to do the jobs they were not trained to do."
bad,I wouldn’t recommend it to anyone even my worst enemy. The managers played favorites and they cut your hours if they didn’t like you. They legit told me that I was a stand in
bad,"We were always under staffed and over worked. The training was rushed and incomplete. The manager turn over rate is ridiculous. The crew members are allowed to call out for almost any reason, leaving you to work multiple positions while being pressured to complete daily management duties. This job wasn't enjoyable at all."
bad,"They pride themselves on being a company of growth opportunities, I was there for 7 months and still performing a new hires tasks. It seems to be easier to keep a person stuck on one task and let them get really good at it and become your mule than to allow them to be cross trained and have the opportunity to grow as an individual. Chipotle is a selfish company. By the end of your shift there is an odor that has settled deep in to your clothing.  Employees are overworked and extremely under paid. Not worth the mental ware fare."
bad,There is little to no job security there. Some weeks you have only 4-12 hours and schedules for the week go out Sunday night (sometimes very late) and it’s difficult to communicate with management. Unfriendly environment resembles a high school favoritism shown to Hispanic employees.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"When I first started working at Chipotle it was really fun and I was happy to work there, after a couple months we had a change in management. At first everything was normal, then the new manager stopped scheduling people and started hiring new employees that had no idea what they were doing but refused to properly train them. The new manager started changing company policies and rearranging the store without telling anyone. I would not recommend working at the Petaluma Chipotle until they get new managemnet."
bad,"Highly stressful,underpaid,they r users,they use u when they need and dont even let u work scheduled hours when business slows down,nothing but use u to their advantage"
bad,Terrible management they never have enough people cause they’re disrespectful they want to work you without a break and they talk to u like ur just trash
bad,Good place to get thrown into a kitchen and show what you can do. They teach you about food safety but some seldom hold onto that knowledge. I have acid reflux and was trying to save money by eating there; and getting food that wouldn't upset my stomach to much. Had a few incidents where I puked due my stomach acting up. Manager wrote me up and was telling me it was due to me drinking. I informed him of how I have numerous people who will attest that I wasn't drinking and seldom had a beer. Later down the road my Aunt had passed away of whom I was close with. I wasn't given time to grieve and simply couldn't make it to work and seeked medical assistance. Came into work the next day and was informed by a new manager that I had been terminated. She was unaware of why and I left without any answers.
bad,"Coworkers were alright besides general manager always posted schedules late in the weekend sometimes at 230 in the morning everyone had different pay you never got the hours you wanted i would get told to go to another location if i wanted more hours, then get scheduled almost 40 hours from 19 a week, then the next week get 15"
bad,When i worked (grand opening and a few months after) since we were understaffed the environment was slave like. we had to pick up many tasks that couldn't be satisfied and employees would be punished by getting breaks taken away from them and having to swallow down there food when it was slow or starve until after the shift was over. Management was okay until it came to the General Manger who was brand new and lacked experience. He didn't even know how to fill out proper accident reports and workers comp.
bad,"Just another fast food hole where managers do nothing, and yell at the only people doing any work at all, and blame them for their own failings. If you want to run around like a chicken without a head while someone stands in a corner and does nothing but yell about how her tasks are behind schedule, this is the place for you."
bad,"The manager was recently promoted from a prep chef. So she had little to no experience when it came to management skills. She was putting high schoolers at the time on the schedule for shifts from 15:00 until 00:00, which was already breaking child labor laws. All of my coworkers at the time, were awfully rude & the management did nothing to prevent future altercations."
bad,Management doesn't care about their employees. Horrible turn around rate. Constantly getting beaton down and lied to by management... Do not recommend working here
bad,When they do you wrong they all cover for each other.  They over work you and under pay you. Treat you as if your disposable. Don’t value employees that work hard.
bad,The mangers are the worst. They don’t give a care about you or anyone else for that matter. I would not suggest working here. People don’t stay here long anyways
bad,Management only acts as if they care when corporate come around. They hire a lot of people who don’t care about the culinary arts therefore a lot of safety and sanitation issues arise especially at the store in North Hills Raleigh North Carolina.
bad,I worked at the one in Bridgeport CT and the management is all young people who have now idea how to run the place they contradict what they teach you they want the cook to work as such a fast pace put don't want to pay them nothing the person at the register was getting paid more then I was . When it comes time to take your break and so done covers you  that person never does anything so you fall very behind. At night cleaning the grill they never had proper safety equipment to protect you hands from hot grill the gloves they had always had holes in them which will lead to burns. I'm not saying this about all Chipotles but this is what I experienced at the one in Bridgeport CT
bad,"My manager was just all over the place. Always short staffed with lines to the door, prep work would still be finishing up after we had already opened. I don’t recommend working here"
bad,Mangers goofed around. Dork feel welcome at all. They were young and liberal. So their work ethic was —-    I I wouldn’t ever go back unless I had to be cause if th
bad,"It is not a hard job by any means. Although it does get busy and stays busy, so that can be stressful. There is no training, at least for my location, they just throw you to the wolves. Everyone liked to play ""boss"" even though they all did the wrong thing and tried to blame it on the new people. The managers had no idea how they wanted things done, would say to call stuff out at 7 servings but wouldn't get you the new food if you did. When it came to closing they punished you for finishing last by making you stay late instead of getting whoever finished first to help with the tasks. Some people wouldn't leave til 2 AM when the store closes at 10 PM. It was so poorly ran and it showed. Also co-workers would get all upset if you had to ask for help. Everyone hated it there and no one was ever in a good mood."
bad,Managers play Viedo games on phone. I’ve seen    Untastefull. Viedosn on thier phones passing buy them. They they yell because we don’t have everything ready to open.  Place could be cleaner   Employeees who work deserve more pay and benefits     Start. By cutting hours from employees who miss without good cause.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,Management was terrible. Don't recomend working there one bit
bad,"From the day that I started, people already did not like me because I had to be trained. I was treated like I was incompetent and was pushed to the side. I was promised eight hour shifts but only if I picked up other people's shifts, not if I did a good job. I did not have a GM while working there which made it even more confusing. I have had a shift manager call me multiple times to interrogate me on the whereabouts of a coworker which was totally unprofessional. Would not recommend... The food is great though."
bad,"The first two years I worked at this location everything was good we had constant sales with the general manager on duty and the store was hitting it's all time max. As soon as the field manager changed the general manager of the store to whom at the time was the apprentice of the store, the store has hit it's Rick bottom. People who were working up to a higher position got completely cut off including hours, benefits, and all together thrown out."
bad,"Managers are unprofessional. "
bad,Not a very good place to work unless you are in need in a job right away.Store depends on the management.The experience of the fast pace and fast food you will get is the only benefit.
bad,"The training is too short, compressed and they force you to take positions that you are not prepared for just to fill them. I had 4 different bosses in 5 months and none of them were supportive or helpful in anyway. The job is demanding and there is no work life balance. They pay you for 50 hours a week salary but in reality expect you to work an extra 20-30 for free, ""whatever it takes"". They make endless promises that are never seen to fruition. I would not recommend this company to anyone."
bad,It was a great company until they vot a new ceo. Bad management. Saw so many talented workers leave. Manager won't let you take break when store opens. You will have to have all your work complete before opening and your break is included with that time. If you fail to do so then no break.
bad,"do not work at chipotle. they will have no regard for your life or daily needs.  You will get burned from the grill, bruised from all the heavy lifting. You do so much physical work and the pay is not worth it. The job is full of stress and after a month you will want to quit. don't do it to yourself."
bad,"Terrible job if this is your first. On your feet 24/7 with a goal of getting a break everyday. Terrible management when all they do is stay in the office and only rarely come out to prepare one customers bowl or seldomly cut an ingredient. Was working here for over 6 months getting paid 9.15$ an hour with past job experience, to only hear that new hires are starting at 9.25$ an hour. While i started with 9.00$ with past job experience."
bad,Newer workers get paid more than older ones. Every position is paid the same even tho some are harder than others. The mangers favorite employes got hired before the older ones.
bad,"Majority of the general managers and the field leader of Reno do not know how to keep a professional relationship or how separate work life and personal life. Most of the management team has quit do to the work load, treatment, stress, and lack of personal life."
bad,It's a stressful environment that asks you to do a lot for little pay. In the end I wouldn't recommend anyone to work here might as well look elsewhere.
bad,Don't waste your time the corporation only wants as much money as possible and will take away from its employees rather than take a 10000 hit of their own.
bad,Walked out due to childish behavior. Manager basically had a tantrum in front of customer. Snatched bowl from my hand and was talking down to employees. Nothing is worse....
bad,Bad work environment and no one cares about the employees.  Management is young and inexperienced and have no education on how to manage people.  The pay is good.  They make you take your break right when you start your shift and then you get no other break during your shift.
bad,No matter how hard I worked and what I did right I was never praised for it but only looked down upon (for unknown reasons) as long as I ignored the other staff's extremely rude comments I could have a good work day.. But the rudeness was beyond belief...I will never work at a place like this again where they play favoritism and ignore my genuine regard for thing to learn and Excel!!!!
bad,"I did 5 people's worth of work, and was told I wasn't working hard enough or fast enough. I literally worked so hard, and moved so fast, that I dislocated my shoulder WIPING TABLES in the dining room!"
bad,This environment is very fast paced alot to learn about their culture. Long hours on your feet. If you are not prepared to work those hours with a smile on this isnt the place.
bad,They fired me because i had been fighting a breathing problem since working there. I came into work one day and got sent into an asthma attack for no reason and it didn't stop until I stepped out of the building. The next morning I was wheezing when breathing and called to call off or ask if I could come in for prep but have someone else open and cover the rest of my shift so I could go to the doctor and get a breathing treatment for the wheezing. They said I could do  neither and fired me on the spot. when asked reasoning they said that me leaving for a breathing treatment is classified as 'bringing personal problems into the workplace' and that wasn't tolerated. On top of that they were evacuated later that day for a carbon monoxide leak that could be smelt and had been going for at least a week.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer.

bad,"Poor Management, they only hire people with no experience so they can try to manipulate/take advantage of new comers. extremely poor management would not recommend friends to work here. Bs job"
bad,I probably had the worst luck with this company. I worked for several different locations in several different states. I had managers that were stealing from the company and countless other things I can't talk about here. When we contacted our area manager they brushed it off. I worked very hard at this job and there was no room for growth.
bad,"This place was terrible. Day-to-day was terrible. I learned nothing because it was terrible. Management was terrible, expect the worst. Culture was terrible. The hardest part of the job was terrible. The most enjoyable part of the job was terrible."
bad,"I did learn a lot of things, but management was unorganized and careless about the employees and their personal lives and issues. They treat people badly and I wouldn't advise anyone to apply there"
bad,Really good food. Very small menu but the options are explosively guaranteed to satisfy every inch of your taste bubs. Everything is fresh and smells wonderful ready to serve!
bad,"Management is poor. Four of the five managers (Service/Kitchen Managers) that work there are an absolute disaster. Would never work for a fast food company ever again. Pay was $10 an hour, income was too low for me. Promised promotions that never happened. Overall, I wouldn't recommend anyone to work there."
bad,"Manager's state they care for you and want you to advance in their company. When I let them know I would be going to school, they said I couldn't advance. They also illegally cut people's time."
bad,"Has to be the the most unprofessional workplace I have ever worked at. Management chooses favourites and gives them all the shifts, while if you are not liked you will get 2 shifts a week and in my case fired after only 2 weeks of employment. Even during my 2 weeks of employment I wasn't given the full time work i was  guaranteed. Don't waste your time here"
bad,"The work is overwhelming , they have you doing everything and do not give you enough time to finish so you end up working past your time and they make you punch out before you're finished. I've learned that I will never work for them again. Management is not good. The hardest part was not being able to take time off when you're sick without being threatened to get fired. I have not enjoyed working there at all."
bad,Awful. Management didn't know what they were doing. Would overwork workers one week and the next give them barley 15 hours when asking for full time.  Your job was at risk if you ever got sick and didn't follow sick protocol if anyone was sick at the store. People get fired with absolutely no reasoning and without warning
bad,"When working at the restaurant it was very unprofessional working alongside with the staff, shortage of staff, pipes would occasionally overflow, food undercooked. Many other things go on I  the place which will shut its doors permanently if fully inspected! Wrongful termination"
bad,"I was supposed to be working with mature adults, but it felt like I were working with a group of managers who were immature and prematurely promoted. The managers are terrible trainers, each of them teach you a different  procedure then criticize you for not doing it their way. I would hear them talk about how bad other employees are but would not help them improve. They also use new employees to pick up their slack since they feel that their superiority grants them the benefit of slacking off. The managers do not lead by example."
bad,"Simple: just another run of the mill fast food establishment peddling food that they claim is healthful and wholesome when in fact one burrito exceeds the daily intake of calories, cholesterol, and sodium far more than a Big Mac Burger."
bad,Management could've been more understanding and treated everyone fairly/nice more i learned not everyone has a good heart . The hardest part about working here was working with bad leadership and i learned every work place is different the best part was eating 50% discounted food daily.
bad,"Yes they have great food, but being a team member is completely different than being a customer!!! They are very unprofessional, rude, and un-ethical!!! My first day of work all the managers knew nothing of me, or who I even was!!! Shouldn't all managers have a weekly meeting of some sort and announce all new hires?!?! Never will I work for this company again!!!"
bad,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, over works there staff and as well as expects them to learn everything in under a month. "
bad,"Very unprofessional and unfair, treats employee with disrespect. Hours differ from how they ""Felt""  that week. Needs alot of change."
bad,"This store operates as a Franchise more than part of Corporate. I've seen a lot of good people come and go because of the constant issues within the store. Failed inspections, failed audits, and blatant  favoritism. What they tell you at orientation might be true for another store, but not this one."
bad,come in to a slave like environment no appreciation but coworkers get you through the day and putting your own music to help with all the stress
bad,"The company claims to be all about helping people grow and learn from mistakes, but that is far from the truth. Employee turnover rate is outrageous! Work-life balance is non-existant. If you ask for help, you will be reprimanded. Salaried managers expected to pick up any slack from staffing concerns. No one helps to recruit. Employees expected to work 80 or more hours per week, equaling less than minimum wage."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"Here, employees live by the motto, ""Work Hard, Play Hard"", but schedules are inconsistent and I worked random days, times and weekends with no consistency.  Co-workers are fun and interesting in general, but the very social environment turns into something reminiscent of a high school clique.  Management and workers advance based on who they know, not based on education and qualifications.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the constant free food and alcohol, random parties, etc.  However, for the stress, judgemental, condescending and threatening management, it's not worth it to work here.  They start everyone as contract workers and fire who they don't like and wait for random amounts of time (averaging 9 months) before making people they like permanent.  I wouldn't recommend working here."
bad,"I absolutely hated working here. I quit in less than 3 months, and it takes a lot for me to quit a place that fast. They give you an unreasonable amount of work and do not train you appropriately."
bad,"Chipotle the company offers a good motto, however if you do not ""fit in"" to their definition of a ""top performer"" you will get fired/laid off. So basically if the managers/manager doesn't like you for any reason they can give you less hours. Management at the Chipotle in Casa Grande really needs to look at who their managers are and if they are using their management powers and abusing them by giving their personal friends more hours!!!!!!!"
bad,"When I first started working there, it was amazing! I took pride in my store, I practically lived there. But honestly from jump management was poor, unorganized, and messy! They did not respect their employees, there was ALWAYS gossiping! They hired someone who was not even permitted to work in the United States. The hardest part of the job was dealing with unstable management who did nothing but talk about each other and crew then smile in your face. The most enjoyable part was building relationships with customers, the crew, and free food while working. It saddens me that this place where i called a second home, turned out to be a nightmare."
bad,Chipotle was all work no play. Every food item needed to be stocked correctly and on time. Sanitation was a must everything needed to be clean at all times. Luch breaks were barely taken because of the business was constant.
bad,I was kept entry-level on account of my being a college graduate who comes from an affluent background
bad,"Basically chipotle your going to be running around doing everything and not be well compensated for it . They barely give hours too, so good luck with that unless the manager likes you or something. It’s a lot of work I worked there for around 2-3 months and saw around 10 people quit"
bad,The managers were lazy in my orientation and unwilling to give me work hours. I worked 1 full shift in a span of 3 months. At the end of the day the mangers were just some bums.
bad,"Did not value employee’s hard work. I would over work myself many days and once I got sick and could not work as well, they turned their backs on me and fired me l"
bad,"This is by far the most toxic and uncomfortable place to work in my recent experience. I literally just got this job, and my ""certified trainer"" is the worst person I've ever been ""trained"" by. I don't know how she could have ever gotten certified. She has taught me next to nothing about how to do what I needed to do to be a cashier. This trainer talked bad about me in front of me and about other people (including managers). She has yet to say anything to their faces! She'll mock me for not knowing how to do something or if I ask a question. I'm sorry that I want to know how to do the job correctly? Like come on dude! There's no structure what so ever, it's like she did everything on my first day and the next, she threw me in the deep end. If you want me to be efficient at my job, then train me how to do it properly! It's simple. Please find a job somewhere else, you'll be better off. (:"
bad,"The entire three months I worked there, we were understaffed just about every single day after my first week. A lot of employees (including myself) have quit due to the pure bitterness, lack of communication, rudeness, poor decisions and high-school mentality of the management. "
bad,This was easily the worst job I've ever had. In my interview I was crystal clear that I would only be able to work limited hours in the summer due to my heavy volunteer schedule and they knowingly hired me. They didn't pay me for my first month of work until 3 months later after I contacted corporate. Then during the summer they released me even though they hired me knowing of my limited availability. My coworkers were all awful and had terrible attitudes. I would never recommend anyone work there because of the toxic environment.
bad,location is going broke. mangers say one thing and do another to save money or to get you to do work they dont want to do. i was lied to and told several time that i had gotten or was going to get a raise and i never received any kind of raise
bad,"My hours were slowly cut down from working full time down to working less than 5 hours a week. They hire new employees and phase out old ones. If you like job security, don’t work here."
bad,"Where do I start with this one? Within the first three days of working there, they expect you to know everything. They throw you to the wolves and don’t care how you handle it, so long as you get it done and get it done fast. My manager/GM flirted with all the pretty girls but not enough so he would get in trouble. He cut my hours without even talking with me first over something someone  who wasn’t even telling the truth. He said he would fix the problem, instead he let that same coworker have her way and nothing changed. Even though she was the one in the wrong and I was  a hard worker. I would never work there again"
bad,"Unprofessional, inappropriate hood rats with no class or social grace overwhelmingly work here. If you like to get in fights at work, are disrespectful and ignorant you can go far at chipotle. If you're not.....run away and dont look back. Bonus points if you're an jerk, you'll probably get promoted faster. #facts"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,They had poor management and showed favoritism. I was hired as a cashier and I went through training as a cashier and the day I start working the girl didn’t want to get off the register so they made me work the line and I had no type of training and then mad me take my break 20 minutes into my 8 hour shift and they made me stand the whole time with no other breaks
bad,Chipotle is not a good place to work because the management is horrible. The atmosphere is not professional and the culture is not like how it used to. DO NOT WORK HERE YOH WILL REGRET YOUR LIFE DECISIONS!!!
bad,"Managers were immature, but were good at their jobs. It was a very stressful environment half of the time. I got hurt on the job and my mangers made me go to the ER. Supposed to have workman’s comp but they never paid my bill so now I’m the one who owes the hospital a lot of money and I have a derogatory mark on my credit because of it. Thanks, Chipotle."
bad,If you arent hispanic the other hispanics will team up against you.. To make them fire you and replace you with another hispanic worker.Do not work for this company unless you are in the latina culture.There is no one to turn too..even management was hispanic and participated in the retalliation culture and I was never paid my last check.
bad,My typical work day was stressful and a lot of the time with other employees talking trash about one another. I only learned how to do cash and the rest was on my own. The manager didn't do her job and refused to call me my name and gender. She didn't inform any one about my name either and even went I told them other wise they ignored me.The hardest part was counting cash I got little to no training on how to do it. What was enjoyable was being able to talk to someone as you were doing you job so you didn't feel alone the entire time.
bad,The company is only ever concerned with rebounding after outbreaks. They continue to schedule less people and put all responsibility on certain managers. You are told not to take breaks. Constant calls and texts even on days off.
bad,"Don’t even bother with the application, some (not all) managers think it’s still high school, too much gossip and drama. Your work schedule / hours are used against you. Favoritism is a HUGE problem here, managers pull employees into the office to gossip, training isn’t taken seriously. If you want to drain all of your mental energy into a silly fast food restaurant, this is definitely the place. And if you don’t fit in with the clique, don’t expect more than 10 hours a week."
bad,"They hire young people to maintain a care free aesthetic. Unfortunately at my restaurant the kitchen manager lacked emotional maturity and would fire you if you ever made her feel uncomfortable or dare questioned her. meanwhile she would sit in the manager office on her phone most of the shift, would sit in the back gossiping, and created a very ugly culture where she constantly flirted with the guys who cooked the grill food. She loved to pick on the cashier and younger girls. I was in college and for some reason she was jealous of me? Anyways, she literally fired me the day after I finished my training. Be careful!!!"
bad,"I’m glad I didn’t have to work at chipotle that last long... and I’m seriously not recommending you get a job at this establishment!! The manager said I would get promoted quick and I will say that all I did was learn to do the same work for several months that the prep and grill did."
bad,"I've been here for quite awhile, and while I have met some amazing people, every so often my hours get cut and it's hurt me financially pretty severely. I've talked to my managers about it, but nothing has been done and it feels like my voice isn't being heard. I've worked at other stores and had the same issue as well. With that said, I don't recommend working here."
bad,This place has a work load even experience can't keep up with. They claim to work with people who have disability and illness but lack the management skills to do so. They expect you to give your life to the company but don't usually have your back.
bad,It’s definitely a hard life and you have to close at 1 AM and be back to work at 5 AM also never feels like you get enough help management is very young
bad,"if you want to work in an abusive work environment where you're basically bullied and chewed out and called crazy simply for not being able to fry enough chips for a 30 person catering order and for the lunch hour (insanely busy) crowd in just two short hours (you also have to fry the tacos, cut the limes, and set up the line in those short 2hrs) then go for it. if you enjoy being bullied and if you enjoy gossip and conflict and everyone trying to get everyone in trouble and suck up to management, then go for it. you never get off at the time you're supposed to get off, so if you have a 2nd job or go to school, good luck, you're gonna need it. you're running to get everything done and you're treated poorly by management, all for a measly $9 an hour."
bad,"The worst job i ever had. I missed a lot of days due to having to get surgery done and they fired me based on that. Poor management, not enough hours (willing to work full time and i barely got 15 hours per week). Managers would tell employees to wear cut gloves or else be fired yet they never wore cut gloves once. Was talked rudely to by manager every shift i worked."
bad,The company relies too much on individual managers to run their stores and this tends to lead to lots of drama. Chipotle as a whole expects all its employees to act as if they live and breathe the company.
bad,the mangers care more about making friends with some co worker and disrespecting others that do not have intent of being there friends  and are there to do there jobs and the high up staff only care about getting the most money out as possible no matter the cost they will cut your hours down up to one hour and give you 2-3 day if lucky i wouldn't recommend this job to anyone the amount of stress they put on one person is unbelievable and the mangers slack off and make other take over there jobs and they give them self extended hours to cut down on crew hours I one again would not recommend this job to anyone
bad,"They don't follow the procedures themselves. Even though my co-workers were experienced, they did things differently than what the manager had told me. One manager likes thing in one way, the other one in the other way. There's no uniformity. You don't even get time to drink water (someone calls for something if you do try to). Employees that had been working there took shortcuts (not drying the pans/bowls with paper towels and serving/preparing food immediately)"
bad,"the employees argue and gossip, managers are overly picky about employment and rather have their friends work. the over hire and don't schedule very well. not flexible with shifts or time off. I got fired for wanting to take off two holidays due to being military and they heard from other employees  that I was stilling going on vacation which was not true."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"The company has taken a huge turn for the worse, there is no work/life balance. I 100% would avoid this company at all costs. Always understaffed, always changing policies but not communicating these changes effectively."
bad,"Long days, never knowing when you'd be able to leave. People were incredibly disrespectful and rude. Managers were arrogant. Place was disgusting and dirty."
bad,My time working at Chipotle was not that great. Working up for a manager took me three years and I was the only manager that got paid the least for the same job. I highly would not recommend people to work for Chipotle. The only enjoyable part of my experience working at Chipotle was getting to work close to the crew and seeing them develop to become future managers themselves.
bad,Apprentice at Downers grove location has had multiple accounts of mistreatment of employees with threats of firing and unnecessary termination. Remarks towards women and the lack of respect.
bad,Profit drives Chipotle and at the end of the day if they can cut corners to save on labor or to make a profit they will do it. The chipotle values is nothing but a show they do not believe in anything they say
bad,This Job when i first started 4 years ago i thought it was the greatest place but then i started to realize how unfair they treat their Employees really bad.
bad,"management is horrible not a great work place, very disrespectful coworkers and management overly stressful, as hard as you work its always overlooked and unless you are part of a click within the company you will never be promoted regardless of your work skills."
bad,"Chipotle may look good on paper and on their videos, but unless you wish to work tirelessly for little to no recognition and/or benefits, for inadequate pay you will probably be miserable."
bad,"Management was promising to advance everyone but at the end would promote those people who wasn’t qualified for positions, too much favoritism.  "
bad,"A typical day at Chipotle is people being routinely overworked, lots of people in line but not enough people behind the glass. The only thing I learned is that if I can work at Chipotle, I can work anywhere, because of how hard they work you. Management was terrible, they "
bad,The most enjoyable part about the job is communicating with the customers management sometimes wasn't doing their job the workplace culture was very diverse
bad,"Everyday I was in my restaurant I would hear things like ""development talks"", ""one on ones"", and my personal favorite, ""opportunities for you to get better."" The people culture that was encouraged in the restaurant never got achieved at my restaurant. I was taught how to run and operate a quick moving restaurant with high standards for the food and service that we were providing. I loved interacting with my team and I loved my regulars. I did not like however the need for my entire team to learn the definitions of phrases like Top Performers, Empowerment, and High Standards. The most frustrating part of this experience was being reviewed to become an elite restaurant with the title of Restaurauteur and being told no because one of our team members didn't know what a Top Performer was."
bad,Sounds nice from the outside but is a terrible place to work. You can be removed without any notice so no job security. Its stressful and you need to do an unreasonable amount of work in an unreasonable amount of time.
bad,"the pay was very little, minimun wage the staff was mostly friendly but it was to stressful to work there too much work for only one person, no benefits"
bad,"could have been better, maybe older managers or more serious about the job. workers where great, job was great but when it came down to management it just wasn't truly available"
bad,A typical workday is a fast paced service environment with a a great amount of labor involved. Management doesn't do too much work they are always fooling around. Besides that they have poor management skills. the most enjoyable part is the food and the hardest part of the job is how busy it gets sometimes.
bad,"I worked there and it was a horrible experience. In the beginning they make it sound like a dream job you've always wanted and then you start working there and people do their own thing, they don't follow the rules, management doesn't fix problems, they don't help you with anything like they should. Not a good team at all."
bad,"It is a good place to work at the workers are good to work with some of them are helpful not all some of them are not friendly at all, the hardest part of working there is you hardly get help when closing at the end of the shift and the manager wants you done right away and everybody has help the management is very bad there some workers are rude to the customers then they cut your days of from 5 to 2 days no one can pay the bills that sucks."
bad,It really sucked and I was pretty much told that I was going to lose my job everyday if I didn't know how to cut the right size bell pepper or onion or if I close bad.
bad,"need new people ,not all but a lot, a lot of immature mangers ,shortcuts , and me working there seeing some things I would never eat there again .best part was paid lunches but you may have work pass your lunch time by law .but someone just coming to work can have lunch lag and it's ok ,"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"it was okay. new management is horrible."
bad,"if you want to just come in to eat as customer that is great , but do not work there."
bad,"Second day on the job they left me alone and expected me to know everything. Yelled at me to move faster my second day and made fun of me in my face when I wasn't going fast. Cant be late at all even though when you come in you take your break. Which makes no sense. Worst job, put me on the schedule during my class hours and couldn't change it because their schedule is set in stone. Examined the whole dinning room with a flash light after I cleaned it. Got mad when one piece of rice was on the floor. Terrible !! Terrible!!"
bad,There is a lot of favoritism that plays into effect you do not get the proper training and the managers don't care about anyone.
bad,"Very emotionally draining. I worked here as a dishwasher and it was so stressful and not worth what i was getting paid. Most managers would help me out except for the gm. Always would make false promises and leave. He literally does nothing. The apprentice works much harder than him. She should be the gm. Its just sad how im supposed to help everyone else but when its my turn, im left to suck it up..This is ridiculous.."
bad,"I will not speak for all Chipotle restaurants because I haven't worked for all of them. My store manager was a horrible communicator and was down low racist. Promotion did not come from how hard work, it came from who was more Mexican. If you worked hard then my manager will try to make you pick up all the slack. My experience was so horrible I  will never work for the company again."
bad,Hardest part of the job was management and customer satisfaction.  Managers weren’t the best as we had a different one  after 2-3 months. Learned basic restaurant skills and customer service skills
bad,Overall did not enjoy working for them. Management had a constant attitude and it did not feel like a family environment. The conditions are slightly off putting.
bad,Chipotle have amazing training put in place to be a successful leader. BUT you have greedy and deceitful leaders who lie about everything. No life!!!!
bad,Buen Ambiente de trabajo. Personas amables y educadas.
bad,"Working at chipotle was very stressful due to the environment. The manager was rude and not fair to new adjustments. Unlike the people , the employees were awesome"
bad,Company promotes people too quickly and promotes though who do questionable things. Mission statement is followed when they feel like it and it is convenient. Does not allow people enough time or support to do job. Managers are overworked and you will not see your family unless you are a suck up. Vacation time is a fantasy and if salaried expect to work open to close so your field leader can hit their numbers and get their bonus. Do not recommend.
bad,Be careful don't stay there. They will make you work like a slave. They say please clock out and work with no pay. I will put your hours in the next schedule and it never happens. When someone don't show up they dont look for someone to cover him/her. Sorry but you should do the doble work or more. It is a really stressful work. And the bosses dont care about.
bad,Great company but it’s not the same people culture. All the GMs started to leave to other companies because the upper management cares only about results and not the ones running the store.
bad,Chipotle was a good place to work at until my new manager came in and started messing everything up at that place and so then he started giving me less hours to work and giving other people more hours when at the same time i had been working better that those people
bad,"New CEO came on 1month after I started.  Two months later he announces he is moving the company out of Denver."
bad,"Chipotle has a very stressful work environment that isn't very easy to get used to. Chipotle has very strict rules about portions and getting orders through the line at a certain time, and that's similar to any fast food work place, but for those who don't like face paced and crowded work environments, this is not for you. Chipotle employees can range anywhere from teenager to grown adult which creates a lot of diversity among the age groups. The management at Chipotle is not at all adequate. Sometimes managers, especially ones closer to the age of the teen groups, become mixed up with coworker drama and end up promoting gossip which leads to an unsafe work environment for employees."
bad,The company itself is great good benefits and perks including free lunch on your shift.  they dont like to pay overtime but they want you to work it. They will change your hours and clock you out not letting you know they did keeping you working.
bad,"General manager was not well organized. "
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"I loved it at first until I realized I wasn’t being treated fairly or being fairly paid.              "
bad,"Management was awful, the pay was trash compared to the amount of strenuous and stressful work you have to do, and the environment was incredibly toxic where people talked bad and formed cliques (not saying it wasn't apart of it, but after leaving I realized just how bad it was). I recommend this job as a TEMPORARY one if you need money quickly, as they will literally hire anyone, but get outta there fast."
bad,"I was denied any type of advancment and also turned down when trying to transfer to 2 other locations because of my tattoos, i was also asked to leave work early multiple times due to our field leader not liling my appearance despite my work ethic."
bad,"From day one I didn't feel as though i belonged there, training was non existent, and nice but very weak management. If you dont speak Spanish you're screwed."
bad,"Worst job ever. Bust my buns there for them. Stay over hours and still treated like poo. Offered a promotion to stay. Got a title they could give me to do my managers work for them. No pay increase. Night time manager also, leaves us working not to do paperwork, no but to score illegal substances and buns out back. I left ."
bad,When I worked there the manager was very disrespectful. They cut employees hours for no reason at all. The job discipline is really low. People from the shift before dont clean their area before they leave so I had to clean when I got there and when I closed.
bad,When I first started working at Chipotle I had so much fun. The management was good and everyone around me helped me learn. But overtime the management changed. People working these for YEARS were eliminated. My significant other worked there for three years and one day decided to fire him. They clocked me in acting like I was going to stay. In the end they looked at the crew like trash even though WE were the ones doing THE MOST at the store. Please don't work for the Missouri Kansas State line store. The benefits are not worth the treatment.
bad,"I LOVE chipotle but this location was NOT for me, the management fell apart and when there’s no leadership the, “team” falls apart, would I work at chipotle again? YES!"
bad,I have had plenty of time in chipotle to know if you dont have a good gm then you will not like it. You need someone that wants you to grow make sure you feel out the team
bad,it was a good job if you want to learn social skills and interacting with people that come and go everyday . the only issue was how disorganized the management was taking months to hire me and taking months to make a schedule which was insane . It paid very well I would say for a teen that's just starting out on their own . Some workers were jerks nothing new about that but I managed to stay professional until the very end .
bad,"A typical day at work was getting everyone set up for success and prepare for the day. I learned that the company was tough on procedures, however not caring about the employee. Management took alot of credit for ideas of the team and GMs. The culture was unique and I loved it. The hardest part of the job was having a life outside of the four walls as leadership. The most enjoyable part of the job was to hire someone for first job and see them grow."
bad,Stores are not set up for success by the systems and processes used to drive operations.  Many managers work off the clock.  Unreal expectations.  Management leads by fear.
bad,"Open store, prep, dealing with crew no call no show. Informing General manager & area manager.  No support from neither general manager or area manager.  Instead of supporting your managers, the crew continued to be insubordinate to the managers and other staff.  The GM & Area manager would get rid of the managers and relocate crew who were stealing and promote insubordinate crew members.  This is bad for business."
bad,"Management was awful at this specific location. They talked a lot of hype when hiring but once hired in the environment changed. They push favorites and only give hours to them, even after giving you hours. Most didn’t have food handlers and were still allowed to work."
bad,"Put everything I had into being a service manager, gave up my entire life to move to a new city and I was thrown away like nothing but garbage all because a few of my fellow Managers didn't like who I was and I attempted to build friendships with my coworkers. They will expect everything from you and give nothing in return."
bad,"it was a really bad experience , the management is really poor and they don’t have professionalism. It sad how hard crew members work and get paid so poor"
bad,"At Chipotle the management was constantly changing making it so people were being unevenly paid, and the shifts were very random and would be made without regard to prior commitments even if they were made clear and well in advance to the general managers."
bad,my work day was normally from 7-3 I did alot for prep work and cooking on the grill.you was always busy and that made the time go by fast however the managent was poor. they liked to play games and go party with the employees. They give you free food and drinks.
bad,"where do I begin? first of the manager is super unorganized and forgets everything constantly. Don't expect any training because all you get told is where things are in like 5 minutes. I didn't watch any orientation videos. I was thrown in to serve the line my first day in the first 10 minutes of being there which was extremely stressful because I had never eaten there so I had no idea what was on the menu. So you can imagine my anxiety being at an all time high the whole time. I am a native spanish speaker as well, and most of the employees including the manager are too. You would think they would use my bilingual skills to help customers but instead I was verbally abused in Spanish in front of Anglo Americans maybe so that they wouldn't understand? I was yelled at for not knowing how to fold a burrito??? even though I wasn't taught??? Maybe they though I would know because im brown. I got yelled at for being ""too slow"" even though again I was learning everything at that point. I was getting yelled at by both customers saying rude things like ""oh you expect me to eat that"" and by the manager screaming in my ear ""HURRY UP"" . I never got my 30 minute paid break. I didn't even get a chance to ever go to the bathroom. If you value your self and your sanity don't work here. Yes it's 9.60 some an hr but honestly it's NOT WORTH IT. Especially if you're latino don't do it you will be verbally abused."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,A typical day here is nothing short of confusing. NO one is on the same page when it comes to the rules and what is supposed to be done. The management team is the worst for it. For example our area manager told me the right way  to place my chicken on the grill or what must get clean. When he leaves the managers follow their own rules and they have a different set of rules.
bad,"Worst place ever to work for. Loved the actual job in itself.  The team of ""leaders"" are a joke.  Late most days,  takes hour breaks at time, talks to employee like they are garbage. The managment need some classes on how to treat people. Just dont do it..."
bad,I feel like the chipotle I work at never gave me a fair chance they fired me before giving me a chance &  I truly was descriminated against @ chipotle
bad,"At first, I loved my job and all its benefits. I mean who doesn't like eating chipotle every shift for free. However, my managers would schedule me 40/hrs a week while I was both still in high school and a minor. I was not appreciated by any of the management despite this. I opened a new store with about 30 other people and by the time that I left less than 6 months later only 5 of the original remained."
bad,It was so stressful working there like it’s really for a job for a teenager after school I seriously don’t recommend to anyone 21+ Like it’s not a good place
bad,A day at Chipotle is fast paced. The culture is great and the team is great. The GM is very horrible to crew members and customers. She has no respect
bad,"You are expected to work off the clock, or your manager will threaten to fire you. Has gone downhill the past 3 years, ever since e. coli incident everything has changed as far as health/sanitation yet people still get sick."
bad,I loved working there and getting that hands on customer service but the crew was not really mature and people were stealing our personal belongings. TThe manager was really nice but wasnt really on top of everything like she should have been.
bad,"Multiple chains have shorted people's on their overtime money, and as much as they live to claim they are understanding and want to help you it is just like any other fast food chain"
bad,"Management was very poor at this location. As a rookie, I needed assistance with prepping the food the correct way; however, it seemed like nobody spoke enough English to help me. There was always a language barrier between my managers and I. Also, we were severely understaffed. It seemed like every day, customers would be lining up from outside the door (we didn't even have enough seats for everyone).On several occasions, we would close at 11:00PM, but we would still be there cleaning until 1:00AM. I was not compensated for the extra time either. It was also hard to understand the schedule at this time. Keep in mind that this was several years ago, so the atmosphere at this location has most likely seen some improvements"
bad,Absoulately hated working at this establishment. The managers want you to always be 100% on top of your game regardless of the weather. They don't acknowledge your efforts at all.
bad,"Chipotle Mexican Grill was one of the worst jobs I have had. We had to work long 10-13 hours shifts with no breaks majority of the time if workers didn't come in, If you were not willing to do this your job was always threatened. There were a lot of things ignored as far as how the restaurant should be kept and how it was kept. No matter how many times you called corporate and the area manager and made complaints your issues were never handled."
bad,Got nothing nice to say about this place other than the food and some of the employees. The manager is a kid with an ego the size of someone in the Trump family. Assistant manager is a bulldke with tiny man syndrome and every employee under them are young impressionable kids.
bad,"Instantly intrusive, vindictive, and emotionally- politically charged service management made the demand of fast-paced cooking and preping a nightmare. Constant conspirator pacts to scape-goat new team members came to the point of immaturity. The atmosphere was that of middle school girls gossiping to end people's jobs over ridiculous superficial circumstances not related to the job whatsoever. The place was designed like a cult down to the very repetitive hollow terminology use throughout."
bad,"I worked there for many year and long time ago the experience was much better , right now NYC is bringing people from our side  and they are just horrible people , they care just for the money and not the people , the support is badddd ,and the people in NY don't want to work for 9 dollars because is to much job , the company is making responsible for keep them into chipotle just sharing the culture , whattt??? People need more money be realistic, do something really good for them ."
bad,its was always a good day I love my cowokers and I always learn something new about the store the hardest part of my day would be the managers stoping a long line just to give awy free food to any pretty girl they seen
bad,"I worked there about a month. As a self motivated hard worker I've never been so micro managed in my life. Too many chiefs and not enough indians. If you dont not fit in with the crew socially they rip you apart professionally,  They have very specific ways they want things done and have no problem telling you that in an unfriendly manner. Mostly everyone recieved frequent talks from managment abut performing better, as if that is some type of encourgagment. Worst company I have ever had the displeasure of  being apart of. Great food, every single time i've returned to this location to get food there is always a new person working the station they had me on. Clearly im not the only person who had an issue working there, as they hold open interviews weekly to keep up with theyre high turn over rate."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,The typical day for a crew member is amazing but if you are a manager that works hard then you get put blame for everyone's mistakes. I learned a lot of techniques to cut or chop food and the culture of chipotle. The co-workers are nice. The hardest part is nothing because it is simple and the most enjoyable is the customers.
bad,"would never work for another chipotle location. lack diversity and inclusion. lack respect and proper leadership. this is a new location, so of course there’s going to be things people don’t know and that’s totally okay if you’re a manager or you’re white. you will be micromanaged by 15/16 year olds. the managers show they favoritism very strongly and you will hate being there. you aren’t trained and they’ll bash you"
bad,"Working here sucked, to put it lightly. The amount of work you’re asked to do in such a short amount of time is absolutely ridiculous and often times not even productive. Management was a straight up joke and played favorites literally every single day. If you’re not absolutely perfect at your job, you’re always in the manager’s office with them breathing down your neck, threatening your job, even though they barely give you the training required. The pay could’ve been substantially better with the amount of work you’re asked to do, but you do get free food and the benefits were actually really good too, so it wasn’t all bad. All in all, if you want a decent at best part time job for a few months, I’d say Chipotle would be fine, but definitely not a long term option."
bad,"My day consisted of cooking and cleaning. The job wasn't the problem for me, it was the toxic environment. Chipotle was unorganized and the people there were very unprofessional, rude,and i didnt see myself growing there so I quit"
bad,Punished for going back to school and had a position made for me embarssing as well as being yelled at by GM. Not trained to job that I was hard for and when tried to work there was pushed off by Asst to the GM as well as the GM.
bad,The management is very poor and unprofessional. The manager will have you come all the way there just to send you home for mediocre things. He doesn't know how to talk to employees either.
bad,No growth no job security not a place to go to.        There is nothing else to say about this job. Their retention rate is horrible because they hire externally
bad,The store that I worked at had truly awful managers which made it difficult to get anything done. Hours were not given out as promised but if there was a shift available you were shamed into working on your days off.
bad,"Chipotle is backwards. The managers talk in the office while the crew runs the store, alone, even during rushes. Managers often dole out different punishments for the same crime depending on who did it. Those they were closer to, they forgave and those they weren't, they cut hours for. Favoritism also was evident when it came to promotions"
bad,I had worked at chipotle for three years at the beginning it was fine since i was still a minor and they had to follow minor laws but as soon as I turned 18 i was peer pressured into become service manager. I was frequently asked if I wanted to become manager and i declined everyday. It just got to point were I got tired of them asking me so I just agreed so they’d be off my back .I definitely hated it and showed it daily that I wanted nothing to do with management. My upper managers had been on my case if I didn’t follow safety rules but they definitely didn’t set an example. Employees don’t follow safety precautions either wouldn’t recommend eating there. I had voiced out my decision to get demoted was ignored three times I had enough and walked out mid shift when I had to close many stations by myself. Don’t recommend unless you want to get overworked.
bad,"I was working there in 2016, when my manager on duty left his Bluetooth on his speaker on . He went into the bathroom and my other manager pulled me into the back of the house was the speaker playing some xvideos. "
bad,"I was on cash for the 2 or 3 months I worked. Free food is nice, but you rarely if ever get breaks, and managers don’t help. At all. Or more accurately they’ll help on rare occasions, but more often than not they’ll just scowl at you. The amount of stuff cash has to do is terrible for the pay, and quite unrealistic"
bad,"good job if working part time, "
bad,"While the pay is very good, the work and stress that matches it is not worth it. Management was a mess and you barely get time to breath, especially as a cashier."
bad,"Mis en paz "
bad,Chipotle hired me to cook grill. There is a lot of work for a grill person to do. So much so that it's far beyond what anyone else has to do in the store. If you need a job or like the challenge then the job is for you. If not look for something else
bad,"Chipotle is a good company, but has to many food safety risks for upper management. The upper management didnt seem like they cared for the people in the stores working!"
bad,The work there was fairly easy had some difficult test but above all was fine some of the other employees were unprofessional along with some managers was the reason for my leaving
bad,"Managment: some managers are good, others are horrible. It seems they put people in managment just because they need managers. The GM is very good and knows how to run the place but other managers are very lazy and make employees do the work they don’t feel like doing"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,The employees hired are all personal friends of the general manager. They all know each other and party together and as a result call in sick because of a hang over. Its unfair the employees whom aren't friends of the GM have to work harder and her friends get away with doing the minimum.
bad,"Hot and stressful"
bad,"In the beginning, Forest Park Chipotle was a very welcoming place to work but after working there for about a year or so the excitement of working there decreased as well as the welcoming feeling you would get from the work environment. The management at the Chipotle in Forest Park is awful, the General manager at that time I worked there would put the majority of the work on one person when there were clearly other people around that could do it and let the people who they really liked leave early. There was little to no break given. I understand that you do not have to have a long break but working on your feet 7-8 hours a shift non-stop need some sort of relax time. The tuition reimbursement begins after working for a full one year and if you do stay longer than a year, make sure you know that you can only file for tuition reimbursement 30 days after your semester has ended."
bad,"Working here over a year I experienced poor management, discrimination and verbal abuse. I was injured in an accident but was still given harsh hours and expected to work 100%  even though they know of my condition. I felt as though they took advantage of me in many ways."
bad,I do not reccoment this job if you're looking for a job with a lot of hours. You have to compete for hours and they favor their workers. The management is horrible.
bad,"not all chipotles are like this but the one I worked at the field manager didn't want to help out our store and instead of teaching he just fired really great hard working people. I had a rude manager who wasn't nice to me at all and just ultimately said rude stuff. But my co-workers were amazing. But like I said not all chipotles are like this, just the one I worked at."
bad,Do not care about the managers. Overworked and not given the recognition . Policies change everyday . Childish field leaders . They are number driven .
bad,Wouldn't at all recommend working here!!! The management is very poor and they do have their favorites even if you are more of a hard worker than anybody else. Co-workers are very rude and if their sick they'll come to work without anybody telling them anything. People don't fallow guidelines at all they do what they want and yea you get free food but after working there you'll get sick of it fairly quickly. If you are to bump into any problems don't bother talking to managers they don't care what so ever about their employees just call corporate and get them reported. GOOD LUCK!!!
bad,"If you care for people, you don't want to work here. This company will make you hate people. Customers, and crew. You are underpaid, and over worked. They set high expectations, and unrealistic goals."
bad,I don't really remember it was three years ago it seemed like a ok place it was fast paced and we got discounts on food but no health benefits or paid time off
bad,They made us clock out and then continue working (closing shift). You had to clean the hot grill with nothing but thing rubber gloves. Its a super busy environment yet you only get three days of mediocre training.
bad,"Too much is expected of the workers. They are expected to be perfect people and the standards are way too high. It's always understaffed because people are getting fired for practically no reason. No flexibility in work hours either. Ask for more hours, you'll either get less or way too many. Lots of effort and hard labor for a 9.00 salary. Not worth the pain it causes."
bad,"Load of work for pennies a day. Super fast paced and feels like customers never end. If you need the money go for it, but if your looking to get out of what you actually feel like you deserve its not worth it."
bad,"The management does not follow chipotle rules at all, they expect more then a human can give the curse at the employees. they make up reasons to send someone home because they don't like you its disgusting this location needs to be shut down."
bad,"I was an outside hire GM, which rarely happens with this company. They try to hire from within at all costs. Number 1 it's their culture and to go against everything they preach about really hurts the stance they try to take with 99% of mgt come from the crew."
bad,"Where to start. When I was first hired at Chipotle, everything went smoothly for the first 2 months or so, until they started asking me to stay until 10pm (which was a lie because I never actually left until 10:45). I was a senior in high school, and it was my first job. As a 17 year old, there are some laws that protect me from my employer. The management at the store I worked at sucked. They we're constantly late (not by like 5 minutes, but by like 15-20) which put everyone else behind. I missed soo much school because of how late they were keeping me, and I almost failed my senior year. To anyone in high school that may be reading this, DO NOT consider Chipotle a good idea while you're still in school!"
bad,I had the worst experience there they did not train me and when i would ask them to they would not. The management was horrible they never knew anything and always messing things up.Some co-workers were very welcoming and easy to talk to. Customers very disrespectful had a customer ask me for a green card cause of my race and it was my third day there.
bad,"Overall i enjoyed my employment at chipotle, besides the fact that none of the coworkers or managers showed me much of anything and that i was fired in such an unprofessional way."
bad,"It can be a great company while you work at a $3000/day store otherwise consider yourself a slave, no matter how high of a manager you are."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,A typical day working at Chipotle I do have to say I did learn how to work hard and efficiant at a very fast pace. I learned many differnt task's in all stations I started off as a crew member in 2004 promoted to supervisor in 2005 then to assistant manager 2006. Awlay's willing to learn what's needed for advancement worked very well with co worker's had to separate my self from being crew to becoming manger but went smoothly. The hardest part of the job was working 9 to 10 hours a day and not recieving any breaks never having enough time thru out your day to complete daily tasks. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the public getting to know your customer's on a more personal level to see them smile when walking in and them knowing you already know what they are gonna want before them having to ask overall working side by side with my crew allowing them to see that I was willing to work and do what needed to be done to get customer's in and out in a timely manner but yet satisfied.
bad,"I didn't look forward to going to work at all. The managers were extremely unprofessional and would stay hidden in their office while the employees outside struggled with a huge crowd. I enjoyed this job because I met some very good people, but there is also a lot of cons."
bad,"The environment is fast paced. At first i loved the job, but now it is draining. The management is horrible, we always run out of stuff and nobody helps when we have work related problems. We are basically set up to fail. The only pro is your coworkers are nice and fun to work with, those relationships are the only thing that keeps me there. Oh the discount is also cool."
bad,They pay well and have good benefits but will get all of that out of you. There is zero work life balance. It’s a very hard job. It takes a lot of skill to be great. It takes a long time and a lot of commitment. You can do great things but will probably get burned out before you find success.
bad,"IF you have a good amount of patience and can handle a lot of trying situations this job won't be bad for you. After time this job will start to make you hate food services. I worked at mcdonalds before and liked that job so much more. Management was great, just the customers expect so much with not a lot to give and complain a lot, which is crazy because they watch you make the food. But yeah, you'll definitely NEED patience to work there."
bad,"They skipped out on $100 from my last check and in general the management were very hostile and controlling and lacked any sort of leadership qualities. Their version of leadership is merely knowing the job/barking orders and not inspiring others. Perhaps Chipotle is better in other locations, but the management was evil and soul-crushing."
bad,"best part about working there is you got free chipotle beyond that, it was not really a great experience. the managers kept a majority or the hours for themselves, while other employees had 15-30 hours they had 50 or more hours."
bad,"At my time working at Chipotle, I felt as if I was constantly being overworked due to severe understaffing. I was asked to work an insane amount of hours within a week and was unable to keep up with school and social life."
bad,"extremely unorganized, lots of call outs, managers could be rude to you even if you’re trying your best. very unfair pay for those who come into work and have to deal with the lack of employees that show up while working with a line out the door with only one other person. if you cant deal with very fast past and a mess then i suggest this isnt the pkace for you."
bad,"Chopping and dicing veggies. Getting deployment printed counting cash draw, setting up dinning room for the guests.The culture was laid back. Taking care of the guest's. Covering poisons for for employee breaks. Frying chips, Doing dishes put away truck. Cash audits twice a month, Full Inventory's once a week. Management could have been better. the hardest part about the job getting the proper training. The most enjoyable part of my job our guest's and some of the employee's"
bad,"When I began working there it was an amazing place, It went off ""we treat our employees good, they do a good job, we have happy customers""That did not last long, I had left because it changed. When it came to GM and Area managers all they cared about was themselves, their promotions. And they did not care about the team. They knew we benefited them however I was a service manager and I myself had been there months and seen what a horrible place it had became."
bad,"I loved this job at first and the benefits were good but management was horrible. We were always overstaffed but they kept hiring people, and couldn't give people the hours they wanted, so they fired a lot of people. If I was working at any other location, I probably would've loved it but this one sucks. Free food and paid breaks were nice, but not worth it due to how management treats their employees. Managers only favor people who have been there longest, and half-a** training new employees, then get mad when they don't do things correctly."
bad,"chipotle does not value their employees, However they have an insane way of training people. It taught me to be a great trainer myself and to communicate very well with others."
bad,I've had a lot of experience in food service jobs but this is the only place where I worked for a big corporation and they had so many unnecessary rules. The company is more concerned with their way of doing things and making money. They come off as well organized and informed but there is a huge disconnect between corporate Chipotle and the GMs and crew members.
bad,I hope you know what you're doing as chipotle is the last place you'd want to work. Between the managers threatening to fire you form day 1 to the customers constant false complaints for free food you're stuck in an endless loop of let-downs and punishments for a measly 9 dollars an hour.
bad,"Under trained staff "
bad,"Management is terrible. don't get too invested, it's a stressful environment but they give you a lot of hours if you need them, flexible with my schedule."
bad,"the management is the issue they don't treat employees with the respect, they are suppose to and they do not know how to speak to their employees"
bad,"Please don't work for the Indianapolis location. There's many other Chipotles in IN. Despite somehow being ""restaurateur"" this location is full of a bunch of teenage boys who will make jokes around you about your body parts and touch you inappropriately. And let's not forget the ones who find you on snapchat and try to sext you. I went in to quit and it was the best decision I ever made. First, they make you work even when you're sick, which probably explains the whole E. coli situation..I had thrown up one night before coming in to work and let the manager know. He made me work the rest of my shift. In addition, when you burn yourself on the tortilla press or the grill, management doesn't even let you rest or apply first aid. They will barely give you enough time to slap a bandaid on yourself or rinse off with cold water. My breaking point was when they scolded me because I asked a customer, who I had never seen before, not to take a video of me. They threatened to fire me over this situation and tried to do so, to which I promptly let them know that I had already gotten another job and that there was no need to. As of right now I am a full-time student and will be graduating with the Academic Honor's Diploma in June. So happy to urinate all over this sad E. coli infested salt-bag of a restaurant. I'll certainly cry over how sad my life is without Chipotle and all it's 2.0 GPA high school dropouts and drug addicts who come in to work high..while holding my $7,000 scholarship."
bad,"I would not work for Chipotle again, as the management allowed little to no breaks, was rude, and hours were cut or added on with little notice."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"Great place to get experience and a great place for a potential career. However, unrealistic expectations with high standards and the need for all employees to be perfect is very stressful. Definitely not a laid back environment or job. Hard work and a lot of commitment. No flexibility with schedules and the possibility of being terminated is very high. You are replaceable"
bad,"Having to file Worker's Comp is a Death Sentence, even when due to employee and managerial negligence. Continuing to force employees to use broken, poorly assembled machines, having extremely heavy equipment at ground level and requiring strenuous lifting to use, etc."
bad,Just don’t. It’s really understaffed and the female managers are so rude and disrespectful.They treat make workers like trash but expect them to pull their weight. The stores overall training method is basically either show you once and your good or figure it out yourself. Not a good place.
bad,"Im a current employee at chipotle my mental health has deteriorated. We never have a staff or a good day. We are closed more than open. I was so happy before I found out they don't care about you or the stores outcome. We have a pest problem flies, everything is always broken & they don't want to fix it aka replace it. They don't care about the employees. Just money way more BUT don't ruin your life. Go to school and do better."
bad,Ok job if you can stand long periods time you would like working there and benefits are ok but I wouldn't go back not because I didn't like the job just that that job is more for the younger generation
bad,Overall I have no problems from the company itself. The problem was with the managers that tend to be lazy and non-proactive. They like to black everything on the crew members instead of taking responsibility for the actions that happened on their shift. The most enjoyable part was going to work to see the regular customers and crew members that made the day enjoyable.
bad,"Typical morning shift: Start time is 8 AM but will get there at 7 AM to get everything up and running to start the day. Do a walk through of the restaurant to ensure closing shift did all they were suposed to and left the restaurant clean. Plug everything in and turn everything on. Wash the produce for the day, label and put everything away. Check all emails for the day and check Critical Items (CI) Count count from night before and diagnose to ensure at proper range. Make deployment for the day. Check HACCP and Red Book form night before. 8 AM crew starts to show up, go to the FOH and give Wellness Checks and clock them in. Start Prep tasks for the day which include Dicing, cutting lettuce and making guac. Ensure everyone is keeping on track with opening Grill, Salsas, Shredding Cheese and Making and Bagging Chips. Pushing everyone to get all tasks done by 10:15 AM to go on break. Open by 10:45 AM. Line to the door, have to deploy 4 pillars to ensure line moves quickly and guests are satisfied. Delegating tasks to get dishes done, afternoon prep done and all food safety procedures are completed. Peak hour at 11:45 AM, no one moves from the line and everyone is in a position to help out guests. 0 prep tasks done during this time. 1:15 PM, after peak food safety tasks, afternoon prep and chips again. Trash needs to be taken out and dishes need to all be washed. Shift change comes and all tasks for restocking need to be completed and all new employees come in for wellness check and old ones leave for the day if their tasks have all been completed. SM to work the night shift comes"
bad,"chipotle is a great company, i learned many things. A typical day in the life is not what you think it will be. always too busy and not enough employees  to do the job. The management isn't the best, had about over 2 general mangers in the last year. I would say the hardest part about the job, was back of the house, dishes making food,like rice all the meat marinate clean floors mop,scrub, and also sweep all in one shift."
bad,"You will do so much work for little pay. Also you have to write journals every other day so you will have to take over other peoples job. They will MAKE you learn their vision, definitions and goals. Half of the time they take out of work to talk about what you need to say to their boss and you don't get it they will drill it in you"
bad,There are many things about chipotle I don’t agree with being a employee there. For one I was given many promises of promotion and hours. Since then I have been cut on hours and have been told that my manger is there to offer me a job and not stability.
bad,"Hated it overworked and under appreciated, management wasn’t at all up to par. My gm would do a lot of shady things and get away with it. It wasn’t a respectful workplace."
bad,"Worked at chipotle for years. And everyday of every year that I worked, something would go wrong or someone would try and start something with me or another coworker. The amount of stress from the job alone is enough to cause health problems. Any other stresses after that might as well be nails in the coffin. Which sucks because I know this place can be something amazing...I just have yet to see that happen. And I don't know how much longer I want to wait for it."
bad,Management really needs to work on their training. They set big expectations without properly setting up the crew for success to reach those expectations.
bad,"They are all about favoritism and siding with there on kind. They pick and choose which employees they want to make actually work for the money ad which ones can walk around and do nothing for the money. There is this on manager that start a lot of stuff with other employees just to fire them, but in all actuality there is no liable reason for that employee to get fired. No one in management seems like they know what they are doing until the store manager comes around and tells them how they should be running the store. They also over work people, while they stand in the back and talk all day."
bad,"Chipotle was easy, fun, and sometimes annoying. The managers were very lenient; the other employees were nice and fun to be around but  favoritism played a big role in the store."
bad,Everyone is nice they help you with anything you have. Always have a smile and you will get good comments back. The customers are nice and help you out
bad,it was an okay place to work doing the same thing everyday until they hire someone new then you train them to keep moving to new diffrent things
bad,"I had chips thrown at me and co-workers were childish (Teen-like drama, management expect flawless skills in short period after being hired."
bad,"The work place was fun with supportive management. Not only did we work hard to empower each other to grow and be great as a team, we had fun while doing it."
bad,I honestly loved this company and was one of the many brainwashed chipotlians. They make you believe if you just keep working your hardest and dedicate every second of your life it will pay off. Well I am a perfect example of how that is not true. I dedicated 80 to 100 hours a week for 4 years and in the end it did not pay off at all. I feel sorry for the thousands of people who will loose so much of their lives by believing in a company that only cares about profits.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"This company provides us employees with many great benefits like free meals the days you work, heath, dental, 401K and even PTO. Also if you're a college student, you may be eligible for tuition reimbursement. Great stuff right? Well at the Closter, NJ location, you have to pay the full price. "
bad,"A typical day at chipotle is most of the time stressful when working with an unprofessional, disorganized, and lazy management. Management tends to fire workers without a valid reason or do not have supported evidence against a worker. There is always miscommunications and management act very unprofessional when doing their job."
bad,"Had job for the summer. Managers were often nice. Felt constantly stressed because I wanted to be a good employee, and it was a fast paced environment, which I expected. I felt like I was going to get fired at any chance because I was slow. Requested time off months in advance because I was going on vacation. Was put on schedule when I had given them notice. Had short shifts, but was often asked to work overtime. I understand that they may have been short staffed at the time, but I scheduled my life around my job"
bad,Just it was horrible. I regret it all. It started off good like i wanted to be there everyday and not I just regret everything about chipotle I even regret applying there.
bad,"Received 0 training. So desperate for employees we were thrown in without really understanding too much of the basic training. I personally did not feel like I was informed about what I was doing in my job, they kind of just left it up to me to figure out what I was supposed to be doing. Poor management. Great schedule flexibility and free employee meals. Overall unenjoyable."
bad,"They had to let me go because my mental health was too much for them at the time, I was homeless, my car broke down and I literally lost everything I went into work one morning and they had the manager talk to me (he always used to tell me he was gonna fire me one day) and he told me my fiance was also one of the reasons why they were letting me go because at the moment of time we were going through things as well. The manager always used to make me and my ex I dated in high school argue all the time just to cause drama, they always made me feel like whatever I did wasn't good enough I felt terrible, and one of the gm would only hire you based on looks if he thought another guy was cute he was automatically hired. I don't recommend working here at all!"
bad,At Chipotle Mexican grill i learned customer service how to pick up calls and make to go orders. The hardest part of the job was trying to manage everything all at once but it got done.
bad,With the right management team this could be a great place to work. However lack of support causes long hours and extra stress on you and your team. I would not recommend becoming a salary manager for this company.
bad,Great co workers fun and easy to get along with some very lazy . poor management on gosford location very unprofessional and rude . Really don't give you hours pick and choose who they like you can work your but off and get over looked .
bad,A typical day at work included the line being all the way out the door when the lunch hour rush came in. We would sell out of things quickly and have to replenish them even quicker. It was a very fast pace environment that always kept me on my toes.
bad,I enjoyed my time working with this company. I've learned so much throughout this process and still is learning more everyday about myself. I recommend people giving this industry a career opportunity.
bad,"Not a good job for me. The type of work is not enjoyable. I usually am stuck in the back doing dishes alone. Other people there like it, but I just don't enjoy doing that sort of work."
bad,I've worked on food for over 12 years.  I was trained one day and that wasn't even training.  I started in Nov been doing the same thing until December management tells me I'm washing dishes wrong.  I didn't make steak and we clearly didn't have steak.  I didn't need the money I just wanted the respect most of the managers are super young couple of managers were (are) great one of he best transferred because of poor management.  But two were awful.  They have this thing about bacteria right so boxes of meat they don't want it in the e prep table because they fear contamination.  So instead they put the POSSIBILY CONTAMINATED box on the SALAD SPINNER!!! And on the racks that you keep bowls for food. So beyond the smartest thing. I left because one manager was just sooooo  freaking oblivious to what I was saying I couldn't do it anymore.  If you are super young go for it but if you looking to kill time DONT WASTE YOUR TIME YOU WILL NOT BE RESPECTED NO MATTER IF YOU WERE THE MAYOR
bad,"As a salary manager, you are extremely over worked and under paid. Only paid for 50 hours in a week, but working upwards of 60-70 hours. No support from corporate managers, you are just a name on a screen."
bad,"Working here I regularly experienced an uneven distribution of workload, berating, and stress. Every day I went to work I was filled with the anxiety of never being good enough and being fired. I finally decided to just quit the job and remove the toxic environment from my life. I always felt as though I was never going to be good enough for the manager, and felt that the job just was not for me."
bad,"Everyone last time dont have organization and i dont like"
bad,"This job was a bad mistake from the beginning.  I was told, as I was grilling meat, hands wrist deep in raw chicken, that I wasn't smiling enough."
bad,a typical work day at chipotle providing customer service prepping food for the next shift  making customers orders mangers were respectful co-workers were also respectful
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"it's a great place to work at depending on your supervisor and manager, they have pretty flexible hours but they need to work on their staff it needs appropriate Training"
bad,"They didnt give my breaks when i needed it cause we were too ""understaff"". Management sucks also. High Management sucks also theres no communication.."
bad,"hen Chipotle first opened, the idea was simple: demonstrate that food served fast didn't have to be a ""fast-food"" experience. We only use high-quality raw ingredients, classic cooking methods and a distinctive interior design, and provide an exceptional customer experience—features more frequently found in the world of fine dining. As a fast-growing company, we’re always looking for new people to join our team. We provide real opportunity for advancement and a fun, exciting work environment."
bad,"fast paced environment. training techniques not followed 100%. Pushy training, to get you to learn faster. job itself is easy to learn, but expectations are high"
bad,Manager auto-terminated me supposedly by accident can't even go get my job back called the higher company no better response. Turn to find out the manager was stealing money for his OWN COVER UP !
bad,"It is stressful. You can find better money elsewhere for the type of work you do. But the people you work with are friendly. Be prepared for corporate to make rash changes, and want you to conform to their needs."
bad,Everyone there is replaceable. They make it known. If you miss one day of work no matter the circumstance you will be terminated. They are not about the employees at all.
bad,no room for advancement and is run by young adults with a  lack of experience. The employees hardly showed up for work and when they did  they lacked any and all customer service skills.
bad,I don't recommend anyone to work at this place they are very unprofessional. Very little pay and a lot of work. And a lot of managers are or professional at all and constantly unprepared
bad,did not receive proper training. was not given a fair chance to learn. cant trust the general manger not to share your buisness to other co workers. Horrible place to work !!!!!!
bad,"n.a"
bad,"No one is happy in this work environment. You are treated as a cog in a machine that is barely functional with the time allotted. I was penalized for my unavailability to work after being hired as a part-time student. I don't recommend working here if you have to be part-time, they will keep you late, they will violate your rights day in day out."
bad,"they wouldn’t tell that over a period of time working with them especially in prep that u could develop carpal tunnel syndrome, my hand is messed up but they don’t care and they are not sanitary"
bad,Not at all what they promise at first. I will say I learned a lot of hard life lessons while working at Chipotle. I believe if Chipotle listened to the low man on the totem poles their stores would prosper in the end.
bad,"Every chipotle you go has a bunch of managers yelling and constantly moving people from dishes to the line and to somewhere else. I went through three managers in my time there which wasn't a very long time. They hire people with no talent who give messed up schedules and are always moody. The people I worked with talked so much shitt as if the customers didn't speak Spanish and as if others couldn't hear them. I promise you the food you've eaten here is covered in spit. The people washing dishes have cuts on their hands because the water is either freezing cold or super hot. They are not paid enough, there's too much chaos and people are constantly quitting or getting fired. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH BENEFITS IN THE WOLRD TO JUSTIFY WORKING AT THIS SHITT HOLE."
bad,"I have personally worked at several different chipotle locations over the years. I worked at the Milford location for over a year. This location is just not it. This does not have to do with the job itself, it is quite an easy experience to be there."
bad,Sucked. Never work here unless you want to loss your will to live and slowly give your soul to chipotle. I cried almost every day. Poor management and mean customers
bad,They will say that you will get hrs and then renege dropping your hrs citing job performance as the excuse rather than stating they only wanted part time employees
bad,es una companania en la cual hay mucha trabajo pre cuando llegan nuevos le desminullen las horas a los de mas la cual no debe ser asi tiene que poner su ahorario fuijo a las personas viejas de la compania y ellos no trabajan asi avese tienen mucho dessorden con el cual ellos no pueden con el ni con los empleados.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,Warning before applying to this company sucks Big Time ! People don't come to work and you have to do part of there job because they decided not to come in and work personal experience I worked there for 8 months. People get hired and they don't last . Brutal job I will never work for this company again ! nemissed out of work so I left the doors open nev n
bad,The hours and expectations are beyond unrealistic. I put in 90-100 hours every single week yet only was paid for 50 (salary). Little to no support from upper management.
bad,This job is so stressful and it is so incredibly hot. You are a machine and if you do not work fast enough you are in the way. This job should pay $15/hr or more based on everything you have to do and what you have to deal with.
bad,"i wasnt too keen on working there to be honest. the management played favourites and it got nowhere. hours werent favorable more than half the time, and trying to get along with people was difficult when management didnt like you due to your style."
bad,With this job unless you can cut veggies as fast as you can and get them to the correct sizes then you will be out of a job. You basically have three days to learn this with only one of those days being. Training.
bad,Management says everyone is responsible for doing dishes. But one person gets stuck doing them for hours on hours non stop. They say do not come to work if you’re sick and then get mad when you don’t come in.
bad,I would come in clock in get started on guac then talk to my coworkers said hello to my manager on shift then started the meat process and then cut lettuce then take care of customer service and do the dishes the whole time thru the process of being prep
bad,i worked here as a kid and hated it they kept me at all hours of the night. they scheduled me 5 days a week i had to quit dancing because i was so afraid to tell the managers that i wanted to quit
bad,If you work at Compton and the gm is jonathon and you aren’t the same race as him expect to work harder . Besides that I guess it isn’t that bad of a place . Just know if you work in the back you will do majority of the work
bad,"Genuinely was a fine job, at the time they were just hiring people left and right but would only give certain people less than even considered working hours. i would be given four (4) hours a week and half of the time i would get a call saying that they dont need me to come in so i would only work 4 hours if im lucky per pay period (every two weeks)"
bad,Here I learned how to uphold high company standards. The culture is strong at Chipotle on producing consistent foods and taking care of customers. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the unreasonable amount of stress attached to producing burritos.
bad,"Please, save yourself the headache and just dont apply. They are a company full of empty promises and little to no follow through. They will tell you anything and everything to get you in the door then they treat you horribly."
bad,Chipotle is a great place to eat but not the best place to work. They are too money hungry to worry about their employees. I wouldn't recommend working there to anyone.
bad,I love working for Chipotle. Start your day off opening the store and turning everything on. Im in charge of cooking food properly in timely manner at chipotle high standards. I teach the crew to better themselves with the company. No one gets lefts behind. I learned how to hold the crew accountable for their actions. There's really no hard part about chipotle. The most enjoyable part is making the customer happy.
bad,this was by far the worst job ive ever worked. employees are two faced theyll tell you to your fave that your doing a good job then all of a sudden the manager is talking to you about something that person said.
bad,"my experience with chipotle wasn't pleasant in any way. Management is very selfish and its not something you learn until you become management, because how is staff supposed to know different then what mangers tell you."
bad,"Working at Chipotle is a non-stop work day, management doesn't really take your schedule into cosideration and there are too many tasks for just one position."
bad,"The management at this company is awful. They are rarely there and the days they do decide to show up to work, they make all of the staff feel uncomfortable and unappreciated."
bad,"I'm a great people person I work will with others, I'm a great people person I love helping others, I always treat people with respect, I will be your number one worker ."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,We all help eachother but the job can et out of hand when we get a lot of customers. The managers are rude nice but at times they get very in patient and they become rude. The workers there are all nice and very easy to get along with.
bad,This place is full of BS. They play favorites and let certain people get away with whatever they want. Their training program sucks and they expect you to be perfect at every position with the little knowledge that was given. They don't pay enough for the BS you put up with. Favoritism doesn't get you far remember that.
bad,"Du sale travail, non-gratifiant et on t'en demande toujours plus."
bad,"Typical day very fast paced always going making sure customers are having the best experience possible."
bad,"manager wasnt a team, was more so looking towards his goals not the whole team goals, enjoyed the people there it was fun, best part of the job is the food and customers"
bad,Atypical day at work is opening store at 8am strat preping to open store at 11am start serving customers with a smile and very friendly you learn every day you are giving the opportunity to learn each station and as well have the opportunity to grow in the company the managment are very nice understand their employees and help you be better each day the most enjoyable part is that at the same time you are working you are having fun with your co workers and customers and you are always in constant activity always something to do .
bad,"I feel I was discriminated against. Only male african american, besides a few half-breeds, that were employed. I was removed off of the schedule without being informed for no reason at all. When I though I was working my butt off, it wasn't good enough for them!"
bad,"my review is every six month, i have to know about the quality and integrity organic food, because when the customer comes needs that information."
bad,"Chipotle is the definition of doing too much for being paid pennies.. I was on grill it was probably the worst experience with a kitchen job I have ever had. First off you’re on grill by yourself making, chicken, steak, beans, rice, and all the other meats they sell. If your store Is a busy store you’re still doing everything on your own I think there should be at least two people on grill at all times but sadly not in chipotles eyes not only do you have to cook everything by yourself you also have to wash your dishes too! And they have a dishwasher. After slaving your whole shift you have to deep clean everything no help and do other areas too that you do not even touch when you’re working on grill why? You have to scrub the floors every night there is no mop. The manager makes you pull out the what they call drain socks which will make you throw up and clean them out. Also you have to clean the grill vents every night. It’s too much work for little money in my opinion."
bad,Chipotle Mexican grill is very busy so there is never a dull moment . The food is amazing and always fresh and good quality . The team members are professional and fun people
bad,"No hours. Bad management. Don’t want to listen to your problems. Don’t set yourself up for disappointment. They don’t want to sit down and talk to you like  management is supposed to do.,"
bad,"I had an unfair lay-off because I reported the GM to Respectful Workplace."
bad,"The manager was not friendly or understanding of my needs with me being a senior in high school. When I asked for days off, he made it hard for me to get them. The pay was well."
bad,The managers at the rock away chipotle are awesome if you're on their good side . It is a very stressful job and not meant for anyone not willing to work hard.
bad,"This is a hard review to write. I researched a lot about gmos and organic farming, and came to the conclusion that the company is fearmongering about these topics for profit. But they treat employees well."
bad,"This was my first job in the fast food industry and I will never again work with food. Honestly, I did enjoy my time here but there is so much work that goes on behind the scenes and theres no time to slow down. If you are looking for many hours, better than minimum wage pay then this is the place for you. But be ready to work your butt off."
bad,"I love the company Chipolte just not the Edgewater, Maryland Chipotle. My GM was hiring her family members and paying them more then everyone sle whom was doing more work then them. BUt I love everything Chioptle is doing, all natural, all fresh and over all good food. They want to make sure that the employees know about Chipotle so when customers ask questions the employees can answer and not get the manager."
bad,"super fast yet fun. heavy lifting required, cleaning bathrooms required of everyone, marinating meat is required of all staff. management could use people skills"
bad,"The job requires a lot of patients and a lot on your feet. The job can be stressful, you have to work with some people who may not like how you make the food"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,My experience there is not so well the manger treats you like. Your in high school basically we don’t  open at a good time. I worked an 15 hr shift and the manger complained when we had less employees on the roster. There’s no respect at all they ignore you or yell at you.  And don’t care about no one but themselves it’s supposed to be about team work like a family no self work
bad,I work for Chipotle for 2 months I just recently quit it's not worth the money and amount of stuff u gotta do a lot of work u gotta do in little amount of time management was childish and unprofessional I work for the chiplote by the Florida Mall they give u the hours but u don't see those hours on your paycheck u see less I wouldn't go back they lie about the pay And don't matter how much experience u have start lil pay takes awhile to moved in the company from what ppl told me takes years if you're on prep u have to do all the dishes by yourself no helped and do prep at the same time without helped management doesn't care think it's a joke only care about their self's wouldn't recommend anyway to work here
bad,"I was only at the Burbank location for 2 months. The management was very rude to me. I was hired for a communications/specialist position. They fed me the lines of independent work, saying I could help raise daily sales. And it turned into me doing regular food line work and only a little bit of management. I had co workers disregard my position and blatantly talk about me while I was near. I do not speak Spanish, but understand enough to know when someone is speaking ill about me. I had to talk to management a number of times about the employees not wanting to help me because they felt I didn't deserve the position I held."
bad,Would not recommend friends unless you are a recent high school graduate or someone looking for temporary work this is the place for you. Compensation is better elsewhere.
bad,"Managers don't care about you as a person, you are just a worker to them. They give you no respect, and will send you home just to save on labor. "
bad,"A work day was pretty hard for me, because the managing skills was horrible. "
bad,A tough job if you can handle opening after you close the night before and being made to punch out and continue working. Very young management staff..
bad,long hours with mandatory off the clock work requirements.  No over time allowed but required to do functions that you do not get paid for. Poor food safety culture and retaliation if you point out the store short comings.  No support and forced training to advance with out pay.
bad,"I learned a lot. How to deal with angry customers, how to work fast paced, maintain my dinning room clean during the rush. GM was not a good GM. My service managers deserved another promotion. GM was not fair at all. Hardest part was dealing with all the drama, cleaning the way they want you to when your're not getting paid enough. Enjoyed my time with my coworkers. We were and still are like a family."
bad,"It was my first day and they basically just threw me out there to the wolves!  Cried the way to my house plenty of times.  Bad manger,, food is great."
bad,My work days go by really fast so thats the best part and I learned how to cook the chicken and steak but the mnagament sucks really bad but the coworkers were fn to be around
bad,i did not enjoy working at Chipotle because there was lack of encouragement and motivation. no promotion no motivation.
bad,"I came into my employment at Chipotle with an open mind and positive attitude, even though I was the youngest employee on the crew. I loved my job until the other employees began to mock me and exclude me. I was constantly yelled at or made fun of, even when they fired me for being too shy and not having the boisterous attitude of the rest of the crew, one of the two managers firing me began to laugh so hard she hard to turn away from me."
bad,"slave drivers. worked under some lazy management that would take away hours if they got ""mad"" at anyone"
bad,Working at Chipotle was a terrible job. In the few months working there we went through four managers due to lack or organization.
bad,"a work day was fast loud and fun, i learned the quickness and quality of great food. management was too young and i feel did not uphold the standard of the drug free or great customer experiences to the high standards. my co workers were just as immature and low standard and the service we provided and customer care. the hardest day about the job was the favoritism around the workplace.the most enjoyable part of the day was i was able to cook"
bad,"to much competing on who is better than who, managers are not to serious."
bad,"Working for Chipotle started off great. But as time when by nothing about the job improved. As they were trying to get an advancement in the company, they stopped caring at all about the employees. We were expected to do twice as much in the same amount of time. We were scolded by the managers and treated like children. The managers were cruel and did not care at all about your life outside of work or your other commitments. They did not let you leave until all the work they wanted you to do was done no matter how late you stayed. But if you did not have a lot of work to do they would make you leave with 3 hours left on your shift."
bad,"The Huntsville location will only be good for you if you fit in ""the plan."""
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"When I first started here 2 years ago, I loved it! But it slowly started to unravel the longer I worked. Managers don’t care about the little guy’s in the operation, just the business. There is no sense of accomplishment, nor equality. Obviously this varies from store to store, like I’ve worked at about 4 stores now, and only 2 did I feel like I was there for a reason, but the one in Roseville, I would NEVER ever recommend my friends to work there"
bad,"Chipotle in  Camillus, New York was a horrible experience to work at. The management team were very unprofessional  and didn't respect their employees.  The food it self is always amazing but the staff was unbelievable and I wouldn't go back and work there ever again"
bad,I personally despise not only the manager but the management of the business. The lack of communication within the industry is just ridiculous. And the scheduling is unorganized as well and trying to get your days off was complicated too.
bad,"1. The disrespect  is atrocious and even if you bring it to the G.m multiple times it doesn't matter he will will just say he will handle it but wont because he is friends or familywith the people who are disrespectful 2. No breaks even if you have a 7+ hr shift if you dont get ""finished on time with prep"" and that's IF they dont add more to your plate during your prep.And they will mess with ur time to make it seem like they gave you a break although they didnt. 3. Gm is related to the manager and they love to team up on people and for those who dont speak spanish , learn basic words because most things they talk about shouldn't be spoken . Theres simply alot wrong there but goodluck if you decide to work there ! .                         "
bad,Should not stress out this much. It’s problem after problem in my store and they are not great with there employees and mistreat them. Not organize at all.
bad,"It was my first job, I thought I had been doing really well, I took all the feedback into consideration, but it was a lot of very fast-paced work and a lot of cleaning. Apparently, I wasn't fast enough for them. So on my birthday, they met me in the parking lot and told me that I was a good person and I could use them as a reference, but they would have to let me go because I was not catching on quick enough. I was struggling to pay for school and counting on that job to make payments. And I had to frequently deal with hostility with another coworker who was upset that I didn't give his sister free food, and also got into a lot of trouble for doing exactly as the manager said and giving free food to whomever he said to and putting everyone that came through the line during a fundraiser on the fundraiser, which we apparently weren't supposed to do. I also wasn't allowed to clock in until my drawer was ready, and often got into trouble for ""being late"" according to the time clock, even though I always showed up ten minutes early."
bad,"Maybe a good job for someone young ,  because I said I liked taking care of customers they abused that by making me always stop what job I was doing to wait on them while they would be standing there doing nothing. Only worked there 4 weeks ."
bad,"At the time I worked there they only had two people for management positions each at 60-70 hours per week which I found ridiculous because the location I worked at needed AT LEAST another 2 or 3 managers because of how busy we were. They also never held afternoon shift accountable. I usually worked the closing shift and often had to do the work the afternoon shift didn't bother to do which automatically set me back 30 minutes to an hour in an already stressful and fast paced position or else I would be the one in trouble :/. It also couldn't hurt to have another person working in the back as well. More often than not I had to work through my lunch break just to make sure I didn't fall light years behind when I got back. Word of advice to anyone applying there, work on the line or as cashier. Because unless things have changed, the stress and coming home smelling like the food is not worth $9.50/hour at all."
bad,"It feels like everything you do is unappreciated and not enough. Very stressful environment. Always short staffed, prepare to get 40+ hours even when you are not full time with no full time benefits. The managers are very bad, unprofessional, and do not know what they are doing. If you ask for lower hours they ignore your request. Good luck getting a break, and if you ask they straight up say no or not now and give you attitude. Basically, profit over workers needs and concerns. Its too much work for little pay."
bad,"Management was poor, trained employees completely wrong. Worked almost a month without being paid due to manager laziness. Store was in constant threat of being shut down."
bad,"Once you work for them, you'll quickly realize that Chipotle is just fast food masquerading as something above casual dining. You work to the standards of Texas De Brazil but are treated like a Mcdonald's cashier by the customers, management and corporate. they egg you on with promotions and raises to make you think, ""okay, I'll stay a little longer for this,"" just for it to never happen. They don't value their good employees. The lazy employees can waddle around doing line wipes and having no-call no-shows and nobody will apprehend them, but god forbid a top performer is two minutes late with a phone call. the stressful environment teaches patience, dedication and dependibility and can really breed a good employee however, so give it a go but don't get stuck there."
bad,There’s not much advancement anymore. alot of work for management with no extra pay. They fire you if you call off sick to many times. Hire people without properly scanning their documents. Favoritism. Staffing is ridiculous. Field leaders cover up things for the GM.
bad,"very stressfull"
bad,not a secure job that does not pay for what they expect in an employee. They blur the line of personal and professional and have no respect for a life of your own.
bad,"My location was a brand new store. We went through 4 different SETS of managers. Not just one new manager each time, you have at least 3 managers and they all kept getting fired or quitting. The company culture sounds amazing but was never ever implemented. Upper management would come and make changes but not be the ones having to jump through the hoops to meet all the new requirements. My coworkers were all young and fun. Very fast paced you are always doing something."
bad,The manager was terrible.  She would always target me and not understand the way my life is currently. She would always choose favorites and If you weren't her favorite
bad,"Management was garbage, you do way more work than what you're paid for, coworkers are metiches and no one follows standards like they're supposed to, if you call them out they all turn against you and try to get you fired."
bad,"My experience working at Chipotle will always be different from anyone else's. The employees take 10-15 minute breaks on every chance they can get, so if you want water you have to wait until your co-worker comes back from gossiping in the back. Management seem to be missing the ""manage"" part because the associates literally do whatever they felt like doing."
bad,"Need better managers , better work  environment , be treated fairly, and  take consideration of the people who are learning something new they have never done before."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"Management were unprofessional, and carried themselves poorly."
bad,"Learned a lot good skils at chipotle , very faqst paced, standing on my feet all day, rarely time to get breaks, lifting up to 50 lbs daILY. No room to excel or grow due to the inconsistency of my manager."
bad,"It was a nice job, but fast food wasn't for me! My training lasted about one day on each station, and they kept me as a primary grill cook, despite knowing that I was going to college a couple months after hire. I interviewed for a part time position and was kept at fulltime hours because of shortage of staff which ultimately left to my leaving as there was no balance in my life as a new college student."
bad,"Not feeling comfortable working there. Stressful, dont care about their employees, not enough hours, management differs from store to store. "
bad,"Everything is wrong with this place (well at the location I worked at). They are very manipulative and immature people. For this company to have a high demand rate, they have no respect for employees."
bad,Bad management skills from the main manager. They like to sweep problems under the rug when is convenient to them and their own job. Very disrespectful GM. He don’t know how to run a store always messing up and having others lift his weight and theirs.
bad,"The company has your back so long as you show up and do the work. Usually the pace is fast and you have to stay on top of your schedule so you can open on time. If  you have good time-management that part is easy. However if you have a emergency medical situation come up where you are in the hospital, they will fire you as soon as your sick leave is up. Also, don't even think that they will offer FMLA if you are part time. Forget it. Plus the insurance package that they offer only covers PREVENTATIVE CARE and nothing else. I still am paying 4000 in medical bills for lab work that I had to have because of my hospital stay because the insurance did not cover ANYTHING. I had been an employee with them for over a year, so I should have qualified for a decent insurance package but I found out that only managers get something like that. Since I was not a manger, I did not qualify to get any decent coverage. Then they pull the rug out from under me by letting me go because my therapy (which I was finished with while I was on my leave of absence) interfered with my schedule which I had not even received. I was told by my GM that the regional manager had to have the final say, but I was never contacted by either my GM or the regional manager about my employment status, so I came into the restaurant to personally talk to my manger two days after I sent a correspondence that was not answered. When I met with him, I was given the run-around and was told that he would be in touch with me within a week. A week later, no contact. So I went back only to find out I was let go by a co-worker"
bad,"I ended up quitting the job because the team members would constantly say things to me, rush me, and blame me for being the reason we got out late and had too many dishes left to wash. The manager even said I was slow and was holding everyone back , couldn’t she try to put herself in my shoes . How can someone have more motivation to finish things when everyone is bringing you down with words."
bad,A typical day at the Chipotle location where I was employed started with lots of food preparation.  Very busy peak business hours during lunch and dinner.  More food preparation in the afternoon before the dinner rush.  There was no team work at this location which made it a hard place to work.
bad,This place was bad they expected me to know all the recipes by memory within a day and they wanted me to a lot of thing while the other workers didn’t even do anything. They didn’t even send me my last check and I had worked like 30-40 HRs for it. It was just a really bad place with really bad management.
bad,"My review speaks for itself. Terrible competitive culture. On your feet for eight or more hours per day with a half hour break *offered* but typically they expect you to eat as fast as you can and come back to work. At first I loved this company and brought my A game every single day.... I'm the type of person who will work hard every second I'm on shift to better myself and my team and I liked that Chipotle boasted it's team oriented, high standards and community based culture but I soon learned this wasn't true. I struggled to make this a great place to work for two years before finally giving up and getting a job where I actually felt respected."
bad,Proper training should be provided for new employees and new managers. The hardest part of the job is dealing with either mornings or night shifts unfinished tasks. Also dealing with rude customers or the homeless coming into the store interrupting customers in the lobby. Another thing that was also difficult is working in the store that provides catering and has a low staff. The most enjoyable part of the job is when you get to work with people that like to get the job done and be stress free. When you get to work with those who like working in a fast pace your entire shift is awesome. It goes smooth and all you really get to worry about is providing great customer service.
bad,"Nothing special, good for quick money. Getting promoted is a hassle and the environment is stressful at times. Becoming a certified trainer is like becoming a manager without the pay."
bad,"Chipotle is a company that relys on kissing up to your managers for job advancements and quick learning. If you do not learn your position within a matter of days they leave you out to dry. Little to no training, Angry Managers, Stress, and always down one to two employees a shift. Lazy people are not punished, but the people who work hard but complain about the lack of help are tormented and abused. This is a horrible place to work."
bad,"Although I did learn a lot of team work at Chipotle, the managment was awful and when under pressure i was left alone on line 99 percent of the time and still got the job done. Being timed and under pressure is hard but I still got the job done as fast as I could to satisfy the customers. Most workers relaxed in the back and fooled around while i was working full time in school trying to get enough money to buy what I need."

This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"There was a lot to be done and the paycheck was so little. Worked extra hours every day and still, it wasn't enough because I was getting paid 9.15 per hour and the people who got hired after me got paid more."
bad,"I was working when the E-coli outbreak was ruining the food. Also, I was there when the managers were highly favorable over certain employees. Dishonorable experience lead by managers who were inexperienced."
bad,"My experience with Chipotle was not the best but it may have been just the restaraunt I worked for. I learned how to work as a team and developed good communication skills when interacting with customers. However, the management did not take into consideration that I am a full time college student and would schedule me during my class hours, which caused my grade point average to drop."
bad,"Great concept but poor management. Worst company you can work for. If you have a family this is not the company for you, they dint care about you or your family, long hours. Managers have to do a lot of hands on work... not your typical 10 hrs a day."
bad,"i got hired just by taking about working in a fast pace environment with no restaurant experience.  all we disscused was my position i would be grill cook and hourly pay. when i started i was told to wash dishes. day after day the same thing did not get the training yet to work on grill. their is no breaks! u work your whole shift! when the chipotle close you get employee meals food to take home. again no breaks. i seen i had 13hrs for the week on the schedule. i asked the manager why did i have that many hours? she said youre part time and we dont have enough hours to give out. also said only service managers and management gets full time ours. chipotle closes around 10pm but with all the dishes u wont leave till 1230 1am. following week started training to prep food. chicken, steak, peel and cut onion, peppers. still have been train what i was hire for grill cook.  next week 9 hours on the schedule for the week. which is not acceptible!! i spoke to the GM about that is no liveable hrs! they bump me up to 25 hrs then i work 38hrs but. but with the hours came disrespect and pressure of being yelled at and being rushed on a daily basis. they're was good days and bad days. but i was pushed to the limit when i was yelled out for not working fast enought in front of customer. UNACCEPTABLE! 4 managers and crew was very cool! the rest was rude, power hungry to feed their ego. they was young about 19 talking down to people as myself (34) and another employee (50). its a good job for a teenagers just starting out from hight school or something. I spoke to the GM very nice had no idea"
bad,"Good place for hands on training, apply what you learned for the next related job and company after all everything really help on the resume whether its temp, per-diem or on call or even seasonal, it does help for job references considering as a starter."
bad,"My manager at night would tell me one thing while the manager in the morning would tell me another. they wouldn't send me on break half the time i got one, and when i did they would rush me through it to get back on the line. The night manager was always a jerk to any new people and literally bullied one girl out of a job her first day there. If you want to work here reconsider"
bad,I was a kitchen trainee hired on through a manager that I thought I knew. The work environment is fast- paced. It is essential to prep on time for all meals. Management positions can be very stressful.
bad,"The chipotle I worked for was horrible, lack of management I was promised to move up and was doing things I should of been getting a higher pay for doing but they kept telling me it will happen soon and it never did there very unorganized"
bad,"The working environment is very stressful in the chipotle restaurant. There are many fast pace times of the day and the managers are not as helpful as they could be. One manager will tell you one thing, while the next manager tells you something totally different that contradicts what the first manager told you. It was quite stressful and frankly I did not have the type of time to venture further into the chipotle business"
bad,"Training is extremely poor, New hires are thrown to the wolves and experienced workers are left to pick up the slack.  up and coming GM openly hates military and police officers and has wished the death upon them! Schedules do not get done until the last second!"
bad,"The management here is poor, don't have schedules on time. Always short on people. Hard to learn new things because they don't teach properly. Never leave on time, always making you stay longer than you have to. Coworkers don't get along with each other and managers don't do anything about the issue even when people come up and tell them."
bad,"fast pace work environment, very busy, always something to do, preparing foods, cooking on the deep fryer, maintaining cleanliness at all times, learning to prepare different meats and burrito bowls"
bad,ok for students that is looking for a job during or after the school year. if you share your availability you can insure class or any person matters don't interfere.
bad,"the management was poor which led to confusion in shift change and general workflow. the management was changed recently, however is still very unorganized and unprofessional. Lots of drama in this workplace."
bad,"I learned some great things like cooking within a restaurant setting and even how a restaurant works. Even down to meeting some great coworkers who on some levels have become family to me. But the culture there was tainted by the leadership there. They treated it much like high school. if they didn't like you, regardless of your level of excellent work, they would not elevate you. Created a culture of racism within the store which is completely against the picture painted at orientation. People who were spanish decent were often to able to do what they wanted without consequences. But a person of african american decent were released immediately for wrong doing or simply because they weren't liked by a few of the management team. i do not believe this is the whole company, but this is an undercurrent issue within the company that needs to be eliminated."
bad,"I had a great work crew team every individual crew member was always respectful and trying to help each other out and doing as much possible to make the store great. But managment i realized are very shady.. if you are in a supervisor position or a G.M. you are the bosses but some are not fit to be in that position. They fire people for personal reasons instead of actual reasons you expect to be hold too. For example if maybe a new G.M. comes to the store and he doesnt really like you he can find small reasons or try to push and achieve those reasons by setting an individual up for failure, I was terminated from my position at a chipotle establishment here in Mountain View when i saw the weekly shedule when it was made and was said to be the offial schedule and i had one of my days off on sunday so i took it. A d then i show up monday morning and get the news i was terminated because they changed the scheduel half way through the week and dont let us know they have made changes and dont even bother to call me or try to contact me to let me know or see what was happening kus i was on da schedule.. but they instead just call some one to cover me and dont try to reach me at my cell phone number they have and just already have a pre made plan to terminate me.. and all week already i had work 2 opening to closings shift because of under staffing, so that means i worked like about 730 a.m. to 1130 p.m. and i didnt even heaitate to do that to help the store not be short too many people and then same week they do that shady little move of terminating me with no warning or bothering"
bad,This store is typically slow. And there isn't too many tasks that you have to complete throughout the day. The customers are nice and very easy to satisfy. The co-workers are easy to get along with as well. The one thing that I enjoyed here was running the ice cream stand.
bad,i am glad ia m not with the company do to the circumstances. there were was a game of favorites being played as far as moving up in the company i was looked passed even though i was had inquired about it and when i made the move for myself it was held aganist me
bad,I been with chipotle for a few years and it always been great to me and i learned alot and grown with the company.But The Management Staff & Team Leader In The 483 Store And Not Doing Things The Chipotle Way.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of slicing lemons, and also limes. Filling the soda machine with ice, cleaning bathrooms, cashiering, washing dishes and also helping the crew on the line. I learned about how healthy Chipotle actually can be. The management here was not all that great. There were some managers that were hispanic and thought just because we were teenagers at the time and we were african american we did not understand spanish. They would talk about us in spanish like we were dogs. The hardest part of the job would have to had been Closing everyday, and also cleaning not only the Womens bathroom, but also the Mens bathroom. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work and if we finished doing everything we would possibly get to leave early."
bad,"I learned how to pick up the speed and be very fast paste. I learned so much about customer satisfactory, but working with managers who barely knew what to do was the problem."
bad,"When being brought on board with Chipotle, the management was very adamant that promotions within the company were a very common occurrence, and that it was a fair and fun work environment. "
bad,"Long busy days"
bad,"preparation for all meals, cleaning, washing dishes. The hardest part of the job was timing."
bad,once you clock in you check the line or your station and see what needs to be prepped. make sure everything is cleaned and ready to go. management except for one person really was a let down. The thing i enjoyed most was helping customers.
bad,"Working in Chipotle is very tiring, especially if it is a busy day. after  a month you get really tired because you are constantly doing the same thing. I did learned a lot of key elements that improve customer service. I also learn how to prepare and cook the food. At the Chipotle that I was located, the management was very poor. some of the managers would invite the employees to commit illegal activities such as consuming drugs like marijuana  and alcohol in the stores' bathrooms, (the alcohol used for sale). The hardest working part in there is working under pressure, things have to be done at a curtain time everyday and the most enjoyable moment is when you clock out."
bad,"If I could describe Chipotle in one word, it would be ""cult."" What they want from you is 24-hour dedication, delirious enthusiasm, and a deep desire to get your manager a promotion. If you have a life outside of work, or worse, school, then you are obviously not a team player and you need not apply."
bad,"Go in to work and from the moment you step into the door the get out the figurative whips and put you to work. Most of the time while I was working I had fun, until the shift ended and the manager required me to work without pay to clean the restaurant."
bad,"Please take note that I have only worked at the New Albany location, and do not know anything about other locations."
bad,Chipotle is a very selfish corporation they seem to only care about the customers and not the actual employees serving the guest. You’ll see some workers getting paid to do whatever they please and other who barely get their breaks.
bad,"The customers are rude, entitled in the area where I work, they expect everything for nothing. The employee pay isn’t equal. You could be training someone new who is coming in with a higher pay than you. The work environment can be stressful, because it does get busy, and there is a lot to keep up with food wise especially. Can be a bit draining if you work long hours or everyday."
bad,"As much as I hate to say it, chipotle was and is one of the worst job experiences I've ever had. Exclusion,  favouritism, instances of blatant disregard for procedure/management. Managers don't care and will do things their way until I higher up comes around. People will cover lies for each other, nothing they do makes sense."
bad,"I was lucky enough to always get one person with me on a shift that I knew and liked. 1/3rd of the managers cared about me, the rest treated me like an idiot and stole my tips and wages. The company doesn't care. Wouldn't work here unless you're desperate"
bad,"In general, not a good place to work. Management doesn't care about you and will either work you to the bone or cut your hours at the slightest provocation."
bad,"They always have unintelligent employees, lazy management, unfair pay, and you have to beg for a raise. Always under staffed. Most stressful job I have ever had."
bad,I would not work for chipotle again. Maybe other Chipotle’s are better to work for but strongly don’t recommend the Chipotle in Enfield CT. Half of the employees seem to think they are management and some of the management finds it okay for these employees to try to tell other employees “what to do” when they themselves don’t even run or follow by the rules. I left this location due to feeling uncomfortable in the environment. Too much drama for a work place.
bad,You bust your butt everyday. Never a set schedule or even in fact a schedule posted a week in advanced. Management sucks. You get one free meal but cannot take said meal home.
bad,"Management took advantage of workers, only were clean and tidy when health inspector came in, pressures underaged highschoolers to work. not enough pay seeing as how stressful it is and how busy it is."
bad,Management often didnt schedule enough people so that if someone did not show there was an immediate issue with not enough people. Low-pay and too fast paced.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"If you like your fellow employees to call out all the time and make life hard, than this is the place for you. Really lame call out policy. Basically any body can call out whenever they want and still get paid. This causes the good staff to get burned out fast. Lame Company!!!"
bad,"While working here the management always had some sort of drama going on that often took away from productivity of the store. The tension was always there. One of the good and only takeaways I can have from"
bad,No communication between higher field leader and gm. Promises made and never went through for advancing in management. No overtime hours. Very fast paced environment.
bad,"The GM makes people cry if they make mistakes and doesn’t help teach anyone. Also the GM hangs out/parties"
bad,"Free food and the customers were the only good thing about this job. The managers and even THEIR boss were 100% unfair, they all chose favorites. Dont consider how you feel if you have anxiety. Got in trouble for things other employees would do daily."
bad,"The general manager is super awful and rude. He’ll talk about you behind your back and make fun of your appearance. He blames other people for anything that goes wrong, and won’t accept any responsibility himself. He’s always super desperate for workers because anyone who works for him, hates him and automatically wants to leave. He’s not a good person, and he doesn’t deserve a job there. Other than him, Chipotle teaches you to work hard, and to be a leader."
bad,"Working there isn't always a problem, I used to enjoy going in to work. Management started being lazy with scheduling and wouldn't communicate, they change the schedule all week for that week. Drama is everywhere, and management doesn't care for employees. Bad pay, no promotions, no paid time off. They've lost four people in a few weeks due to management."
bad,"Typical day was manager meeting in the AM to go over numbers, then food prep assign task for the day. Handled all customer issues, as well any employee issues. Advancement was only afforded to particular individuals; it was not a fair playing field."
bad,"Training sucks..so you have alot of people not knowing how to do their job."
bad,"As a General Manager, you feel like a crew member. There is no time to get anything done other than prep. There are not enough hours in a labor matrix to get your daily tasks done. There is very little support from the upper management, and horrible training."
bad,Management sucked they do not listen to you and they do it’s best for the company and not for its employees also they don’t care if something happens to you and you can’t make it as long as you can get someone to cover you also when the head manager comes we all have to act different and he doesn’t care if we make complaints as long as he looks good
bad,"The managers are aggressive, unprofessional and irrational at some stores, which creates a hostile work environment. I was once punished for having mono and calling out of work, even though I gave them two days notice. I was not put on the schedule for 2-3 weeks and almost lost my tuition reimbursement. A manager once told me I couldn't leave because I didn't sign my meal receipt in the right place. When I asked why it mattered and if there was a policy for it, he replied: ""I am the manager and this is the way I want it, so this is the way you will do it."" I felt uncomfortable in that environment and that no matter how well I did my job and how much extra work I did, I was always in trouble for something irrelevant. Micromanaging would be a good word to use."
bad,"Honestly the pay is okay - it’s really hard to get a raise- but the hours are unstable one week you’ll have 35 and the next you’ll have 14 hours and the staff is all drama and no work"
bad,"A typical day would be stressful, loud, and lack of help from team members. Management was poorly provided. Hardest part of the job is the employees that work there."
bad,"I enjoyed working there at first till I saw how shady the management was. I was not told about 10 minute breaks for about 2 weeks. I was never reimbursed. The people who enforce the rules are the main ones not following them. They take breaks for so long. One time I went to use the restroom and one employee came to the restroom to find me and ask me to sign a receipt. It was highly insulting. "
bad,"-management was rude "
bad,"The management was inconsistent,  unorganized  and did not have store in order. Management consistently was changing and did not give proper training to mew employees."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,Chipotle has poor management and has trouble keeping people in there jobs .I worked 50 hours a week and was never compensated like I should have been .
bad,"Great training systems, with no labor to implement. Little or no support from Field Leaders. Poor technology!!! Sink or swim environment. Fantastic job if you want to put up with all the obstacles that get in your way of being an effective leader."
bad,"Was hardly ever staffed enough, and those who did have to work the shifts were spread thin with things to do. Management didn't know how to properly do their job, and would in turn stress out their crew."
bad,Chipotle Mexican Grill seems like a great place to work at but in reality it isnt. Ive seen people come and go like flies. Everyone is bitter and always in a bad mood. To management you never do the right thing. They basically expect you to do their work while they do nothing in the office. If you close they want you to do a good job but you HAVE to clean everything in like 15 minutes so the manager can get out early as if they're the only one thats tired.
bad,This company taught me many professional skills and helped me improve my leadership skills. However the management team doesn't seem to really care about their employees. Work-life balance is terrible since every store is always understaffed. Too much work and not enough pay.
bad,"In the Chipotle that I worked at, there was a lot of favoritism and many employees did not get reprimanded for mistakes. Some employees would leave the store while on the clock, and often slack off."
bad,"Very poor management makes for a stressful, unhealthy work environment. Employees should not have to come in to work with a manger/boss that does not know how to keep his or her “cool.”"
bad,"Apart from working 7 hour shifts and only receiving one 10 minute break, this place excepts you to bend over backwards for a dollar over minimum wage. Their insurance is barely excepted in more clinics. I have worked for this company for 2 years and I learned that  it is just filled with big-gits and high and mighty supervisor. Acting as if you have to clean a kitchen in a hospital and assuring you can't work while sick. Although of if you have health issues, this is not the place for you. They released me for being unreliable for calling in when I had the Flu. Shame On Chipotle for making me waste 2 years thinking I was going to be a Manager."
bad,"I did cashier and worked the line. No one trained me. I was just thrown into the chaos and told to figure it out. I got yelled at by the area manager for not doing things right. It was too busy and I never had time to clean. Management picks favorites and doesn't like to help when it gets busy. Long time employees are lazy and don't like to help do anything. They make all the new people do the hefty work while they stand around and dilly dally doing food prep. We used to run out of things a lot. They all took breaks during our rush hour so they didn't have to help with the chaos. It was just me and 2 girls working the front. I had 56 hours my last week. Not once was I allowed a break to eat lunch or even have some water (it is very hot by the grill and I dehydrate easy). I had to ask permission to use the bathroom. The customers were all super rude. Also free employee meal can only be eaten there you cannot take it home (which sucked after a 10 hr shift when I just wanted to take it home and eat). "
bad,The job was not hard at all its working around food. The only problem was how it was set up the general manger I had did not know how to run the store everything went down hill when she was hired.
bad,"I would usually work night shifts because the staff mainly consisted of High School kids who had to be home before 9pm because they had school, meaning I had to work even later, usually with no pay because they were cheap. Late night shifts are supposed to end at an hour after closing time but would later stay 2-3 hours later because the manager had crazy OCD."
bad,"None of this is bias. They work you like a slave. I was personally an assembly liner, but they had me doing food prep, dishes, cleaning, AND EVEN TRASH, all for minimum wage. If it’s not as busy as they thought it’d be, they cut your hours back, so if you’re part time, you’ll be working less than 20 hours a week, on minimum wage, which means now you’re making way less than the standard to live. The management is horrible, you can ask the cookers to make something but they’ll be so busy in a conversation it won’t be done. It’s HOT and humid behind that assembly line and there’s like no AC sometimes. Your gloves and fingers are constantly being burned from the tortilla cooker, and you have to go through all this with a smile because if the manager sees you not smiling they talk about you (they did it in my case, one of my coworkers came and told me) and then you don’t even get a free bowl to take home at night after all of that."
bad,The management team was unprofessional and talkative. I felt like the only way things would get done is if I sit there and do it myself. There were too many personal relationships between management and employees and the only benefit is tuition reimbursement after working there for a year.
bad,The crew and management is very mean and unwelcoming. The job is fast paced and there is practically no down time. Customers are rude and impatient. The only redeeming quality is the high pay for an entry level job.
bad,"This place is a great place to start off as a first job which it was for me, at 16. The employees are nice but sometimes we get too invested in this never ending line of customers that we do not provide proper customer service. Instead we talk quick and make sure we serve quick because seeing a huge line stresses us out."
bad,"A typical day is food safety from the moment you clocking to well after you close.The company no longer care for extensive training, instead cuts corners wherever they sacrificing profits over confident and empowered crew members."
bad,"If they don't like you, then they din't care. It's hard to get along with other co workers there. Sometimes you have to fake it to make it. every man for themselves in that job."
bad,"Everyone seemed nice at first but then everyone would start to be fake. "
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,this job doesn't not pay the grill employees as much as they want us to work . meaning the amount we get paid is not worth the amount of task we are required to do
bad,"It gets pretty mundane, you get pestered to do things that aren't your job. There were people fired without first replacing them, and now everyone has to pick up slack."
bad,"this was my first job, at the time it was fun but looking back it was a horrible job. management was like a bunch of high schoolers telling us what to do, drama was plague to this place."
bad,"Responsible for all operations of 14 restaurants: P&L management, cash flow, sales, sales and budget planning, training systems and implementation, food safety, hiring/developing managers, and creating an excellent guest experience. I am responsible for setting the vision, pace, and direction for my teams while achieving our company's goals. I am accountable for operational and personnel functions throughout my teams.  I work with my leadership team to attain maximum profits, return on investment, market share, guest goodwill, and team member satisfaction including: employee development, inventory management, merchandising strategies, and delivering on financial targets."
bad,it was cool for the first month than after the general saw i could pretty much cook prep and handle the meats and salsas they took advantage of me by doing stuff that they're favorite crew members didn't wanna do. couldn't take the nonesence longer han a year so i left i also didn't get my last check and paid time off.
bad,"Management was subpar, not very understanding. Management makes job harder than it needs to be. Not very many hours, not very flexible. Easy job. Hard time connecting with management because of race."
bad,"Everything you eat at a Chipotle Mexican Grill is made fresh every morning, which means there are 3 to 4 people working very hard from very early in the morning to ensure all the food is made from scratch at the Chipotle Standard that so many people have come to love. I believe the amount employees get paid is too little for the amount of work that has to be put in every day."
bad,The Company Stressed Me Out The Managers Or No Good They Tell You Do It Yourself They Will Not Help You Help You When Help Is Wanted Chipotle WestEnd Is Not A Good Restraunt
bad,"Most enjoyable part of the job was making new friends and being able to go home. a typical day at work would be come in, clock in look at what needs to be done for today, complete the task before opening then you would make sure everything is in order then start your day. I learned how to roll a burrito. the staff is very friendly but the manager was awful. they never replied to your texts as well as she was disrespectful."
bad,"Training took 3 months. There's alot of pressure/stress."
bad,A typical day at work was stressful and not enjoyable at all. I learned how to serve and take orders from customers. The management was not very good at all. The culture was alright. The hardest part of the job was communication. There was poor communication. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing friends from school.
bad,"worked here for 7 years. it was great, things have changed though. it was once the best place to work in Denver. that is in the past, it is no longer what it once was."
bad,It was very straight forward at chipotle. You'd clock in and do the same task you do every day. The only time it wasn't terrible was when I was able to listen to music and do the dishes.
bad,"If you don't see yourself working for Chipotle for the rest of your life, don't even apply. They only want people who want to become managers. As a crew member, they throw you out there in all types of environments."
bad,"The worst management ever. Coworkers and managers never communicate clearly with each other. Rules always get mixed up and they are very unorganized. Even if you tell your managers that you're taking a day off a month before the actual day, they'll give you trouble about it."
bad,it was an ok job there was always something to do easy to fall into your routine and had the ability to make tips for the whole team a few celebrities would come in from time to time. only thing i didnt like was that the management and employees were all on social media together and if you were not in the loop you were barely on the schedule other than that a great job
bad,Chipotle was a very strict invironment that would put down workers instead of trying to help them learn. I would not recommend anyone to work in that type of invironment.
bad,In my experience the managers did not deserve to work there. They acted like they were bosses of the people and felt obligated to move them like pawns and treat them as lesser people. Especially the apprentice at my location.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"chipotle was my first kitchen job, on which in about 6 months i got nominated as kitchen manger. the company start with this great ideal  of organic and fresh and safe food. but after they had that ecoli outbrek, their quality went down hard, i used to enjoy working here and eating here everyday, but all the changes were made so quickly that nor the employs or the customers had time to get used to it."
bad,I didn't enjoy working at this job at all. Everything from the management down to the customers were very rude and hard working with. Bathrooms we left unclean.
bad,I quit this place because they wouldn't let me go home after I electrocuted myself because of there ridiculous cleaning procedures. And including the time they made me show up at 4 am in the middle of winter and no one showed to unlock the door till 5.
bad,The managers here like to play favorites. If you are not a favorite you get fired. They will make it look like it's your fault by planning ahead an saying how you are doing all the wrong things. Someone can be doing the same as you or worse and being told they are perfect if they are a favorite. It's a rigged place that vows they meet health standards but in all honesty fake most of the temperatures for food checks or don't check food temperatures.  They expect quality and speed but the speed they demand will not meet the quality they want. The members on my level were the most wonderful part of my day.
bad,"I always enjoyed the food service industry, although when we had new management i really disliked how the transition occurred because non of the crew members got introduced, and the new management was rude and lazy."
bad,"Management was all over the place, for a month I had to tell them I couldn't work on certain days. Customers complain about everything, ""There was no Mr.Pibb."", ""There was no ice"", even though we clearly stated a customer broke the lever. If you can deal with whiny customers, incompetent management, unbalanced jobs, lack of training, no breaks and annoying team leaders and team directors. This is the place for you if not steer clear of this place, the only perk of working here are the other employees (if they are nice) and free food."
bad,The hardest part of the job is there are no standards. it is set by the managers depending on their own calculated statistics. No certain standards are followed
bad,"A typical day at Chipotle involves you as a manager coming in to no set-up and lines outside of the door until closing depending on your location. "
bad,"Not worth long term employment unless you only work and have nothing else to do with your life. If you are a person who goes to school, has a second job, even caring for a family, these factors will conflict with this specific chipotle location."
bad,"It was okay. There were always new people to work with which was interesting, but do not want to work here forever. I know I can find a better job to work in."
bad,I do not recommend this job to anyone unless you're desperate. They give you lots of hours but the pay is not good. There are a lot of empty promises about advancements but they never happen.
bad,"An average day revolves around the simple routine chores of a given station. Restocking, serving, cleaning, not much if any break from this routine."
bad,Where to begin... I was offered and accepted a kitchen manager position. Just to be encouraged by my GM and other GM's to work off the clock to learn the ropes and also to do inventory with them.
bad,"At the Chipotle store I worked at, a typical day consisted of tedious food prepping, customer service, attention to detail, and ended with more food prepping."
bad,"Streesfull, we work very hard at our stores but the company dont care about us or our familys. Lots of work load and no componsation only for the area managers."
bad,"This is a fast food job where the management is good, but not  great.  There is little opportunity for advancement, they do not work with school schedules."
bad,"Chipotle is like every other fast food restaurant business wise, they only care about making money and getting their bonuses and raises. all the hourly crew and managers get tossed around and treated like we don't matter."
bad,"It takes a certain type of person to be successful at Chipotle. In my opinion, the company is growing too quickly and corporate simply does not know how to deal with its rapid growth. Stores are given unrealistic business expectations about timing, budgeting, and hour tracking. Employees are usually overworked and can be terminated for being a ""low performer"" which is essentially a fictitious term created by corporate to fire employees without legitimate reason. "
bad,"Prepping food:"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"managers take advantage of hard workers and make them do the work the managers should be doing. part of chipotle employment is connecting with your people, which they think they do by having ""one on ones"", which really is just an excuse to get out of actually working for a half an hour or more and just talking bad about someone or something. Yes they could possibly be talking about ways too improve your performance, but stuff like that doesn't require sitting down with them and having a pointless, waste of time meeting. part of being a crew member at chipotle requires that if you see something being done incorrectly, you should point it out to either the person doing it or someone who can find out who did and correct their mistake. seems like a good way to keep everyone on the same page, unless the manager doesn't agree with what you pointed out, then it doesn't matter, even if it is against policy. Once you're a manager, youre set. they cant get fired uness they get caught stealing or something ridiculous, which still they probably wont lose their job. I had this manager who was supposed to open one day, we get there at 8, some at 7, and she didn't even call to say she was coming until almost 11, which is when we open, so the whole crew was waiting around for her for almost 2 hours. finally the GM shows up before the opening manager and they don't get the store open until 1!! and absolutely nothing happened to the opening manager...why? because the reason she was so late and overslept was because the previous night was the gms birthday and they went out and got trashed together..."
bad,"i invested two years of my life into Chipotle. I held onto the vision they want you to picture to drive you every day and night, success. I did everything i was asked to do and always looked for ways to improve myself and those around me. I saw new hires get promoted soon after they got the job. Not to speak bad about them but they were always less qualified than i was in all aspects not just the obvious. I was stuck in my crew uniform. I did get the opportunity to train for managment but i never got the promotion. I gave my GM my two weeks notice and let her know that i don't want to leave but if I'm not promoted soon i would have to look else where for another opportunity. Before i left her office she told me ""its hard to find someone to replace you. Ive been trying, but right now if i promote you we would have a hard time conducting business as usual and training people to run my stations would not be good for labor"
bad,"I sat the grill for 5-8 hours a day for up to 40 hours a week. I learned to grill meats, customer service, prep food for the day, start the grills, fryers, etc. Hardest part of the job was the heat 24/7 against your face. the most enjoyable part of the job was the culture and people."
bad,"Chipotle is ok if you plan to stay in the food industry forever. The management at the Santa Monica, California location is terrible. You will be outcasted by managers if you are not latino. They will not accomodate with your schedule unless you are one of the favorites. No matter how much work you put in or how hard you try, it is still not good enough. I did everything from chopping peppers in the back to washing dishes to running the grill or rolling burritos or making salsa and guacamole. Co workers are cool, they talk alot but if you keep your business to yourself it will be fine. Only good part was being paid. Work is not worth minimum wage, they work you like a dog for maybe 30 hours a week with 6 days of work and terrible pay. Dont do it to yourselves, youre better than that."
bad,A lot of gossip goes on at chipotle and sometimes the managers aren't managers. the overall experience eating there is completely different than working for them.
bad,"Full-time job with part-time paid."
bad,to many chief not enough indians. Management is very poor. There is to much of favoritism
bad,"I have been working for the company for over a year, many times have I been promised promotion. However I have yet to possess the title of manager, I have all of the qualities and attributes of leadership but no promotion to confirm it."
bad,Work was fun a lot great people but no room to advance really and if you were actually sick it’s rare that you can get a day off and a lot of turnover and no resources to reduce stress for workers
bad,"Poor management "
bad,"It has its excellant standards,  very organized job , fast paced,  working as a team and every little detail matter is their and customer comes first.  "
bad,Chipotle is very fast pace you have to make sure you are quick on your feet and make sure you are listening to what the customer is say stay focus and smile. But in the other hand the management there is bad they try to over run you and over work you especially if you have a open schedule.
bad,District Manager (they call it “Field Leader”) lies frequently and cares nothing for the success of his direct reports. He only cares for his own success.
bad,"You can lose everything you built as a manger just because someone didn’t sign a book I worked "
bad,It is a very stressful place to work especially if you are not used to the fast pace life. You are always on your feet. You get the hours that you ask for but it can get stressful.
bad,The people I worked with daily were amazing at their job and fun to be around. The management is terrible and I was punished for reporting uncleanliness within a store. I was threatened to be fired multiple time because I reported a store that should be shut down. I was sexually harassed by management multiple times and felt very uncomfortable when they were around.
bad,There are managers at chipotle who choose friends over the quality of work. This aspect of the business kills the culture and drives good employees out.
bad,"Never felt secure with my job, always felt like walking on egg shells with the management. When I left I was so unhappy with the job and all that I felt so much relief when I left there for good."
bad,"Not gonna lie, I worked here over a year and hated 90% of it. Turn over is crazy because of unrealistic expectations and awful and/or lack of training, so the people who have been there the longest have to constantly pick up the slack for everyone else."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"Management Did not care about your experience. knowledge or talents nor did upper management. . They only tended to hire, cross train and promoted their friends."
bad,"I transferred to a new location in hopes of escaping a manager that I didnt agree with only to find out that he was dating my new GM and basically running the store. Was offered a promotion during a time when the entire store basically left or got fired and months later it was still basically up in the air if I'd even get the training. All of a sudden comes out there's a ""sudden change in policy"" and I can no longer get said promotion. That sort of thing seems to happen quite often though so I wasn't too long for working there."
bad,"I worked for Chipotle for 2 years. Started off in South Carolina & transferred when I moved. The management drove me to leave. Policies are no where near being followed, and be prepared to have A LOT of work unloaded onto you, as current management seems to do that to the newer managers. Maturity is absent, among everyone! If you have issues, don’t expect them to be handled. Food Safety is not followed, management is extremely lazy with a high school mentality. Please be prepared mentally and physically if you decide you want to go for this position at this location. I left my job that I LOVED when I transferred here, and I have never quit any job since i started working. Very toxic, I would stay clear."
bad,"Working here showed me to be more of myself and to be comfortable working around people, I’m still working on  learning how to be patient with people but this job helps with teaching me that. When I first started I wasn’t trained by any managers AT ALL I was trained by employees who must mind you do everything differently from person to person, As for management if you enjoy being ridiculed and yelled at for the littlest things this is the job for you"
bad,"Good to work if it's your first job, but other than that it sucks. Managers are impatient and demanding, no matter how fast you work it's never good enough. New tasks will get dumped on top of your normal work tasks on a daily basis and you will be criticized for not keeping up with other coworkers who have easier jobs and who have worked at Chipotle longer than you. My manager was offended that I even asked to take a break, because he doesn't take breaks (which is illegal BTW) no one else should either by his logic. If you work on a fundraiser, good luck getting a meal before you work or getting out before midnight. Overall a bad place to advance."
bad,Stressful and non supportive environment. They push you through without finding out how to teach you they don’t want to bother teaching you how to get better
bad,"Would I recommend that someone work at Chipotle? Maybe my worse enemy..."
bad,"At first it was fun, but as time went on there was no structure, I have never gotten a raise, I don't remember the last time I got a break, so after an 8 hour shift I would eat when we closed which would put me back on my closing.... The management lately has been horrible and stressful, especially if you're still in school."
bad,"Since I’ve been there everything has changed including the managers. I worked there a couple months ago and it was terrible. The managers were rude and super unprofessional. They argued with eachother and the crew. It’s like any other job though, but here the pay was good. It starts off at 10 (7.25 being the minimum wage) foods good."
bad,Management likes to put as little work in as possible while expecting the most from you. Was always told they can find better people at any time and it made you feel like you were not important.
bad,"Being a veteran of this the company and watching the people culture and overall mission change, I’ve watched Chipotle as a company spiral downward significantly. From starting at a job where the employees development and skills were highly focused on, I’m highly disappointed on where their mission went. Now a days, Chipotle uses that same old slogan “Customers Are always Right”, which in terms they should be leaving happy and excited to come back, but what happened to the employees being empowered, and having high standards? The vision that I learned and grew to love, “creating a team of top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards” no longer exists, and I wish that would come back into the work place."
bad,Got .05$ raises. Was asked to work off the clock... management was poor. Food was good learned knife skills. Recipes were easy. Overall not a bad job if the pay was better.
bad,I didnt really enjoy my experience there because there were to many different orders giving alot of days and then your blamed for the miscommunication lack of leadership
bad,Loved the job but the management team where i worked were not too kind to women of a certain race. Loved the customers that would come in and enjoy the great food Chipotle has to offer!
bad,The pursuit of perfection is almost unattainable with chipotle standards. Ridiculous sick policy. In 5 months I saw 22 managers come and go. Not good for job stability.
bad,"This job was very stressful, I was constantly lied to by management. And my coworkers were very lazy. I would not recommend working there to anyone. Period!"
bad,"First off, not worth working here. They talk about expectations, but they have very unreasonable expectations. Other restaurants are paying way above what they pay their employees- and those other restaurants expect less of their employees. You will burn out very fast."
bad,"I worked for Chipotle for almost two years and I was treated like garbage by my field leader and previous general managers. I was pulling double shifts, closing the store by myself, and worked with under performing crews consistently. I would get an ""honest conversation"" every time I told them no, that I didn't want to come in on my day off. I was going to school full time and they didn't care that I needed time to study. Out of the 2 years that I worked there, I was only given one performance review and never got a raise once. When I asked for a raise, they told me to ""wait till you get a performance review"" and those never happened. I had an incident where two coworkers were sexually harassing me, and when I brought it to my field leaders attention, it was swept under the rug and nothing was ever done about it. I think Chipotle could have some great potential, but with the lack of empathy from upper management, Chipotle is going to go downhill, very fast."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"Poor management"
bad,"Chipotle was the best place to work.  We worked hard for ideals - do the right thing for the customer, the worker, the farmer, the animals, and the shareholder, too."
bad,"Personally, I think everything Chipotle stands for is great, but at the specific location I worked at, my own managers lacked some of the 13 traits chipotle looks for in an employee. It's a quick-paced environment, so you have to stay on your toes"
bad,"Not a place I would recommend working at even as a high school kid. The starting pay is around minimum wage ($9/hr), and they expect you to work at your peak for the entire shift. Must be quick, friendly, and mindful. "
bad,"Had my head manager lie to my face about pay advancements and why I was making less per hour than my fellow coworkers. She claimed my friends I worked with for so long were “lying” to me in an attempt to make me feel bad and to bring me down. Then she goes on with an anecdote that had nothing to do with the conversation, which assured me she was lying. If I were you, avoid the specific Chipotle on 1708 Main St, Longmont, CO 80501"
bad,"this is a very fast paced work place, which was kind of fun at times, but the managers at the store I worked at were very unprofessional, they spoke down on almost every employee including the underage ones which I think Is very petty since they are grown adults, almost everyone who worked there was too busy talking about each other to care about their jobs."
bad,If you have the right management and the right team this can be a great place to work. Especially if you stay a crew member. If you have a great field leader then being a manger could be good as well.
bad,"Overall great company to work for but my certain location had bad management, Company pays well and has great incentives. they have health care and a college credit program."
bad,"Truly the worst job I have ever had. I would work 12+ shifts and not be allowed a break. Then my manager would be upset that I was shaky and grumpy - I ended up being fired for this reason. I would regularly have to stay 4+ hours past my scheduled time, sometimes until 3 or 4 AM. Management was the worst, and constantly guilt tripped us because they had to do more work than us (you're a manager... that's your job)"
bad,Their labor matrix is wack. They expect a lot out of their workers but provide decent benefits if you enjoy the work and stick with it. Upper management above GM's fail to see what it's like working in the restaurant and can't relate or understand symptoms to problems.
bad,Nothing special it is just a part time job they need to be more consistent not greatb hours it’s a good job for a first one but not a long term job. Need to move on
bad,"A typical day at work was stressful. Managers favored certain workers more than others, lack of communication between managers and crew. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the stressful environment in the right way."
bad,"Every worker is under valued at chipotle. From the basic crew member to the general manager. The GM is expected to work 55 hours or so but only has a salary of 55,000. So the best job is the hardest with decent compensation ? The worst part is the goal to become restaurant tuer. They endlessly push to become this but it usually does not happen or happens in an almost arbitrary way."
bad,"Other managers would always bring personal out of work problems into the workplace and made working there disastrous. Also, they frequently hire and fire managers which makes the crew members very confused and organized as for the other managers."
bad,"The company was a lot different when I first started working, but has undergone major changes in policy and focus over the years following foodborne illness outbreaks."
bad,"Bad environment created from bad General Manager, potential for a great work place but this specific manager has turned every positive into even more negatives from my experience working here."
bad,Stressful work place due to lack of communication throughout management and from managers to crew.The managers instead of teaching crew would punish or scold if they didnt know of tasks that needed to be done
bad,going to working and nothing was done from the night crew staying an extra 2 hours to help out and going over and beyond what i was supposed to do to make my boss happy
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"At first as a college student chipotle was a fun place to gain some experience. However, after being there for over two years the advancements did not come in as well as expected. Management is horrible and in little over two years with this company I have personally been through over ten managers of all management positions offered at chipotle. After being a dedicated worker, I was finally promoted to TOS after a year and 11 months. This personally is insulting after dedicating many hours of hard work to this company and pushing to move up. Whereas other employees that had just started and shown no skill for management were immediately promoted and failed shortly after. If you are up for dealing with people that have no work ethic, days that your shifts are short more than 2 people or horrible management then this is the place. Chipotle could be a better work environment if they really put effort into finding better management and properly training them instead of just placing people in roles to fill the void."
bad,"It's hard working there, only because of the people. I try my best to show that I can do more, but they only keep me in one position. I want to grow, but they aren't allow me to do so."
bad,"It started out good of course, but after the first year everything fell apart, managers lacked authority, Coworkers stopped trying, all the food started to come in bags instead of having us prep it like before. It was just a hot mess. @ SLU and Cap hill location."
bad,Chipotle was a great job but I remain a Assistant manger for 3 years and they never took interest on promoting me to GM. I left chipotle due to lack of growth within the company.
bad,"A typical day at Chipotle was walking into a shift not set up for success. Meaning you had to pick up the slack of the other manager who left on time while you're there all night. The culture is solid, which they spend a lot of time developing the standards and crew members, but the execution and desire to do so is poor. I really enjoyed my coworkers as they worked really hard but the standards are impossible and the pay is terrible. The company is ALWAYS scheming to fire someone and make them feel as if their job is at risk."
bad,My experience at Chipotle was fair. Easy set up easy rules. Just wasn't quite cut out for me but i will still recommend Chipotle to everyone. Also the pay is good.
bad,"No work/life balance and promotions are not fairly done. The company does not compensate employees properly and no longer promotes from within. Also, the job security and culture are questionable dependent on your field leader."
bad,At my store I was expected to do way too much for too little pay. I had no chance to advance and room for growth was the reason I started working there in the first place.
bad,I'll clock in wash hands then start cleaning up my work station. I'm ask customer what would they like on they burrito or salad bowl then side it down to my next coworker. When things on the line would start getting low I would inform my kitchen chefs  they can make more of what ever is needed.
bad,"They seperate the supervisor teams and each team complain to each other.  Almost of employee there are spenish. They can not speak English good. They talk spenish all the time, so I feel alone working there.  The supervisor can not speak good English, so can not good communicate with me."
bad,a typical work day was basically moving back in forth fast pace literally all day it was a lot of work for a little pay wish I was appreciated better it was really stressful
bad,Very negative environment I hated the job to many people wanting to be in charge no organization to many managers ..no organization ..no team work lack of communication
bad,Other then not getting a lot of hours and having a bad gm. The work experience was great everyone worked as a team. You got training on everything so a person could change positions if I wanted to
bad,"Terrible experience, they make you feel like you are not useful, most of the managers always tell you that you are doing everything wrong, they always tell you to work faster and faster... they never congrats when you make a good job"
bad,When I started with Chipotle it was amazing but unfortunately that has changed over the last few years. The people culture is gone and they demand too much on every level for the pay and benefits. It is very sad to see such a great company be destroyed so quickly.
bad,"I had only worked there for around half a year, but I was moved from the line to the dishwasher and was refused to change positions at every time I asked, even though nearly every other day I was asked to come in early, and the only time I was moved was when the management had absolutely nobody else to cover that position."
bad,"A normal day is completing customer orders and cleaning as people come in and out of the store. I've learned all the front end systems and how to keep the job business flowing. With a fun and energetic management and crew everyday is new and exciting. The hardest part about working here was customers that would stay late and throw off our normal closing time which extended out cleaning to that lead to getting out later, but the most enjoyable part was knowing that every customer walked in with a smile and walked out with a smile as well."
bad,I had an amazing time when I first started working there because I enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant as well as working with the customers. As time went on I began to hate how our overhead treated us as employees
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"Impossible to get needed time off"
bad,"Work could've been more organized, just never had enough workers to make nights go smooth.  I was an all around worker making sure positions ran smooth."
bad,Use to be great place to work. All about family/work balance. Slowly became just like any other restaurant...long hours no pay raise and family seemed to go to the wayside. Use to be a fun place to work. Not any longer.
bad,"great at selling a dream but upper managment was a nightmare. executing order was done out of whack. area managers not serious, when the company began hiring managers from outside and not allowing store managers to have any controll based on the market and location they began to fail badly.( ive seen chipotle grown in the DMV are and can say they are going backwards.and made decisions based on current situation and not looking at the long term effect of the decisions they were making . to the point where mabagers "
bad,The management there wasn't the greatest.  They were very disorganized at scheduling and availability.  It was a fast past job and would have to get things done at a specific time.
bad,"Too much work for little pay, and though the standards are being met business wise i don't  feel like behavior is. Overall i did not like the way many of the employees were acting or the managers reaction to them."
bad,"The communication between managers is nonexistent. The managers will say one thing one day, then say a completely different thing the next and yell at you when you do it the previous way they tell you too. Some of the managers are cool but most talk down to you and make you feel like you're stupid. They talk about having one on ones every month with the crew members to see where you stand and how you can do better, but they only do one on ones with their favorite crew members and leave the others out. Don't give breaks until the end of your shift and then send you home."
bad,"I remember being extremely excited when I started and that faded extremely quickly.  Right after I started management was shifted and everything went downhill.  I broke my hand and the new management team was very unaccommodating.  They constantly complained about how short staffed we were and although I was not able to assist in most prep work with one hand, I offered to do anything I was able to help the team but they refused the help.  Promotions there felt unattainable unless you were part of the inner circle; regular crew members were constantly berated and made to feel inferior while anyone in a management position could get away with just about anything from the way they spoke to us to being 2 hours late opening the store giving the rest of us no time to prep.  It was a nightmare."
bad,great crew members to start with but sadly management was horrible at my location lots of drama and backstabbing with the good managers leaving or transferring the incompetent ones remain driven by ego always constantly changing staff for personally preference not enough pay for the work put in
bad,The company itself is good but each store is given to one individual who has entirely to much power. they cover up their problems and bury them rather than fix them all at their crews expense. just hope to get hired by one of the decent restauranteurs.
bad,horrible place of business. mangers sucks they always try to blame the employees for their mistakes. typical day at work is long but sometimes slow. hardest part is making sure you multi-task
bad,"Management is not willing to cross train any new employee. The management does not host interviews, instead they bring people in to tell them that they are employed. "
bad,you will NOT have any free time. I'm a full time student and a full time worker and they never seem to have flexible hours. management don't care about you at all. they care about the customers more than the well being of the employee. don't even think about asking for a day off.
bad,"A typical day at work could vary greatly. As Apprentice of the store I was at, I would help to make sure all food was prepped, all supplies were ordered, crew was ready and looked presentable and store was above standards. I learned a lot about sustainable farming, all natural vs organic, the importance of coaching to empower and setting an example for the crew. The management seemed to lack once you got to a certain level. The co workers were great and we always seemed to get through busy times with ease as we went along each day. The hardest part of the job was the lack of commitment from my GM to continue to further my knowledge. There was a lack of communication that made it difficult to advance because it caused a lack in knowledge as well. Also, the hours I had to work made it hard to have any kind of home life. I was working 60+ hours a week in understaffed and busy times.The most enjoyable part was learning the new techniques and knowledge provided as well as helping the crew achieve personal and store goals."
bad,"a typical day at work includes nothing but preparing food staying on your feet and serving the customers from what ever time you came to the exceeded time to leave. from this job i have learned to only manage my money become a hard worker and fast learner i am quick with my hands and feet and can get any task done in a certain amount of time. the management is not to good once i was robbed f 50 dollars by one of my employees and the management of where i work now did absolutely nothing about this issue. my co workers are pretty okay well the ones that only speak English, the ones that are of a different language like to talk a lot of trash and snitch a lot and say things no one can really understand, the hardest part of my job is trying to manage the ridiculous hours that i do receive i got to school 3 days out of the week for 3 hours and i barely get a day off or time to get home on time to get any homework done.the most enjoyable part about my job is the pay day and only working with certain employees i can really connect with."
bad,"Went through the interview process... Got hired on the spot. I was super excited to work for Chipotle prior to actually working for Chipotle. I was assigned to work the tortilla station in which I pressed the tortillas, asked customers if they wanted brown or white rice, black or pinto beans, and what kind of meat they would like on they're burrito. The tortilla station is considered the 'hot food' side of line and man O' man is it hot! You are literally standing there dripping sweat as you stand over the hot foods. Everything is really redundant. Manager is a snob and coworkers gossip about the new hires in a negative way..."
bad,"I wouldn't recommend anyone work there, They don't care about your personal life at all. They over work you daily and sometimes will not give you a break."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"A typical day included, washing vigorously to ensure sanitary environment.  Filling drink station, replenishing condiments, Washing dishes, marinading steaks and chicken, Distributing proper portions to costumers.  People were great except managers just liked to talk your ear off about their social life which I didn't find necessary to the job. Most enjoyable part was getting a free burrito everyday!"
bad,Management was unfair. Co-workers was cool. a typical day at work
bad,"This Company makes a large number of empty promises. The concept is good but the follow through is severly lacking. If you choose to work for this company do your reseach on your home store & the ones around it before signing anything."
bad,A day at work with Chipotle was fun because of my co-workers and customers. Wasn't fond of the management nothing was done accurately to the point we had a smooth shift. The hardest part of the job was making sure the prep and managers prepped everything at the right time. The most enjoyable was making the customers happy. I learned to consistently be a hard worker and make customers happy.
bad,"Almost every work day, I and my fellow employees were constantly asked to answer questions, for the purpose of sucking up to the boss so our general manager could get promoted. One of the common questions was: What is our goal at this Chipotle? the answer wasn't ""to provide excellent customer service"" or anything, the correct answer was ""to make our GM a restaurantuer (glorified GM) by October"". Shameless self promotion aside. They'll hire anyone, and everyone. Every day, we were overstaffed, and they were still constantly hiring more and more people. as a result, my and others' hours were cut extremely low (like one four-hour shift a week!) until they either quit, like some, or the more desperate for work, like me, were fired."
bad,The company will work you and work you and tell you how good your doing and promise promotions and more money and never follow through with it the store I was in had a lot of childish managers that I’m my opinion we’re to young and immature to be in charge of anything
bad,"GM (at the time) was manipulative and wanted you to kiss her butt so she could advance you and give you more hours. A lot of the employees that were there simply did not care when they were there. A lot of people would call out, which made things harder."
bad,I got the job at chipotle to get some extra cash but they have very poor service to the customers and their employees. No type of respect is given to their employees.
bad,I don’t see why this part of the application is necessary or relevant to the job I am applying for. It seems to be a waste of time. It is also a bit stupid for this part to be a minimum of 150 words when I honestly don’t have much to say about my time working with chipotle. The management wasn’t the best and the manager would take advantage of the employees. If you requested time off in advance they would still ask you to come in even if you were sick or in the hospital or even out of town.
bad,I have nothing negative to say about the company but there are some things that need improvement just likely other place. The company doesn't treat bad so its ok to work
bad,"Hectic days, with plenty of staff is good. When there is a shortage of staff work gets hectic but it taught me how to multitask and work under pressure"
bad,"the hours are extremely long, crew members constantly calling out due to job being so labor intensive. pay rate is also very low for new employees...."
bad,during my employment at chipotle I was given only two days through out the week off and they weren't on the weekend plus I was going to acc summer classes on the weekdays so I felt drained and was missing out on my family.
bad,"Although Chipotle has gotten slightly better about their worklife balance, because their pay is not great, most employees do not put in much effort and will not do what you need them to.  They have trouble maintaining any employees and their managers no longer have any vision or goals.  The Service Manager position usually requires that you run the entire store by yourself, process trucks, enter inventory and clean.  They are only paying $14 an hour for this, which is not great."
bad,"The job is hectic and a lot of work to do. Unless you are working with cool or interesting people to talk to, the job will drain your energy. Not worth working here for the pay. Only good thing about it is that you get free lunch."
bad,Let’s just hope it got better than when i was working at Chipotle years ago or maybe it isn’t for everyone & it was just me or management was just not On it
bad,"I worked there for almost a year and never got a raise. The manager I worked with would bring in his friends for hire and pay them more then what I was getting paid. When I asked for advancement he made it seem like I would be able to but only with a title change and more work added. Terrible management, co workers were okay, stressful and very busy."
bad,"CONS: Wouldnt recommend working here, they rarley give you raises, lots of Discrimination and favoritism, they cut your hours without your notice. Poor Management and lazy co workers, overtime isnt allowed unless needed. "
bad,My time at Chipotle was kinda mixed the people and the customers was great but not enough hours or pay make it kinda difficult for me but I'm still thankful for them hiring me
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,I worked at chipotle for almost 2 years. It was very fun when I started. Co workers were like a family. I moved stores to advance my position. Managers overtime quit after my transfer and I was put into a position I was not trained to do.
bad,i have worked there for 2 years still there they hire others and pay them more than  the ones who been there for a while they over work you also they    lack on training new managers.
bad,This job served as a way to make ends meet while I was at college. The favoritism and general culture (which is something that is promoted there) left a bad taste in my mouth.
bad,"Working at Chipotle was my first job."
bad,"Your first job can either be the best memory or worst, depending on how it goes, and Chipotle was the latter thought. I could not believe how baffling turnover and management was. Complete incompetence and constant lies to me about my role in the company. Did not even have the respect to tell me I was let go until I called them asking why my name wasn't on the schedule for the next week. The free meal was great. People were alright. Low entry despite most I worked with were 3+ years in. Pretty much law of the jungle mindset: be the best or get out. Getting them through winter was my only purpose in their eyes. A near waste of my time."
bad,"Starting off at Chipotle was great. Great co workers, positive environment, managers that enjoyed helping their employees out. Once we got a new manager everything changed. He doesn’t respect anybody but himself, likes to be in control of EVERYTHING, and thinks he can do whatever he wants whenever he wants with whoever he wants. I would recommend this job only because it’s good pay but if you enjoy working with a manger that is a complete a-hole then this job is for you."
bad,"Working at Chipotle when I started was fun and exciting. But after large scale lack of food safety, the company reacted harshly and it became more about the money than the culture."
bad,"Help with food prep, work register, help on line. clean lobby and bathrooms, Help with all online orders, worked on holidays and main events. i loved the fasted pace environment"
bad,"Absolutley no communication between management and crew, always a high stress job and mistakes occured ever five minutes. Many customers were exremeley rude and you felt belittled working there."
bad,Surrounded by wonderful people in the workplace however the job itself has become too stressful. Teaches you great skills that could be used in future jobs.
bad,Overall not the best place to work. Management is a turnover frequently just as much as the crew. Bad working conditions. Hostile work environment. Wouldn't suggest working here.
bad,I was a griller for over a year while earning my degree. We had huge lines that were to the door and I would have to cook and try and not run out of food on the line  all by myself. Never knew how popular and busy Chipotle was until moving to Vegas. Very stressful and hard work. The only reason I stayed for over a year was because I was in the process of getting a misdemeanor expunged.  High turnover rate with low compensation and little raises. Would not recommend anyone with a clean record to work there.
bad,"Management is terrible. Pay is unfair. They upped the pay in the area and those who had been there 2 plus years were making less than new hires. There was not good structure. If you are put on dish it’s Likely a form of punishment. Drama is Ridiculous and constant. In all my years of working different jobs, I’ve never seen so many employees in tears.  They look for striving employees and perfectionist. People who feel like they need to suck up to management. Those who work there are Criticized. A lot of employees feel like they are not adequate at their jobs because of this. I do not feel like management helps employees succeed. Chipotle had its moments of fun and fast pace. I enjoyed the busy. I worked at the busiest store in my state, was good at my job and worked in a variety of areas. The ideal is they want to turn you into a work horse manager who works 50+ hours a week and literally lives and breathes chipotle. If that’s what you want.. then have fun."
bad,The managers are more interested in drama in the store then helping you succeed in your career or allowing you to advance. They start you out at 9 an our and it is hard to find a good schedule working there. if the store gets slow you fall under 40 hours easily and it can get hard to pay for expenses.
bad,They do not know how to treat their employees. The managers there are rude and they favorite people. Many people have left because of their unfriendliness.
bad,"The GM always left early and came in late. The GM would let the other managers work shifts with 1-3 people short staffed. The other employees were awesome and the work was to the point and fun. Although, the expectations are sometimes unreasonable."
bad,"overworked, underappreciated. "
bad,Work countless hours and do lots of hard labor. Work sometimes go unnoticed. I start to feel unappreciated and unimportant. My requests about scheduling and hours were not taken into consideration. Sometimes wouldn’t be able to leave until 1 am.
bad,"Extremely hostile environment, competitiveness within the co-workers & severe lack of communication. The management was great though. My boss & the training G.M. always gave it their all"
bad,At my location i was called stupid plenty of times by my GM. They could careless about your schedule and how you had to leave on time to accommodate your spouse This was a hard 6 years but i made it through
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"Must have a good team in order to have a good time. Most days are stressful, because the turn over rate is so high and it is far too busy for the amount of employees working. Far too busy to keep up with online orders. Many times the orders do not come through properly and ends up in upset costumers. "
bad,Mansfield Chipotle gave me a horrible experience! The management was extremely mean and fake.  They talk behind your back and everyone spreads rumors about each other.  The work environment was very toxic.
bad,"My tasks were not just running the cash register, but also cleaning the dining room, windows, glass, refilling soda bags, refilling ice in soda machine, expo, and counting money and tips."
bad,"The management could never put together a full staff for each shift, leaving a few areas shorthanded consistently. Supplies also never met customer demand. Coupled with the high-paced and stressful environment created with only a 30 min break from hours of standing, it was not a pleasant place to be."
bad,too be honest it was a terrible work experience. i felt like i was the only one doing my job. try not to be a night cashier because youll be stuck cleaning the toilet.
bad,Fine i liked it just not for me i wanted to move on needed more hours. The bosses where cool but there is a lot to be done and get done in a shott time
bad,"I've worked with this company for 6 years, the first couple years were great the vision was simple and every emolyee that worked there could get behind it. but unfortunately the company is not the same "
bad,When I worked here it was really cool it was always busy and we worked all together to get through the line as quick as possible. It was a team effort and I would gladly go back
bad,Chipotle is a great company to work for starting out and to learn the ropes of business.  But make sure to keep your eyes on your goals because the company is very them focused.
bad,"He threatened to fire us if we didn’t follow his rules, not chipotle’s rules. He was very rude and always assumed. We never really got along and most people usually get always get along with me"
bad,Under Paid for the amount of effort you put in they work you like a slave. Extremely fast pace and sometimes you wouldn't be able to move even for customer situations the customer would get upset and you would get in trouble if you left your post.
bad,managers have too much drama going on most are rude and judgemental and childish. THey go back and forth with rules they explained from beginning and are hypocrites coworkers are judgemental and dont understand you are new they talk to you like a little kid and coworkers tell you what to do 24-7 like they are a manager. only plus side you get free lunch paid breaks food is okay after a while you get sick of it. customers are rude.
bad,I enjoyed this job at first but have grown to really dislike it. It is very stressful and our GM has hired lots of new employees that are incompetent.
bad,"Turn over in food and beverage industry is already high but the turn over at some of the particular stores are very high, even as a food and beverage business. Expectations are to great for the pay you give your employees. I do believe chipotle has the ability to offer great opportunities for people who have none but does not mean every store follows through. As a learning experience for entry level management potions it's great but as a long term fulfilling career you will end up burned out and feeling hollow on the inside."
bad,I've learned to run all stations in the store. The hardest part is not speaking Spanish at the store i'm at. A typical day at the store is usually busy.
bad,One of the worst jobs I've ever had in my life there was absolutely no work-life balance field leader didn't care about anything except making numbers employees took advantage of company policies and we constantly ran short staffed.
bad,"Chipotle is a great company. The culture is great, and  what it stands for is even better. The work is fun and rewarding. I learned many things about the food service industry which has served me well. Management was a complete disaster and they lacked many professional skills. The hardest part of the job for myself was the dealing with the management. The most enjoyable part was the great customers and being able to serve them something I prepared."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"Working at Chipotle was very stressful. You are to be in a set spot and not move unless you have a valid reason to. You are standing on your feet the entire shift moving under the physical heat of stoves and cooking equipment. You only get a 10 minute break and have to follow strict guidelines. People keep on quitting and calling off due to poor management or stress leaving the pressure on you to cover their shift. The only benefits I received from this job was experience, because if you can work at Chipotle, then you can work in most fast food restaurants.Other benefits include medical insurance and free meals on breaks."
bad,Underpayed for amount of things you are required to do. Often do not receive breaks due to having to carry slack of other workers or lack of judgment by managers.
bad,It was terrible. So I stopped showing up. The people were rude. The atmosphere was weird. And the schedule was never regular. I worked here for a month no one ever taught me anything after me my first day and after a month and me still not knowing how to roll a burrito stopped showing up.
bad,Tout depend du restaurant dans lequel vous allez travailler.
bad,"The manager does not know what she's doing and is way over her head. States ""we don't do raises"" and overworks employees. Plays favoriatism. This may just be one bad apple in the bunch however."
bad,"Management put me on a leave of absence, then terminated me while on my leave of absence because my work permit expired. Shift leader, Patricia, was not welcoming and had a very bad attitude."
bad,Chipotle is just always tense for no reason and threatens to fire everyone everyday literally. Honestly the management was awful both places I worked and literally saw people not get scheduled because their hair wasn't tied up when clocking in.
bad,"Easy job, people were questionable, hours were reasonable. Manager was very easy to work for. Lunches are very busy especially 11 to 2 pm Monday thru Thursday."
bad,"Several of the Chipotle's in the area are known among employees to be notoriously bad. In fact, getting moved to a certain location is basically a death sentence. Everyone that goes there ends up quitting. At my location the managers only cared about the employees that came to work when they were sick."
bad,"The management at the new Englewood location was horrible. I only received eight hours of work, for two days. just a horrible place to want to advance."
bad,"Head manager stole money from the safe and the assistant manager that took his place was incompetent, used favoritism to distribute hours, had incredibly poor communication skills, and liked to put her work on the lower managers."
bad,"When I first started this job i was extremely excited, I heard that chipotle could say for your tuition if you worked their a year. however I realized that it was not worth it, customers treat workers like their worthless. during school hours it was a constant flood of customer that would not stop. at first they do work with your schedule but as time went one they constantly have employees that aren't reliable and call out which means they would call constantly."
bad,"I had fun working with the people there, they were all really nice. The only problem I had was they never said I was fired or anything they, Just stopped giving me hours for no reason while they knew I was a single mother trying to provide for my child. Every time I called to see when I was working, it was just some excuse. The only thing I asked was if you don't want me, let me know, be an adult and let me know because having a job to support my daughter is more important than playing these games and not being straight with me."
bad,They play with your hours and management was a joke. Almsot everyone there is a bit inappropriate but it's ok if your friends I guess... was fun at first but that quickly changed
bad,its an okay job if you dont have any bills to pay. the pay isnt great. i wouldnt really tell anyone to work here. you cant have a beard if you want one so idk....
bad,"The general manager likes to get her butt kissed for extra days!!! Treats her employees like if they are trash!! Overall it is a good job but there are also certain managers that are abusive, meaning they make all the employees do everything while they do “office work” or “store cleaning”."
bad,"I worked there for 3 years in It was a lot of fun to work there It was Fast pace,Great Environment, Job task were easy. I learned how to cook,prep,deep clean. Management was a joke at the time they would give glory of something you done to some one else to there superior's the move them up and not you.Hardest part was keeping up with all the Customers when you were doing Salsa,or tortilla stations."
bad,"I felt that I was racially mistreated because I was not the majority ethnic group that worked at the store, the managers told me I was unhappy there and that was their reason for letting me go? I feel like as a manager if you notice one of your employees is unhappy working for your company or a company you represent than the proper way to handle that would be to try and fix the problem and not fire the person for what you think is going on......."
bad,"The best place of working here is the free meal that they offer during your shift (if you work at least 6 hours). In addition, they offer a 50 % discount per day on a day you aren't working or when you are working like 4 hours on a shift. The environment is extremely fast paced, especially during specific rush hours where the line of customers is never ending for two- three hours straight. There's always something to be done wheter business is coming in or not so be prepared to always be on the move and on your feet. It can get very messy as you are working with food and keeping up with speed and demand."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,my boss was a player and hit on all the women who worked there. it made me very uncomfortable and i grew to hate my job. i was always promised advancement and never got it. my co workers were great but being a full time employee and never getting enough hours to pay my bills or rent was horrible they never wanted to give any employees 40 hours. the only person who got 40 hours was the general manager. the job gave me so much stress and i just could not deal.
bad,"Pros: I acquired the not-so-secret chipotle recipes"
bad,"it was horrible. The job itself as stressfull and too quickpaced especially for a small store. What made it worse was the management and how they liked the hold on to workers even the poor ones and yet got rid of good one for stupid ""company policies"". Great pay though."
bad,"The crew could've been more dependable, by showing up to work. I was over worked and under paid. I wouldn't imagine working under their management again."
bad,"Very fast work place, Chipotle didn't allow for many worker to be on the clock so it would make a lot of work for just a few workers, like running the kitchen at times with only one person when two were required."
bad,This place wasn't so fun. People here always talked about advancement but it never happened. They are very into training which is great. Depends on location and people within the store.
bad,"If you want to deal with untrained ""professionals"" who run their stores like a dictatorship, choose Chipotle. Your general manager will most likely be a slacker who takes advantage of field leaders who are clueless. You will most likely be added to a group chat where you will be called out for any mistakes you make on your previous shift. This is a requirement at most places. I'm a salary manager who is supposed to only work 50 hours a week and gets paid for 40, most weeks I end up putting in close to 60 hours of work. As a crew member you will most likely not be trained to succeed, and the stress of your part-time job will most likely push you out the door."
bad,"sometimes you are asked to do things outside of your job description and even work off the clock to ""save hours"" so we dont get a call from corporate saying we are giving more hours than the store can afford. i personally quit because i literally developed anxiety"
bad,"opening up you had to make sure store was clean . And if you had to put up an truck inventory order you had to make sure that was done , and you assigned task was done before the store was open."
bad,Job is very stressful some of the managers are very disrespectful and they say you are full time but give you part time hours WASTE OF TIME but it is a easy job just without the management
bad,"At first, I really liked this job. Management was nice and the people were so willing to help me. It really felt like a family. Then, people started dropping like flies. In the two years that I worked there, there were only 3 of the original employees still working there. It was terrible. Management treated us like trash and I wasn't getting any hours. I was still in school and I am religious, so mornings and sundays were never an option for me, but they never had any problems with it until there were some management changes and different employees."
bad,Working at chipotle you have to always be on your feet its a fast pace restaurant. You cant slack off they are always busy from morning to lunch. It can be fun to work in sometimes depending on the people and the environment. Other than that it was a great work place.
bad,"this was by far my worst job i have ever heard, the people who i worked with were hard headed, didn't want to learn nor wanted to develop. the whole work team was a joke and was being abused since no one knew their laws."
bad,Overall my least favorite job. I left because I received a better paying opportunity. I played my part in Chipotle but there are many things I disliked.
bad,"It can be a good first job and they teach you some pretty useful skills, but during my time with Chipotle it was a roller-coaster. For most of my time I had to deal with a sociopath of a General Manager that would treat his workers like trash. My management team as people were cool, but they were all very bad at communication, training people, and consistency of standards. I loved my team and they were the best part about job. The store I was at didn't run smoothly and it was filled with a lot hypocrisy."
bad,The environment is not very welcoming. The managers are unprofessional. The crew members are unprofessional and overall everything and everybody is unprofessional and time management is something that they need to work on.
bad,"I have given this company two years of my time, where I have been continuously been promised advancement/management. Within this time I have had one promotion to the lowest tier of ""management,"" even though I run shifts and act as if I were a Service Manager. The culture is cult-like, and the pay is good for starting, but you definitely work for it."
bad,"A declining company, was great to work at for a time, but over the past year has become a breeding ground for horrible Upper Management who don't know what they're doing."
bad,Going in a odd hours. Communication was a weak standpoint overworking with little pay sadly. Management stayed in office and more so a dictatorship no real guidance as a leader.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"I came into the job with the promise and expectation of becoming a kitchen manager, however, they did not give me hours, acted like the were mad at me for having to work around my college schedule. Mistake leaving my prior job for this one."
bad,This place can become very overwhelming depending on staff and management it can be chaos. If you like that every single day then this is the job for you. It just wasnt for me.
bad,Management really sucks at Chipotle and never willing to show the correct way of doing things.So I wouldn't recommend no one to work at a unprofessional Chipotle make sure you verify management.
bad,"Working at Chipotle for a year was stressful and not fun at all. The management was horrible and ridiculed me for taking time off work when my brother died. It was a horrible experience and they require so much of you for so little pay. Be prepared to work the Line, cash register, cleaning, prepping food that wasn't finished in the morning, and online orders/phone calls all at the same time."
bad,Opening prep or grill. I've learned how to properly use a knife. Management is about favoritism . Workplace is nice and inviting. Hardest part keeping up with the rush. Most enjoyable part is the people around you
bad,"They really try and squeeze as much out of their good employees that they can. They'll try and schedule you for short shifts so they can save labor on meal hours. As a kitchen manager you have a ton of responsibilities and pressure, and the pay just isn't worth it."
bad,"Chipotle was a interesting place to work, I felt like if your not Hispanic then they don't treat you wit the same respect, they take advantage of the fact the people need the job"
bad,I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone it's ran like a cult. I recommend you take my summary and imprint it on your and forever avoid the company for a job. I recommended earning there because the food is great.
bad,"Chipotle promises quick advancement and uses this to keep potentially great employees on the most basic pay scale. Their culture of sustainability, while admirable is hardly reflected in their management or logistics. In the end, Chipotle will most likely reward your hard work with the bare minimum it can get away with."
bad,Chipotle is a very nice place to start working for a first job. The job gives you a variety of experience in multiple areas to provide you with experience.
bad,"While this was a miserable job, it taught me a lot about the ins and outs to running a franchise. This is a good place to work for your first job. However it was an extremely negative environment to be in. Crew members honestly bully each other, and adults get involved in the most childish altercations imaginable. i accepted lower pay at another job instead of staying there."
bad,"I did not work there very long but the company was fast paced, family oriented, with helpful managers, flexible hours. They train you at your own pace, and allow you plenty of upper mobility in the company."
bad,This was my first job so I was not expecting anything grand. It could have been better if the management was not so stuck up and rude and only cared about themselves and not their employees.
bad,I love chipotle but working there is not the experience I thought it would be. It was a bit disorganized and it was a stressful area. The demands were high for the way they treated there employees
bad,"Seemed at first a fun place to work, but too much looking over the shoulder from managers and cameras watching staff. Ended up not being fun and a drag to come to work everyday. Left the company earlier than I intended."
bad,"I love the food, I don't love the work. This was by far the most work I did for the least amount of compensation. The management demands a lot of work from the employees without helping much themselves. And when something goes wrong, the blame falls on the employees first every time. Sometimes there is infighting as well."
bad,"Chiptole use to be a company of integrity, honesty, and respect. The management has changed a lot of things. If you are in school and just need a job it is a great place for you. I would not recommend being a manager as it is a very stressful and time consuming job in which you will eventually get burned out."
bad,"I liked working in a fast paced environment, but we were regularly understaffed and most managers would rarely help out. I was the only Take Out Specialist and was frequently swamped with online/catering orders that I had little to no help with. I was extremely undervalued as an employee. I did however enjoy working with most of my fellow crew members and customers, especially regulars."
bad,Now there isn't much to say about this company all i can say is that i liked the fact that it always busy but they would always ask me to do so much when i can only do so little not because i couldn't do the job but because i wasn't robot that can do everything a limited of time.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,The daily job was very extensive and demanding. It was high pressure and very busy and the work required training if it were to be done in a timely manner and to the Chipotle standard. The leadership was lacking as it was not encouraged to move forward.
bad,"Terrible management, the bosses played favorites with employees and would allow them to get away with a lot. The bosses were also terrible at communicating with their employees."
bad,"The customers and coworkers were fantastic, new management did not care for you're well being besides one, doesn't care about you're availability. Would be better if there was a different GM and new management."
bad,There is a lot of favoritism. No one is treated equal. Manager gives openings to her best friend and when I ask to open i get told everyone has to close.. But I only open 1 day a week. When i first started i told them i need to work mornings n have Wednesday off and now all i do is close. Not fair at all.
bad,"Horrible work environment, managers don't do their jobs properly, not enough hours equally distributed,managers treat their employees very poorly, your made to feel inadequate"
bad,good place to work. lots of work to do typically wont leave until 2 am depending on how good crew is but more $$$ to be made. dont like the hiring process though
bad,Hectic environment and disorganized. There was no sense of direction because I was being told for different ways to do one task and being scolded for not doing the task the right way.
bad,ok job people and management are really fake! fast paced pretty easy job great if you don't want to work typical fast food restaurant chill scene diverse company
bad,"A typical day at work involved food preparation, cleanliness and proper quick serving at all times .  "
bad,"Few different roles to play at chipotle, but I'm a great team member so it wasn't much of a challenge for me. Some days I would roll the burritos, and other days I would cashier or even wash the dishes in the back. What I enjoyed most was the free chipotle on my lunch break, there weren't really and hard parts to this job."
bad,"Upon getting hired at Chipotle everything seems glamorous. In time you come to realize that it is not. The managers are too young to act like real professionals. Half of the staff is still in High school and the half that aren't are in college. Everything moves at a fast pace and for the most part very efficiently. But you will never see the full time hours that you want and it is possible that someone who got hired 10 minutes before you or even years after you will start off making a lot more money than you. Which is upsetting for how much work you end up putting into your job. They will tell you that you are a 'top performer' but you will see no benefits from it. Expect for there to be more rude customers than nice ones. Even if you are trained one way if a customer complains you will have to bend the rules for them. Also you can get fired over a customer complaint. Overall, in theory, it could be a good place to work, but it depends on who you are."
bad,"Not many employees working at Chipotle felt motivated day in and day out to work at one's best ability. It was competitive and there felt no incentive to think that it was anything but a bleak job. During the time I worked there, eight people quit or got fired within the first three months. I eventually quit because of food poisoning I had from a dish and couldn't imagine preparing or serving any food there again without feeling nauseous."
bad,"For a company that boasts ""Food with integrity,"" their employees' integrity sure is nonexistent. After a whopping 3 full weeks of working here, I was fired with no due notice, paired with no actual explanation of what was supposedly wrong. The GM at this place really needs more training. Their Respectful Workplace Hotline is a farce or a joke, I still can't decide which one. Shockingly from all that being said, I actually liked working here. My days consisted of prepping all the salsas needed for the early-midday business hours which was quite a lot, but I felt it was manageable. This was done from 8am to about 10:15am, then we would have 30 minutes where we could make and consume our delicious free lunch. The only truly ""hard"" part of this job was the fact that the co-workers smiled in your face, then obviously would report fabrications back to the GM. Go teamwork. Also, in this location they apparently do not believe expediting dishes throughout shifts is of any kind of importance. Don't expect to get off work anywhere near when you're supposed to, as it's going to take about an hour or more to wash everything that was dirtied in that entire shift. And I was so excited to work here- I interviewed many many times before I got here... Just to get this. Really."
bad,"It was alright, most days had too many things to do. We could not click at the end of our shift until all our tasks were done. This was hard for me because I had to catch the  bus."
bad,"I enjoyed the fast pace environment and being able to to talk to customers. I learneed to actually pay attention to detail and enjoyed that, but being in high school, my managers had no sympathy and would over work and sometimes schedule 6 day work weeks. I had no time to do school work and when I did that meant I wouldn't get any sleep, and given your senior year should be easy. I didn't have time for anything. It would be a great place to work while going through trade school."
bad,Bad crew and managment. No training. Favoritism. Wants to be to involved in PERSONAL life. Bullying between co-workers. Injuries not taken seriously.
bad,If you are trying to just get by on bills it is the place to be. You have to be in high school to enjoy it.Its not for grown working individuals.
bad,fun managers to work with coworkers were always picking fights with customers very rude and difficult to watch. The food was great and always cooked well
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,I loved learning new procedures about my line cook position learning about allergens how to properly handle customers incidents or complaints. i learned alot about myself in this company and grew up within them as a person as well. I decided to part ways to better further my career and experience.
bad,Learned different kitchen skills. Busy days of the week. Very fast paced. Tough closings for night crews.Free meal while working. Easily move up within the company.
bad,Everyone wants to bee the boss and always feels the need to say something to someone at all times. Enjoyed the fast pace. Constant confusion and pandemonium.
bad,"Chipotle teaches you allot of skills you can apply to yourself."
bad,I liked the atmosphere but the job I was doing ended up with me injuring my back and they neglected to hear me when I told them things were to heavy for me. They also make you do 4 things at once while serving cutomers so I think its unreasonable.
bad,"A typical day at work was, prep food for the morning shift so their shift would flow easily.  Help the line (serve food) when needed.  Be the cashier for a few days of the week or substitute for the day. Wash dishes when I saw it needed to be done; and also cook/grill.  I have learned a lot working for this company, they have helped me gain experience.  The management needed a lot of improvement.  They were completely disorganized as well as the communication among themselves and the crew workers alike.  Majority of my co-workers were easy to get along with however their performance did not meet the standards of the company; due to the management.  The hardest part of the job was getting others to meet the standards needed to become restaurateur.  The most enjoyable part of the job was communicating with the customers and making them smile."
bad,"I worked at Chipotle for a little over a year in which I had 3 changes of management was made to work off the clock and not given my breaks. "
bad,no....no. no. no. nol no. no. no. I have to keep writing cause i'm not saying no enough. OMG it's never enough. The managers need more communication with the other managers and employees. In stead of firing them automatically they need to investigate the situation because they fired the wrong a** hole!!
bad,"Typical day at work included morning prep in which ever section the manager decided to put you in that day, go on break and the open the doors to start the business day. Rush would come around 11:30-1:00 and then die down. You would clean your section and re stock everything for PM shift. You have to wait for your replacement and then you could leave but sometimes that would be an hour after your scheduled time. Hardest part was nothing, it was an easy job. I loved most the people I worked with and miss them not the company itself."
bad,"Basic day of work was prepping in the morning at 7 AM. then proceeded to cook food till peek hour when i received help from the prep cook for a hour during our rush. continued to maintain food levels after through put then was breaked by the next grill cook. I learned how to control my environment and too cook different styles of meats. My coworkers were generally nice, though not to fluent in English. So communication was difficult at times. Hardest part of the job was Halloween during boorito days, 3 dollar bowls, tacos and burritos meant lines out the door for hours.The most enjoyable part was the coworkers. They were always lively and in great moods."
bad,"I worked there for over 2 years, it was a hostile workplace and I was overworked.  I Opened and Closed the Grill for over 2 years in a store that averaged $6,000 in sales daily, and it was a tough job.  I obtained and then turned down the Kitchen Manager in Training Position.  They forced too many responsibilities on me that could have otherwise been done by the upper management.  My training for the position was very poor.  I was told, by my trainers/managers, that everyone receives poor training and that's just how things go, meanwhile they would recieve full credit for training me.  The management in the store, as well as regional management and corporate, were out of touch with each other and the crew members in the stores.  The Chipotle Co-CEO lives in La Jolla, where I worked, and in those 2 years there I never met him.  I was forced to leave by my General Manager.  I was told that I had no right to complain about working 7 days in a row. They said if I wanted less hours I should get some shifts covered or just remind them next time that I only want 25 hours.  I worked almost 50 hours a week, performing and executing the most difficult tasks, sometimes having to work 9 day work weeks.  I have a lot of discrepancies with Chipotle, but it's the past. I learned a lot about myself and met some cool people along the way. I've worked very hard for them and I left feeling bullied.  The whole experience was very hostile and drama filled."
bad,"They did not respect one another. "
bad,Overall it was a good experience but wished they would of let me stay there longer so I could grow stronger. I learned to use the Point of Sale System. I actually tried their chicken burrito for the first time.Hardest part of the job was time management. Co-workers where awesome and team players. But one seemed to not like me and that is very sad.
bad,"Nice place to work if you have a great manager , other than that the leaders and managers have favorites at more than 1 store , its everywhere . its okay place to work , dont move up unless you have no choice."
bad,"Typical day at work was extremely fast paced. There were a lot of customers that came through our store. We were the busiest in our district. I had never worked in the restaurant industry before this. There was a lot of cleaning and multitasking involved. I was the head cashier, so I handled the register & was expected to keep the dining room, patio, & bathrooms clean. The management did not treat me very well; I'm assuming because I was at the bottom of the food chain. One of my managers had an anger issue & lashed out at me one night; hence why I quit. My co-workers were all very awesome and goal oriented, which was what I felt kept me there for as long as I did. A difficult aspect of this job was having to maintain that dining room at the same time as cashing out customers. I didn't like to keep my customers waiting if I was bussing table out in the dining room, but I also didn't want to have a dirty & understocked dining room. But, overall, I enjoyed learning what it was like to be around food & the busy environment kept me occupied."
bad,managers are unfair and not really willing to work with your schedule. They play favoritism. They did not appreciate the work and effort I put in and they expect you to know everything that easy.
bad,handled costumers and handled food. fast paced job have to always be on top of your game. you had to act like you were manager and take care of the restaurant as if it was your own
bad,a place where it is hard to keep busy during slow times. didn't really like it. enjoyed working at McDonalds rather then here.
bad,"Chipotle Culture is probably its best and worst characteristic.  They love young people, so much so that they will promote them long before someone with other or more job experience, and they do take care of you."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,Unorganized. Suits care about numbers more than the daily works of the teams within the stores. Structure set but not followed. Inadequate training. Rarely hire from within (as advertised) for management positions. Employees not appreciated causing high turnover rate.
bad,I worked there for about 2 months then got fired with no explanation as to why they let me go.  I did not have a very good experience working at chipotle.
bad,The managers there have no clue what they are doing the gm not there half the time. People that work with us are just mad about everything. They pay ok but just a bad place to work.
bad,"I worked for chipotle for 4 years. I recently decided not to return after my maternity leave exhausted. This job over works you especially as a manager. I had no time for my children. They refused to mix up my schedule so I was closing everyday for more than a year! Also a lot of managers are disrespectful and mean. Especially to the minors. In regards to advancing, I was promoted 4 times in 3 years."
bad,"I worked here for a few months and all I have to say is that it was horrible. They do not train you properly, they are unorganized and the workers are eerily all cohesively miserable and rude. Every shift I would walk into work and feel a wave of negativity. The only nice people at this location are the male cooks. 98% of the girls at this location are mean, catty, and competitive. The overall vibe of this location is very off setting. Do not work here."
bad,Chipotle used to awesome and very team and food oriented but after the ecoli outbreak they snapped and replaced everyone who worked there with external managers. They used to only promote from within and encourage people to grow. But now they just want to squeeze as much energy out of people as possible for the smallest dollar amount and then toss you to the side like trash.
bad,Working at chipolet was difficult work load was alot. Demand on speed an consistancy memorization of recipes. Minimal training but high demand on accuracy.
bad,"A lot of people who worked there complained to the managers for how they were being treated by other employees, nothing was done about it, it only got worse. Poor hires were made recently and very vulgar in front of customers, ( new grill guy ). You can’t learn new positions because you’ll get kicked out of your spot then get yelled at for not learning the scheduled position. It is a very unwelcoming environment"
bad,Although i loved my coworkers the mamangement sucked so bad i was terminated for giving proper notice about a leave of absence for a huge family emergency and to top it off my coworkers were the ones that told me i was fired not even my GM
bad,Managers are not very organized and they expect employees to do a lot of tasks quickly and efficiently. Always understaffed and felt unappreciated from managers.
bad,"I do not recommend my location.  Poor management, rude coworkers and poor leadership. Too many illegals, very territorial. Management threatens staff to let them go if they contest any ideas."
bad,"While working at Chipotle, I had little to none social life. I got paid fairly well but I was not treated correctly, I worked a lot of hours off the clock, which my area manager made me do, I wrote it on a review but never heard back."
bad,"It depends from store to store, but from my experiance it is a rather draining place if youre not with the right people there. It is mainly a place where teenagers/young adults work, so patience is a good skill to have if youre older."
bad,It’s wayyyy to much work for little paid. They start you up @ $9.50 an hour to work on the grill. It’s not worth it @ all. It so much hustle for little pay. You have to wash your pots and pans.  Lack of communication Between employees. Poor management.
bad,"Working with the other employee's were alright. Management (of course) had favorites. They timed you on everything you did (mind you Chipotle is a made fresh environment, making 6 batches of guacamole would be longer than 20 minutes, etc.) Management never spoke with you unless they were telling you off. You either won't be put on the schedule enough or not at all. Management is unprofessional and did not even tell me when I was fired (but instead told another team member to tell me). Would not recommend."
bad,"Very difficult to work at because I never had time at home with my family. I worked every single day due to call outs, sick employees, and behind understaffed."
bad,"Chipotle is a very demanding job with nothing to compensate for the long hours and stressful work days. Even my manager told me, that Chipotle knows their jobs are so physically and mentally demanding and stressful so they try to create a fun environment to work in, in order to keep their staff. The culture is awful. I resented going to work everyday. A lot was expected out of you with only a little time to do it. Myself, along with a long line of other former workers will tell you, do not work here. Save yourself the grief."
bad,I worked at Chipotle for four days due to my manager only focused on herself gaining promotion. Promised two weeks of training shadowing another employee and only received 2 days. My manager was only focused on getting herself promoted for her financial goals.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,This location is too busy and understaffed. I would work 10 hour days with no breaks. I didn’t get breaks at all working mornings. Some management is disrespectful and it’s already stressful but dealing with people who have bad attitudes or anger issues makes it worse. Only store that doesn’t give meal breaks.
bad,"Learned what it was to work in a kitchen, that was the best part. Terrible management, unprofessional and disrespectful, always playing favorites. Restaurant workload, with fast food wages. The job is already terrible, having bad managers does not help."
bad,They did not pay me for the hours that I worked. There is a nationwide class action lawsuit against Chipotle for this practice because it is not just limited to the Silver Spring area.
bad,"The summary is in the title. It was a minimum wage job that required too much work for the amount that they paid."
bad,"When I stated at chipotle, I did not receive a formal training, it was a watch and learn type job. I only worked there for a couple months because of being in college."
bad,"Some locations have a great team and managers that are exceptional leaders who will provide you with not only a fun workday, but the chance to learn some pretty strong communication and time management skills. Others, like the one I worked at, are run by kids in their early twenties on a power trip up the corporate ladder. I was often not allowed breaks (even a second to drink water or go to the bathroom) so that we could sell burritos as quickly as possible and our managers would impress their bosses by exceeding the day's projected sales. My coworkers and I almost never left when we were scheduled to for the sake of the restaurant being over prepped and having the appearance of efficiency and leadership. At some point, I just ignored my schedule and stopped making plans with friends (or for anything at all) after work, because I knew that in reality a seven or eight hour shift on paper was nine hours long in real life."
bad,"Chipotle claims to have a certain culture, but their culture is all comedy and nonexistent. They will push you and work you to the bone until you’ve had enough and just when you think you’ve had enough they ask for more of you. Work should be fun and not dreadful"
bad,How fast they make you work and how many times things get repeated and you feel like you can't advance. The managers have favorites that they move up in career and its chaotic. Working hard goes unnoticed
bad,Not a bad place to work at all but cleanliness is definitely a recurring issue there. Management isnt the best either and seems more interested in trying to maintain ridiculous standards then effective operating procedures
bad,It was fast pace when its rush hour time. I like all the manager there are friendly and great to work with. I was just a cashier and sometimes I help my team in the line wrapping burritos.  I had fun working in there and make some friends.
bad,"Outside of running the day to day tasks of the kitchen, making sure that food was prepared correctly and up to ServeSafe standards, leadership fell primarily on the on site general manager. With as much professionalism and respect that is applicable, they were highly incapable of respecting ones availability. The level of which there was much disrespect and favoritism being played in the environment which was originally meant to maintain professionalism."
bad,"Consistently working 60 hours a week while the GM works less than 40, yet we both get paid for 40. "
bad,"If you're into kitchen work with little or no life outside of work, this place is for you. They will suck the life out of you. They make you work very hard for absolutely no reward."
bad,"Was forced to work more up to 16 hours in a day with little to no breaks."
bad,"Overall a generous staff, management could use more help in that area. Friendly regular customers, employees need higher pay and better benefits. For a starter job I would recommend it for younger first time workers."
bad,"A lot of high standards and specific guidelines that don’t make a lot of sense but can whip you into shape. A lot of favoritism based on race, especially when it comes to advancement or just general things like who gets their full required break."
bad,Management was poor and the company policies are incredibly outdated in regards to food preperation and staff benefits. Regularly under-staffed and rarely granted days off unless you were literally throwing up at work.
bad,"Overall, fun place to work in 2014, after the E-Coli outbreak though, all the new safety standards implemented made us work a lot harder for the same pay. People were nice, but the work was too much for $12 an hour. Pay your people decent wages and maybe they’ll work harder and do what they’re supposed to do."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"it gets busy here a lot. if you are afraid of or dislike working with a large volume and variety of customers, do not come here.Good communication is key here because you will have to work with a variety of different coworkers as well. Poor communication or miscommunication amongst the employees will only lead to a terrible work environment, and that tends to be the case a lot. If you like food service and teamwork, this is the job for you."
bad,"In Westport, the management is really lacking. I was let go and not given a real reason.  After talking to my manager, I came to the conclusion that I was let go so that someone else could have more hours."
bad,chipotle is a great company i loved the business idea and its culture. i just had moronic MGMT who really were distracted with raising a prodigy then the crew and work ethic. prodigy then quit on . them..karma
bad,The environment is nice and friendly. At the time the management was not at its best. There were many schedule issues and break issue. There would also be lots of drama within the work place.
bad,"The management team, while friendly, was poorly trained and often caused issues with scheduling and ordering supplies. Often, we would run out of some time of food or we would be short-handed due to a schedule conflict that was not resolved by management. High stress environment, though the work was not actually stressful."
bad,"When I first started at chipotle it was such a great work eviroment but over the course of the year and a half I worked there, I saw and experienced such a decline in every aspect of what originally made that company so amazing"
bad,it wasn't the best job for someone who want to just grow in a company no-one has ur back nor shows u respect even as a manager it was a horrible job and bad experience
bad,"Working for Chipotle can be a great start for a job, but I'd suggest in just working in Chipotle if you're a college student or if you just want to make some money on the side. Otherwise, don't work here."
bad,"The job consisted of  preparing various kinds of rice, as well as preparing multiple meats that were available for consumption, and working on the assembly line preparing customer's orders."
bad,Horrible place for your sanity. You will feel over worked and under appreciated. The crew members you work with are the only thing that will keep you happy because of how nice most of them are.
bad,"Fun workplace culture, but could be stressful because the managers make you feel horrible if you're having a bad day or having difficulties with something pertaining to the work. They have incredibly high and unrealistic time expectations for getting things done. Management will talk behind your back and be disrespectful. They're all very young, probably too young to be running a business. Would not recommend anyone to work at this location."
bad,"Unfair"
bad,Managers do not take responsibility for their actions and blame/punish the employees for their wrong doings. Too customer oriented and abuse of power.
bad,"My experience started off really positive, the work was hard but the pay was good and everyone helped each other out. The longer I was there the more I noticed that they unevenly applied their standards, overworking their best employees while refusing to push those that constantly slacked off. "
bad,"I love the environment Chipotle has made for their workers, but they allow the wrong people to move up into management. The managers at my former location were wonderful during the beginning of my time there, but for all but one, their true colors began to show. We were a new restaurant location that was opening up, so I expected things to be a little disorganized at first, but the place stayed disorganized long after due to poor management. There would be plenty of days that we'd be understaffed because we went over on our labor hours, but what they failed to realize was how many hours 5 full time managers can take up every week, especially when most of them just sat in the office and didn't help out like their job description entailed. There was also a lot of favoritism going on. They'd allow certain workers to sit around with them in the office while the rest got yelled at for not working fast or ""good"" enough. It was truly sad and disappointing to have the experience I did because I liked what Chipotle stood for as far as values go, and still do. I would maybe work there again but at a different location, that's for sure."
bad,At the beginning I loved working for the company and that was because I had a great manager at the time. I moved store after two years of working there and the next store was a disaster.
bad,The hardest job I've ever had. The expectations were super high. The amount of work that was expected of you was just crazy. The job was difficult the people were fun to work with.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"This company expects too much for too little pay--policy makers at top continuously issue new decrees/rule changes making the job more difficult each time.  This job could really use two grill persons and not force the prep/ dishwasher to aid grill during busy times."
bad,"When people talk about companies that drain your soul, you have to wonder why. I'll be brief:"
bad,my time at chipotle was great at the begging  I was excelling however toward the end of my time there was the whole e cloi scare where we seen every manger fired but myself and two others which led to confusion and miscommunication
bad,Unloaded labeled and store food items. Conducted proper food rotation and storage check to minimize waste. Cleaned and organized counters area and beverage stations on a regular basis. Handled all customers queries complaints smoothly and proffesionally.
bad,Chipotle was extremely stressful. moving too fast. extremely hot. rude management. great food though. I didn't like working here. my coworkers made me feel uncomfortable. if you need fast money apply. don't work here as a daily job.
bad,"it was a great working environment. But some managers have favorites when it comes to crew members, so that includes loss of hours in the job."
bad,"Working at Chipotle I was the ugly side of corporate jobs, something I never had experience with previously. It is an insane amount of work for barely minimum wage and that's if you're even being paid. Yes, you read that last part correctly. There would be a time-frame that you would have to get work done, and if you didn't get it done then you would be punished. Now, this may sound like any job but the work load was never proportional with the time given and so many people would come in early or stay late and finish the work OFF THE CLOCK. While the management would say they weren't making you do it, they weren't stopping you either, and if you didn't complete your work you were in trouble. There's actually ongoing lawsuits over this. The management at Chipotle is some of the harshest of any job I've ever seen and I would not recommend this job to anyone. The one good benefit of working there was free food during your shift and 50% off when you're off the clock. These were not enough to make the job even nearly worthwhile."
bad,"Chipotle generally has 3 shifts. Opening, mid, and closing shifts which wear you down regardless of which one you take."
bad,"Always busy, customers are rude. Managers have to many expectations for such little pay. The manager will work employees all day. Managers leave early."
bad,They expect way too much more work out of their employees considering they only pay a little more than a dollar over minimum wage.
bad,The goal of this store is to make the SM a restaurateur. The management will tell you that you can become a manager soon if you work your hardest but that is not the case. There not much room for advancement.
bad,"i would begin to work as soon as i arrive"
bad,Chipotle is a good starter job. There is opportunity to be cross trained and learn things that will help in other jobs. The problem is the lack of communication among the management team. The management team dose not run the restaurant smoothly and a lot of task that should be handled by management is dumped on crew members. If their was stronger management that promoted more of a team atmosphere and better training for new hires it would be a better place to work.
bad,"Get to work. wash a pile of dishes. shred a bunch of cheese. wash onions and avocados. wash a pile of dishes. cut produce, marinade meats, and help the cook with the rice. wash a pile of dishes. wash and cut green peppers. make guacamole. wash a pile a dishes. non stop. free lunch 30 min."
bad,sucked.. the management sucked. i was forced to walk 5 miles in ice and snow or otherwise lose my lob. they gave you little pay for a huge workload... and a lot of the management have favorites.. over all bad experience
bad,"Food preparation, customer service, cash handling, reports, develop leaders and crew"
bad,"Chipotle Mexican Grill, over works there staff and as well as expects them to learn everything in under a month. I personally worked their for about 3 months and in the first month was bounced around not having anytime to actually get better at any one thing. After the end of that month my manager yelled at me for doing something wrong. I explained that I had been thrown around and never got used to any one job. She then proceeded to yell again not realizing who I was or how long I had worked their."
bad,"Days at Chipotle are very busy and your active at every moment. I learned how to give fast service without rushing customers, how to properly use and sterilize a knife, how to master cashiering and work with very high standards. Co workers were okay they did have really high standards and the management was very lazy so they gave workers all the labor and only really did paper work and computer work. Hardest part was working grill and I enjoyed the fast pace and business it made the day go faster."
bad,"I would fry several batches of chips in the morning before customers arrived.  When it was time to open, I started the customer's orders off by asking them what they would like to eat and then beginning their order like a burrito or bowl.  I learned a lot about time management.  I had some good managers and some poor managers.  Didn't like being screamed at for doing nothing wrong.  I got a long with most of my co-workers.  They tired keeping a fun atmosphere, but the language and hard physical labor was absolutely ridiculous.  The hardest part of the job was their need for perfection.  The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the customers have a good experience."
bad,"A day at Wendy's is so busy , I was wondering why i was only working 8 hours per week. I have learned that just because a business is booming , doesn't  mean that all the employees will. I did like working with my co workers and interacting with the customers. I would have to say working 8 hours per week was the hardest part of the job , I'm just not a part-time person."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"F*** Chipotle. The management in multiple restaurants operate at an unethical standard. I mean nobody is perfect, but the stuff I've seen. It was a great job until you get into management. There is an extremely high turnover rate and there is a reason for that. But if you can hang or if that's your bag, great place to work."
bad,i loved working for the company because it was a fast work pace. and i liked that i was always busy.
bad,"Day started with getting the food ready for the customers, re-cooking a lot of the food and making the side dishes. I learned how to manage multiple things at once, and was reasonably good at it. Management was ok, they weren't afraid of doing other peoples jobs as needed, however they were limited by corporate by being forced to do steps that hindered work. The hardest part of the job was keeping up using the companies standards."
bad,"don't have much to say about this employer, it is a very fast working environment, i learned a lot bout the kitchen, very  good co-workers although not a great management."
bad,"I remember being extremely excited to begin at Chipotle because I was really into their mission. The atmosphere seemed really fun to work in as well. However, once i started i quickly realized otherwise. The company had lured me in with under the false pretense of quick promotions and the flexibility of the job. I learned quickly that neither was true. We sometimes had a break in the morning if we finished ridiculous amounts of prep but more often than not we only had five to ten minutes to prepare and eat our food for the day. We stayed on the line for hours and had to wait hours for restroom breaks. This was  my worst experience in a job ever."
bad,"In the span of 9 months I had three different managers. I thoroughly enjoyed my time as an employee there and enjoyed the balance of responsibility and fun we had. However it seemed that the location was going through some very tough times and major transitions which was very challenging. There were not firm standards set and then all of a sudden they would be thrown at you with immediate compliance expected. Again, the company itself is fantastic and I can truly get behind a company that spends more money on it's food then it's staffing."
bad,"This job is painfully repetitive and very exhausting. Personally I don't really enjoy working for food businesses but they have been easier jobs for me to hit. Up to a certain point, I think theres only so much to learn in this company. Meeting interesting customers is what beats the day for me most of the time!"
bad,"When I first started at Chipotle, I loved it. I felt like I was somewhere I could start over and that would help me gain new skills and find new opportunities. As time went on, I was finding the employees were fantastic to work with, but management liked to play hardcore favorites, and that’s not okay. It became almost a competition with the GM that if you were tired, she had one up on you. Nothing you said could be valid if she was there. After that I lost any sort of real respect that I had for this place. It’s an organized chaos that’s very toxic to be a part of."
bad,"Some 19 year old trainers are like slave drivers.  It's not helpful to intentionally stress people out and say things like, ""You have 8 minutes to sweep the floor, restock containers, restock food, and clean the glass.""  Some trainers enjoy the power trip and control of bossing new people around.  They take themselves very, very seriously and abuse their ""power.""  I don't think I will succeed at this job based on my coworkers' domineering attitudes.  They act like you should know everything before you even started.  Some coworkers (trainers) are not supportive or helpful.  It seems like they want or expect you to fail.  Management is nice, but first-job 19 year olds should not be trainers."
bad,I did not receive the full training that I needed in order to be successful resulting in a lot of struggling to find my groove. I am learning but it has been a real struggle
bad,"•work days felt long "
bad,"They're always striving to better, which is not bad, but at the cost of their employee's. They don't care for you, they're just meeting quotas. They constantly try to suck you up to management so others can move up ahead and so they can have  a secure team. There's not really strive to manage there, but once you're there you won't get out. Unnecessary extra load on people who already do the most at that job."
bad,"Depending on the location you choose to work at you can be underpaid for what you do, example: every single shift I would come in to at least 2-3 people didn’t show up or called out for their shift . We would always be short-staffed which means you could be running at least two stations at a time, depending on how confident they are in your work ethic."
bad,If you want to work in an unnecessarily stressful environment where the customers are rude to you 24/7 then this might be the place for you! Want to be overworked and underpaid? Then work at Chipotle!
bad,Long story short: Very underpaid for the tasks that you do. Favoritism by the field leader so it’s hard to advance to a higher position even if you’re the best at your job. Shorts breaks. Stressful due to disorganized management. Lazy management. Field leader is very strict and has a stick up her butt. I would do yourself a favor and work somewhere else.
bad,"My store manager threatened to fire me because I drank too much water. I take medication that is toxic in high concentrations. I would have felt too sick to work had I not done so, but this did not matter to her. People were hired and fired very quickly, the scheduling was done poorly, and the store manager gave vague and contradictory instructions. The vast majority of my coworkers were dissatisfied with the environment."
bad,I am no longer qualified or allowed to review Chipotle as a company due to restrictions from my severance with them with the move to the OH and CA offices
bad,"it is a job to pay bills, not thing special, learning experience and earning working skill. not much to say about the job and i'm trying to fill in the 150 characters"
bad,"Since coming to Chipotle my 1st impression was wow the entire staff is just deflated. Here I was NEW to the company and yet Im the only 1 with energy. During training I noticed huge staffing issue, everyone leaving/quitting, and other managers prepping, prepping, & prepping. Its 2019 and we dont use slicers and dicers , instead opt to chop everything by hand. Im talking over a hundred lbs of vegetables daily by hand. I also would like to warn you about “the policy” that kills this job for me. Chipotle has caused so many illnesses and been in the media so much that they created a policy that makes your job as a manager impossible. So if ANY employee calls out of work and says they are “sick” (for the 12th time this month) There are NO repercussions. If you write them up OR cut their hours - You the manager will be terminated.. You will have up to 4-5 call outs a day... On average 1-3 will happen daily. You the manager will be prepping, working the line, and grilling until even a fit energetic person like me will just wanna drop. I haven't eating my “free meal” in about a month due to staffing... Employees Week 1 will be well versed about calling in and certain “key words” will get you awarded 3 days off. Its just insane and theres no real support from anywhere. Compensation is great but my life is over. Run - Seriously please dont work at Chipotle for your own good. Chipotle does a great volume and YOU will waste away while lazy employees call out when they don't feel like working (or when their friends are off) then you’ll be so desperate for help that you’ll have to let them"
bad,"I would recommend working here if you're okay with being promised promotions and never actually getting promoted. If you're okay with watching management knowingly cut corners and not follow the rules while keeping your mouth shut about it when the big dogs come in. If you're okay with being treated like the runt of the litter even though you do a better job than anyone else you work with just because you like to follow the rules. If you're okay with being hired for full-time but only getting 15-25 hours a week max. If you're okay with being berated for not being available for call ins 24/7. If you're okay with new managers constantly being cycled in and out. If you're okay with being treated like utter garbage and like an opponent rather than a friend by coworkers, then yeah it's a great place for you. Free food is bomb."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,Very stressful every time I worked. Forced overtime even though I had college classes. Worked until 2AM for cleanup even though I had classes at 8AM the next morning.
bad,"People called out everyday our GM was very poor and hardly at work. There was no discipline for anyone, and no consequences for anything. The hardest part of the job was having to work a short shift almost every day working there."
bad,"I started working at Chipotle with and open mind and excitement in my heart. I left Chipotle feeling used and empty. They have a policy where they automatically terminate you if they do not schedule you for two weeks. I was barely scheduled to work as management definitely had their favorites, and was finally let go via auto-termination. Management completely ignored my text messages and phone calls when I was trying to figure out why I was not being scheduled. Awful work environment."
bad,It was an okay job I didn’t like how I didn’t have help when many others did. One of the female mangers seemed to make me work harder than others. It was a nice paying job.
bad,"When I first got hired on at Chipotle I loved every minute of it and who I worked with. As my time progressed with Chipotle so did the atmosphere and so did the people. Within a year the manager had gotten lazy and wasn't putting his foot down with the workers. The customers stopped coming in, because of the poor attitude from. The new hires or current workers. I was stressed everyday until I quit my job there"
bad,I would never work here again. New people are put on the fryers and I burned myself so many times. It's been years and I still have scars. I was hired on the spot but eventually let go under very mysterious reasons. I was told the managers all decided together I was not a good fit. Yet they all had only good things to say when I asked them for feedback.
bad,"A typical day started with me clocking in, and immediately jumping on the line. I primarily worked nights (4PM to close). Unless it was their second or part time job, most people were scheduled at shift changing times. This was a problem because it would be unorganized and hectic when people clocked off for others to come in. This was extremely frustrating because I would have to clean the messes left before me, while somehow having to keep the line stocked with strict and different food safety standards, communicate with the cook, and serve customers their food. My managers were cool people, but because of the high standards Chipotle corporate sets, they had to consistently remind us of our duties with nit picky opinionated details and paranoia from person to person. They would constantly remind us to act, look, and do things a certain way because if someone at corporate saw something wrong on the cameras they could be in trouble, or a Chipotle inspector could come in and flag/penalize the store or employees. The amount of responsibility each worker had was overwhelming. They stretch each employee as thin as they can to make the most money, and combat any sort of questioning or suggestion of different routine/ team collaboration with accusations that you aren't working hard and fast enough. On top of this, we were also consistently understaffed, thus making things even more chaotic. As the night would progress and people would fatigue, those who had been there longer showed they had greater seniority to do less work. This was infuriating because it not only contradicted their"
bad,"My experience working at Chipotle is both good and bad. Chipotle is a great first job to have, fair starting wage, and many benefits for the workers. It is VERY fast paced, we are almost always busy, and things can get stressful, sometimes it is hard to stay positive during these times, but we always made it through it. I have been working there for about a year, and I have had no advancement in moving up in the company. I have asked many times and have even been told that I will move up but nothing has been done. After the management change, the environment of the store has really changed."
bad,"The company shifted its focus in 2017 from its leading appeal to a hardline numbers only oriented business. It used to be about the people working for the company and allowing them to work for something bigger, but now hardly pays attention to its employees. It's a shame, the company changed my life for the better but broke me in the end."
bad,When i first started I enjoyed it but over time the environment and managers get to you and you stop being happy there. Overall I did not like working there and grew to really dislike it there.
bad,Working there is alright if you don't mind occasionally figuring out how to do things yourself. There were lots of times where i was assigned to do something one day and then did something totally different. They had me work dishes a lot. It would have been alright if I hadn't gotten cuts all over my fingers and hands from the pans they used.
bad,"Chipotle has or had an amazing idea and training program that was one of the best I had ever seen."
bad,They teach you everything you need to succeed in your position. Learning is every day and the team is regularly good with exceptions. You get free food while being on shift.
bad,The manager at Chipotle was especially rude to her employees and to customers. I can tell when she made someone uncomfortable. The environment is so stressful I would find myself losing sleep.
bad,"If you're looking for a new job (you must be desperately), then Chipotle is the right candidate for you. The only thing worth at this company is the experience you can gain which includes cashier (being the easiest), Prep, and grill (hardest and most stressful station), and lastly a Service Manager (you will need around two months of training or less depending on manager).This position is pretty stressful as many of former service managers have said."
bad,"Chipotle is a great company. It honestly must have just been my specific location but I am going to go down the rating system this website uses to explain why I gave it why I gave it."
bad,"When I first started the store was more than okay, but after our new ex GM got fired it got a mess, now we have a new General Manager there but he does not know how to respect the employees , like yelling at them without showing the right way for to do."
bad,"Completely disreguards availability, and schedules you at will. Will not respect you or your wishes. Some managers are very rude and have a very quick temper especially the GM. Managers break the procedures/ rules yet get upset whem employees do it. People are usually undertrained and have unrealistic expectations set towards them."
bad,very fast pace and busy. must have great communication skills to talk to customers when they get upset. Always be friendly and have a smile on your face.
bad,"I worked my way up the ladder from crew member to general manager. It had its hardships, and I learned a lot, but the company had, and still has, its fair share of flaws. When it comes down to it, progression in the company comes down to who you have to favor you. If you are not in with the right people, then you are not going to go anywhere, and if you are not in with the right people and you are at a high enough point, they will try to get you out by putting you into rough situations, as is what happened to me. 80 plus hour work weeks at 40k annual salary? No thanks."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"Chipotle talks very highly of their employee culture, but at the end of the day management doesn't care about any non management employee. Advancement is more based around general brown nosing than merit, and many good candidates are overlooked because they aren't buddy buddy with management. Training is inconsistent. One employee may take training very seriously, while another may not care at all. Getting a manager to sign off on completed training is near impossible."
bad,I have been working at chipotle for 4 months and I don’t like it. It’s not a fun job and the managers are terrible. They don’t create a loving and warming environment. They make me feel on edge and make me feel as if I’m not welcomed there.
bad,"Honestly I hate chipotle, management here always has favorites and if you’re a favorite, you quickly move up regardless if you’re good or not and if you’re not, you’re stuck doing the same thing over and over. The year I worked there I learned nothing, but just to stay on the line, they never moved me up, I was told I was an extremely good worker but they “couldn’t find time for training” meanwhile people newer than me were already learning everything. It’s not a fair place to work and maybe you’ll like it there the first 6 or so months, but after that, it’s garbage. However, this job does teach you a lot of important things, like good customer service, having lots of patience, forcing a smile even though you’re extremely irritated, it’s a good first job, but I wouldn’t stay there longer than 6 months."
bad,"Chipotle executives are very good at building new restaurants constantly and not putting in enough care of who runs it and how. When ""training"" new employees, there's a chance of them throwing into the front lines on the first day."
bad,"I had good and bad days at Chipotle. It's a very flexible job, good hours and alright pay. Management, for me, was not great. Alot of butting heads with other employees. Very fast paced, must learn very quick as well."
bad,"I was hired for full-time work and promised 32-36 hours, but worked any where from 8-30 hours per week.  When I asked the manager about my schedule and my hours, she only gave me 2 days the following week with 8 hours total.  I felt like I was being punished."
bad,"The management was very poor and unorganized. First and foremost, they expect a lot from you. They put me on positions i was never trained in and expected me to be picture perfect at it."
bad,This was a nice and comfortable relaxing job. They are high paced especially during lunch and dinner hours.  Really enjoyed my time here sand was sad to go.
bad,"Chipotle sets you up with life skills that are going to be useful in your daily life such as; cleaning, cooking, and being responsible. You might be asked to do various activities to show that you are a top-performer. Environment is great. if it is your first job you will love it. You will make tons of friends and even sharing time with them at movies."
bad,The managers and the company do not seem to care about minors and the labor laws. The manager can mistreat and harass minors and get away with it. The manager makes some minor cry and quit because of the treatment.
bad,"Chipotle creates a very competitive culture where team work is preached but not promoted. Hard work is definitely a necessary attribute but, at most, is only of equal value as 'popularity'. If you posses both of these qualities along with the patience demanded to move through the ranks and their $1.00 raises as you obtain a management position, then I highly recommend this career."
bad,"Chipotle is good for most crew members, KMs and SMs but they take advantage of GMs like nothing else. ""Salary"" at chipotle doesn't mean doing the office work, you have to do office work but so much more. They prep everything fresh (good for customer) but then they keep labor so tight that the only way for the GM to manage it is to over work themselves. Then the high ups come in and ask a crew member, making 9$ an hour, what the companys mission is. If they don't know it, guess what the GM is doing a bad job. They don't say wow thanks for working so much to make our pockets fatter, instead find the SMALLEST thing and proclaim that your a ""low performing"" GM. The stress is through the roof at this place. Knowing that any moment a higher up can come in and find a grain of rice on the floor and freak out can destroy you over time. Everything they do is so backwards it's unbelievable. Eat the food here causes its good, but if you want any time to yourself, stay away from this place."
bad,"This is a good job for people who do not have a family. 65-75 weekly hours put in as a GM. The compensation is decent, however, with the hours worked its not worth it."
bad,"When you first start to work there, its an interesting journey. Depending on who you have as a trainer, the day can be smooth, or it can be horrible. The people you work with typically are the best part of the job. Oh and Free Food. haha. Management is very unorganized, and they HATE when they're told that they're wrong. The company use to be all about the people. After the virus and stuff went around, the people no longer mattered. It was all about the money. After awhile you start to feel stuck inside the company, and you began to scream inside each day until you break free! Love the people though."
bad,There is always something wrong with the food. They either run out of meat or salsa or guacamole. The rice is undercooked and it's like you are eating rocks! Management is also not that great.
bad,"To begin the day with the opening of the store by preparing fresh food, then serving to customers until closing. Learned to be faster and the culture."
bad,"It's a very fun but challenging place to work.But some of the managers shouldn't be leaders because they lack basic leadership skills. Most of all the apprentice who doesn't understand how to interact or respect others,he assumes that he doesn't have to show respect of any kind due to his high position.Therefor he is even rude at times to customers. Other than those factors place is a good place to work with everyone else at least."
bad,"The culture at Chipotle when I first arrived was extremely inviting and made it easy for me to look forward to going to work each day. I was a junior in high school when I started working for Chipotle and it was a pretty easy balance between work and school. Then the management started to change around and we got new leaders that expected me to ALWAYS put Chipotle first, and as a senior in high school at this point, this was something I was not willing to prioritize over my school work and future. The environment became cutthroat and catty."
bad,"The job is very stressful, overwhelming and the overall company doesn't really care about their employees. The benefits cover how much corruption really is. There are good people there for the most part, but the higher up you go the more corrupt it goes. Pay is not worth the stress, but its a good way to start with no experience. It just depends which store and what area you're in to decide whether or not you're going to be treated fairly and have a really good time."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,Management varies from store to store but is overall poor at best. Compensation is low but what do you expect from a fast food chain. Hours are not guaranteed with most going to whoever the managers befriend.
bad,"Very productive, I've met a lot of interesting people both employees and customers. Positive energy, a lot of smiles and laughs, can be discouraging at times."
bad,"The US not a recommendation for anyone who wants a good environment or a good paying job. The management get us terrible, the staff is poorly administratated"
bad,great concept; wonderful morals; 100% put into food not too much saved for employees. My general manager was 22 and she knew nothing about management of chipotle or any company for that matter. She played around with peoples livelihood and acted as if nothing mattered. Favoritism was also a big factor with the company. I hated the store I was in but would have loved to prevail within the company.
bad,"Being a college student, I did not enjoy my time at Chipotle. The management does not respect students schedules. They will have you close every night, with only two days off. That is not enough to balance school, work, social life, or family."
bad,Easily distracted environment also the employee to manager communication is subpar. Often had to reach out just to speak with someone to get things taken care of.
bad,"This was my first job, so I did whatever I could to impress. I did find it hard to relate to my co-workers. I had only just graduated from high-school. The culture and philosophy of the company was something that made me unhappy working there. Workers are encouraged to weed out what are called ""low performers"" in the crew in order to keep up with Chipotle's aggressive hiring and expansion. I saw a lot of co-workers lose their jobs over what seemed to be person grudges caused by this kind of gossip. Even people who had worked there longer than anybody. When I lost my job at Chipotle, I was very aware of the fact that we were losing a lot of business after negative publicity about the safety of our food. I was not made aware, however, of any serious deficiencies in my work performance. It was as though the managers did not want to help."
bad,"When this was my first job with food service, it seemed pretty interesting to me when I realized what kind of culture Chipotle had that the crew members could enjoy before I applied. "
bad,Worked as a line cook preparing and making sure that the line was stocked and did not run out of anything. Fast paced but not the best management.
bad,Chipotle has moved from a restaurant focused on people and culture to more or less a drive-thruless fast food restaurant. The management has little in mind but the profits on a day to day basis with a greater focus on speed than proper training and consistency.
bad,"The manager of the whole place chooses favorites, people are so disrespectful and always talk about you behind your back, it's very unorganized and they treat you as if you're dumb and don't remember anything. The hardest part of the job is it requires you to stay on your feet for 10 hours straight. If you get a 6 hour shift, you don't get a break. It's only if you have a longer shift. They keep you until probably midnight just cleaning unnecessary parts of the restaurant. I hated my experience there. They also have uneven pays throughout all the employees. Newer employees got paid more than I did."
bad,"A day at work for me consisted of opening either salsa or tortilla with time expectations. These time expectations always motivated me to get better each time. The management is less than average really. The general manager didn't do much to motivate the employees and most of what he did was sit in the office. Our apprentice and service manager were the best because they actually cared for you and wanted you to succeed. They were always there to give you motivation in the correct way. Our kitchen managers were alright. One of our kitchen managers barely worked and he was too obnoxious to work with, not much professionalism there. The other kitchen manager was a good person and worker. One thing I hated was the false hope they instill in you so you can keep working your butt off. There is really no advancement whatsoever because of the GM. My coworkers were undoubtedly the only reason I loved coming to work. These were individuals that knew what they were doing and were easy to work with. The hardest part of the job, which wasn't hard at all for me, was moving big lines. I mostly enjoyed the interaction with the customers and working with my coworkers."
bad,I worked for 6 years with an excellent work record no hard work been noticed .it’s about who you know to get you advanced
bad,"Chipotle hires one person to handle dishes, lobby, restrooms, trash and self-service station. To top it off the manager (who only stood there and watched people work) would constantly go off on you for spending more than five minutes in the dish room without checking the lobby. I turned out to be allergic to the dish detergent, and the manger refused to provide me with gloves. The store closed at 10, and we were supposed to leave at 11:30, but continued working until one, which wasn't too much of an issue at first, until one day the assistant manager made us clock out and continue working. Soon after Resigning, I was called back by the main manager and asked to return. I refuse to work in such a place again."
bad,". typical day is fun on an individual level lots to do "
bad,well at first it was a fun experience then it ended up not being what I wanted it to be
bad,"I first starting working here when it was almost a year old, and there was new management, and I loved working there. I learned all the positions and was great at all of them. We had a strong crew, a few people came and went, but overall we were doing awesome. Then the new store opened, so we lost two of our managers to the Meridian Chipotle. The general manager of that store came to the Boise location, started firing people, promoted his general manager to the Boise location, fired the apprentice, and now has his offspring residing at the Boise location and soon the Downtown Boise location. "
bad,"A loving job with great food and fantastic customers. They,re a very serious type of job. All the Workers work very hard. Moving as fast and the managment want you to. Because, I love to talk to the employees and it seemed like they just wanted you to hurry up and get them served and out of the way."
bad,"When I worked for Chipotle, I was always put under stressful situations and in bad predicaments. I always seemed to handle them well as a manager. I did daily deposits, ordered supplies and trucks, entered data in to Excel and Word. We were always shorthanded. I had to pick up slack, learned to work quickly, and under lots of stress. I would work 90 hour weeks and doubles. I would go all day without a break to eat or use the restroom."
bad,The job was nice I had flexible schedule do to having a kid appropriate breaks awesome co workers motivation of the crew was nice and fast customers enjoyed our service
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,A fun place to have your first job but some of the managers could use some social skills. Hours are inconsistent and the amount of work required for certain stations is not worth the pay. Management will also guilt trip you into not quitting or coming into work when you aren't scheduled if they can.
bad,"I spent years working for this company moving to a different state when they needed me to and driving to other city's to help out, "
bad,"Solid company but highly disappointed of the regional manager and the company standards are unrealistic. They want you to manage the store, wash dishes, prep, serve and clean and the same time."
bad,"Horrible experience with  the management, no a respectful place to work, managers don’t care about your ideas and treat you poorly and Most of the times don’t recognize your efforts, always a lot of drama in every store (6) that I worked at. They basically hired anyone so you’ll have to deal with a lot of immature co-workers. Lack of communication. The food is pretty good. A lot of benefits."
bad,"When I first got the job, it looked like a nice place to work and grow while in college. Severely understaffed, most people don’t ever seem to know anything, even the managers. People quit after one shift sometimes, the workers are really  rude until they get to know you, and then if they like you enough, they make you feel welcome. If not, they will do everything in your power to make you want to quit"
bad,"I had high expectations for Chipotle when I started. That was my first mistake along with thinking that I was going to get adequate training. I cannot emphasize enough how tiresome the job is mentally. At my location, the line would sometimes go outside and unless you catch up to things quickly you will feel looked down upon. The team did not like me. It's difficult to work with people who criticize constantly and never acknowledge the achievements you make. Low pay. Opportunities for advancement are not without their added stress. Stress is a good word to describe working at Chipotle. Upper management is disgusting."
bad,"good company but no life balance. The benefits are great but the company has no care for the employees. the opportunity for advancement is great. If you like to work 7 days a week and make money, this is the place."
bad,"I dont know if its only at the Chipotle I worked at but favoritism was problem for sure. When I joined, there had been a woman that worked there 5 years prior and she was more or less a bully. She wasn't a manager but she'd certaintly boss people around like she was while also talking badly about you in spanish and because she was great at her job, she stayed. And this is only one example of things at Chipotle."
bad,"exhausting work for little pay, stressful work environment, angry customers. i enjoyed absolutely no part of this job after almost a year of work. not to mention the burns and injuries i have accumulated."
bad,"management is messy and unorganized. I did not know if I was working on Monday until Sunday evening. Long shifts, as a  minor I would do OT while in school and they did not care."
bad,"Chipotle can be a nice job for the summer or for someone looking for some temporary part-time work. BUT! Don’t recommend working here unless you‘re needed too or are desperate. It’s tedious, straining, long, unfair, and severely underpaid work for any position at Chipotle. It’s crazy busy most of the time, management is HORRIBLE and even though the company says all the time it‘s employees are number one and they care for them... it’s a complete lie. If you call out sick one day, the managers yell at you and demand you come in anyways-no matter if you’re deeply sick and have been vomiting all day. The schedule lies as well, everyday you end up working past your scheduled time and have to specifically ask your managers! to get out on your „scheduled time“. Hours are long, you work super hard here you’re whole shift and never get a break. If the managers decide to give you a break, even if you work a 9+ hour day and are entitled to that, it’ll most likely be right after you open (if your opening)  and only a 10 Minute break, and right before you close (if your closing) again only a 10. To sum everything up... this Job is unworth it. Severely underpaid for the work required, no breaks, work that pushes you to your limits on a daily basis, horrible management, horrid customers, basically no time off unless you want to get written up or yelled at by management (who will then cut your hours), schedule is never pushed out two weeks prior and on a good week you might see it a couple days before that next week begins (at my location it wasn’t uncommon for it to be posted on Sunday-the"
bad,Got to work around 8am and started to prepare all the food we could need through the day. When we opened the customers would rush in and we would help as fast as possible. I was in charge of making sure all of the food was coming out cooked and cut right.
bad,Working at Chipotle is very stressful especially if you are in management because you would occasionally be running the store with two other people and yourself.
bad,Chipotle used to heavily emphasize how important it was for its company culture was and how important it was to take care of its employees. This is not the case. Management will work you as much as possible with little to show for it. The pay does not compensate with the treatment and work expected from the company.
bad,"Over the last almost year of working there, i was worked to the bone with a 9.50 an hour wage, which was nothing compared to the amount of work i was doing. The amount of things that needed to be done at night severely outweighed the amount of things in the morning, so i felt as if i was doing more but getting paid less then new hires."
bad,"chipotle management is terrible. I was relocated to a farther location without any heads up by my field leader and ended up having to quit because my current pay wouldn't allow me to get to that store and back home without going bankrupt. people saying theyd quit to get promotions, improper training etc. I was given a choice, quit/ get demoted, or transfer and go broke by my field leader."
bad,"Hard work with disinterested crew, long hours, procedures constantly changing and company vision always changing. Promotion and advancement are hard to come by"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,I worked very hard for Chipotle but managers (very young) promoted their drinking and pot smoking friends. You only get promoted if the team votes for you which I think is very stupid because a lot of new people have no experience to know if somebody is ready and only vote if the like the person. You get a lot of bad managers because of this. The job is very easy but very fast paced it is a lot of work.
bad,"Working at Chipotle was a great growing experience to further my leadership skills and also learn about company budgeting. Although the pay is great and the hour are flexible and would be ideal for any college student there are few major flaws with working here. The scheduling is not completely figured out, and even when it is there are more than a couple call outs everyday which causes low staffing, which then leads to shifts not running smoothly. I do believe that if there was more staffing and better scheduling things wouldn't be all that bad."
bad,"Food service more enjoyable than others. Usually a good place to work while going to school or preparing for your next step in life. Employee meals are the best! Discount not terrible, benefits single people a bit more than families."
bad,"Initially when I was hired, the job was fun because the people there made it fun. Despite a completely incompetent manager, the crew around me made the job manageable. The work was very tough and Chipotle asks you to do a lot without much of a crew. After a recent management change and half of our staff leaving, the place became too much to bear. Nobody higher than our general manager wanted to help us out and that led to a very toxic workplace."
bad,This was by far the worst job I've ever had. Granted I worked at an extremely busy store that never saw an end to the lines and the rude people that made working here terrible. It is different depending on where you go so make good observations before applying.
bad,"When I started at Chipotle, it was definitely a people culture. Everyone cared about one's growth as a person and worker. All of that has changed for the worst."
bad,I believe that working at Chipotle was a great experience especially being that I am in school. The hours were really flexible and the pay was great. I would recommend this job to anyone!
bad,"Learned some new cooking techniques, how to properly roll a burrito, how to make chips, met some cool employees, and learned how to quickly move on my feet."
bad,"Overall, working for this company is not unbearable. You go in, help your customers, and leave. The only real issue I had while working here was with the company. I was not well trained, and management doesn't really care about the employees well being."
bad,the gm will constantly be on your back for no reason if he does not like you. it definitely is favorites inside the store. i wouldn't recommend if you aren't the same ethnicity.
bad,Don't want to bad mouth them so i rather not disclose. you are not supposed to speak bad on any company that you work for so i rather not day anything if it's not good.
bad,"Very strict company, many requirements. A lot of competing throughout employees very hostile environments. Seniority plays a huge part. Veterans are highly HIGHLY intimidated by new comers"
bad,This WAS a fun place to work at until management became shady and docked my hours for no reason. I never had a set schedule which also made it frustrating.
bad,"Chipotle used to be a great place to work. The benefits and pay were pretty good for a fast food place and as a GM I made decent money. The people culture though was the main reason that mad e Chipotle such a great place to work. They were all about making yourself, your team and your restaurant better everyday. But now they have gotten rid of the people culture completely and they only focus on food and money. It's really sad to see how far Chipotle has fallen."
bad,"The team was very energetic and everyone got along. However, I was hired on opening day for a new Chipotle restaurant in the area. 30 people and I in a failing location. So I eventually got cut. That's my experience."
bad,"Horrible job security and unbearable work environment if you plan on staying for longer than three months. Old manager harassed workers  verbally and physically leading on to more stress. I got second degree burn and they told me to ""work faster""."
bad,Chipotle is good as a temporary job. At my store I wasn't treated very well by managment. I would make one mistake and it's like it was the end of the world.
bad,The only reason I would say don't work at Chipotle is because the chipotle I worked at. I believe that a lot of the crew i worked with were not only amazing people but were like family to me. They had to go through so much because of the upper management at this location and it was unfair to them. The amount of discrimination that took place was unfair to them. I hope that they find a job that will treat them well because this job was only a burden on their lives.
bad,"chipotle is a very interesting place to work at, it has its good things as well as its bad things. but in the middle of all the catastrophes that occur when it gets full you get to learn many things such as, working under pressure, becoming more agile with the things you do, you learn many important things about food and its making. the workplace culture is very nice and the food is great, in the other hand for my personal experience in the management side of it wasn't very well i had in the beginning a great set of managers around me and my team that taught us  everything but then some management changes were done and management became very poor and especially from the general manager that had replace the past one. i strongly disliked working once she took over coming from a place where i loved and enjoyed working in. but at the end the part that i enjoyed the most of it all was the great people that i met and most importantly learned many things that in the past did not know about."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"I do not recommend working here, as it does not seem like a great job. I worked there as a high school student, so i was limited as it is. Chipotle an compensate you decently but overall it may not be a great option, especially long term."
bad,"BIGGEST PRO is that I received all I can eat free food before, during, and after every shift. Although, I was guilt tripped when giving my two weeks notice, and I was made to be moving the entire time as the cashier- yet my coworkers on the line could just stand there. I was even made to fix the toilet's flushing WHILE I was on duty as a cashier."
bad,"an extremely fast paced job. Every task has an assigned completion time to it. The pressure to complete some tasks seems a bit unrealistic. The pay does not match the pressure that the company asks of you. "
bad,"In overall I can't complaint about the company,I see what they are trying to do with Food Safety, and Organic food. it just as simple as they hope their employees to work extremely hard for too little. They standard what they ask for are doable, but not with all the procedures that they actually want, with labor, or any other number that i will not say."
bad,"had team members doing management jobs but wasnt paying them management money, team members did food orders and inventory managers did nothing but sit and eat and laugh"
bad,"it was horrible,the manager angie from maiden lane she made it a living nightmare. She yelled for no reason and she never actually worked she just sat there and hung out with her friends like a careless manager"
bad,chipotle is a very fun place to work at. they way you make food there makes you think twice about going out to eat to another fast food place. learning different recipes and trying out new food was always fun.
bad,"A typical day of working at Twinsburg Chipotle Mexican Grill is easy but hard work. It all depends on what position you are; I was trained on line and easily moved up to cashier, prep, grill and out-take. The starting hourly salary is $9.50, which is a great starting salary. "
bad,"Clean dishes, Food Prep, Mop floors, Season food, Etc. Hardest part of the job is washing the dishes. Other workers were easy to get along with. Didn't take me long to get hired"
bad,It was a good job for my first job to gain work life experience but I would view it as a temporary job. You work long hard hours for low pay. and it was very intense.
bad,The manager showed favoritism towards a certain group of people. Yelled at employees in front of guests and made the Team meme era feel uncomfortable. I would never work at another chipotle again.
bad,"The people that you work with are definitely the best part of this job. Everything else kind of sucks, ESPECIALLY the customers. Dear God. The only redeeming thing were the other crew members and managers."
bad,"Poor management style with opportunities to advance if you ask to move up, however you basically have to harass a manager to advance constantly. If that isn't your style, be ready to be stagnant for a long long time at the Kalamazoo or Portage stores."
bad,There was a point in time where this company was more then what I could ask for. As things began to go downhill it seems they didn't know what to do with the culture.
bad,"Chipotle has thirteen characteristics that you must adhere to, they WILL ask you to work while of the clock and are currently being sued for said illegal behaviors. I was given three days of training before being thrust into long rushes with minimal direction. If you don't manage to instantly fall into the norm of the business, the managers constantly inform you that you are not being a ""top performer"" and WILL threaten your job. Do not work here unless it is your last option."
bad,"First off, some of the management was ok. But there was a manager dating another manager. Even worked the same shift. Lack of communication as well. Was told i was doing a great job and was let go for standing up for myself and was told there was no improvement."
bad,"I was a cashier at Chipotle Mexican Grill. I loved the environment, I loved my job, and I loved the people most of all; however, the management didn't care as much for their employees as I would have preferred. While attending high school from 7:00 a.m.-2:00 p.m., they had me scheduled from 3:30 p.m. to close every night I worked, which was entirely too much for my workload, and I didn't get home until 2:00 a.m. I lost 10 pounds, had 5 severe panic attacks on the job, and slept for 18 hours straight the day I quit because I was so exhausted. The Chipotle I worked at was brand new, so my review only highlights the one month that I worked there, but it really is a high-stress job that could be rewarding if you truly have what it takes and you don't let your managers walk all over you. Good luck!"
bad,"Great learning experience when working in food, however Chipotle is no different than any other fast food employer:"
bad,"Very fast paced, many bilingual associates. Mostly friendly associates. Delicious food."
bad,"Hmm.. What can I say about Chipotle perhaps maybe it was the worst place I have yet to worked, the amount of politics that goes on here is ridiculous, managers favoritism others and seriously screw the new hires, I've worked 3 weeks here and was let go because of how I didn't fit the 'Chipotle vision' instead of helping you improve on your flaws they'll just fire you expecting that to help, yes I can see that definitely making me a better employee, working at a place with zero job security and also being expected to kill yourself in the amount of work for minimum to nothing is beyond my comprehension, my advice is stay away from here, also to note if you work under 5 hours you're not allowed to get a free meal or nothing not even a break."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"I worked with them for about a year, and the certain store that I was at was the 2nd busiest in the Chicago region, so we were always busy, always a line, non stop."
bad,"My first job, very fast pace. Everyone have their likes and dislikes about their job. Chipotle is just consider to be one of the jobs that I didn't like very much. I love the co workers we created a bond within the store and were like brothers and sisters. The managers took their title for granted."
bad,"-A typical day a t work was busy and fun with the customers help of course."
bad,"Performed administrative duties including payroll, inventory, ordering, cash handling, and"
bad,"count cash drawers, prepare food, cashier, make burritos or bowls for people, clean when the restaurant closed."
bad,not good with promoting from with in. very busy company for small pay check
bad,"would have loved to grow old here, field support leaves management defeated."
bad,"the hardest part of the job is luchtime."
bad,"Upper management is not able to provide plans or solutions for area wide issues. The hours are ridiculous and the work itself is taxing and stressful. While they preach a people oriented company, they don't practice it. In addition, they refuse to recognize low paying wages to hourly employees results in high turnover-not lack of motivation."
bad,"I was a service manager. I knew how to run the store answer question, schedule, truck orders, ect. "
bad,"As cashier i would handle money transactions and would provide great customer service by interacting with them while they were enjoying their meal. I would keep dinning room clean and neat. I would make sure behind the counter and drink station was fully stocked and organized. If needed i would help on the line preparing food for the customers. I opened and closed the cash register and dinning room. I would count out and set aside money for deposit. I would answer phones and take orders by phone. On special occasions that we had i would inform the customers about what charity we were supporting and why, also sharing the company motto. I would deal with and resolve minor complaints and issues. And help out in any position i could. I learned how to help manage a fast paced restaurant and how to multitask at a high speed. There was two managers one service and one kitchen whos heart was in the right place and did what ever he could to help and encourage his employees and keep things in the restaurant moving smoothly. How ever other managers slacked off quite a bit and found it very frustrating and an inconvenience to help various positions. These managers would constantly give horrible criticism over things that were not done wrong but over things that were not done ""good enough"" and refused to take in perspective that one person cant do it all. Praise, reward and gratitude are unheard of. And its sad, disapointing and heartbreaking because positions at Chipotle require a lot of backbreaking hard work at a very high constant speed. Management favored workers and would not punish"
bad,"Run the day to day operations of the restaurant. The food with integrity mission statement was set up to ensure that all of Chipotles food comes from family farms and no factory farms. All of the animals are never given any anitbiotics or added growth hormones. They are all fed a vegetarian diet and they are allowed to roam free without being locked up in small cages. The co-workers were all great, Chipotle only hired the best-of-the-best. Every once in a while someone may slip through the cracks but they never last long in a group of top performers. The hardest part of the job there was the factthat all of the upper management in the Central Region got let go because of hipocrisies. The best part of the job is, was, and always will be sharing the story with customers."
bad,"in chipotle, a lot of favoritism goes on. The managers don’t care if your sick and will force you to work. It’s honestly a very toxic place full of very toxic place."
bad,"Taco bell v2 in the recent years. Used to based off good principles and morals but management and corporate employees have trashed that. Food is slowly being pre packaged and pre prepped to keep up with demands so there goes ""fresh food"". Hours are random sometimes but pay is decent and they actually do offer management if you're one of the suckers who they have emotionally manipulated to overworking themselves long enough for a stingy corporation. Good job security because the turnover rate company wide is terrible."
bad,"be ready to move and non stop for hours on in"
bad,The main issue I had was they over hired when they opened so they started cutting people loose. I was considered an employee without working for a solid month. My management at the time kept giving me the run around and I ultimately quit in the end.
bad,"I wouldn’t recommend working there . I didn’t have a pleasant time . I had one or two co-workers that I got along with but besides that , everyone else was stuck up ."
bad,Good not great experience working at this company when does a managerial skills but work like balance was a huge opportunity during my experience but I enjoyed the free meal every day
bad,"I know they try to push hard for a really cool work culture, but when I worked there, a lot of my coworkers treated it like it was ""just"" a job. They were only there for the money. They didn't care about doing their job right, even when their laziness makes things harder for their coworkers. For a job where you're constantly under pressure and the customers are far from your friends, it really sucks to not have any support from your coworkers. "
bad,"The environment in this restaurant is just ridiculous. Whenever I think corporate has gone too far, they go way deeper than they’ve ever been. About a month ago, we literally had to take this “hospitality class” which was completely unnecessary, because it was about customer service and treating the customers right, which we all literally already knew how to. Needless to say that class did nothing, only now we make ourselves look more stupid saying literally every single customer “did we make this perfect for you?” Or “please take the survey on the receipt and you can win free burritos for a year.” Whenever they or the person saying that could care less. Corporate really doesn’t care about any of their workers. It’s just an awful place to work at."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,Scheduled absolute minimal staff to slide by though the day and if one person doesn't show up no one has a good day. Free food is always the best. Lots of prep work that needs to get done in the AM shift or the day will not be successful. Meticulous cleaning standards Learned how to handle a kitchen knife safely.
bad,"Working for this company overall is great, great benefits and great crew. But it was not a great experience in my case when your job is threaten every time you get a visit from management, leaving you with a sweet and sour feel and lowering your self confidence."
bad,"Pour une entreprise de restauration rapide de qualité chipotle se démarque par les produits frais et son management axé sur l'humain."
bad,"Depending on your area and how the store performs it can be very stressful. A lot to learn and also unfair pay... I was a kitchen manager and got paid less than a crew member that I had worked with. In all it was hard to balance my time between school and the company since managers are often dissatisfied when you ask for days off. The atmosphere is full of kind people, I just wish there was less stress since students have enough as it is. There are also problems with people calling out often and in circumstances like this help isn’t usually received from management. The crew members are just asked to perform at a higher pace therefore degrading the quality of the food. This then hurts the reputation of the store and the blame falls upon the workers."
bad,I am a student in high school and I was getting scheduled 330 to 11 everyday of the week. I had no time for school work or any other extracurricular activities. Also the managers would always fight and did not communicate. On multiple occasions I was repremanded because I communicated a day I needed off to one manager and because they were fighting would not communicate to the others
bad,"They make you work to your breaking point,.  If you are in production your day starts by cutting enormous quantities of veggies with a certain number of minutes for each one ( unrealistic times ).  You can’t stop working even for a minute and then you have to start washing dishes.  They require you to do more work than is humanly possible in your shift.  Even if you are working your best it’s not good enough . And then you are not allowed to leave even if your shift is over until your supervisor approves it.  You are going to end up your day with pain everywhere in your body."
bad,Being able to work very quickly fast paced with other workers was fun. Sometimes you had to be so fast paced that it was stressful some employers was mad at others.
bad,The management at Chipotle could certainly be better. However you will find that the crew and most Assistant Managers are some of the nicest people you will ever meet.
bad,May not be all Chipotles but this location has it bad. Certain managers are rude and they really just throw you on things with no training & expect you to pick up everything fast with no help. The people that you meet here are cool & nice but because of the lack of structure you really want to leave. The pay doesn't match the stress.
bad,"It was cool work because I like to work with food , but some of the people were difficult to work with. They were never appropriative of the way you help the team get things done"
bad,It's a very fun job albeit only temporary. I wouldn't recommend attempting to move up in the company though as they have unreal expectations for their management. Many of the kitchen equipment was poorly maintained making the job more difficult than it needed to be as well as dangerous.
bad,A typical day is busy constantly doing something. The hardest part is filling up the ice machine and trying cleaning and do cash. The most enjoyable is at end of the night wen you eat.
bad,This job was incredibly stressful and high volume. There was a always a line of customers all the way out the door. I didn't feel like I was given enough support to maintain that high level of productivity with the tools on hand.
bad,"The most challenging part of this job for me was time management. They expect you to work and learn very rapidly. "
bad,i work here currently but i am looking right now into replacing chipotle with a job that wont make me stay back until ur work station is clean and i am a opener for another job and they ask that u ask them to leave early and the manager has to say yes or no and i cant even finish my station due to them bringing me stacks and stacks of dishes to wash as i am a prep member and they always leave dishes and dishes piled up when i am on my way to work and im just over the company and all its messed up and stressful work enviroment
bad,Management has no respect for employers. Co workers are very friendly tho. They help when they aren't busy. Management is lazy. Corporate does nothing when you call about something.
bad,Chipotle has great opportunities to grow and one can move up quickly if working hard enough. The unfortunate part of working for the restaurant industry in general is the demanding lifestyle. Work/ Life balance are nonexistent especially in management. You are required to work more than be able to live life.
bad,"Your day was always planned out when you walked in. If you were learning a new positing you would get shown what to do, but not well at all. You had to learn as you go, but in a fast paced restaurant it is not effective when you are just left after being told once and have to keep asking questions. My co-workers were my best asset and I didn't like going to management for questions. I did however learn some things, although the hard way. I learned how to effectively work with my crew and communicate. I also learned valuable customer service skills as well as how to handle cash."
bad,"Chipotle was an all right place to work.  I was hired essentially on the spot since they were low on workers.  I was not trained well. I only trained for a day on the cash machine, which was fine.  But I was not told all my duties for clean up and during work hours.  Some of the workers are quite nice, and one of my managers was great.  The others though, would yell at me to do something while I was doing something they just told me to get done and were quite rude-even to some of the customers.  A typical day was that of cashiering, cleaning up, refilling napkins, ice, etc. The hardest part was probably the constant moving from one thing to another.  There were so many duties assigned to the cashier that it was a bit hard to keep track of.  New things to do were added to my list almost every day while the other workers only took care of a few things at a time.  My list was filled with at least 10 things to take care of all the time: cashier, packing food, clearing trays and plates from tables, cleaning the plates and trays, wiping down tables, sweeping floor, refilling napkins, forks, spoons, and straws, refilling the ice machine, customer service, answering the phone, and taking online orders.  Keep in mind that I had to switch between these for about 6 hours everyday and that this is just during open hours."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"in my opinion, Chipotle is going downhill and will probably fall through by the end of the year, due to this whole food safety crisis that happened at the beginning of the year. we've always been short staffed and things get backed up way way too quickly and easily."
bad,My coworkers was over supervisor I like been a grill cook close to my home not to far to drive alot of students worked there so i was able to get some overtime
bad,Labor at its finest.  I appreciate the opportunity while it lasted and thank u very  much for ur time.i had fun ..didn't like taking breaks I like to workall the way though
bad,"If you are in a crew level position, this review doesn't really apply. I really loved working as crew, it was fun and exciting and I worked really hard. Being a manager in this company was one of the worst experiences I've ever had. We were constantly short-staffed, and we would only hire ""the best of the best"" so despite turnover being really high, we weren't getting new employees in at a fast enough rate. I was managing shifts with less than half of the recommended number of staff. I was forced to work nearly 60-70 hours a week because they needed me to fill the gaps that our short-staffed store had. The overtime was great, but I wasn't being paid nearly enough for the work that I was doing. The only payoff I would imagine now is their tuition reimbursement program, but I didn't stay long enough to see that. Work-life balance is awful, unless you are at a TOP TIER store, expect your personal life to go dead. Myself and the apprentice (who worked 80 hours a week) were carrying the store and had absolutely NO LIFE outside of work. You sleep, go to work, and even on your days off, you usually get called in because they need you. Typically I was working on a good day the job of 2 people and on a bad day the job of 4. To top it off, the upper management constantly told us we weren't doing a good enough job because we didn't meet their high standards even when we worked our butts off on a daily basis. I was doing the work of a service manager (I had an unofficial title of ""acting service manager"", what a joke) while I was a kitchen manager, and they refused to officially promote"
bad,"Chipotle although it may be a great place to eat it is not a great place to work. The managers ( well atleast in my store which is MSP - madison square park ) SUCK . So much unfairness and favoritism in this store. "
bad,"Chipotle was a good start for a first job. There was strong nepotism and the managers favored their family employees. After I left the job, they called my parental guardian and told him that I was always late and skipped work. This however was not true. I always showed up 15 minutes early and when they needed someone to cover a shift, I was always available to do so. After a persons shift was over, the managers would make them stay over an hour to do unproductive work suck as cutting limes or finishing up dishes."
bad,"It is very easy to get into the routine of things at Chipotle. I learned how to use a sense of urgency and efficiency. The management at the particular Chipotle I worked at was absolutely terrible, managers are young and act as such. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the lack of professionalism as far as management is concerned. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers"
bad,this is a fun place for people who want to work in the restaurant industry and to gain some knowledge by working your way up to possibly working at your own restaurant for chipotle .problem is if the management is horrible which the one i was working at was then you will be somewhere where they don't train and expect you to know everything also they use teenagers as managers which is fine i am not discriminating but they should properly train them if they are just going to be having anyone become manager cause at our location there was teenagers selected as mangers because of family relations etc and the problem was they acted as teenagers instead of managers goofing off forgetting to give breaks or being a motivating leader. i feel if they work hard to make sure they have strong leaders leading their employees which i have saw the difference at other locations and it can be done than i feel this can be a awesome place to work.
bad,"i'd go in five times a week and work a five to seven hour work shift. i would prepare all the meats bfore the building opened up. i would than help out in the front by cleaning the resturaunt after customers finished eating. i would go on the line when employees needed to take a break. i would work on the line and on the grill half the time. the hardest time was closing, id have to clean the grill as well as wash all the dishes and to make sure everything was clean and sparkly. my favorite time of work was when talking to customers"
bad,"I learned that you have to stand up for yourself, even if you're afraid."
bad,"Because of the small staff, it is very difficult to take off work, as you won't find anyone to cover for you. "
bad,"Chipotle was the worst job I could have possibly had. The team didn't work as one half the time. The managers were very unorganized. While I was in training, I was not being trained correctly.  However there were a few nice people that helped me along the way whenever I didn't understand something. The pros were the payday and free food."
bad,"Cashier n Clean tables keep my money accurate, i learn how to talk to customers"
bad,Customers are very rude and managers do little to nothing. You get no breaks and they barely care about your outside life and troubles. Overall not recommended
bad,Need better management and employees. Everthing and everyone need more order and manger need to stand film on the rules for everyone friends and all..
bad,To crowed of a crew every busy work. No ALOT OF HOURSSS AVAILABLE. bad training true to advertising. Caused me to have cooper tunnel in both wrists great discounts
bad,Work here for under a year and I didnt like it Management was horrible and they gossip about the other employees to other employees I felt like I worked in a circus
bad,"This was an okay job. I only worked one day, asked when I worked next, and was told the GM would text me. I didn’t hear from the GM so I texted them and they still haven’t responded. They tried to train me on a busy day on line. Overall the crew was nice. I wouldn’t recommend if you’ve worked in actual fast food before."
bad,"Poor management, everything is based off of favoritism & cliques. People who have been with the company longer receive so so treatment. If there was a sense of leadership the company would be ran much better."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"While working for Chipotle Mexican Grill, Lack of knowledge to be mindful for other employees, the lack of caring for a balance in the workforce was terrible."
bad,It was a fast paced working environment but they weren't very professional. The work was easy to catch on to as long as you had patience. The management was really flimsy.
bad,"Working here I experienced racial discrimination and was fired because the lady worked for the store I was only training at worked there longer then me. They “set” up a meeting upon my second attempt to let the manager know what was happening, to try and smash any problem there may have been just to be unbelievably ganged up on and literally “set up”"
bad,"Some of the restaurants I have worked at have been good and others have been terrible. The work environment highly depends on who the gm is. When the gm cares about their people, then the work environment is great. However when they have become friends with the crew, they let them do whatever with no reprocussions. I would not recommend working at CMG."
bad,The Job was okay for the age I had at the time and the fact I didn’t have much experience. It interfered with my school schedule so I had to leave. The work environment is very stressful if you are any part of the kitchen.
bad,Chipotle is a great place to work.  I'm just trying to better myself and my employment!  I have 27 yrs. of professional kitchen experience. I'm a very fast learner and a very dedicated employee.
bad,"This job had no consideration for high school students, but I do recommend it to those who want a challenging job. It's a fun place to work, but it can be very stressful, constantly busy & being a cashier you hardly get any help."
bad,It was ok not my best. I enjoyed helping people but the pay could have been better. I have a disability and I know I will find a better job for me to help me.
bad,"It was really overwhelming. My manager who hired me was nice and sweet. But my coworkers were... Questionable. I mean most were okay and nice enough but I just got frustrated and easily overwhelmed as I was put on cashier on the weekends. And the hours were not flexible at all. They told me If I can get the register memorized I can work the line to even out my hours, and that is how they run their workers. But a guy got hired after me and he was immediatley on line! That was not fair! The management was inconsistend and it was just stress inducing. Wouldnt come back here."
bad,Manager couldn’t work with my schedule when he said he would do it was difficult for me to juggle both jobs . Not to mention their was some poor customer service with the managers as well
bad,"Responsible for kitchen cleanliness, customer service, and team compliance as well as productivity. This is a job that had more downs than ups after almost year and a half."
bad,My experience at Chipotle Mexican grill was hard. I have learned every position in the work place. I didn't understand why I could't get promoted at work. I have worked there for a year and a half. The crew was amazing and it was a blast. The management was awful. The management never knew from one day to the next. Example I was a griller and they would tell us the day off that we had a fundraiser. I never understood why they wouldn't go over the crew weeks in advance that we would have fundraisers through out the weeks or months. That would bother me the most. Another reason why I didn't like working for this company is the pay. The pay is awful. Plus I would do the most with the littlest pay. Back of the house should get paid way more than the people in the front of the house. My management team was awful. They were so uncoordinated they didn't know what was going on. Very bad communication with the management team. The hardest part of the job is dealing with customers occasionally. I think that the company should focus more on the employees rather than pushing sells. That was the main focus of what happened when working for the company. Couldn't get promoted because of the crew or management team. Made me quit at the end of my career at Chipotle.
bad,"Not a bad job, they were not very communicative within the team, pay was a little above minimum wage, and best was you got a employee meal after every shift you worked."
bad,"As for the job it was exhausting and I felt like they over worked everyone for how much we were getting paid. As a cashier I had to check people out, help people with any concerns they had, help bag online orders and hand them to delivery people, restock drinks, bag chips, quickly run and restock the drink station area, wipe down tables, sweep the floor, empty and re bag trash cans, refill the ice machine which took like 20 giant barrels filled with ice. Like I constantly had to be moving around or checking out a customer. But besides the actual job itself most of my employees were pretty chill and fun to work with besides the occasional attitudes and snitches."
bad,"Management typically sucks. I reported people to respectful workplace, and nothing changed smh. "
bad,It was overall an okay place to work at. Management was poor but the employees and work made it worth it. I’m very thankful for the experience I had there.
bad,"I worked at Chipotle and during my time there I definitely enjoyed it, however, if you are a college student looking for a summer job, this might not be the place for you. Or it might be -if you're lucky enough to get a manager that respects your wishes and does not overstep the boundaries set between a boss and his/her workers. Make sure that your manager UNDERSTANDS that you plan on returning back to school (and won't drop out) therefore, they should respect your two-week notice and not enter something completely different in the system. Truly a shame that my latest experience in trying to get rehired after having left on such a positive note, I was met with obstacles, misunderstandings especially with HQ and left with little desire to go back."
bad,"Pays well, very fast paced and competitive, 30 minute lunch break with free meal (one burrito or bowl, chips and guacamole and a regular soft drink), training was insufficient."
bad,The management could’ve been better. They never listened when I requested for certain days off or how I couldn’t work in mornings. The coworkers were great though
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,fun place to work. it is what you make it. management can be the reason people leave. a lot of gossiping goes down. hardest part was keeping up with busy days.
bad,um this place was fun and i would definitely eat there again they were very clean while i worked there thats for sure thats all i use to do clean lol so i would recommend there to eat.
bad,Chipotle was not an awful place to work but definitely was not my favorite. The management was pretty out of whack and there was many issues with the staff.
bad,Terrible place don’t work here it’s stressful the customers suck management is not able to handle the lack of employees and fast paced environment work somewhere else
bad,"Great place to work when you're not in a full-time school program. "
bad,for all of the work i had to do from the cooking to prepping the food or even had to fill had someone else position if they didn't show up. i wasn't paid enough.
bad,This was my first job ever as a teenager and ill say i hate it. I dont know if its just me but i cant work at a fast food place like chipotle. The managers are always yelling and telling you what to do.
bad,"The job itself is okay, my manager doesn't take my schedule into consideration, and I asked for 30 hours a week and work 40. The job isn't easy, it takes a lot of work. And closing sucks."
bad,"Overall I had an okay time here but I did not like how bad they overworked me, honestly was not satisfied with how much I got paid compared to the amount of work I had to put in. Bad management was the number one reason I left, after getting injured on the job I was not satisfied with the way my supervisors handled the situation, extremely unprofessional."
bad,"They push too hard, you get thriwn around, its a really stressful job amd if you like it then you like if you don't then you don't and you don't make enough to live off of and the management is kinda poor"
bad,"Chipotle Mexican Grill. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (/tʃɪˈpoʊtleɪ/, chih-POHT-lay) is an American chain of fast casual restaurants in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany, and France, specializing in tacos and Mission-style burritos."
bad,The workplace culture was terrible. I was the only woman who was trained on the grill and all of the men would cat call at me our grab my behind. It was highly inappropriate.
bad,"They hired me after the interview and accepted that I would only be able to work at certain times because I was a full-time college student. They proceeded to let me work one day, then fired me because my schedule did not work well with their shifts. What???"
bad,"The managers were unprofessional, and they were always understaffed. Some of the food was out of date but they still made us prepare it. I did like the vibe of chipotle though."
bad,"The manager was young and inexperienced.  He was too focused on being friends with everyone, so workers took advantage and often got very little done."
bad,"Something that I thought was really bad, and one of the reasons that I left was because they didn't gave me many hours, I just worked from 11:45am to 1:00pm and 4:45pm to 6:00pm, and sometimes that hours for the same day, so I went to work twice a day, for only an hour and a half."
bad,"very stressfull place to work at, a lot of work for very low pay at the time, management was not to good. At times we would get off work at 11:30 and would have to be in the next day at 7am."
bad,"Such terrible management with a brand new store, almost no communication between managers and they did not give me the full time position they promised me."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,"Fun if you want something that will make the time go by. Alot of career options great if you want to move into a culinary career. 401k plans, retirement, room for advancement."
bad,"It's fine as a college job as it does pay better than most food service jobs, but it had its issues. The culture of Chipotle is sort of strange and if you can't get behind it, then you won't enjoy your job. It is also very fast-paced (at least in a big city store like I was in,) and the managers are pretty ruthless. People were fired left and right, sometimes on an almost daily basis."
bad,I worked here part time during college. The expectations and demands did not equal to the pay. I was constantly yelled at and pressured by the manager and other employees to cook more food but they would tell me AFTER the food had ran out. It was there job to tell me BEFORE the food ran out.
bad,I worked there for a year and 2 months it was okay sometimes it was really fast paced and really annoying but some days were easy and slow paced but it was mostly fast paced
bad,"Pay is not well with the amount of work and stress that they put on you, underpaid is an understatement. Management just doesn't care most of the time"
bad,"managers were short handed, and it reflected on the quality of help the employees received. "
bad,"You are underpaid until you advance. In the higher level be prepared to work 60+ hours a week unpaid because you are in a salary position. If you like the food service industry then it is a good place to work with room for advancement. If you just want a part time job be prepared to work a lot. There are some really great managers who help and support you, then there are a lot of managers that can barely do there job."
bad,"Its a favortism company. Management is rude and theres  no room for growth. The workplace is hectic and stressful. If your co-workers dont like you, you will fail. Hardest part of the job is having the tools and help needed to carryout your duties. Not everyone is a team player. The most enjoyable part is the tips and customer gratitude for the quality of service and food."
bad,Everything was fine until the new manager got carried away with his personal issues. He got really cocky and all about himself. Kept telling me he was going to promote me even though I was more than qualified and then making excuses. Made me stay passed my time everyday because someone was late or they just needed extra hands to clean back of the house.
bad,"The company, overall, is terrible. The corporate culture is largely dictated by the area managers, and so he can turn a blind eye to whatever he or she wants to unless it impacts employee turnover or overall functioning of the business."
bad,Great Morning crew. Its a fun place to work at especially with the right managment I seen some of the greatest leaders leave this company n excell in other places. Its always busy so u get ur hours.
bad,I started out as a crew member and worked my way up to management. The company suffered a major blow after the outbreaks in 2015 and thus changed the way they did business. The job itself become more rigorous but the pay stayed the same. The company is now scrambling to get out of the negative spotlight by rolling out a new menu item that is not at all tasty.
bad,Fast pace work environment. Team is expected to work together and communicate at all times. Provide a excellent customer experience. Provide a clean and safe work environment at all times.
bad,"I would assume it varies by store with some people well run and organized. The location in Pitt is unorganized and, at times, unprofessional. As a company, employees feel valued and are generally taken care of, however."
bad,"Working at Chipotle was a great experience because I learned necessary skills to prepare quality good and providing excellent customer service. "
bad,"The patch I worked for was completely incompetent. If we had a regional manager, they were always changing. I opened up this store and went through five different GM's. Not all are like this, but this Chipotle was not the best."
bad,I was treated unfairly and so were a lot of my co workers. I was reprimanded for things beyond my control and most but not all of the managers were just incapable of recognizing hard work on the part of others.
bad,"If you're 16 and want money, this is an okay place to start."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,It's always a rush and the employees or managers do not take their jobs serious at all. Everyone acts like its recess and they don't do their job correctly. Very unorganized and slow.
bad,"It started off well, but when the managers begin to fall under pressure by their superiors, they tend to take their frustrations out on the staff. When confronted by the staff they began to yell and tell us that we didn't understand what they were going through."
bad,Store mangers tend to abuse power to belittle crew members. Fast paced working always multiple task that need handling. All in all store managers just need improvement in training crew members.
bad,"As far as coworkers go, it is fine. They market themselves as ""top performers"" but really the crew does most the work. 3/5 managers shouldn't have even been there. Nice job, and okay career path, but don't buy into everything they say."
bad,Working there was fun it was a family oriented place. The food was great and the customers were nice. I Had fun working and eating there.
bad,The management seemed purely friend based and Favorited and not based on worth ethic. It seemed as if even though training was not taken seriously when it needed to.
bad,Fast paced unorganized environment. Often had to pick up slack for coworkers that where no-shows or where doing no work.
bad,"Did not like the working environment they created after we got a new general manager, it's a shame their business is turning out like this."
bad,It was unprofessional establishment management are very rude to there crew members. I was satisfy with the management work ethic the stayed in the office and refuse to help the other crew member with tasks that need to be helped on and etc. Truhful it was no such thing as an enjoyable part about the job sad to say.
bad,"The people who can do the job get to follow those that cant and when you get tired of the ""politics"" you get shown the door. I don't want to get too far into it, but they don't give breaks like they should and they snake overtime hours to save face on labor."
bad,"- A lot of work and fun"
bad,"Created relationships with employees but management thought I was a threat so fired me, for her position. Nice store and company to work for. Just very segregated ( at my location)"
bad,"Typical day - washing fishers, prepping, cooking, serving"
bad,"I learned a lot in the food industry. i cleaned, prepped food, and provided customer service. The managers were gave poor treatment but I continued with my job and ignored the negativity. My co-workers were fun to work with. Some are friemds outside of work and they treated me very nice. The hardest part of the job was closing the store on time becaus ethe store was so chaotic. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers and puttin smiles on their faces also recieving compliments from them about good work."
bad,"Fainted at work one day, manager made me walk home in 95 degree weather."
bad,This store has made me not enjoy working for Chipotle. The management is horrible and no one is on top of the workers. People basically do what the want.
bad,"I would have enjoyed this job and its location, however it was not ideal for me as a beginner in food service."
bad,"Respectious, friendly, punctual. I learn a lot in this job like how to serve people. I enjoyed this work. The hardest one is when I got home at 12 or 1 Am."
bad,they start you off with a ton of hours then once youve been there for a while they give more hours to the new people. very picky managers
bad,"Although I only worked there for a short time, everything I endured while acting as an employee was not worth the frustration. There standards are too unrealistic and far fetched for what they pay. The fact they ""believe"" in their crew is the only good thing they have going for them and thats still not worth the labor intensive fake environment they run. They waste so much food its sickning and wont let employes share it in the back espacially the ones who rarely get a break. They dont mind pilling on more duties or keep raising the standards to make the task unreachable. They literally get the biggest bang out of their buck and work employees harder then I've ever seen. Nothing is ever good enough and they dont do raises based on performance, rather everyone cohesively gets one in 6 months so there is no real initiative. By all means have an issue with how a manager talks/treats you then your the crazy one even though they blast out promotions to every Tom, Dick, and Harry."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,On a typical day i would always work the front line. I never learned new things and they always showed favoritism. The hardest part about this job was that i didn’t know spanish we’ll at the time so i never knew what everyone was talking about and it made me uncomfortable
bad,"I wasn't there very long. I had missed a couple days, one was due to a death in my family, I left early.  Next day due to the death in the family. Then I was sent home due to stomach problems.  The manager said that they would call back when I could return to work that day. Next day, the manager texted me stating I was fired.  I feel that I was treated unfairly,  I was doing what was required by the employees to report if you are ill.  The manager said they would call me back when I could return to work on 9/24/2019, the next day I was texted from the manager on 09/25/2019 saying I was fired. I was fired on a text message for reporting I had stomach problems,  and was even allowed to work after I reported it before I clocked in. I got worse,  I noticed the manager,  was then sent home,  and fired the next day through a text message."
bad,"Started off great but as I moved up within the company I realized there are many rules being bent to meet peoples personal agendas. As I continued to put majority of my time and effort into this job I saw little in return. As a first year college student working minimum of 35 hours a week and taking 5 classes Monday- Thursday, I was never given a “thank you for your work” or a “good job”. Not much appreciated is show for the amount of work you have to put in. This is a great first job but I suggest never to move up. Stay a crew member"
bad,"Not many people last here because it is a stressful job & very fast paced. It has taught me many things like efficiency, patience, grill experience, management experience and to be quick."
bad,"Not a very difficult job to say the least but my personal experience was with poor management at my store and zero follow ups on training with new employees, leading to inefficient staff."
bad,"always rush with customers, unorganized, good customer service, fun coworkers, hands/arms getting burned, learned how to deal with customers/ deal with problems"
bad,"When I worked at Chipotle it was incredibly hard work, with very little incentive. very very fast paced and sometimes too hard to keep up with. The managers were always on you even if you did something right they wanted it done better. there was never downtime and the work was not worth the pay by any means. I worked so much and I had trouble being able to provide for myself."
bad,"Working there was okay as I could work with my boyfriend and sisters. But the upper store and district managers were terrible,they cared more About numbers than the workers."
bad,Chipotle was my first that I got by myself. This job help me come out of my shyness!! But it also was a mind game for me. I had to remember all kind of thing that I didn’t have to do at the job! But it was a good first job.
bad,"This job isnt for everyone. I loved it at first and then i would start to drown in work. when i first got hired i was told it was a team effort kind of job. so when i needed help i would ask, but people would just stare at me and tell me to figure it out on my own. not a team effort. they throw a list of jobs at you and then tell you to deal with that while you keep a line of people happy. it doesnt work."
bad,"If you are 17 - 23 it's a great place as a starter, if you're going to School, and need some extra money. If you are older it will be an uncomfortable environment."
bad,"Working at chipotle was very fast paced and required a lot of mutitasking. Depending on the location, there was no time for a break but other stores were a bit slow. I experienced both, and both taught me to be a great manager."
bad,A typical day at Chipotle is very enjoyable. Morning crew enters at 8am. The kitchen crew and I associate all the time and joke to make everyone laugh. While we are all talking we are working at our given position. Along with that we clean the back and front of the house till its spotless. We don't usually leave till 10:30-11pm.
bad,"Lots of changes a clear lack of top level executives have stymied the growth and appeal of Chipotle. "
bad,"I've been working for two different stores and one is worst than the other one."
bad,"A typical day at Chipotle was very fast. Our morning shifts start at 6:15 and we close at 11 every night. The experience i had here was great. A lot of friendly people and customers who came in every day for lunch or dinner. One of my favorite jobs to work at, i felt like i was a family with Chipotle. They worked with me with my issues and helped me grow as a person within 11 months as me working there. I would recommend this job to anyone."
bad,Expected to do more then what was possible in reality. Cashiers are made to do mostly everything. Help with the back and front. But the cashier doesn't get help.
bad,a lot of work to do hard to balance with personal life. could not focus on school at the same time didn't stick my availability
bad,Everything was great but the Management. It need more diversity within the management.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
bad,too much expected of you and a horrible crew comes with working there and favoritism plays a huge part there as well. wouldn't recommend it to anyone looking for a job
bad,"Poor management"
bad,"You have to be willing to devote yourself to chipotle if you want to advance here. However, as a part time position it's the perfect fit for somebody working towards their own degree."
bad,i loved working at Chipotle although i believed that it wasn't ran properly people was quitting left and right. A new person was hired every week when there wasn't enough hours to go around for everyone. i never was scheduled to work i would on be on call and i was a great hard worker. the same people would continuously call off and i would cover their shift. i just felt that i should have received more hours and the place wasn't ran well the managers are all my age and they would make others take the blame for something or they would let some people get away with arguing with customers is was a mess.
bad,"Customer service, answering phone calls, preparing and serving food, directly handling money, taking orders, bussing and cleaning restaurant. Typical entry level job."
bad,I can only speak for the south east region. It is a horrible restaurant culture. when your boss gets in trouble so do you. the only way to move up is to be flawless or a kiss a**. It does however leave you with good life experiences
bad,I enjoyed the people I worked with. The management team needs serious work. Didn't stay long because of the way the GM and service manager treated me.
bad,I worked for chipotle for almost 4 months. I liked it for a while but then it got really stressful and the management wasn't too great. They make it sound all great at first and then you start to realize they have ridiculous standards and expect too much of their workers.  I was fired for an invalid reason and they weren't too nice about it. I don't plan on ever going back to the one I worked at.
bad,"Constantly posted at the counter with a fake smile, the pulled to wash dishes for 6 hours, then expected to work 14 hour shifts every other day. Wouldn't recommend. Need to take a step back to analyze system. Company is making thousands, need to compensate employees better for their hard work. Hourly works a thousand times harder than any of mgmt, who is just told to stand around and dictate whenever they are not in the ""office filling out paper work""."
bad,Great co-workers however it is a very fast-paced environment with little rest. It is not uncommon to leave late and the turn-over rate is extremely high. The customer base is not the greatest and the store is understaffed.
bad,"The company was great with the culture of the business and the opportunity advances. Everybody was able to move up if wanted to, no matter how long you have been there."
bad,It has its ups and downs just like any others but chipotle has good benefits but a low pay rate. They don’t like to pay overtime and they cut down your hours so you don’t hit it
bad,My manager had stated when I was hired that I was able to have a flexible work schedule due to me beginning college that summer. But she has made me drop two college classes in order to work for them.
bad,I climbed the later of chipotle within a month and I really appreciate the opportunity it’s a hard job but you learn many kitchen skills cooking home made food in a fast setting.. as a manager I just found the scedual flexibility to be non existent I either work 3-close or 8-5
bad,They just opened this restaurant. It is fun to work with the employees and managers are helpful when they can. I feel like it is too much work for certain areas just for one person.
bad,"it depends on what position you held in this business. sometimes, it is overly tiring and irritating. At times, it is fun but it depends on your team. it is all bout team work. As a manager, it is a true struggle because you are expected to do so much. I f you are a clumsy human, expect to hurt your self in many places. oh yes, the tortilla press, and grill will burn the  out of you. Patience is required for this job because customers are highly spoiled."
bad,food prep and cooking chips and meats . it was full of people around my age and the manager was very helpful. it was very diverse and the easy part was working with people my age. and the hardest part was working at night.
bad,the job itself was ok overall but if you're over the age of 18 I wouldn't recommend applying.  a typical day at the location I was at was stressful at times due to the shortage of team members and lack of training I never received.
bad,I liked working here I didn't work here long tho people come and go a lot switching stores but the people never want to help each  other out and you get critized a lot on things you never got trained on to begin with. Fun environment and customers are pretty great but the people don't care about anyone but themselves...
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Operated a cash register, assisted customers with store purchases, answered questions from customers regarding different menu items....................."
good,"Didn't respect schedule, wasn't what i expected, washed dishes most of the time, rude, food was prepared well done, clean.  it was okay in the beginning after awhile it became real real real REAl hectic. wouldn't finish on time, people didn't work together. Good chipolte from the outside but the inside? people weren't the co-workers you'd want to work with"
good,"this place has a lot of work to do, the company itself is crazy.. the standards that they set is out of this world. but that's my opinion."
good,"Great environment far as being an employee. Benefits are ok but pay could be alot better. Clean, busy, and more like a fast food restaurant. My time is valuable"
good,There is not much for me to say about chipotle I don’t recommend it to anybody to be completely honest from entry level all the way up to management...
good,Chipotle is a fun place to work when ran correctly. Managers make the job stressful at times and there is a huge disconnect with no communication from managers to crew.
good,"great place to meet people. "
good,"The company as a whole is a terrible place to work. the most enjoyable part of the job, was the people you worked with. the job itself, and the workplace culture is cut throat. one mess up, and you're out the door without any proper training."
good,"Sure its a good place to work at, but managers are as understanding as they are when you start workings. when you need a day off they tell you find someone to cover and don't help, and give attitude if you don't."
good,"It all depends of the manager you have. This will literally make or break your career at chipotle. I unfortunately was under the management of a poor general manager and apprentice. The apprentice was very belittling, and due to the status of their friendship nothing got done about this behavior. The manager gives the excuse ""He is just very passionate about his job and when employees do not listen he gets frustrated."" I would assume that patience is really needed when becoming an apprentice but I guess that goes out the window when you now assume a position with power."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle Mexican Grill was exactly the same as every other day, we would come in already knowing what we had to do. What I learned while working there was it does take a lot of team work, however the team was usually yourself. Having to do everything allowed me to manage my time. The hardest part of the job was getting everyone to help and work as a team. At times the employees would say its not their job to do a task that isn't assigned to them, when in fact it was their task since we were always told we should work as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing you made a difference in someone else's life because of the food you served because we knew where it came from and how it was raised."
good,This is a good job for high school students to teach structure and responsibility. Do not work here if you are financially independent or have a family to support. Not enough pay. I worked for chipotle for 3 years and I'm so done.
good,Working at co. Chipotle Mexican grill restaurant is stressful and extremely competitive and over working because of poor unprofessionalism of employees and the employer..
good,"A typical day working a chipotle was a fast environment it was always busy since the time they opened till the time of closing. It could be stressful if the people you had to work with were really slow and they didn't do things the right way, sometimes you had to redo something they didn't do right to please the customer."
good,Very high turnover with very long hours required for managers.  No work/life balance. Fast promotion possible but you will never see your family again.
good,"I worked there for approximately six months, and according to my performance reviews, was one of the hardest working employees at my location. The manager at the time informed me he wanted to promote me to a kitchen manager, and that never happened after being outted by him in front of the entire workforce. The manager was a total trump supporter, showing me discriminatory memes on the clock about who I am as a person. Upon never getting a pay raise or promotion, I had to leave the company. The entire company was toxic- the manager who replaced the former never appreciated me for who I was and never respected me. I felt unappreciated all the time. I went home with a bowl of chipotle and asked myself every day, is the way this company treats me worth $9 an hour? If you're struggling to make, ends meet, sure. But never succumb to people who exploit you and your worth."
good,The benefits and free food were nice percs but unfortunately the lack of leadership organization caused too much tension for me to do my job correctly.
good,"It used to be really fun until their outbreak events got out of control. Now it just sucks. As the General Manager, I was able to uplift several stores and got moved around to several locations. I didn’t mind that part. I just didn’t like that I was not supported in my last couple stores or compensated for the hard work I put into the company. Very stressful when you work hard but don’t have  He support of your boss when things get tough. Instead you get demoted. Smh."
good,"For the amount of hard work you do not get paid very well. Management is typically bad and sanitation is not always the best, but better than many other restaurants. Even the benefits are not great, but can help people who are struggling."
good,I enjoyed chipotle because I could wear my piercings there but the management wasn’t good. My manager didn’t have time to listen to any of my needs which wasn’t okay. I had no time to do what I actually want with my life (which is to be a cosmetologist)
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"we were understaffed at that location which meant when a co worker was sick I had to fill in depending on what they did. The manager didn't help improve skills or offer advice on how to move the line she just said to move faster. Chip talks were one sided yelling matches from the manager, sometimes chips talks were made infront of customers who heard said manager yelling at us. Because we were understaffed when I needed to take a day off for family business I was responsible for finding a replacement for my shift and there wasn't anyone to fill it so I couldn't take the day off."
good,A typical day at this job site was a lot of dish washing. A lot of food prep. I learned how to function in a team work setting. The most enjoyable part of the day was lunch because they do have good food.
good,"Chipotle expects robots, people to work and work and work and kill themselves for nothing. Training is a joke, they don’t give us time and then fire and never look back. Constant state of worrying that you’re next drives people (salary) into working 80+ hours a week."
good,"This chipotle was so disgusting.. A hot ghetto mess. The employees were all over the place. It was like nobody know what their duty was. dirty food left all over and place not clean,The workers were too busy in their own conversation to pay attention and help the customers. overall i just didnt like working there"
good,"I stayed here for three years because I was going to school right next door to the store. The company overworks its employees, there's very little job security if you're not in corporate. You have to be a robot and tow the line 100% even when the company is being unethical. The company can be good to work for if you make it to corporate, but inside the stores they run it like the most big brother like company I have ever seen. Tuition reimbursement is a sham, it used to be 5250 a semester, then the next semester they make it to where they deduct any grants and scholarships, then the next semester they make it to where its 5250 for the ENTIRE year. They keep changing the dang policy! This company puts on a good face, but they most definitely do not care about their employees."
good,even thou the work is easy ...the administer of the restaurant  is every inconsistent...   the rule and  regulation change by the day and the atmosphere is always charge with tension they do  have a amazing heath plan and 41k matching  plan as well but is just not worth the headche
good,"I had fun working at chipotle. I just wish the employees were more focused on work than outside events and other peoples personal lives. Also, the pay could have been better."
good,"Management was rude and very unprofessional. Job for a somebody in high school, not for an adult with bills. Way too much work, very little pay! Fellow co-workers kept me going. Other than that, it sucked!"
good,"I worked at Chipotle for 2 years and loved the people I worked with and the experiences. The restaurant is very fast paced and it can be easy to fall behind on your work if you don't stay up to pace. The people here are always there to help out if needed, and we all supported each other in everything we did. I had a family when I worked there. The hardest part of the job was working when we were short staffed but that was about it."
good,"often high stress environment, unprofessional management and staff,  improper sanitation and safety precautions. i was often asked to do things i was not trained in then reprimanded for doing them incorrectly."
good,This job was good for learning how to prep and cook food properly and move in a fast pace environment. I don't think this is a great place to further yourself.
good,"The environment was highly unprofessional and I feel employees nor customers were treated with the respect expected. I morally, did not feel that this was the correct job for me to be at during the time, so I could not continue to work there."
good,"I cried often, I cried hard-but that was always in the car on the way home. I respected my co-workers and supervisors, but I worked very hard for little respect and a lot of lies."
good,Working at that particular establishment was very difficult and unprofessional. Every manager had their own preferences on procedures and did not all follow company policies and sometimes they were rude or mean when not needed.
good,Working for this company was fun at first and i neverminded how hard they said you were going to have to work. But the overall staff was drama filled especially the managers. I felt like they could've been more understanding of people going through rough times like they said they would be. Advancement in the company seemed fast as long as they favored you some otherwise most of the hard work you do will go unoticed more often than not. The culture and the companies ideas are in the right place but i think they need to reevaluate alot more who they hire and move up to certain positions.
good,co-workers were great but management was bad. on a daily basic no one knew what to do and would set up late. management would never answer the phone. the hardest part was taking responsibility for management.
good,"Working here I learned a lot from my management, co-workers, and customer's. I learned that when working in a restaurant you have to be fast-paced, the customer's are the #1 priority, and you have to have good communication within the team. They didn't train us properly."
good,An active fast-paced environment in which you must meet the high standards of the team. Must maintain the fast pace at all times.
good,"American company with a great idea of Team's Vision. ""At Chipotle, we take ownership for our responsibilities and pride in supporting one another's advancement. We are empowered by teaching, encouraging and motivating each other to achieve excellence""."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Place is very clean learned about customer service and how to keep customer coming back how to become restaurateur and how to be a top performer with high standards and empowerment managers mostly care about their well being more than they care about their employees. They favorited certain people. I really enjoyed making customers happy and seeing a smile on their face.
good,I'm currently looking for a new job because of there lack of communication and respect in the work business. Honestly I just started working there and it is a job I would not recommend to someone because of the people.
good,"Management was not so great, I learned a lot about different races, Mornings were always the hardest, It was always a long day from 8AM-330PM. I did not enjoy much."
good,"I worked here for 5-6 months and then I quit, because I had two full time jobs, which were hard to keep up with. I learned alot within those months and built an ok relationship with my co-workers."
good,Dont work there anymore thank goodness but when I did management was ungrateful and would always threaten with a write up for anything. Good hands on experience
good,"My employees love me, I get the best results but I was never appreciated, never got a vacation, never a single thank you for effort and energy.  Crew level they were amazing but above that it’s some of the most corrupt people!"
good,Management was poor. They only give hours to the people  who was there longer. The store itself was disgusting . The managers had their favorites on who gets hours and who don’t
good,"The company used to be about the culture and the quality of the food but over time it started losing its value in product. The store I was working for cut corners on health standards and food preparation and did not share anything that was going on in the store, even though the GM would always say ""We need to communicate more with each other as a store."" The store was always understaffed and I would always go in for people or stay late if it was what was needed. But as that kept happening, they would get onto us for having too much overtime."
good,Very fast paced work environment. Restaurant experience definitely would recommend. Poor management. Great pay for the position. Free daily employee meals.
good,"I loved Chipotle when I first started but once management changed so did their standards. They didn’t expect the same work ethic from the new employees as they did from us. Therefore I was stuck doing other people’s job because they couldn’t finish on time. Yet when I needed help on the Take-Out Line no one would help me. I did all the orders by myself, including making all the food."
good,"I think Chipotle is a great place to work, especially if you're a college student, since they tend to be really flexible. However, most of the managers and supervisors at the Chipotle I used to work were inexperienced college students,  too. Nothing wrong with that, but they were not trained or prepared correctly. Customers were unsatisfied with the service, most of them did not know what to do when an issue came up, most of them are not efficient leaders meaning that they will either lack confidence and authority or will abuse their power. Chipotle's general managers should do a better job at training this new young managers."
good,"started of as a crew member and eventually became kitchen manager. Overall it is a good place to eat, after all who doesn't enjoy a burrito?."
good,No common sense not paid enough for what you have to deal with plus u dont actually get paid 11.32 when you only actually get 9 or 10 if that so you go in to the interview thinking 11.32 is what you will start off as but your luck if u get 10.50
good,"I worked here for 2 months and I loved it, but once my car broke down and I didn't have transportation they called me an unreliable employee. They expected me to pay $10 every day for an uber to and from work and I couldn't afford that due to taking care of my mother. "
good,"Although the job itself is perfectly simple and easy to do, management and fellow co-workers add unnecessary stress. In addition, customers tend to be rude and rarely will management hear out the employees side of things."
good,"just your average job that you work to get through school, most stores I have worked at are a joke. Management is never good and are childish and loveeee favortism"
good,It is a cool place to work if you like eating for free on your lunch break since they feed you for free. And they give you 50 percent off of your purchase otherwise.
good,"As an adult who needs income to pay for their home and family, Chipotle was not the place. Went from a poor manager who didn't train properly nor kept the work environment up tp code, to a new manager who cared more to prove she was better than the last more than the employees. Didn't give breaks, and over scheduled and over hired teenagers of whom made those who needed adequate hours and pay to support their family impossible."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Like I said above horrible turn over rate and lack of leadership. Lack of almost everything. Constant tardiness from employees. Only a handful of people actually cared.
good,"when i worked at chipotle they were giving me 30 hours per week all on school nights when i was in high school and they scheduled me to stay later than i legally could because of my age. they also broke protocol and had other people count and manage my cash drawer because they wanted ,me to clean instead of managing my own drawer so receipts went missing without my knowledge because i didnt take care of my own drawer per managements instructions"
good,"Chipotle claims to be an equal opportunity employer, I have worked there for over a year and it has revealed itself to not be an equal opportunity employer. There are a lot of inappropriate situations and conversations going on during business hours. No matter how hard I showed my manager at the end of the day that I cared about the company, it always came down to me being a different culture."
good,"Non experienced managers start cooking for me to cook behind them because i clean. Rude management, nasty place in general, insuffient payment for my last week working here."
good,"Working for chipotle is okay kind of a nightmare at times that you want to throw hands with someone. If you can handle a fast pace, stressful environment this is for you! The job itself is extremely easy the people you'll work with would eventually become your best friends they're so loving! but the mangers at least some can be so rude and a B and won't care about your education your life literally has to revolve around chipotle! The job becomes stressful when your low staff (which is mostly everyday) and its extremely busy and people are moving slow. my advise for the new hires is make sure u can handle moving at a fast pace and don't quit on your 2nd day cause it ruins everything for everyone! Theres really nothing hard about this job only if your opening you have to make sure you finish on time to go on break before you open. Most enjoyable was the people and the free food!!"
good,"Hours weren't adaptable, some of the staff was mean, staff sometimes messed up my tips and I don't think anyone really liked me. I did a lot of work which ranged from cleaning, data recording, cash register, and serving."
good,My first time working there was grand but it in the long run the job was really terrible. The employees were really fun but the management is really poor.
good,"for real crew starts at 8.50 and you get worked far too hard for far too little pay. bullsheet pay for your boss to get monthly incentives for YOUR WORK. u would think the free burrito would make up for it, but by the time you are eating your free employee meal you feel like throwing up."
good,"I had an issue with the server manager, and the kitchen manager. The general manager and the area manager ignored my plight. I then quit due to unnecessary, rude comments and actions coming from people I was supposed to look up too."
good,"This place was is always busy. Co workers were nice always helped out when you needed it most. In the beginning the hardest part of the job was trying to remember the procedures for cooking everything, but the more you did it the easier it got."
good,I was on cash most of the time. I would ring out peoples orders. Sometimes I would get on the line to prepare someone's burrito. Or other times I would be back on dishes.
good,"The free food is great and so is the 50% off whenever you are not working, but the management and employees are not very friendly. Typical day consists of nonstop moving and you will sweat."
good,Every chipotle is different. I learned that it is so hard to work with unprofessional people. The need a better training orientation
good,The management was not on the same page as staffing and the way we where treated was not how you should be in a place of business.
good,"Hard to maintain schedule when constantly being called in, when that is not part of our scheduling. Boss was never there. Underpaid for the amount of work asked of us."
good,"A typical day with chipotle is a hard one, the amount of people you have to deal with is astonishing and the pay is good but in order to receive a promotion in the company you must be able to remember the chipotle vision by heart."
good,I have taught myself everything I have learned at Chipotle and my co-worker or my team are great. Most enjoyable part of my job is my team and the customers.
good,"If you enjoy a fast pace work environment, this is definitely for you! Busy locations, long lines, lots of food preparation and cleaning. They train you on what you need to know, but not for too long! you must be a fast learner. Management is okay. What the company stands for is great but it doesn't always match with what's really going on in the restaurant. Co-workers are great. They are very helpful. They are the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"Chipotle is well known in the food industry. I learned a lot about providing customer service. Each customer experience varied, showing how fast each employee is supposed to adapt accordingly."
good,"help customers place there orders."
good,"I loved adapting to a new environment. Being the only non-Spanish speaker was a bit of a culture shock but it was fun and the effort I put into using my high school Spanish did not go unnoticed by my coworkers. It wasn't long before I felt comfortable in my work environment. "
good,"I did not like working for this company"
good,"I had responsibility the manager and crew, for example make dishwasher, prep work in the grill, and open and close the store."
good,At one point in my job it was fun and all happy but one co-worker always gets mad and she always bothers people around and is not fun and expiring to work around those kind of persons.
good,"Descrimination ,managers don’t appreciate our job ,not pay old time work short crew every shift , hard to comunicated with the leader ,never fix the problem ,we work hard and I never hear a thank you I not feel safe went open the store I work extra time with no pay"
good,Working is good robson is busiest location but managers are biased they make difference between crew member. Promotion is done on basis of favouritism not on skills .
good,"I went to 7 stores all of which had poor management & double sided. I always felt singled out, but overall I loved my job & I would go back if needed."
good,This is a job suitable for high school/college kids. You meet a lot of nice people and you can move up in management. It just takes long to get promotions started.
good,"Working at chipotle helped me develop communicating skills. it was always so much fun and fast paced, learned a-lot about the company. there was always room for improvement and the company was always looking to promote someone to the next level which helped anyone develop more skills along the way"
good,It’s alright just have to know how to deal with people that are drama filled. It’s a good place to learn how to multitask. You will meet good people here
good,"Each store is a little different, however I found that they are always finding ways to stretch the team thin with how many people they run with and they stuff them full of work that you can't really enjoy your job. If you have a great GM it will be great, but corporate focuses solely on the bottom dollar."
good,The management team is mostly unqualified and they discriminate highly. I felt severely discriminated against by a manager who doesn't know the job which cost me mine
good,"You have to bw friendly, fast paced & stay focused with working at chipotle. They time all their workers with each customer they have so many seconds to minutes to take the customers order & get it bagged & paid for. Fun work place, steady hours, you can work overtime if manager allows it. But i think it has to be only 40-45 hours a week is the limit on working in a week unless you are a manager."
good,The benefits keep you working there for longer than necessary but I don’t regret getting the job and getting two promotions. It helped me a lot but not a long term career. Too stressful and doesn’t care too much about employees at any location I worked at
good,the managers and director of the store not professional at all they are not responsible or reliable they are unorganized and have little respect for there employees
good,"I spent 4 years of my life at this god awful company and ill never get it back. This place drained the life out of the people that worked there. Underpaid and underappreciated, we slaved away doing work that we were no where near compensated enough for. The free meals and tuition refund were the only good parts about the job."
good,Trying to balanc swirling at chipotle and school is not the best thing to do. I did learn a lot like quick hands and Leaneed to communicate better. I did a lot of work that was not supposed to be mine.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,A very high pace high stress environment. A perfect place to have a first job and gain experience. The management was very poor so that is something they should really work on.
good,this job was stressful and half of the people asked you to do more than what you're supposed to Poor management young people shouldn't run jobs like this. Also some managers and co-workers were sexist.
good,This is a complicated time for Chipotle. I think it is best to wait to see what happens before deciding to join. The culture and people were great initially but the company grew too fast and now leadership is struggling to put systems in place while meeting Wall Street's demands.
good,"Working at Chipotle as my first job was a huge mistake, they take advantage of young workers, do not tell employees everything they need to know and set people up for failure."
good,This job will stress you out on a daily basis and you will only have yourself to depend on. Management isn't always the best & lots of the employees like to just stand around and socialize.
good,"It’s definitely a fast past environment, you are constantly learning something new, and there is always opportunities for cross training. They train and hire within For management positions. High standards is key."
good,"Very unprofessional place with little chance of advancement. All depends on your friends, that’s how you get a promotion. They are childish and misleading"
good,"Company culture , not so great there is no balance between home and work , if in management you work many hours, restaurant comes first, your personal life is not important"
good,If you can handle people constantly yelling at you and telling you that you aren’t doing anything right then this job is for you but if not I’d stay away.
good,"While I was working there it started off real good but then he management changed and the ceo of the company had to step down. This caused he company to hire people for management position from outside of the company even though they promised we would have a chance to rise. I worked there for a out 2 years until I was fed up with promise after promise of getting a raise, especially after being over worked. It was the final straw when the new manager decided to hire people at more than my current wage."
good,It was a great place to work in the beginning but then they started changing their policies and procedures. A lot of which didn’t make sense because other food places that do the same thing don’t have them. Most of the staff I liked and still remain friends with but most of them were really two faced and there was always drama. The new general manager their is extremely two faced and a terrible manager. She will tell you to do something and then forget to tell you she did it then get mad at you for it. She also will not work with your schedule. And not give you enough hours
good,Not worth the stress. Workplace culture is horrible expects you to finish a task that's equal to 2 hours within 45 minutes. Have Field leaders coming in thinking they know everything when they haven't even worked in a store in years or were outside hires.
good,"The work itself is manageable. It's extremely demanding and no matter how hard you work, if you mess up once. You are on their bad side. Low key favoritism exist too. Good luck"
good,"*A typical day at work is either fast pace or slow, depending on the local events."
good,"A typical day of Chipotle consisted of working in the evening. As soon as started shift manager would tell employees where they would be working. For example, in line serving food, in the back washing dishes, or in the front cashing customers out. The hardest part about this job was closing due to some tasks taking longer than others. When ever I closed line, it took me a long time to finish, but I learned that the more I closed line, the more faster I was able to finish the next time I closed."
good,"I really enjoyed my job at chipotle. At first it was going fairly well; I got a lot of hours, and I got along well with who I worked with. After I got home from winter break, there was new management in place. The new management gave me no chance at all since I was hired under the previous store manager. Instead of training me their way up to their standards, they gave me less and less hours. One week when I received no hours I called the restaurant to see why this was so, and I was told that it was because I was no longer on the schedule and I had no warning about this whatsoever."
good,There is a lot of favoritism and the hours suck. I went from getting 50 hour weeks to 4 hour weeks. The management hires there friends and helps them rise to the top faster. Forgetting about all the hard workers that have been there.
good,Management needs more training on how to respond to their employees. Management doesn't treat employees fair. Management spoke ill of every employee without the intent to improve the employees' problem.
good,It was a fast paced environment and everybody was friendly and was willing to help with whatever you needed help with. The best part was being around everybody at work
good,"I did not enjoy working here. I felt that I did not make enough money for the work I was doing. Most of the people whom I worked with were very rude and unproductive workers. The management was horrible, and I was not trained properly."
good,Manager is very unprofessional. Promotions are only given based on how close you are to manager not how hard you work. Slackers are never held accountable for not doing their job.
good,"None stop movement. As soon as I got there wash, stock, cut, prep, and start cooking.Work through a long fast paced day and helping all the guests that came to see us so they would have a good experience."
good,"working at chipotle was fun with a few people that work there. the customers were nice, always busy. the managment was terrible. everyone wants to be a boss."
good,"I started working there when I first oved to Vegas. At first it wasn't so bad, but in the last few months it hasn't been so good. I started getting treated like I was a child from different managers. When I would bring it up, the GM would shrug it off like it was nothing. I let hem know my complaints ad left he company.  I wasn't the only one that had complains, but I was the only one that would voice them. Because of this, they thought it was only an issue with me when that was not the case."
good,This job was ok but not really for me. I would get to the job and clock in and immediately have too go too the line and start helping out. I would greet the customers and ask what they would like and make it for them then when my shift was over I would help clean up and then leave with everyone else.
good,Wonderful place to work depending on location an what type of manager you have this is a job you have to stay positive for all ways keep your head up an push yourself for better
good,"This company is very unprofessional.  The management, is young and unqualified. The work is very strenuous, the management's mostly on drugs and very unreliable."
good,I've worked at chipotle for a year. my review reflects the store I've worked at not the company itself. Job security is almost guaranteed because we constantly have people quitting they will take what they can get but dont expect to move up unless you want to be doing everyone else's job and more.
good,"Chipotle srarts EVERYONE off at the same pay, regardless of your work experience. Constantly working short handed. You will definitely work for that $9/hour. No overtime unless absolutely needed. They would rather work short handed then pay."
good,Typical fast food job. Not the worst job in the world but general crew members are treated robotically both by higher paid staff and customers. Best thing is the food really.
good,Good job to learn many skills quickly as it is a fast paced job. However too much to do without the pay. Advacement was talked about alot but never really applied for most people.
good,"Although the job its self wasn't hard, getting along with all of the people was. If you weren't partying with them, or talking about drama you were automatically cast out. I had two good managers, and i wish they would have had a say so in how the Chipotle I worked for was ran."
good,"This job totally depends on the team you are working with , both as employees and management. This is a high pressure and stressful job. I worked here two years and as much as the experience taught me , it was hard to move up especially if management has personal differences with you. Just don't expect it to be as wonderful as it is pictured."
good,"Lots of work for the opening prep cook, management is very helpful, but there is hardly any room for growth and little resources for raises.  Hardest part of the job is the long hours, especially on the weekends, but the crew members are friendly, outgoing, hard working, and most are attending college or have experience working in kitchens."
good,"Terrible management. Horrible hours, very stressful work environment. Always getting criticized for everything you do even though you do it to their ""standards"". Management is very childish. As id being in high school."
good,"I didn't enjoy working here because of the poor management, the managers will argue with employees in front of customers, employees weren't cleaning behind themselves."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of me standing around at a cash register or working the line to help customers with any needs that they requested."
good,"A typical day included food preparation, serving customers and keeping the place clean. There was drama within managers. Because the company tries to push for a quick crew to manager pipeline, some are not as ready as others. The co-workers in themselves were amazing and some are still my friends to this day. After a month or so people are moved around to new stations making the work environment stressful because we would have so many people at new stations. Be wary, some people take this way too seriously. I have seen people having vigorous arguments and I was called stupid because I was struggling at a station."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,If you have no other needs other than a little bit of money than Chipotle is for you.  Hard work in a fast paced environment that is focused on quality.  Would be a great job if they paid $15 an hour.
good,"Prepared food following a projected data chart indicating the usage for the day; Cleaned, stocked, and organized the workspace throughout the shift; Labeled and charted on all items to prevent loss of income and wasting supplies; Trained other staff members following protocols and evaluating their performance."
good,"Loved working there,made lots of great people. but when management showed their true colors it was a different story. overall employees got a discount and great food"
good,"a typical day at chipotle would be to get ready for the customers it will be very busy during the lunch rush and you have to be able to work with speed and be able to handle dealing with 200 customers. I learn how a lots of things. i learn how to be fast i learn how to multitask and i was even trained to be a cashier i then got promoted to becoming their take out specialist which is in charge of customers who order their food for pick up and their catering business i dealt with about 200-300 customers in only two hours. All co- workers were friendly we treated each other like a family.The hardest part of working in chipotle is the opening and closing shift in the morning you are preparing the food for the rush and the closing you have to clean the store and make sure everything is good for the next day. The most enjoyable is you have fun you learn to work fast and learn how to become better you learn how to cook, prep,clean and you move up. The bad thing about chipotle is they pay the workers unfairly and the only give you a raise of 30 cent or less and you don't get full time hours only part time"
good,"If you've never worked in a fast passed environment Chipotle is not for you. Chipotle was my first job and I loved working here, but due to bad management, I lost that love and dreaded coming to work every day to the point where I had to quit. The bad part about working at Chipotle was the management. They literally have no idea what they're doing and the go on favorites, so it you want to work there Good Luck your going to need it."
good,The hierarchy of managers was skewed the main GM didn't have his head on right was confrontational I didn't feel he had his employees best interest at heart.
good,"Come in at 8am and start prep task to prepare food for the day. Ive learned how to safely and efficiently use a chefs knife, and the shelf life of all of chipotles food and ingredients. Most of my co-workers are wonderful to work with making the work environment enjoyable."
good,It is not the job I really wanted. I feel I deserve better than what this job has to offer. I am more of a professional than I feel at this company.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be me helping and serving customers, cashier, prep work, line work. management was under staffed. co-workers were pleasant majority of the time, most of them worked together. I enjoyed every part of my job, the good and the bad because it was all a learning experience."
good,i skill cook the position and clean the table and trash. we get work hard team.
good,"OK job, the customers come very rude and stubborn! But overall its an ok job you recieve good benefits and the people you work with have cool attitudes. Wouldnt work there again though, poor scheduling."
good,"The managers didn’t fulfill my needs as an employee. I felt pretty neglected. Very fast paced environment, can be understandable at some times, But not every day is to much to handle felt like more could’ve gotten done."
good,"Its good job for the persons who like to cook and grill. there food is healthy too, they give benefits to students in paying there tution fees. i feel it as  a burder because of so much crownd on the palce."
good,"Worse company to work fie, you never get out on time and they expect you to stay longer than yoyr shift without speaking to you first. I once stayed 2 hours over my shift without being asked, just made to do so."
good,was a good place to work at however not knowing what days you worked until a few days before was troubling. calling out for emergencies can get you fired if no one is willing to cover you.
good,"The managers are contradicting and lazy. Unprofessional, unorganized and messy all hours of the day. Hardest part of the job was doing 3 jobs at once while nobody attempt to offer a hand. Best thing about that job were the paid breaks."
good,"I have worked with Chipotle over a year now. There have been more days I have come hope exhausted than feeling accomplished. Poor management. The pay is not enough to match the stress and demands of the job (I'm making $9.75). We are never properly staffed for how busy we are and most night I'm not home before 12-12:30am when we close at 10pm. I was screwed out of my tuition reimbursement.  The only reason I  am giving three stars is I  Do love most of my managers and co-workers. Also, out of all my food industry  jobs this has been the one that I've been with the  longest due to how much I love my coworkers."
good,"Since I was eager to work, they used me, and broke me. I was constantly told about what I was doing wrong and never complimented for the things I did best."
good,I really don't even want to get into it cause im still there but my GM is underqualified to run the store as he only had been here for 6 months and doesn't hold any standards that he was taught.
good,"As a General Manager, the only thing that kept the job worth it was the crew members. 50+ hours a week leaves little to no time for your personal life. Higher management positions didn’t support store level management. Field leader/ Team Director, do not provide adequate training necessary nor speak to their employees with respect."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotle was a decent job. The management was unorganized, clustered, and unprofessional. The culture was toxic and the people were the only for themselves and didn’t realize the importance of team work. The work wasn’t bad and taught me a lot of hard work."
good,"Chipotle is restaurant food, worked at a fast paced environment, for that reason they overwork their employees. Its good as a side job if you want to make extra money, but not as a full time career. You can exceed company standards, and it still isn't enough for your supervisor and management. Chipotle is good for a first job, or a lesson, if you want to learn how to appreciate life and know your worth. Not recommendable for the faint hearted."
good,Its an okay job. The hardest part of the job is that it can ask a lot out of their employees. Good thing is that there is always work to be done whether it is pepping food to cleaning.
good,"Everyone is paid the same no matter what your position. I was hired as a grill cook and ended up doing dish washing many times instead of cooking.Newbies work the late closing hours. I didn,t get home many times until after 2am when the stores closed at 12pm."
good,"Even if your at home trying to relax. you will be expected to answer calls and emails. If a situation occurs, you be expected to come in and fix it, even if you are not near the location."
good,"Working at Chipotle was very stressful. If you couldn't get things down in the first few days, it looked it would take you a few days to learn it on your own. Customers really treated you like trash. If the food didn't look or taste what they thought it would taste like, they would lash out on the crew. Managers though were the best, they almost always had your back and made sure you felt comfortable working."
good,working at chipotle taught me to be fast paced and how to multi-task. It was a great place  to work.I learned how to manage certain situations and what to do in hectic situations.Ive learned to really listen to customers and understand them.the hardest part of the job was having to work with an unprofessional manager and having to work around that but the job itself was enjoyable.
good,"I did not work at Chipotle for very long, however my time there was not very enjoyable. Within one month, I was designated to Prep, but the managers would normally do the prep work for me. So most shifts consisted of 7 hours of doing dishes."
good,"While there are a few people I do like at my work, there were quite a few people that I wasn't very fond of. One of my managers no matter how hard I try to befriend her would always get on me about every little thing. The work is very stressful on the body, and you're expected to have a smile even when you have no energy left to give."
good,"The company is good for advancement if you can get past the slave work. I do not believe that thy pay enough for the amount of work you are required to do, especially after hours."
good,"I do enjoy working for chipotle but I do wan to try something new, with the experience I have. which can help"
good,Its a good place to work if you just need extra cash. Definitely nothing to take too seriously. Being short staffed every day is nothing unusual as well as being belittled by the client demographic.
good,"be ready to work when you clock in, you must be presentable and ready to go before your shift begins"
good,"Chipotle is only a great and amazing place to work at if the management works within the company properly. My manager was rude and didn't care for her store, she also paid people differently by the color of their skin and age."
good,"very fast paced, had to do a lot, dealt with ridiculous managers, including a general manager that was very inconsiderate and very irresponsible, over all did a lot of teamwork"
good,"The managers don't know how to communicate well with staffs. They are bias to non-Spanish speaking and give you a bad schedule. They only care about getting their job done, not about Customers, which is the main purpose."
good,"My GM and Apprentice would go OUT OF THEIR WAY to say/do things that would trigger my anxiety, especially when I would tell them to stop. I told higher ups about the issue I was having and they did absolutely nothing about it. But other than that, I loved the co-workers and regular customers that I did have."
good,"this job has room for growth and plenty of available hours but if you do not wish to grow, your work day will be nothing but mindless stress. company takes personality and overall mood extremely serious, so if you do not wish to grow with the company or at least fake it EVERYDAY this isnt the job for you"
good,"A typical day would be I get in at 6:45,turn all the equipment on and set my station up for the day. Then I would begin cooking and after my grill shift is over, I would hop on to prep work and help out as much as I can to either finish what prep did not finish or set up prep for the next day."
good,Chipotle is a company that has lost its fire. It used to be about the people but not any longer. Crew members and managers alike are stressed frequently. Days at work can be very stressful because crew call off constantly. They feel they are under paid for the work they actually do. We are forced to work in unsafe conditions on  daily. I did however learn how to properly go about running a business. I learned what work and what doesn't work. I enjoyed the people I met in my five years at the company. But I will not miss the long stressful days. Im so glad that I know have a peace of mind
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Working at Chipotle gave me the skills I needed to really build my resume and put myself out there. Normally I'm a quiet, introverted person but as a Crew Member, my skills have developed here over time."
good,There is a clear set of guidelines you need to complete each shift. Easy job to learn quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with good people and management that want to make the place better.
good,Fast paced but bad management. Company only cares about themselves.the food is free which is good. The managers are lazy an only care about themselves. U have no time for your personal life and even though that’s not a problem for me the problem is working for nothing. No career advancement. No appreciation. No nothing. Lack of communication GMs don’t care and in turn field leaders don’t either.
good,My previous manager had no sense of what was and was not appropriate to say to employees which was my main disconnect with the job. His running of the store itself was also questionable and often left people over worked and under appreciated.
good,"All of the crew that I worked with was amazing. Most crews at other Chipotles are amazing as well. but it is almost universally known that managers (KM,SM,AP,GM,R) are not properly trained as well as under paid and over worked. Most managers are forced to work 40+ a week. Tuition reimbursement is nice though"
good,"I learned how to cook, fix materials, helps customer, also i did  provide inventory for my store. As Kitchen manager you have to deal with employee humor and make my store as good as i can."
good,"Starting off at Chipotle was really fun and I made a lot of new friends that I liked a lot. It was a fun job, but soon, new management came in and took over and it just became too toxic of an environment to work in."
good,It was cool for an after-school job but overall this is not somewhere i would want to sty. there is no advancements in this job so if you're looking for something just to have something to do this is the right job for you.
good,"Prior to working at Chipotle, I managed at several other fast casual restaurants. This was one of the most stressful of all restaurants i worked at. started as a crew member and was quickly put into the roll of kitchen manager. Management would always push you extremely hard but without any compensation for the work we did. i did not receive my pay increase for becoming a manager until about 3 months after i had been managing. also the increase was half of what they told me it would be. Do not recommend for anyone"
good,"Management is annoying! Other co workers work really well together, really great teamwork overall. Clean enviroment, fast paced work. Overall it’s a good restaurant."
good,"If you are looking for a job while going to school, this place is the right one for you. They work on your schedule if you tell the manager ahead of time the circumstances that you have. However, managerial position in this company is a bit of a hard task because the higher-ups expect you to be following rules even though sometimes it seems realistic.It always feels that you're always threatened that you're gonna lose your job after all the dedications and hard work that you put into this company."
good,Chipotle is a very fast paced job to work at. You basically have to thrive off stress and fast paced work. I learned how to make tortilla chips and hard taco shells in a fryer. I learned about proper food handling and proper hand washing for restaurants.
good,"Chipotle is  great place to work if you're young, just starting out and looking for ways to create stability in your life. They have a culture built on teamwork and high standards."
good,"I only worked there for 2 months, a lot of time I would get sent home earlier than what was on my schedule, or held back later than was expected. They really don't train you well enough, you have to learn by watching other employees, and messing up yourself and getting yelled at. you're not guaranteed hours if you work part time, only full time people get the most stable hours. very fast paced and stressful"
good,The hardest part of a typical workday was dealing with team members who were not taking the job seriously. What I learned was how to run the business aspect of Chipotle Mexican Grill.
good,My job at chipotle was crazy busy and the staff was all very competitive with one another. This was my first job straight out of high school and it was real pain.
good,"When I first started working as crew I didn't notice the poor management until after months into my job. This was when I felt the stress from the managers creeping onto me and work schedules were never posted two weeks ahead of time as they said they were supposed to be, there was always a shortage of people and there was a very demanding atmosphere. Never enough people to open and never enough people to close."
good,"Managers are biased, Only willing to promote their own agenda with little consideration for employees who work for and deserve to advance. High turnover rates should lead to rewards in the form of promotion, however they bring in outside help rather than promote from within"
good,they put you up to fail with lack of training or no training at all at the location i was working at. boss was a jerk always rushing you with only being the only cashier and doing 7-8 tasks in an hour before opening.
good,May have just be me but at first it was a great place. however over time i saw people's true colors. People would blame others just to get a promotion or save themselves
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,It wasnt the best nor was it the worst it had its days. it alos was very stressful i rarely ever got the days that I asked for and when I would have soccer matches I would have to call off even though I asked for the days a month in advance.
good,"always under staffed, over work crew members, bad management, very selfish environment, under appreciated, under payed, and very stressful, management does not listen to crew members needs."
good,I would come into work everyday and prep food for the night shift then I would run the grill on most days. The job repeats it self and its doesnt feel like your moving anywhere
good,Some people have different experiences working with Chipotle. Sadly i was the not so lucky one to have a good experience. I worked at two different Chipotles and in both i would see favoritism and i didn't not like it at all. This was so unfair because some staff members would hardly work and the others would work so much. I didn't like feeling under the pressure or even trying to talk about it with the manager or any leads.
good,"Did not like the environment at chipotle, hours were not flexible given we were very understaffed I was working almost 40 hours a week on part time. communication could use some work as well"
good,"Consistently understaffed when I was there.  Useless protocols.  Loud and tiring.  "
good,Management want lower management and crew members to work hard but refuse to pay over time. Will hassle you for not getting work done but don't want to provide enough people necessary to run the restaurant because they don't want to pay for more employees.
good,"Easy job to learn new things. Could have better management and more raises. Gets a bit busy and hectic, but its easy to multi task. Managers will train you on eve"
good,In the beginning with everyone smiling it seemed like I found my dream job. As I trained I saw that everyone there was just mean and out for blood. I felt like I was that movie mean girls.
good,"Working at this particular resturaunt and location i never felt welcomed."
good,"At Chipotle, there was always something to be done. It's a very physical job and I got experience in culinary arts, customer service, and aspects of working on a team."
good,"Great place to work at, a lot of help was given when needed. The timing was bad because I was in school, yet it was a good experience being there. The place was always clean and customers seemed to be happy."
good,Chipotle is a good place to start a base job. The company has a wonderful work culture and strives on giving extraordinary experiences to  customers. It's easy to move up within the company. I was fortunate to be promoted from crew to Takeout Specialist within the first six months of being the company.
good,"a tipical day at work would be making sure you have the right energy to bring to the team during your shift, we could pick up on energy easily. Doing food prep, was very demanding to ensure we were not just any fast food restaurant but a fast food place with a restaurant type of feel.  Some of our managers had preferences within the team, the hardest part of the job was how demanding they were to expect you to have it all packed down as fast as possible, some cowerkers were competitive, we worked like slaves some nights we would stay extra hours to ensure the place was squeeky clean. "
good,A typical day at work involves food prep depending on if you are opening 7-3 but not closing 3-10. The only time you will have to food prep on a closing shift would be if you run out of food that was expected for that exact shift. The closing shift which I got most of the time required cleaning and putting up food preparing for those who open the next day. Closing was the hardest part of the job for me because you're expected to be done at an exact time. Working with others can either be a positive or negative experience depending on the way they work. Sometimes they can be trained sometimes they are not which can be frustrating. Most enjoyable part of this job would be paid lunch and a free lunch as well. Gained cashier experience.
good,"It's weird how they get crew members to interview you and then collectively agree to hire you.. "
good,I would come into work and just get on task. Sometimes when a customer needed the manger they would take forever to come up and customers would start to take their anger out on the co workers.
good,"A typical work day was very busy. There was never a time that i did not have anything to do. Being a cashier consists of making sure your dining area is intact. Always keeping the floor clear , as well as the bathrooms and garbage area. There is constant in and out so its very important to make sure that the dining area as well as the bathroom is always cleaned . As far as for management not all managers cared about their employers as they made it out to seem. Some were very rude and not respectable. When i first joined i must say majority of my co workers made me feel very welcomed . The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the sense of urgency. Definitely not impossible but very challenging. The most enjoyable thing about the job was meeting great customers and co workers and being in an environment where everyone is so kind and welcoming. It made me feel like we were a family. What i learned about this job is that you have to lead by example , step outside the box sometimes do things that everyone would not expect .Also it is nothing wrong with empowering each other."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,this is a young persons job. I think the people I met were great other then that it could have been better. management had there picks in my opinion
good,"The food is great, but being an employee at Chipotle was quite difficult. The working conditions were hard, especially for the pay. Managers were hard to get along with."
good,"A typical day at work would consist of normal, work-related responsibilities along with periodical one-on-ones with a manager to track progress and random quizzes to test knowledge of culture and food facts. Chipotle was big on its employees being fully invested in the culture of the company. Empty promises were given out more often than actual promotions, but you were always learning a new task every day regardless. Also, the managers weren't always flexible with your schedule which could be frustrating at times. The best part of this job was the coworkers, without such supportive, upbeat people the work would not have been so enjoyable. Slow days were scarce so working in a fast-paced environment became second nature. The company always stressed high standards which taught me great responsibility. The skills I learned at this job I will forever carry with me, along with many great people I can call friends."
good,"In a typical day I was given a list of things I needed to prep before opening. Depending on the size of the items on that list was what determined when I was allowed to clock in. I prepped food, my work area, and would assist others in doing the same, if they needed it."
good,tell you the whole culture with integrity thing to make you work harder with them giving you a raise while they pile work on you
good,At the time I was there it was no commutation with staff. after all it was a okay place to work. The good part is that you might see a few red sox players.
good,"Working at Chipotle in the beginning was fun then we got new management and I just feel that the whole culture of the store changed in a negative way.I used to be a crew member I was an opener I worked in chipolte mineola for 2 years I would get there at at 8am and the kitchen manager would be there from 7 and they would tell us what task we had to for the day, cooking chips cutting lettuces cutting and scooping boxes of guacamole everything we did was by hand. I loved my co-workers some of us were like a family that's what I enjoyed the most the free food was a plus"
good,"As a Crew Member for Chipotle Mexican Grill I typically interacted with the customers while preparing their orders at the front line. Usually, I worked the peak hour shift and constructed hundreds of bowls, burritos, and tacos per hour. Performing on a exceptional level, and efficiently maintaining high quality during peak hour was the most enjoyable aspect of the job. "
good,"A day in the life of working at chipotle can be fun, it can also be very bad. It is a very fast paced restaurant all throughout the day so sometimes communication is not always there. Sometimes managers will call in and wont even make it to work on time, let alone the day. I have learned alot about the mexican culture being here at chipotle and the food is to die for! The sitting down together eating a meal and discussing things as a team is the best part of the job!"
good,"Fun environment, training lacks, no support from corporate, most training done at home or on the fly"
good,"Working at Chipotle was okay, and I took valuable lessons from it."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Chipotle. When you get the work done time goes by fast. I learned so much working there, the co-workers were nice and fun to work with on the line. The job wasn't that hard, the only thing that was hard was rolling those burritos when people order extra sauces. What I enjoyed about the job the most was the crew members We all got along and helped each other, we all were a team. So far as the management at Chipotle I didn't approve of it because the manager did not treat everyone fair other than that I loved working at Chipotle Mexican Grill."
good,I did not really enjoy this job because the management was terrible. My managers did not have any respect towards my days off and constantly ask me to come in. They had no respect for their employees and expected way too much and did not recognize anyones good work. I enjoyed the free food i would get for meals and the discounts but i myself was not in a comfortable environment.
good,this job teaches workers how to work in teams and the importance of clean as you go. excessive work and managers always like their workers to carry for task then what they are asked to
good,Great job to begin work working career. My first job ever and they were able to work with my school schedule.
good,I loved the culture and values that Chipotle represents. Coworkers were nice but management needed work.
good,this place was great to work at it was just not enoff hours to go around i need a full time job with room for growth
good,The customers were friendly and fun you met a lot of different people.
good,"Each day was about the same, all the managers except the Store manager weren't very nice to the employees. Some even said things that shouldn't have been said to female employees. It was hard to like that job."
good,Sometimes I didn’t know if I could continue with it because of the level of expectations the higher ups had even though the training was difficult and was based on how much you worked.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,chipotle is an okay job . maybe it was the location i was at but i wouldn’t necessarily recommend the job to people unless you’re a teen in school trying to make some money .
good,"In order to request a day off, you should have to tell the General Manager two weeks in advance, but most managers there would almost never work around the schedule to fit your needs."
good,"It’s good first job, I wouldn’t recommend it for experienced workers the management is very poor and you end up doing more work then you’re getting paid for."
good,When I first started at Chipotle a lot of transitions were happening. The turn over rate for employees were high and still is due to low pay of the people who ACTUALLY RUN THE STORE. Managers nor crew were treated properly in order to feel that we were doing great jobs. A lot of people left due to a lack of appreciation & low pay.
good,"When I first started working at chipotle 2 and a half years ago at the downtown Manhattan area I noticed a lot has changed. The imbalance of management some managers are professionals and some such as my GM are very unprofessional. Hours for fulltime are cut from 38 quickly to 24. The FSL aka the patch leader refuses 40 hours if they can. Managers are doing crew members jobs, crew members have low and poor hours the list goes on ...if you want a job check out sweet green before chipotle please !!"
good,If you're someone in college or school they are definitely flexible and can work around your schedule. However forget it if you're a manager there and have kids. All the managers can be very stingy with their availability and its almost impossible to have someone cover or switch shifts when you're a manager because none of them ever want to close. You can definitely promote really fast if you can show you have the ability to and are a strong worker they will recognize that. I worked at 4 stores however and every single management team is different and inconsistent there can be favoritism at some stores. Not a whole lot of benefits or sick time. I like the they try to aim to have a great culture ad chipotle values however they focus so much on making sure guests have an excellent guest experience and on numbers instead of actually taking time like how they used to and how they should train each inividual. I put in a lot of hard work as a manager and got paid the bare minimum when every other manager was promoted so easily and they were lazy and never did anything . Again I think if you dont have a family to feed and you're available anytime then it would be a great job for you.
good,Working with customers alongside coworkers who helped to create team work and a comfortable work environment. Although we had very good team work and motivation we were very understaffed with managers and crew member.
good,"It was really hard to get hours working for Chipotle. A lot of the time, I was only on their payroll without getting any hours to work there. I didn't even get hours for a whole month due to overstaffing of the location."
good,"I was at my Chipotle for almost 2 years, and my general manager kept promising me a promotion but I never got it. The worst part was that others that worked there for less time than i did got the promotion"
good,"The job itself is great if you enjoy working in a fast paced environment and can handle the stress, but the management really sucks. There are scheduling issues, corporate issues, lack of leadership and discipline..."
good,"I love All my jobs ,because in each job that i have Worked in it only made me a better person . I alway Willing to accept any challenges because as a person i love To grow and learn , but overall my experience in chipotle was great."
good,"Made great friends here but its very noticeable how management cares more about clients. Had my hours lowered until I had no other option but to never comeback. Job is impossible to do as the place is always full and you're without and expo most of the time. Clients are very rude,a typical day working here is constantly having rushes specially before closing."
good,"I thought that working at Chipotle was going to be amazing being that I basically was raised on Chipotle. I went in and was hired on the spot but thought it was already a little weird that everyone else was training and I was told to wait two weeks or so. I didn't receive any training for this job and once I started there were so many times I was in trouble for something I was never taught. At the end of my experience at Chipotle I was accused of stealing because I served someone double meat without flagging that's what I did. Because of this simple mistake I was sent home, taken off the schedule and ""fired"" soon after."
good,"I worked at Chipotle in Oregon for a little over two months. My time there started off okay, but quickly deteriorated after being made aware of the many downsides of working at Chipotle. I don’t mean to sound harsh, but our management at the South Salem location and all the way up to the district manager in the area had serious communication and presentation problems. One particular manager was best at micromanaging, being condescending, and generally expressing ignorance. In my experience, this is isn’t out of the ordinary to expect from a manager there. I’m honestly really disappointed that I’ve had the experiences I’ve had there, from being treated poorly to having racist superiors (saying the n word while working). I was really hoping Chipotle would be a kind of utopia in the fast food world, and I was wrong. I’d stay it’s a step or maybe even a half step up, but without good management, it doesn’t even really matter that you get free food or reduced medical benefits."
good,It was okay but wasn’t what I expected. I didn’t like the job. Wouldn’t recommend it to anyone but a teenager. Place was ok cause of free lunches. But didn’t pay well
good,"Chipotle has a very face paced work environment. "
good,"When I first started, it was a part time job to have a little extra cash and get a discount on food that I was always buying anyways. After talking to the GM and learning about all of the great benefits offered, I decided to quit my full time job and work at Chipotle full time instead because I was told I’d be fast tracked to Service Manager. Originally, when we had sat down, it was said that it would be a 3-5 week overhaul of training. GREAT! As someone who has had over 10 years of customer service experience and a bachelors degree I was okay with being a crew member along with students for what was supposed to be a short amount of time. Here I am 7 months later, still just a crew member, and no management in sight. I finally was tired (and financially drained) of waiting so I resigned. I think it’s a great job for students or someone without any major goals in life, but that’s not me!"
good,very chilled fast paced but good energy environment. could offer some more pay and hours. they can also make more efforts to get the proper training to the staff coming in or coming up in the company. Give out some food handlers courses every month or so it would help tremendously.
good,"A typical day for me was to sign the book to show that I was healthy enough to work, stocking the little fridge to make sure we had enough ingredients for dinner service, and then get started making orders for customers. After service was done, I had to save all ingredients we could and then clean the whole area including the tortilla press. Most of the managers were kind and respectful and I even became friends with them. There was one manager that was very rude to me personally and a lot of other employees. The other employees were nice and I made friends quickly and had a lot of regular customers that I became friendly with. The hardest part of the job was getting all in house orders and web orders done in a timely manner during the dinner rush. The most enjoyable part was being able to work with people who were friendly and making customers happy."
good,Workdays are somewhat monotonous when on certain parts of the job. Management does not like to move people from within up into better positions and will hire outside of the workplace. I have been there for almost 9 months and I've been trying to get trained in something other than what I've been doing for 9 months for 4 months with no results. My manager does not like to own up to the mistakes they have made and we'll blame it on the crew members instead. I believe the hardest part of the job is when you do your best and be as fast as you can and it is still unsatisfactory to your manager who is slower then you at the job. The best part of working there is your team members they become close and you truly enjoy working with most of them.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"The managers gossip a lot and they dont know how to train or do their jobs... Especially the General Manger and the girl with dreads, she is horrible. Miami Lakes needs to get better management."
good,It’s good but it depends how you communicate with your crew members. Sometimes we struggle from having bad customers but we get through it and just move on and keep working what we can do best for our customers.
good,"I gave my everything to this company for over a year and there was so much promised that was never delivered, I completed my management training but never got signed off by upper management and ended up doing the job without the appropriate pay"
good,very low level work costumers are very impatient and some even look down and managers do very little work if any at all most high level managers just site n the office and play on there phones especially during lunch rush
good,"The food that was prepared and served was great and it was enjoyable to be apart of that experience, but the management wasn't great and the environment and pay weren't either."
good,"My experience as a Kitchen Manager was largely that of picking up after everybody else. Store and corporate management had no clear goal, nor were they capable of achieving goals that were set. Constantly revolving management as well. It was a fun, cooperative environment, but lack of labor led to many over-long and double shifts."
good,"Rude customers, "
good,"I began my career for Chipotle under good management, unfortunately the new management is incompetent and completely ignorant of their employees needs."
good,"A wonderful working  environment ,I love working with all my coworkers.  The management there is terrible,  it’s not chipotle it was just the specific manager that I had.  I ultimately quit because of his attitude and how disrespectful he was to his workers."
good,"Working here was only nice because of the benefits. The rest I would say wasn't so great. The rate of crew turnover and management turnover is ridiculous. I had about 3 different general managers in the 3 years that I worked there, along with complete turnover of the other employees. Most people also didn't respect dress codes or respect their responsibilities and duties that needed to be performed on their shift."
good,Your experience with the company depends on the store you work at. I worked at 2 stores the first one was great then I got promoted and transferred to another store and that store's management is horrible. But it is a fast paced job you're always going to be on your feet hustling.
good,Working here wasn't so bad. The environment was great but the working hours they gave me weren't many and they would always ask me to leave early due to the lack of customer that would come in.
good,Had an family emergency and was told if I don't get a coworker to cover my shift the call I made to state my emergency wouldn't count and would be considered no call no show
good,"It was a fast paced environment and extremely competitive. If you're new or they don't like you, they tend to be unfriendly and unhelpful. The customers were mostly friendly, but there's always someone rude in the food industry in general. Management was disorganized, lazy, rude and played favorites. The pay was sub par and hours were unfairly distributed based on who is liked and who isn't. Breaks were short and sometimes there were no breaks if we were busy."
good,"While the fast paced environment wasnt too difficult to keep up with, dealing with all of the other managers was significantly difficult. "
good,compensation could be better. management was unprofessional and lazy at times i worked 2 years without advancement. but it was a good job while i was in college.
good,"the chipotle i worked at was as mess, drama everyday with cowrkers not getting along, plus going through 4 general managers in the year that i worked there."
good,was only employed a month had to relocate closer to home but could have better communication skills within the company the manager was come and go was not trained properly
good,Working at chipotle was an amazing experience with amazing people. Had it not been for certain things I feel as though the company could grow to be better
good,"Over all I have learned a lot for Chipotle, but i do feel like the company people  culture is not there anymore and was a big part of why im not with the Chipotle anymore."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Honestly it’s not a fun place to work if your magagement is bad and your crew has no one to guide them. Plus If you’re non Hispanic you’ll have a very hard time getting ahead."
good,"I've worked at two different chipotles for over 3 years and the problems occurred were problems moving up, unacceptable wages, hours, and responsibilities. The food was indeed made with integrity if one follows the recopies and is passionate about their work. Not every store is as strict or in compliance with those policies but the different ideologies of each store creates a somewhat unique experience in flavor, customer to crew interactions, and quick and easy process to move the line of traffice along smoothly. Management seems, typically, to play favorites or play in competition to help employee growth, but demotivates many not to want to advance. Its very fast paced and demanding, but if you're one to be very involved and focused on tasks at hand, the job will come to be very simple and enjoyable. Not a job for everyone. They do not discriminate race, age, sex, political views, religion, or even criminal history. To be honest the more unique, different and special you are, the more a manager is inclined to hire. Must to know to and enjoy working closely with others in a fast paced environment."
good,ALot of hard work for the amount they you. Growth is impossible if you are working part time. The discounts were great. Workers are all fun make work enjoyable.
good,A typical day at work included helping customers get their desired food. I would also take to-go orders and clean the line before we closed. I also got free meals.
good,"from 11am to about 1:30pm is the busiest time of day for morning crews, 4:30pm to 8pm for night crew."
good,"Reviews were supposed to happen every three months—that never happened. Too much work not enough pay and you suffered for others mistakes. Not a friendly environment, always ruined my mood ."
good,"This company looks good on the outside, but oh boy when you realize how the whole thing works it makes you want to run the other way. Management was very strict and don't really allow room for error ."
good,"It was a very fast paced place of employment, learned about the 13 characteristics that Chipotle had in order for the employees to learn and become..."
good,word word word I am typing words to appease to you this is not anything I am simply just typing words I only have 37 charac no twenty four no nine no I
good,"Everyday is hustle at this job. Mind you I've worked many food service positions and this was by far the most labor intensive. This was my second hardest job (next to a welding job), that I've had. Constant pressure, never stops and the managers are pretty pushy there as well. All in all, I was very appreciative of the fact that they hired me."
good,Horrible management a majority of the time. Constantly changing policies with little to no training on how to implement them. They spend more time on trying to create sub-par things to try and drive sales rather than to focus on what they have and making it great.
good,Horrible General manager. But they were flexible with my schedule. My time there i was able to get experience in several areas. It was a learning job which has helped me.
good,"La direction  ne respecte pas ses employés, les méprise. Le travail est dur et on nous dit de travailler plus."
good,Due to the popularity of Chipotle. I had to work really fast. Everything was hands-on and required you to be focused and communicating with your crew. Management was poor and never helped but as a crew we were able to overcome poor management. The hardest part of the job was the long shifts and lines. but the most enjoyable was working together and getting things done efficiently
good,"The management and the fundamentals of working at Chipotle are very poor. The location I worked at, the management was rotated out about every year. In regards to the duties of the job and the work environment it was great. Everyone works as a team. It is a competitive workplace since there are so many positions to work at. It's fast paced and a great first job for a high school teen."
good,"You do all your duties required for the business to operate sufficiently."
good,Some important things I learned at Chipotle Mexican Grill is how to prepare important and tasty meals to customers. While I was at Chipotle I also learned how to smoothly run the cash register.
good,"The oldest manager was the age of 23 when I worked here in high school and was hardly ever on top of shifts and workload, hardly ever working on prep or line. The average closing time everybody would get off would be around 12:30 am, (other chipotles usually got off by about 11) and I was always stuck on dishwasher because the managers (all males) were highly sexist and would put the girls on cash and line so they could flirt with them and check them out. Would not recommend working here."
good,"I started off as a part time crew, but over the years have gotten promotions and am now a full time manager. Full time here is not just 40 hours a week though. Not even 45 every now and then. It's an exhausting and constant 50-60 as an hourly manager. These are hours that salaries are supposed to work. Sure, the extra money is great, but most of the time it's just exhausting. This job will slowly take over your life and your energy. None of my many general managers have respected my schooling let alone my days off. (Which is a day a week if I'm lucky.)"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I have no ill intentions towards the company. It was a great learning experience for me, as it was my first kitchen job. I learned a lot about myself."
good,They tend to rotate general managers if you don’t get results quickly. They have little patience or understanding on what it takes to take a really bad restaurant and turn it around.
good,I was working at a location with terrible management. There was a high turnover rate and the management was extremely unprofessional in the way they spoke to employees. After I left I found out they fired the general manager.
good,"A typical day at work would consist of clocking in, checking in with a manager, and if you are on line. Checking that all the foods are at optimal temperatures and that it is also clean, with supplies in hand."
good,"good place to work if temporary or part time but management is unorganized and communication is lacking. people that work there are great but the managers and higher up staff are not. hardest part of the job is knowing that you are going to get overworked and not paid for it. taking care of employees isn't bad but isn't good either, the attention to address human resource issues is slim to none"
good,its fun at first then management stopped helping with work that would get backed up or would try to explain why it was getting done or how to make it faster instead of just helping to get it done
good,"A typical day at work consist of scrubbing toilets, checking customers out, and wiping tables. When it would get packed, it would start to get stressful so sometimes other co-workers would get frustrated and yell at you for no apparent reason. You don't get to sit down except for on your breaks so if you're working a double, you would only get to sit down for your lunch break. Lunch break is thirty minutes long."
good,i love the environment of this place. it was a very high paced job and they expected a lot of you. they use timers for everything to make their employees get faster. which is great but if you cant keep up they will get rid of you
good,The best of this job were the people. The rest was not that good. The hardest thing for me was to work weekends and evenings. I met my best friends in this job and that made it worth.
good,"Chipotle has high standards. Yet they are not followed or respected. Maybe just the location I worked at. The manager was one of the least productive members on the team, did not train Well, and was not motivated to help motivated people. Seems like the actually experience was miles off what the company advertises and promises."
good,"Chipotle was a great beggining 5 years ago, now it’s become a stressful environment due to constant audits on food and lack of upper management support. Work load is heavy and in most cases team is never properly trained."
good,Some of the coworkers can get annoying fast and most of the time a good day at work depends on who you're working with. Best part is the employee discount meal and a lot of the coworkers there are chill.
good,"As a cook at the chipotle that I worked at it was mostly me doing all the work while the line did not that much work in comparison, especially on the downtime. Whenever there was no work, the management wouldn't divvy up jobs so it was me most of the of time trying to manage cooking, doing prep and washing dishes while the line was waiting for people to walk in to be served. At times it wasn't even the busiest Chipotle but when other workers would fall behind I was the one that had to pick up the slack and make up for their lack of work ethic."
good,"At the time of my employment with Chipotle, I noticed a lot of favoritism from managers to certain employees. If the manager came to work in a bad mood, it would damage the positive flow in the atmosphere for everyone else. He wouldn't listen to what I to say about it so he let me go."
good,"There's definitely too much of a workload for the amount of pay, for example, as a cashier you would have to tend to all customers and also take care of the whole lobby, the line moves very fast. On the other hand you get free food when you're working."
good,"trabajo sensillo y facil, las instalaciones eran buenas y el ambiente muy agradable"
good,"Stressful job really fast paced & mostly get burnt if working on grill, easiest job is still a pain & actually the stinkiest one. i quit as soon as i could"
good,Working at Chipotle was great when certain managers were on duty. Certain managers were a pleasure to work with because they treated you with respect and dignity. Others made you feel worthless.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,I've worked at Chipotle for 4 years and the one warning I have is always be on the lookout for bad managers. I saw probably 15 managers come and go because the job and the perks go to their head and they start to treat anyone lower like garbage. I would have stayed longer if my manager hadn't been so awful
good,Fun job for college. Management at the time and location was awful. placed favorites a lot. overall an easy job if you don't mind working in a food industry.
good,"-either very busy or very dead"
good,"you would come in and be assigned a station. depending on the station you could be doing a number of things. you could be, prepping, or clean the food. after all the station are done you would go on break and then when you come back you would be assigned a different station where you could be a cook ,on the line, or in the back doing dish"
good,"It started out great, but as management changed the culture changed. It used to be more about the people and now it’s all about the numbers. At times hard to advance if you are not in the chipotle politics."
good,"the job was fine. didnt get along with everyone there, a very cliquey group of workers who favour those they choose. not a great place to work if youre starting fast food"
good,"There were stressful times, mainly during our ""peak"" times.  Besides that, management was good before my boss left. Once the new assistant manager was moved up to manager, the place went downhill.  The coworkers are great, and the discount was good! Your meal is free when you work, and 50 percent off on days you were working."
good,Work starts of by running around trying to get everything set up. I've learned how to multitask and how to deal with stressful situations. Management is horrible they do not appreciate or give appropriate raises.
good,"It was stressful and coworkers weren’t friendly. I had to things that my job didn’t require me to do as stay overtime because the manager would get upset if I can’t stay and he wouldn’t give me full-time emplyment for the next week. Besides the hours weren’t flexible. I had to work at night shifts only and go home very late. I also had to clean the bathrooms, take the trash out. And clean the whole place while doing my cashier job at the same time."
good,"Always fast paced, Learned to maintain a clean line, Learned to work both front and back of the house. Learned to very patient through any situation and become better in customer service."
good,"I personally believe that the amount of work there does not compare to what you get paid. I'd say $10 an hour undermines the amount of work required. I have worked there for a little over a year and have not received one pay raise. I work hard but my work is not appreciated or compensated. It is difficult to advance there as well due to poor management. I have had at least 4 different GM's while I worked there and it was a hassle with different styles of management and inconsistent schedules. I do not recommend anyone work there unless management is not a priority for you. Chipotle's values and the food is great, I would totally dine there because the food is fresh and hang prepped every morning."
good,"Chipotle is a great job, but you are not paid a fair amount for how much you do there. The Higher ups as well treat you unfair always giving you negative responses instead of trying to build your self-esteem."
good,Tbh they suck. They want you to work extremely fast with little to no errors and talk down to you all day! I’ve never been so stressed thinking about tacos and nachos tbh! Omg the costumers suck too. So snobby! It may because i was working at a extremely busy location but the way I was treated was unacceptable. My crew members played a part too but idk maybe other chipotle’s are better 🤷🏾‍♀️
good,"It's very stressful and fast-paced, plus one of the managers didn't like me and made sure that I knew. They would make me feel stupid for asking questions and I was always given a new task added onto the other things I already had to do. They would say ""Oh did you know you're supposed to do this too?"" I did meet some awesome people though who I'm still friends with."
good,"very unprofessional with female co workers, having an uncomfortable working place and got late schedules with mixed up working hours, making it stressful to know when you do have to work. They were very flexible with all college students with any schedule they had or days off they request. i really enjoyed the fellow crew members who I've grown to love as a second family by being soo welcoming"
good,"Great place to work, but management is terrible. Some staff can  be really great to work with, but the work place is terrible overall. The staff can be easily manipulated."
good,working for there was stressful. they hire to many high school kids who come with so much drama. management was poor. you can barley request days off and when you do they still put you on schedule.
good,"90% of the time management only places one person as cook. Regardless of how many people are working, they insist they have more people working the line. This puts strain on the person working as cook because as more people are getting served their food, it is entirely up to the cook the keep up with the demand."
good,"Personally, I do not think Chipotle is the best way to work. The management is not very good. They do not appreciate all of the hard work that their employees put in and they do not give a lot of opportunities to grow and be a larger part of the company."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"As a customer, if in the right culture, Chipotle is great -the food is good and the employees are almost always too friendly. As an employee Chipotle is stressful. Their extremely high standards of a company combined with mediocre management causes the turnover of staff to be very high. I helped open a store with about 25 other people and three months after opening not even half of the original employees are there. The company's push for perfection always kept me on the edge... I was constantly being bugged about speed even though I thoroughly produced quality work - much greater than the speedy workers they replaced me with. Most customers don't mind the time, if they have to wait in a line, especially in comparison to other fast food chains. The pay plus scheduling hours makes it hard for anyone with children and a home to barely make it. Other than free employee meals and fifty percent off meals on off days working for Chipotle is not the hype it seems to be. The company itself is a disgrace. It's not even real Mexican food."
good,They are very flexible with hours. Management was good but at times they didn't schedule enough people. You also could ask for a day off and 99.9 percent of the time i would get it.
good,"it was fun to work here and the pay was nice, but it was very stressful and a lot of work. the management team wasn't on the same page and that made work harder."
good,"A typical day at work was always busy, no matter the day of the week. I learned a lot about work skills and customer service. The management was not very great. The hardest part about the job was not being provided with enough food to last so it would always run out. The most enjoyable part of this job was the crew."
good,"If you're a teenager looking to save some extra cash and get on the job training, Chipotle is excellent. If you're looking for a career where you're rewarded for hard work and feel appreciated at your job, maybe not the best."
good,"Managers were not the most approachable and had a lot of favoritism, other co workers were okay to work with, decent discounts on amusement park tickets and such."
good,The hardest part was working with people who did not want to get to know me. I was judged for being to nice and let go because I was the most recent hired worker.
good,"A fun, fast-paced work environment that taught me much about customer service and the food service industries. The sanitation and safety practices I saw were enforced and up to date, I held a ServSafe Certificate, and was provided decent benefits for part-time work. Only one of five managers I worked with were qualified and took true pride in their work while maintaining humane relationships with their staff. Conditions specifically surrounding management only worsened with time, eventually interfering with both employees' work and their personal lives."
good,not the best job for someone who needs to make a living. the pay is dismal and the management has a high turnover rate. opportunities for growth but they can easily be stalled by interpersonal conflict.
good,"Working here was not the best time in my life and it wasn't the job specifically that was terrible, but instead it was the people. I believe that if I was a part of a crew that respected one another this job would have been really fun! I have a spot for them in my heart based solely on the fact that they get local meats and cheeses and nothing contains GMOs."
good,Could be a great job to keep you busy while you're in school. Could be a great job depending on the team you're working with. Always make sure you're working with a purpose.
good,"Enjoyed working with the people an management, but again no chance for advancement an they would only work me at night. Liked the food very much."
good,A typical day at chipotle is usually fun but unless your willing to do more work than the management put in themselves than things take a bit of a turn but all in all it's an ok place to work temporarily unless you want really to be management youself.
good,"Working at Chipotle at the location I worked was very stressful because the store was not very organized. Although management that was active did their jobs, a kitchen manager did resign within my first few weeks of working and this made everyone's job a bit more stressful."
good,"The work environment was alright other than the fact that the managers were no more professional than the crew, gossip and drama was constant. I was scheduled for very few hours each week although when i was hired i was lead to believe I'd receive about 20 a week."
good,"A typical day at work is manning the food line."
good,"The Chipotle environment is very busy. Everything has to be done with integrity and speed. I loved that about working with them, however there were issues with management that caused them to fall apart."
good,I rather not say much towards this company other then there was a manager that threatened to physically hurt me and would verbally abuse me and others as well.
good,"They expanded too fast, and really tried to get super expensive ingredients, which insured no future significant raise for the employees. Chipotle is constantly changing procedures, and making tasks more difficult, yet not allowing any flexibility with how work is delegated and to how many. Management sucks, the restaurateur culture is a lie. If they made getting to restaurateur a raise for the whole crew and management, instead of just for the gm, then maybe everyone would be more committed, but nah. this is probably the most frustrating part."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"A typical day at work would include but not limited to making sure customers were satisfied, meeting the required quota for that day, and also preparing for the next work day. Management was excellent in their field as far as working with employees schedule and being able to compensate their needs. Co-workers were friendly and helpful with helping out in case things tend to have gotten overwhelming. Some challenging parts of the job were minor things such as dealing with irate customers or when the workplace would get very busy at peak hours, none the less the most enjoyable part of the job was doing my part to contribute to meeting company's and the customers needs for the work week."
good,"At first I loved the position of kitchen manager, but you need to put in a lot of extra time to be great at it. Chipotle provides only so many hours. I would often find myself at 39 hour and not be able to do all I feel I need to do. I am very detail oriented and I will work on task for quite sometime to make it perfect. I didn't like having to struggle with others to have them do their part.The most enjoyable part was training crew members."
good,Very up tempo working environment. As many hours as you can handle although schedule can be subject to change at any point during the week with or without your knowledge. Overall easy money and energetic but can also be inconvenient.
good,"Management is a huge problem here. GM was dating a coworker and very biased towards everyone. When concerns were raised, everyone was lied to about it. Too many managers in training and very little organization. No one was ever on the same page. AM vs PM shift feuds constantly. Overall the work itself was easy. High standards for food despite quality of products not being that high. Chipotle likes to pretend they care about people and being natural etcetc, but it's all a publicity stunt. They're just like any other food service corporation. Do not be fooled by their facade. I quit because of all the pettiness within management; nothing ever got done."
good,Learned how to work independently on a regular basis. What i didnt enjoy was only getting around 2-3 hours a day but also having to walk 2-3 miles from work and back home
good,"I was in charge of managing the front of the line which entailed food and customer service. I was also, responsible for financial affairs with the position of cashier."
good,It's a fun environment and very fast paced. The fellow employees are like your family and everyone is close and work hard to create an outstanding customer experience.
good,"I respect Chipotle's mission statement, and what they want to turn their restaurants into, but the reality wasn't really to the Chipotle standards. The GM would promote anyone just to move up. The best part I'd say is working with the coworkers. I loved my team. But the amount of work one does was too much for too little, often times, I found myself going out of my way to help the dishwasher, or other team members who were closing. And the best part, is after the Ecoli situation, the store was always chaotic.  Nobody (in my store anyway) really knew what they were doing. It was pretty frustrating."
good,"This was a interesting job. I've never did a job to where I was actually making the food. I didn't care about cooking so much until I started here. Chipotle believes in being yourself. Bringing your own individuality to the table and excelling at your highest. I can dig that. The only issue about working here was management. It was very ill managed. We didn't have much of an understanding because she was kind of rude and unapproachable. I didn't get a lot of training but I am a quick learner so that didn't bother me too bad. The work environment in itself was cool, but the manager in some ways was unprofessional. I felt uncomfortable, and I felt this job wasn't showing my full potential. Overall, this was a good job experience. It taught me speed, efficiency, and tested my pressure level. It showed me that I could be a manager and I can handle pressure! The fastest I've ever had to move was working at Chipotle."
good,"During my time at Chipotle, I have had the opportunity to witness both the good and the bad. Working in a fast-food environment required the employees to work together. If someone was not a team player they did not last long. The turnover rate was much higher than I would like, being a manager now. A good portion of the managers where I work do not know how to properly motivate and treat employees. Giving positive feedback and encouragement are just a few qualities that are lacking from most of the managers. If a manager treats their employees with respect and kindness, the workplace will be much more pleasant and enjoyable."
good,They were very unprofessional. They did not balance out hours correctly. They are very unfair and unjust. I was very unpleased working there and if I had the chance to do it again I wouldn't.
good,Job is not what they said it would be. The company is not very organized in communication. Typical day at work can be stressful and dysfunctional. Everyday a crew member is quitting. In the beginning of the year all of the managers resigned their positions. They don't let the crew know what's going on with anything. And they are very inconsistent with their daily work. I personally think they don't really know the rules like they stress us to know them.
good,The only good thing i can say about this company is that it is very easy to move up if you work hard. Other then that it was a terrible job.
good,"Chipotle is a great company to work for but there is a zero life/work balance. Weekends are long. Weekdays are longer. Management expects you to be superman and do everything even though you have a ""team"". There may be favoritism depending on the store. I was promised if I work hard I will see advancement or an opportunity to receive a promotion. That was thrown out the window. The company is great, but remember to never get too comfortable with anyone you work with."
good,I learned a lot while working at Chipotle in this capacity and many of the people I worked with were great to be around. They have great benefits for their employees and perks.
good,"On a typical day I would prepare the tortilla chips and taco shells for the day.  Then I would manage my own station for online, fax and catering orders to ensure timely pick up."
good,"At chipotle once you walked through the door you are to be properly dressed before you are to clock in. my days at chipotle consisted of helping customers, managing communication an team work, as well showing or teaching some one the proper way to make, cook, or do something the hardest art was keeping up with the pace. the most enjoyable parts were the people Because of how positive an out going they were."
good,"Although at first this job was very good experience, it soon changed into a terrible environment. With a few management changes in the store, it became very clear that no one besides a select few were concerned with the hygiene of the store. I learned that I never want to work for a place with health standards this low."
good,"Chipotle is a great thriving company with great ideals and a solid business plan which is growing by the day. The opportunity for advancement is great and most promotions are from within although the managers and staff in the western new York area are unfocused, unexperienced and lack leadership skills as well as the ability to communicate with their employees. Overall it potentially is a great company to work for, but the western new York area needs a complete overhaul before it can reach it's full potential."
good,"Didn't appreciate the GM at the time. He wasn't true to his word, i feel employer employee communication is important. My pay and position was a hoax the day I started my pay changed my position changed. I wanted this job to work out but it just didn't."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I was a very fun place to work at, seeing different people everyday was real fun! A lot of the people coming into eat were real kind and so were my coworkers."
good,"60-70 hours a week at salary. Lack of support in a restaurant that had staffing issues. Lack of managerial support when team was short for over three months in managers and over a year in staff."
good,"some customers can be very rude, the management is bad. co workers were good. hour may be good depending on location. work can be stressful due to time limit of finishing a task."
good,I worked at chipotle as a line server and cashier. I learned a lot at chipotle like moving in a fast paste I learned about healthy eating and also great customer service. the management at chipotle was great they were very helpful. my coworkers I enjoyed working with them they were very helpful and worked as a team. the hardest part of my job was dealing with rude customers. the most enjoyable part of the job was being around great coworkers that worked together as a team
good,A typical day at work was getting ready to make customers feel welcomed at the restaurant and provide them with food they enjoyed. My co-workers were mostly not nice and the hardest part of the job was having the rest of the crew members tell me to more than 3 things at once only because i was a new hire and i thought it was unfair.
good,"Fast paced environment - Open the restaurant, deploy staff, set up prep charts, train, morning motivational meeting, follow up, set the next shift up for success."
good,"Very busy, fun, and fast pace. learned each positions available. management is very good there are 4 managers to always go to. co workers are fun and communication is high. the hardest part is have no break if extremely busy. going to work is like a vacation...most of the time."
good,"Chipotle is okay. The pay is terrible. You will start at minimum wage, and any raises you receive will be miniscule. If you like working in a fast pace environment, maybe you would like it here. There are lots of opportunities to advance in a store, but knowing Spanish is key."
good,Chipolte is a heavy stream of customers. Need to have a fast pace. Know all the ingredients and quality of the products.
good,This job had a lot to teach if you could handle all the extra stuff going on inside. A typical day for me would begin at around 9 or 10 a.m. I would help prepare the food the restaurant would need for the day. I usually made the guacamole...8 boxes from scratch. I would also help bag chips and prepare the food lines. I learned how to be a team player. I also learned a lot about myself and self control. You can not always show your emotions because there is a time and place even if you are being treated unfairly. The hardest part of the job was being treated badly by management and out of fear for losing the job not saying anything. I have again learned there is a time and a place and that management can not abuse their title. My favorite part of my job here was my co workers. It was always laughs and smiles as well as jokes with the customers. They kept us busy and on our toes. I really enjoyed the friendships I gained from working here.
good,don't expect to have a work schedule that suits your lifestyle.
good,"Geensboro Chipotle needs help badly. Shady management, liars but good benefits"
good,"Very challenging job , which I like but, unprepared child- like managers made the job too hard on a GM"
good,"A lot of prep, plenty of hours available because it is usually busy. A good job for a college student. Great team work, some management lazy and careless"
good,"I've Worked at chiptole for a year both stores i worked have a fatal flaw greed from management extra benefits for them if we work hard but i worked hard everyday working six days a week with long hours and still no raise or time off but the actual companies message is good positivity, healthily living and sustainability is very clear everyday"
good,I was not given proper training. Management was not good. Manager was moody and short tempered. Did not handle the stress of the job well. Communication was a problem as my co-workers did not speak English well. I was not given a chance to reach my full potential. I believe in the company but the location I worked at needs to make some definite changes.
good,Working at Chipotle was not the best time. Was very poorly managed and  it felt like the employees were running the store more than the managers. Would not recommend.
good,I enjoyed having my coworkers at the job but the management was horrible. I will never work at that Chipotle again. A typical work day was fast paced and confusing at times.
good,"Working at Chipotle Mexican Grill was very fast paced and hectic. We were constantly understaffed and worked long hours, typically without a break. I enjoyed my coworkers yet the employee turnover rate was very high due to stressful working conditions."
good,"The culture is amazing and positive with your fellow crew members, but management is a constant problem in Chipotle. The company has also been hiring new employees with no experience at a higher starting rate than employees who have been there for a year. Those employees who have been working there for a long time and are fully trained will never be able to catch up to the new employees salary."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Its a really good first job, really helped me improve my customer service skills. The environment was fast paced so you have to be able to think on your feet."
good,A typical day at work was very exhausting and sweaty and very unorganized. It would be rare for the days to go very smooth and everyone on the team to be on the same page.
good,The worst management experience I have ever had. The company is wonderful. Their ideas are amazing and the benefits are superb but the actual people in power on a store level are bullies.
good,"From the start, management at Chipotle will be trying to convince you that there is something different and special about Chipotle. It's easy to believe them due to their above average food, reasonable pay, and the array of benefits offered to you upon hire. After working there for any real amount of time however, you'll find that Chipotle is the same food service position you'll find anywhere with some additional wrinkles that make the work more stressful. The allure of free food offered each shift also loses its shine after 900 burritos, but medical insurance available to part time employees is the best reason to work there."
good,"Huge swing in culture as a company from what they were to what they are now. They speak about culture, but throw results before anything else, not realizing culture is how they drive results."
good,"good first job, easy to get hired if you're clean, smiling, and have a good attitude and cant work quickly and proficiently. keep up the hard clean work and they will move you up quickly, just have to be dedicated."
good,Management was very difficult and coworkers did not take their job serious. Schedule was messy. We had our good days but everything else was a typical day at work.
good,Bad management but great place to work beside that!
good,"This is a nice first job, but I feel as though it’s not practical. You have to break your back to get a $500 check. You can’t live off of it if you’re getting hired as a crew member or anything under a manager. But, the job is not bad. I just think think we should get paid more."
good,"Did not like the environment, no coworkers helped when I had difficulties with my tasks like carrying heavy boxes of chicken or washing a mountain load of dishes."
good,"Not good management short on people most times and we need stay late because they don’t have a dishwasher "
good,"i did not work here long.. the work was fine and the employees were great, but i did not like new people working everyday. they hired a different person every day and within a week the GM was fired"
good,I worked at chipotle almost 2 years and it was a great company but the management made the entire experience horrible. Don’t recommend the Bowling Green location in NY.
good,"A place where if the manager doesn't like you, he just won't put you on the schedule anymore. And he'll never tell you why. People always love to give criticism but never help you fix it. somewhere where unless you're this extroverted talking machine you'll feel like everyone's clicked up and thinks their better than you. Too much time and mental/emotional energy with very little to show for it."
good,"No support from management, very competitive and unfair. Schedules come out the day before the week starts. Training periods are very short, less then 3 days usually 2 hours each. Breaks are paid and it can be a super fun work environment, but don't count on it"
good,"The general manager only seemed to be concerned about their bonuses and benefits. Lots of favoritism going on as well. Very discouraging job. Very fast paced and i had a disability which made things even harder, wasn’t a very comfortable environment to speak freely about personal issues. great food though! which is the most important thing at chipotle :) customers first employees last :)"
good,understaffed overworked underappreciated underpaid just not worth it in the long run but go for it if its temporary might be a little bit more manageable. too many issues with my paycheck
good,I started working at Chipotle my first semester of college and in the beginning is where I had mixed emotions about continuing to work there. The management is awful there. They expect you to know everything off the bat. No training but orientation videos. My main manager showed favoritism to other coworkers of his same race and would even use profanity and give out free meals to whoever he liked.  Working at chipotle has been a rollercoaster. It was such a negative energy every time i worked there.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"A typical day at work consists of clocking in and then get straight into opening. I learned that the fast paced people will belittle you and degrade you because you are not good enough or fast enough. Management is good if you become close to the manager, but if you are not, then they will make your shifts hard. Workplace culture is good and diverse, and you make good friends. The hardest part of the job is having to see disgusting managers that don't like you. The most enjoyable part of the job is my pay, and when I leave."
good,"When I first began working there, the atmosphere was nice and everyone was friendly. Unfortunately, after a complete manager turn around, things were never the same. The store began to employ people that hardly met the 13 traits that are supposed to be required. We were constantly told to do certain tasks by upper management that could only be done if we had more people on shift--like detailing the walls or floors--but, because of labor costs, we were never able to have enough members on shift. Because of our limited staff, many nights went until 12 am, which as a student was difficult to handle. Tasks that shouldn't have fallen on one person began to fall specifically on myself, and with only two hands there is only so much I could do in addition to my own duties. With the right managers, it can be a great place to work."
good,"Chipotle taught me a lot on how to manage people and be a great leader. Extremely stressful job though, very high expectations makes it a high stress environment."
good,The job was just okay. Management was not the best as they had bad communication and most of the employees were young. Most of the employees didn’t have great customer service skills at all.. I did not get the amount of hours that was said when hired which lead to having paychecks not worth much. I personally wouldn’t recommend this location to work at especially if you are a hard worker since they might do you wrong.
good,"A typical day would be mired by a no-show caused by the store's high turnover rate. Management was inconsistent, some managers were great, some were unprofessional and unreliable."
good,Job is easy but alot to do. It's hard to move up if you are not in with everyone else. Hard to be heard. Lots of lifting. It gets hot during the summers. I have been a cashier there and have been stuck doing the same thing even after I asked to be cross trained. 20 cent raise in 6 months. I'm too old to wait for higher positions.
good,"Long shifts with no break, poor management, employee tasks and productivity not enforced, health code violations, lack of training for all positions, unrealistic standards for closing"
good,I worked for over 3 months. I you told the manager you needed a day off even a month in advance he would not listen and still schedule you. Bad work place.
good,A typical day at work was fun and I got to learn a lot of things such as cleaning and how to test the water. Also got used to dining a lot. The management wasn't so great I felt like the manager was racist especially because I did what I was supposed to do and everyone else wasn't my complexion and got treated way differently than I. the hardest part was just trying to blend in and be a part of the team.
good,"I loved working there. I was always excited to go to work hearing, ""How can you enjoy being here?"" over and over. What I didn't like was the scheduling."
good,This job was very unorganized and it was too many teenagers that had problems with handling teamwork when it came down to ones job description nobody wanted to do there job an I wasn’t paid for sick time that I’ve accrued in process I know that there’s something better in this world
good,"its a good job for a college student, but can become super stressful. Also the pay isnt enough for how much work youre required to do on a daily basis. BEst part is the people you work with for the most part"
good,"Management was terrible and constantly fussing at employees about food portions, but overall my coworkers made it a fun job. If you like to work with your hands and in a fast-paced busy environment, you'll like working at Chipotle."
good,Chipotle is probably the worst place I’ve worked at culture wise. The atmosphere is tense. everyone knows what they’re doing but does the bare minimum. The attitudes of the people were more often than not negative. Our customer service score was often low.
good,"I have only worked here for 4 weeks, the environment is unprofessional and layed back. Food safety isn’t a big deal unless it’s temperature related everything else isn’t worried about. No breaks working 8 hours."
good,"They had a horrible management when it came to scheduling hours, sometimes not considering there employees at all. Over all its a nice environment to work on."
good,"After multiple months working there, I still felt like there were things I needed to know but was never taught.  Did not get employees nonslip shoes and always had to wear someone else's shoes.  Poor team communication/collaboration.  Long shifts, often scheduled on short notice, or asked to come in earlier or stay longer than scheduled.  If end of shift occurs during a rush, employee cannot leave.  Uniform and strict dress code.  No official way to request time off.  Did not receive final check until weeks later than last shift.  Free meal during or after every shift.  Only receive company discount if at home store, did not apply to other stores.  Easy to get hired if you do a bit of research"
good,"Management was a disaster. The manager never hesitated to give days off to those employees he was biased and had favoritism towards, but for newbies like me, he'd get so hostile and vicious with every action I made. The customers were fine, the work was hard but the pay was fair for the work I put in and given that it was a very busy location. I did not like that if I requested certain days off with time, my manager would put me to work for those days anyway, completely ignoring my requests then proceeding to THREATEN to fire me. This happened with 3 of my other coworkers who told him that they can't work on certain days, and he responded with hostility and said that if they didn't show up they'd be fired, despite having told him with ample time. The management differs from store to store, though- I've had friends work in stores where their managers were compliant with their school schedules, etc., so it ultimately depends on the type of manager you have- I happened to have a terrible experience with management in this store, but the overall benefits, paid time off and discounts you get are pretty great."
good,"I really liked the culture of the restaurant and its characteristics to looks for good employees. At the time I worked there, there was discrimination against everyone but Hispanic people."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,The management was great but the company itself is not somewhere I would ever suggest someone should work and by the end of my time there I felt like they didn't really care for their employees. It took over a year for me to get a decent raise and to be able to live off of my checks.
good,"The job is what is what it is. That's what it boils down to. If you're coming in with the expectation that it's dumb work, you're partially right-- you must be aware that it is physically taxing, but relatively mindless. It's a food industry, so get ready for unhappy customers every once in a while. That's the bare bones."
good,"Management was constantly starting arguments with employees while giving minimal instruction as how to fix issues. There was also far too much disagreement when the restaurant got busy. One example of the disorganization is when i wasn't able to eat my lunch because the line inside the store had taken 25 minutes out of my 30 minute break, Management noticed i was trying to save my food, and instead of explaining what i had done wrong the manager threatened to fire me for trying to explain my position."
good,A typical a day working at Chipotle I had to redo alot of what an employee left behind after their shift was over. It was very unfair and if i had said anything ill get blamed for it. I learned that ignorant people will put you in a bad situation that you wasnt even part of just to cover themselves up. Management were too much of a slack when it came to certain employees. They would choose an employee that would lie bout something instead of hearing both sides. The hardest part of the job was getting tooken advantage by other employees and managers with extra work of another employees situation. Managers will always stick up for the person who has been their the longest. The most enjoyable part of the job is making customers happy and satisfied with their orders of food.
good,"They expect the Cashiers to always be ready at the cash register, keep track of discount/coupons, keep the dining room and tables clean, make sure the bathroom is clean, refill the ice machine and check the soda levels, make sure the online orders get to the proper person picking it up, and also help with anything else going on. It was way too much for one person to do.and the Cashier does not get any breaks during their shift. I was super overwhelmed everyday that I worked."
good,"My experience at chipotle Mexican grill wasn't the best nor was it the worst thing ever. It definitely isn't easy and the hours were never consistent, but it did help me get out of my bubble and teach me basic food and people knowledge. "
good,Ive worked here for three years and I can honestly say the stress never dissipates. It will change into a different stress as you get promoted but stress free work days are far and few between
good,"Personal experiences will vary based on department and the management within."
good,"Overall the workplace wasn’t terrible, there were a few issues though. Workers didn’t always do their work, and they weren’t told to do their work either unless the general manager was there."
good,"When I started working at Chipotle in 2015, things were a lot different with the company in terms of employee satisfaction and business overall. The company took the time to ensure employees needs were being met as far as promotion, benefits and employment satisfaction. Although after the company took the hit in October/November 2015, the business refocused it’s efforts on above and beyond customer satisfaction only to leave its employees on the back burner. They never took into consideration that happy employees meant happy customers. They started heavily hiring from outside the company despite the previous boasts of primarily inside promotions. With a new CEO and business picking back up these days, the current management teams (as I have worked for several) don’t value personal lives. After losing both my grandparents only 1 month apart, I was practically shunned for needing to take time off last minute and ended up missing my grandfathers funeral in the end. I don’t blame the company for those instances, but the salary managers generally have no sympathy or care for their ‘most valued’ employees - the hourly managers."
good,No work life balance at all if you want to be successful they expect you to work over 12 hour days sometimes 7 days a week.  Its good for a person who doesn't have anything else in life they're committed to.
good,If you are looking for a fun good paying job this would be the job for you but you would also have to deal with the lack of management and you’d also think is this for me.
good,"It was good to have a job that was fast pace but I guess I don't want to be in the food service. So it might not be chipotle, it might be me. But I found a better job opportunity so I took it"
good,"well this particular store I'm working at is very exhausting and draining. I don't really approve of the management, because the hostility and the passive aggressiveness is quite evident within the employees. there's tension in this store almost everyday with management and crew. I wont make this review too long, but nevertheless, I'm just not comfortable working in a place with such intense attitudes, mostly from management."
good,"I was promised more than 30 hours and I got less than 20. Going from 35-45 hours a week to less than almost half, at about half the pay, not really with it in my eyes but it’s a job and you get free chipotle."
good,"Employee turnover rate was very high. The typical work depending on your position could be very demanding and fast paced which can be better for some people than others. The hardest part of the job for me was peak time which was our busiest time, the line was typically out the door the whole time until the end of my shift. The most enjoyable part for me was the customers, there were many times I encountered poor management while working. I did learn how to work fast and productively."
good,"Day starts off with you doing a certain duty, people who call in then you'd have to open their area. If no communication, orders can get messed up. Managers are lazy. Management takes advantage at times. No one seems to know how to communicate with each other like ""adults"" that we all are. The members are great people but as employees they lack purpose."
good,"The poor management and sub-par pay are akin to a typical fast food joint, but the workload is more intense. They make you feel taken care of with free meals and a cult mentality, but then drain you for labor like any other corporation."
good,"the most managers made me feel like the work I did was ever enough. Very disappointing when you're literally doing the best you can. Also, the distribution of work at my location did not seem fair."
good,"Though I did enjoy working here, I realized that this wasn't the job for me. It is a very fast-paced environment and gets quite hectic during the day."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,I worked at the 4th busiest chiptole in NJ. We made around 12-13k a day. I was kitchen manager and ran the grill most days. Managment was a bit disconected to the crew members. We were very understaffed. But When everything worked we ran that store like clockwork.
good,"Although I do not agree with some things within the ""Chipotle Business"" . I cannot say that I can stop coming here, Each day. However while on the line , The Grill, or prep you will be confronted with many challenges. reaching as far as some things are not completed from the prior shift."
good,"A typical day at work was walking in, clocking in and working the line with at least 2 other workers however at times it would get packed and people had to move around to make do. It was not a bad place to work however a patience is needed to work with customers and as well as the employees."
good,I used to love working for this company before it became all about politics. The company needs to stick by what it stands for across the board. The benefits are amazing and it’s great at teaching you if you are a self starter. Higher management and HR type departments are one sided when they promote to be fair to both parties. It’s become all based on how well you can talk rather than how well you work or the results you put out.
good,Working at Chipotle was extremely frustrating. I had to remind them several times that since i am still a high school student i couldnt work 30 hours a week. They constantly disreguarded my orking restrictions making it difficult to balance life and work and school all in one.
good,Chipotle is a good job to have while in school because its is easy to balance. Also you can learn a lot about the company through events such as cultivate
good,"I worked there for a year starting doing cash and ending up doing prep and washing dishes, once a manager didn’t care about my health and had me working there she doesn’t care about my tooth pain and I was crying and at the same time doing the job.  "
good,Fight or Flight is what happens in surprise. Managers in and out so fast the team is rebuilt again and again. Standards always changing and nothing is consistent and it's frustrating being around frustrations. Need a better environment and recognition for the work I put in but get looked over for it.
good,"Day to day business varies from store to store based off location."
good,"When something needs fixed, such as a grill, it could take days to fix and you are expected to produce the best quality without the necessary resources. Field/Upper management does not trust store management."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential."
good,"Chipotle is a good place to work for college students because of the hours and the unlimited time off, it is a cool place to make friends and plus free food."
good,"I was a crew member, therefore I did different things in the restaurant, I served the customers, I would make sure the restaurant was always clean along with the bathrooms, I helped prepare the food at times, I was a cashier."
good,"Poor management, many people quit on the spot, management does not have it together. Has to be reminded multiple times of small things such as days consistently requested off. Night managers dont know what theyre doing."
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed my job there for about 1.5 years and moved up the latter quickly to be a service manager, but the upper-management started to crumble, and the store got taken over by a less-than adequate manager. 75% of the staff quit."
good,"On a typical day, I would arrive and prep the mornings food. By opening we'd have our regulars and always a lunch rush. Things were fast and hectic. While the training wasn't the best I enjoyed the company of my coworkers. The management would always complain about things the crew did while putting a lot of stress on staff for things beyond our control."
good,Getting off 30 minutes to an hour late grated on me as a part time worker. It would not have happened if management had actually scheduled people to work. The expectation of workers was insanely high for the low pay.
good,"You would think that the employees of chipotle have it very easy, right? because the just scoop stuff? It's not easy at all. Chipotle is a very fast paced and demanding job. It is very hard on the body and mind. You are constantly stressed and always have to avoid getting sick at all costs. Depending on your management, it can be a very great job or a very bad one. Definitely do not recommend this as a first job for teens because it is difficult to work around their schedule, you also wont have a social life. I love chipotle but i hate it as well. It was a very great learning experience and pushed me to me past my limits. I made a friends and a family there."
good,"Overall had some terrible managers, the good ones were amazing, but many weren't in it for the right reasons.  The company frantically changed to save it's image after the Ecoli outbreak and is still spiraling out of control."
good,Always working with tense moments occasionally. Can be a nice environment but only if you enjoy your coworkers. It was a hassle to try and get a raise after being there for a year and making less than new employees.
good,"Great food, pretty much great people. If you're looking for a professional career, not so much, but if you need a part-time gig to hold you over, Chipotle is the place to do it."
good,very little pay for all the work that has to be done. Managers do not care about employees well being and you don't even have time to have a social life. sometimes i would get out of work at 1:30 in the  morning after working a shift more than 10 hours.
good,"You need to learn to be extremely fast and not get behind on anything. There is a lot that you need to learn how to do if you want to actually have a decent amount of hours. Learn BOH, but that is the most stressful."
good,"The job started off promising and intriguing, but being there long enough you realize the power trips of management and the feeling of being stagnant. A typical day was being fast the minute you walk through the door to the minute you walk out. The job was high stress and the strength of the team did not help. I worked at two Chipotle's and the lack of creativity allowed was apparent. Managers were adults who act on emotion and coworkers felt that they could be the same way. The most enjoyable part was learning how to be  leader, but the process was a struggle everyday."
good,"I have a lot of negative things to say about Chipotle, but one aspect I can never take away from them is that the people environment that is created is absolutely amazing. Me and my coworkers are all very close with each other and they are the reason my shifts are better. The job itself is not super hard, just you need to be moving fast at ALL times. You get comfortable for one minute and you will get backed up with work immediately. I absolutely love my GM, she is one of the best GM's I've had so far in my career at Chipotle, but upper division management, like our Field Leader, is an absolute jerk. He expects WAY too much from us in a very short amount of time, when he knows we have a million other things to do and he treats us very unfairly sometimes and does not how to talk to us respectfully."
good,Chipotle was a fun atmosphere to be a part of. I liked the idea of working with a group of my peers. I gained a lot of customer service experience while working there.
good,"Working at Chipotle -Mexican Grill- was a waste of time and money."
good,Was a great place to work then was not when a manager was taking their role a little to far and taking advantage of their power. Other than that it was a fun work place.
good,"Some management is great, some is terrible. Job advancement sucks because they promise you they’ll train you for a position, trainyou for the position, and then refuse to give you the position, or even the opportunity to get one."
good,"The job atmosphere was enjoyable, and very friendly. It was a fast paced job but the management could not keep up with the pace.  Overall I would recommend this job as a starter but not a long time/career job."
good,"I honestly dont remember how it was there its been a long time since i worked there, i dont remember learning how to cut foods/vegetables the management that i remember was ok."
good,"It is a very fast paced job , each position is very different from one another, but there Standards are very high. You have to be open minded and ready to learn new things daily."
good,"The expectations are very high at this company, which I respect, however the pay is very low and it highly unlikely people with good management skills will become managers."
good,The scheadules were fixed so a typical day would be very predictable.Not enough pay so it was stressful working 8+ hours. Decent management sometimes very irresponsible.
good,"They no longer have competitive pay for crew members, but still expect them to bend over backwards for little benefits. The fun people culture is gone, so work is stressful and people don't feel like they matter. Upper management is clueless and expects 12 hours of work to get done in a 10 hour work day."
good,I worked there for a year and I still had to get worry if I'd get scheduled enough hours. My manager gave me a lot when he first came then stopped giving me that many. Then would start scheduling me outside of my availability. Very intense and not the most understanding manager but an amazing person. Was very all over the place sad to see him go.
good,"working at chipotle was all about speed, customer satisfaction, and safety. I liked working at chipotle but it wasn't the career choice for me. however I liked the people by my side working with me"
good,A typical day is walking in and being constantly busy and not being set up by previous crew or manager. I learned that generally you had to rely on yourself to problem solve without much help from management as they were already busy putting out other fires. The crew members were great as we bonded over chaos. The hardest part of the job was being expected to function at 100% when you are constantly running out of things. The best part of the day was breaks (if you got them) and going home. On the bright side most of the customers are nice and you get a lot of regulars.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotle is filled with lots of great people.  When I was there the culture was intensely focused on career paths for promotions from within, but as with most concepts in the Dallas market, staffing was a continuous struggle.  I learned a great deal during my time there."
good,"The management is awful and it's all drama and too much for a person to handle, it is a fun place to work on certain days. It gets to the point that you dread going to work."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Chipotle, due to the fact, that it was the first job I applied for while being in college. As the days started to go by, I often felt uneasy because coworkers were rude and expected me to know everything about the job after only being there for about a week or so. Other than that, I enjoyed being a part of the Chipotle team."
good,"This job is more of an enjoy who you work with than an enjoy what you do, kind of job. The hardest thing about the job was working the grill, besides that the work fairly simple just very strict."
good,"A typical day at work would by rushing to get my cashier drawer and quickly check customers out. I worked in other positions too, Chipotle is about rotating positions and be involve in everything. I learned how to manage time and how quick things need to get done. Management could be better. The hardest part of the job is to serve food fast enough customers don't complain. The most enjoyable part of the job is not interact with the customers."
good,"When I first started working at Chipotle it felt as if I would never be leaving the company.The people culture was amazing, lots of room for advancement, and great opportunities for learning new things.As time went on though things took a turn for the worst after and more and more little things started to disappear that made the job not feel like just any other job."
good,When working here you are expected to advance positions very quickly. Your job is not guaranteed due to the fact that you are given performance meetings quite often and if they feel like you are not doing well will possibly let you go.
good,"Day to day operations"
good,"Chiptole likes to hold them selves on this pedestal, but they treat their employees poorly. They make their employees mesmerize ridiculous statements that don't improve service or quality."
good,"It was too much going on with the management and everyone was over worked and under appreciated.  The manager would bring his personal issues to work and all kinds of drama would fold out in the lobby in front of customers.  There was really no leadership,  the supervisor was more of a leader than both managers out together"
good,The managers all they do is joke around nobody takea the work place serious unless the head boss comes in and they do not always keep it sanitary especially the bathrooms
good,"It had it's fun moments, but I would never work there again. but last minute promos and and outrageous amount of customers to serve and tasks to complete in an unrealistic time frame for the quality that was demanded. Is what robbed this place  of it's fun atmosphere that the employees work so hard to create. And that whole customer is always right to the determent of the company made it irritating. And it made the employees feel as if they didn't really have a voice because at the end of the day whatever made the customer happy is what would fly. Even when customers would use abusive language--when they complain they are given free things."
good,"A typical workday at Chipotle consist of prepping and maintaining a high level of guest experience. What I learned from there mainly was how to manage and be a team player. The workplace culture was OK for my first two years there but as times change and staffing , it comes with different attitudes , new protocols, changes in health codes etc. The hardest part of the job was getting the new hires even some old employees to understand the importance of building a future within the company. Mainly without having a pipeline of dedicated employees to move up means no change in effect. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing the reaction of happy guest leaving on a full stomach"
good,"you learn to be a great worker with how busy and stressful it is. you do get many skills, its a great place to work if your mindful, if you like fast pace places, and if your a great multitasker. the most difficult part of wokrig here is the managment."
good,"Chipotle has incredible company with amazing standards. However, the company is changing their standards and procedures rapidly. I learned that in order to move up within the company you have to be curious and have to want it more than the person next to you. Working hard will not cut it. Management is very flexible with school schedules, but will give you a lot of hours if the work is needed. Hardest part of the job is being able to apply all the techniques and procedures that is expected of you. If you cannot catch on and you do not apply yourself, you can easily fail. It can be difficult, but one must apply themselves completely."
good,"I couldn't make it to work because I moved right after I got the job and said yes. Since I couldn't make it, they didn't like me.I understand the atmosphere and the food is good."
good,"The food is amazing and so are your coworkers. Management is great with adding enthusiasm, but you will be the back bone of this company. You will need to work and be efficient, but the pay is low. You get paid similar to that of McDonalds employees but you are expected to give Ruth Chris type customer service."
good,"The management was decent, the learning experience very beneficial, But when you put in the most work day in and day out while you're there. It gets tiring and not truly appreciated by management."
good,"they need to hire new managers, not enough people working at a time. sometimes there are only 4 people doing 9 or 10 people's work."
good,I was judged for being a summer hire wasn't treated nicely would not work there again in all honesty very rude and cliquey staff in the location i worked at
good,"Chipotle loves people who have no work experience prior, as they believe that people without a previous work background are more malleable to tailor a person into the work they will hand to their employees. The thing is, that they will take advantage of those who have no work experience and dont understand workers rights and ethics. You will be expected to work more then just what you were hired for. If you expect you will only work in the front, you should know that they *will* give you other work such as cleaning and even cooking. Over the course of around 3 weeks, they expect someone with no job experience to be proficent in the work they are told to do, without delay. "
good,wouldn't recommend ............ i I don't know. Everything was too fast. too stressful. rude managers. stop asking me to write more cause yall making me mad..
good,"Chipotle is a great cooperation when it comes to high standards and food quality and employee compensation, but the work environment is not what you expect, the hours are long and you are expected to stay longer than your scheduled hours every shift making it hard for people who have second jobs or school or family ."
good,When I worked here management kept changing. I think I had about 6 different managers in the short time I worked here. the training program doesn't make any sense and requires you to complete a lot of redundant things before you can move on.
good,"When I first interviewed with my local Chipotle, I was excited to begin working there part time. I even talked my husband into working at the same location with me, and for a few weeks, everything was smooth and we found a perfect work-life balance. However, as the weeks went by, there was gossip and one of the managers began talking about coworkers while we were within earshot. It became too much stress for us to care and we both began hating the environment; we questioned why anyone would want to eat there, much less work there. So. Great at first, but it's all about teamwork and spreading out responsibility, which my location did not do well."
good,"Chipotle conceptually, is brilliant, however I had the great misfortune to have circumstances which made working there unbearable. For anyone looking for a first-time job, I would recommend it; they offer excellent benefits."
good,"mornings start off fast paced to be ready come opening time, rushes start early and come in bursts. Very team oriented, youre as strong as the weakest link scheduled during your shift. If anyone falls behind, the group will definitely feel it through the companies' productivity if you cant catch back up as a team. I learned how to better manage my time while the team is preparing to open, multi-tasking is also a factor that plays into the work day. Overall, it was the team at my location that made the job worth maintaining. You are expected to work at a fast pace, with no sacrifices to accuracy or efficiency. Dont get me started on workplace culture. It used to be present a few years ago, but has been changed since. Its sad, honeslty. But Corporate deemed one-on-ones an irrelevant waste and got rid of their ""characteristics"" manual that used to be a guideline to the heart of what they stood for. Of everything, I enjoyed the free meal you get for working your shift, up to $12 worth of product a person, i believe. If anything, its a good place to start, but overall the job gets old reallllly fast as a crew member."
good,"I wasn't really the right fit at Chipotle. I was laid off because of the lack of work, but there was constant miscommunication between management and employees. Management usually got to the store late and it would set back the time for morning prep. I wanted to move to another department, but I was stuck on salsa and most days it felt stressful to get all of the work done. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning how to make different items, such as salsa and guacamole."
good,"Job was my first job, it just wasn't for me. This was my first job when I was in high school. At the time the job was wonderful, my management was so well. After our GM got let go everything else went down hill."
good,"I enjoyed working at this establishment a great majority of the time. My coworkers were amazing and we were willing to cover shifts if need be. However, we received new management and this person changed the whole dynamic of the restaurant. I found better work and discontinued my employment."
good,"The job is very easy, especially if you  have experience. However, working under those who are unhappy with their positions and those who only hire friends makes it hard to see any kind of future in this company. They use to be about good employees with a good strong foundation, but now it is all about customer service without caring about their employees. That's just what happened in my area, it might be different for you."
good,"A typical work day consisted of preparing all the the food to be up to regulation and be ready to serve. As a grill cook my responsibility was to have the food ready in advance to be used and served. The grill cook was responsible for prepping the meat, beans and rice. Towards the end of the night my responsibility was to close down the grill and make sure all the dishes were washed and ensure were able to leave on time."
good,"Working a chipotle it was pretty cool. Nice easy job. rolling burritos , asking what do they want. Making a happy customer. But you clean every hour , you sweep and clean everything even whens its not dirty. just cleaning because its a slow day or slow hour. Go outside and clean the walls. I can understand the bathroom the garbage, but walls."
good,"very busy days  too much to do and no time to do it. "
good,"As a GM you are put in a hard spot not only in the middle management sense but as a person in general. The upper management has no idea what it is like day-to-day in their restaurants and the managers do the best that they can to make it look like everything is going according how they what things to be run. The best part about this job is the people, inside the store and out. If it wasn't for the crew I worked with and the customers in the store I would have left a long time ago. They do have a great pay and benefits package but it doesn't really equals to all that is required of you."
good,Alot  of favoritism and unfair decisions. GM was rarely at work and would always ask others if they can work his shift without really saying his shift.
good,no matter if one person was slacking or two chipotle is a team based business. so when each individual is doing their job everything comes together and as a team everyone is told good job!
good,The crew members change constantly but their always nice new people you'll meet their mostly welcoming. The managers are nice when you first meet them but after a while of working there you see the fairness they show to certain people and you have to work constantly which leaves you no free time to have an outside life. The goal for chipotle is very great but many of the managers need to be replaced. The crew may seem rude but it's only because of the way the man here's treat many of us.
good,"The Chipotle of 2 years ago was a great entry job, Inspiring young workers to become top performers, who are empowered to uphold high standards. Due to E-coli this company has changed drastically. Forcing their top performers to become over worked and failing to empower their new workers. Forcing extra unnecessary work in order to hold ""high standards"". The fast casual format is hurting this brand tremendously, with many new crew members leaving within a week of being hired. This company continues to enforce new rules and ideas that make the crews life harder. imagine having to stand on a line while there are no customers around. or not being able to finish a task due to standing at attention for peak. This company continues to move backwards recently changing their motto to providing excellent customer service, but not making the sacrifices to achieve that. The safe bet for any chipotle worker is to use chipotle as a summer job. Don't stay for too long as the higher ups care not how hard u work since you are replaceable."
good,I would fry chips and taco shells and stock the area and prepare the food to service the customers before we open at 11:00. I would stay on the line and greet customers as they walk thru the door and put there order together for them and tell them to have a great day. between the hours of 12:00 to 1:00 we have peek hours and we have to be an ace in our place and not move and look forward and smile and greet the customers
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"It depends on what locations you're at. Some store run well, others are not so great. It all depends on your GM, and if they have the wrong person managing the store, no one else cares. Theres no vision, no organization, and no reason to stay in the company."
good,"I learned a lot working at Chipotle. From learning to be around people again and gaining confidence in myself, to making sure we served the best, cleanest, most well done food possible. I learned a lot about food period! The management team was never on the same page and that is what made things a little complicated for me and my crew members, but we always kept ourselves together and worked extra hard as a team! The hardest part about working at Chipotle was not really being able to be myself. I cared so much about the restaurant that it bothered me when the customers tried to take advantage of us or degrade us and there was nothing I could do. But I always managed to keep myself together. The most enjoyable part was interacting with my customers and growing bonds with them. Also, building good relationships with most of my crew members."
good,Chipotle is a very fast paced environment where you are expected to catch on to the task quickly. You have to continuously be prepared to adapt to changes and willing to accept whatever comes your way.
good,I liked working for this company.  I liked cooking the food and cutting all the vegetables.  I was eating healthy and eating good food every day because it was free.
good,"a typical work day didn't come with a plan for the day you'd kind of walk in blindly, I've learned to handle food properly a restaurant level and how to work cash register."
good,"Cool place to work, where you'll learn a lot about yourself, and team work.  Drenched in politics, that start from the beginning.  The most enjoyable part is really the customers, learning names and their usual orders.  Growing extremely fast, lots of room for growth."
good,"I'm a top performer and I love cooking this amazing food. However, I work very hard, using skills that other restaurants pay more for. I have been trying to grow and learn other stations but my management seems to not really care about my development. Last week I had my first 1 on 1 conversation about development since I started 8 months ago. I feel like I'm just a work horse they keep dangling development in front of like a carrot to keep performing excellent work for a cheap price. Sometimes I feel like $9.00 an hour is kind of an insult for the work I do and things I deal with every day."
good,"Develop positive working relationships with all restaurant personal and work as part of a team by helping others as needed or requested"
good,"Working at Chipotle was an okay experience, they over work and under pay you. The workers were friendly and a little to friendly to my opinion at Chipotle in Union Station."
good,"I had a good time in the beginning. The story changed once management changed. It went from a kosher work place to a feast or famine. It was very unprofessional sense of competition between all of the crew members in order to climb their way to the top of the food chain. Unfortunately, through all of the unhealthy work behavior, everyone had been let go."
good,"The particiular store i was at was great, the crew members were great, but the management were inexperienced and young. Was hard to continue to be a student and a parent with the crazy 10-12 hour daily shifts i worked."
good,"The work and what is expected of us, is to much for what we get paid. This is something that I dont see changing anytime soon."
good,This was the first fast food restaurant I've ever worked in. A typical worked day consisted of me handling food to customers and cleaning the dining area. Management was a bit strict but good managers. The hardest part of this job was dealing with rude customers. Although it had its downs it also had its up and which I'm thankful for getting the opportunity to working at Chipotle Mexican grill.
good,"They never care that a new crew member has enough training, and they don't provide much support to help them learn. Awesome crew to work with, but unless you're in a certain location the opportunities for advancement are limited. The job is generally easy, but they never have enough staff to help when it gets busy. Scheduling is horrible, they don't like anyone to have more than 30 hours a week. More than half of the customers that come in daily are rude. The general system and the way the company runs doesn't work. They're constantly pushing people to go faster and do more but they don't show them how, support them, or follow up on if they have done any better. Every store is full of managers that play favorites. Overall, more trouble than it's worth."
good,"Working at Chipotle , I learned a lot about agriculture. I learned about the backgrounds of owning a company and building it from top to bottom. The Co-workers were great , but the work environment was a little off. The hardest part of the job , was explaining portion sizes to customers. Many customers hated the fact that we really coludnt give them extra food because of inventory. The other hard part was as employees we really weren't allowed to express our feelings about the company , in a constructive way . I actually had the most fun doing  prep work before the store opened. I got to know everyone and I also gained a great appreciation for food ."
good,"The days are busy because you are working at a non-stop paced. I've learned great customer service, great cooking, and safety skills. The management is okay. They really are all over the place and not on the same page which reflects on the crew members. The hardest part about the job is that the crew members are over worked and under paid. But the best part about my job is my co- workers, they are all wonderful people and keep me look forward for my next shift."
good,"typical type of day will mostly start out slow when open for business and get busier as time flies. Consistantly busy non stop working. I learned all positions of the resturaunt in less than a year, 5 different positions and mastered all of them management was not so great not very company like but some of them were good. Hardest part of the job was learning how to work grill constant work HOT non stop job. Most enjoyable was the coworkers having fun and working hard to make the day go by faster n staying focus to move people in and move people out."
good,"The job was exactly that, a job. Not much of a career opportunity.  Management was not always on top of its game and the pay was not good. The order at the restaurant was ok but not as professional as possible.The crew i worked with was good and i enjoyed teaching as well as learning from them and interacting with customers."
good,"Typical day begins with food prep. Workers know what task they have and what needs to be accomplished within a particular time period. I've learned a lot about the culture of this company, which is to provide the best possible food from the best possible sources.  However, somewhere along the line the actual customer is just that, a customer. Many times they are ignored in favor of employees acting foolish and discussing topics which have absolutely nothing to do with focusing on the customer in front of them. The cashier must almost always be called to the front to assist the customer, which sometimes takes a long time, and the food often is comped because of the inattention. The main store management team is 22 years old or under, which leads to much inappropriate behavior and foolishness. Inattentiveness to customers is a big problem and their work seems to be mainly geared towards being proactive on the front line during the peak hour for lunch & dinner, then retreat to the office for the remainder of their shift.  I don't know if that much paperwork is required of them. I prefer that management take an active roll in everything at all times, not just during peak hours of the day.  I also find the appearance of certain management team members to be off-putting to the general public.  Employees are allowed to listen to their personal music in the back of house and grill area, which at times is greatly inappropriate both in volume and in lyrics. Miscommunication is a large issue. Rules change on a daily basis and those who were off for a day aren't informed. I started out"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"It's really not worth it working so hard for few hours. The paycheck isn't going to be given to you until the end of the month. So, if anybody  wants to get a weekly paycheck , it's better to work somewhere else. Management was horrible. The manager wasn't able to keep his workers. He was more worried getting employees than maintaining them.The happiest day for me is when I stop working for Chipotle and found another job with better management. Please take my advice it will save you time and a headache."
good,If your looking for a fast food chain to move up the ladder quick this maybe the position you've been waiting for.
good,"a typical day at work involves a lot of moving around, lifting heavy rice bags, rice pots and other ingredients chipotle uses for the food prep. it also involves constant interaction with customers. much of the day requires making sure our stations are clean. I have learned how to properly prepare food and food safety, stronger customer service skills and money handling skills. Although, its sad to say not everyone does all required work, but they get away with it due to favoritism coming straight from management. there is no hard part of this job, its all rather simple, just do as directed and all is well. the most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and seeing them smile as I work my customer service skills. also spending time and bonding and learning to work together with some amazing co workers that share a desire to work."
good,"I worked at Chipotle for nearly half a year and although I enjoyed working there, the managers were immature and lacked in their ability to oversee their employees. Constantly I would be sarcastically ridiculed by managers who, in my opinion, felt threatened by my efforts. Working there for the amount of time i did, I was able to see this same offensive attitude force many employees out, however with a regenerating college work force down the street, they are oblivious to changing their ways."
good,There is so much to do at Chipotle that the pay does not make sense at all.
good,Manangers would change the schedule that same day and not tell you. They speak about inappropiate things during the work at and smoke weed on break.
good,"To start my day off at Chipotle I have to start with a positive adittude not every day is the same not the costumers. As a cashier my morning starts around 10AM or 10:30AM my duties are to open the patio, the drinking station also needs to be set up ( spoons, forks, lids, napkins ect.) also putting ice into the machine, the ice teas also need to be there ready. Once everything is good to go I confirm to my manager to make sure everything is okay and we go to the office where I count the money that is needed for the day. I get set up in the systerm and I am ready to go for the day. Once the doors open (11AM) the cashier must NOT move from her place until 2:00PM and when that is over the cashier must keep the lobby as clean as possible."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle is challenging and everyday brings a new challenge. I learned to have a bigger sense of urgency, and look at the bigger picture. The management is good. My co workers are some of the best workers I've seen and are always there to help. The hardest part about this job is time management. The most enjoyable part about this job is satisfied customers."
good,fun place to work and easy place to get fat at. a day would be prepping food and later on cooking food easy job to have.
good,Have had issues with management and they play favorites. work you to death for 9/hr not worth it
good,"The food is great except for how long the lines get and it can be very frustrating especially when co-workers don't really know how to work together as a team. The co-workers were nice, but at times when stress is involved the vibe can be very irritable and you can feel the tension. The management never work together usually and there was always miscommunication. People quit left and right because of the apprentice working there. Or get fired because they don't get the proper training they need which leads to failure. She is a hard worker but she always gives negative feedback rather than helping out and encouraging the employees to give them a reason to work harder and try harder and feel good about working there. No matter what you do she would pester and nag instead of letting you do your job. Besides the negativity I can say the only positive thing about Chipotle is their value on healthy local foods and they really love their customers."
good,"Love the crew, the food is good and the Culture Chipotle is trying to promote is headed in the right direction. However, the pay is really not so great. You have to be willing to work very long hours and not have much time for a personal life if you want to move up faster. And even then, it depends on how the Team Lead (though they don't actually work with you in your store) feels about you."
good,"Busy place, i learned a lot of how to prepare good food. The management is great. I get along with everyone. The hard part is to go up a postion thats pretty much it. The most enjoyable thing about my job is that we have fun at work."
good,"The company has really great values, high standards and expectations. Working hard to achieve those standards and accomplish everything they wanted you to get done was rewarding. The concept of everyone needing to work as a team to get things done and helping one another to move up from crew to management was very motivating."
good,When i worked there the General Manager was very disrespectful and gave unfair treatment. Everyone was always arguing and it was always bad vibes. Some coworkers were nice but the majority were disrespectful
good,"Short handed staff very often, low quality management, not very inclusive, very low advancement rates, not enough pay for certain tasks, high stress, lack of training"
good,All the benefits really help the average joe college student. But the work is not for the faint of heart. They will work you until you tell them you're done. If you like a constantly changing work environment you'll do fine though.
good,"I loved chipotle for what it made me into, but I hated how people were treated. If you don’t know anyone higher or aren’t friends with any managers you’ll have a tough time."
good,"The job was okay.I met some great coworkers.Chipotle really prides themselves on being ""family oriented"".That would be accurate if only management became for consistent and they cared about growth and advancement. I knew there were benefits I didn't personally sign up for them. They did have major holidays off and sick pay, no pto though.They do have tuition reimbursement  for very specific  majors.It was as good as a starting job for a college student goes ."
good,A typical day at work was to fill up all the things I needed to work my shift and making customers happy with our service. What I learned was how to multi task in short periods of time. Management could have been a little better but they helped out. Workplace culture was like being with some of your friends while making food for people. The hardest part of the job was time management. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to eat Chipotle at the end.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I liked a lot of the crew members I worked with. A lot of them were really funny and sweet. The managers, however, thought they were a gift sent from God himself. They were horrible and made work so unenjoyable."
good,"I started out with the job being difficult, but after we got a new manager, it was the best 6 months of my work life. The new general manager cared about all of his workers and was almost universally liked. He left to pursue another job at Microsoft and after he left, we got the worst manager. I decided to leave after the manager kept scheduling me during school hours and me repeatedly telling him that I can’t do those hours and him threatening to fire me."
good,"When I worked there, an outbreak happened all the managers got fired Bc it turned out they weren’t doing things right and taking shortcuts as well. I liked the food there but I also got sick"
good,"The workplace culture was alright, management over years has gotten worse and depending on what you are assigned to it requires either little to all effort with lots of stress"
good,"Overall it was a good job, they expect you to stay busy during the shifts (which is expected) but it become tiring because customer service is everything for a company, but some customers burn you out."
good,It was a basic restaurant job. The days were long when someone called out. I worked at two different locations. The first location was way better in its management and structure. I didn’t realize it until moving cities and seeing the disorganization at my new store. I made the best of it but decided it wasn’t the place for me.
good,The job experience wasn’t bad until things started to change easy job but if you defend yourself in certain situations with the boss they will give you less hours  or even none.
good,the crew is super nice and really fun to work with. I have run into some difficulty with the lack of hours given. However the more positions you learn the more hours you will be able to get.
good,Chipotle is a make as it's ordered restaurant. More often than not employees would talk bad about the customers. Make up code words to rate the male customers and talk negativily about guest they didn't like. Mangers didn't have much respect for their employees either.
good,"My time at Chipotle was alright for only a few months. The more time I put in, the more I realized how unprofessional my managers, especially my store manager was. They would constantly bend rules to get you to do things you weren't supposed to, or didn't have to do just to make their lives easier. They also wouldn't follow the law when it came to paying you for short notice schedule changes. I was thrown on the grill with no training whatsoever and was expected to perform as if I had known it forever. No grill training, but I got questioned why I couldn't do my job. Asked for help from management, no help. My time on the Line and Register was decent enough though. Also be prepared to work your butt off and sweat for no recognition, and rush rush rush like they tell you too. Because you won't have the chance to slow down, ever. I wouldn't recommend this job really, at all, for anyone. Unless you're desperate of course."
good,If you're young 10/h I think is ok for you but when you have a family and you're km the money is just no enough also everything depends of who's in charge . If you have a good GM that know what he/she is doing you'll have a great time but when they put people just to fill up a position (big no no)they usually doesn't know what they're doing you'll have not a great time.
good,"Chipotle expects a lot out of its employees for the amount it compensates them in return. Expected to endure long rush hours with little help from managers. Was also scheduled more than I asked for: I began to be scheduled 30+ hours per week despite asking to work part-time at about 20-25 hours per week, and was often scheduled for times I requested off for because they were under staffed."
good,"Co workers were very friendly, including the managers at first, but managers became abusive due to their negligence of ""our labor cost"". Yet, they would tell us to come in early sometimes; even on some days, they would ask us ( night crew) to stay and prepare things that the morning crew was in charge of. They even tried blaming both crews stating that the morning crew was slow at prepping and night crew took along time closing. Sometimes managers would send some one with a 4 hour shift home and they would stay for another 3 to 4 hours."
good,"This job is great for people straight out of high school with lots of energy and free time. Shifts are fast and constant, if you can keep up with a heavy flow of customers its a fine job."
good,"Chipotle developed me as a person and a leader. When I began working for the company it was under the old CEOs who originally began the company. They really created an amazing culture and work was always enjoyable. I worked prior to the outbreaks and afterwards the company began to change. It was still an excellent environment to work under until the new Chief Officer team began. The company’s direction complete changed and the culture was gone. The expectations became too high. As a crew member, if you had a poor management team it wasn’t a great work environment. As a general manager, the issues continued to grow. The expectations are unrealistic. The work life balance is extremely poor. There is no opportunity to enjoy a life other than Chipotle. I work 70+ hours a week, without overtime. Some days I will work 16 hours and work 7 days or more in a row. The worst part is that this is the expectation. If you are not willing to dedicate your entire time to Chipotle you become questioned. There is no support from upper management. The sick policy is also absurd. Overall, if the new leadership kept the old culture and values things might be different."
good,the store is ran by a bunch of kids who don't know what they're doing. its an easy job if you're trained correctly. very flexible with the hours and scheduling.
good,It was an alright experience. This was my first job as a high school student (current). The managers that took over the manager that hired me it wasn't quite as fun. And they always scheduled me during my school times.
good,"Just make sure you’re ready for a fast pace environment, and just take advantage of all the opportunities that they offer. They have tuition reimbursement. Which would be very, very, very helpful for a college student. Who wouldn’t take a free $2,000 just for you going to school and doing what you’re supposed to do? They have it set up to where you can have company advancement. The better you do, as long as you’re working, just move up in the ranks. I’ve met people that started at Chipotle as a crew member, and now they’re working in the corporate offices and actually running things. Just work hard, be ready for the fast pace environment, and just stay on top of everything you need to do."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotles rate of pay is 9.15 an hour, if you are working in the morning you will not get a break at all. The customers are rude and will take advantage of you, you are expected to work when you are sick despite their sick leave policy. If you aren’t a fast learner and worker you will be bullied by management for being too slow and the training process needs to be revised.  I watched a coworker on his first week get bullied by a manager for making a mistake and he was yelled at for over an hour about it. It is a great first job if it’s your only option, but don’t expect to be able to pay your bills here."
good,"A typical days work includes serving customers, cooking, washing A LOT of dishes, preparing pounds of vegetables for recipes and salsas, frying chips and taking orders on a cash register."
good,"I love how fast paced it was.  Minimum wage isint worth the job .Because u have to kno how to do everything.  Foh- working the line. Boh ,grill dishwasher, & jantioral work .Cashier  u have to be able to multitask. Its good if your looking for a part time job . Management suck . They never listen to any of our concerns and one manager in particular use to harass and say things she shouldnt have. So alot of people were targeted"
good,"I was a Manager and the management team was poor. It could've been constructed much better. I left for reasons not applied but I will say that if you can handle their management team and crew, then you'll be fine."
good,"They treat their employees externally, very well, internally for the most part they are treated fairly average, sometimes better or worse. Compensation is fair dependent upon hire or promotion date."
good,"Chipotle was overall an interesting first job to have I learned a lot in the time I've been working there that I will definitely take with me into my future endeavors but, certain management situations really ruined my experience being a crew member."
good,"A typical day at work was usually quite stressful as we were almost always understaffed. As a cashier, you are responsible for the cleanliness of the dining, patio, and bathrooms, ringing up customers, and taking care of online orders. It was quite stressful however I did learn how to multitask and perform quite well under pressure. It also teaches you time management. My boss at the time was quite  rude and talked down to his employees which was not a good feeling however they did get new management right before I left so maybe it’s better now. Coworkers are what make the job easier and funner."
good,"While the company has a worthy mission and culture to support, it has room for growth and improvement in leadership training. There isn't any structure for promoting within."
good,"I was a manager at Chipotle Mexican grill, and had been employed by the company for more than 4 years. I began as a crew member, and had the opportunity to be involved in 3 separate stores over my career there. One of which became a Restauranteur. The lessons that chipotle gave me were invaluable, but truly at the cost of my personal life. I was paid poorly for the work that I put in, with countless hours off the clock. My choice to leave the company happened after my general manager went under investigation and the employee turn over sky rocketed. It was at that time that the job I was being asked to do was taking far to great of a risk on my mental, emotional, and physics health. So after working out my 2 weeks notice, and one additional week thereafter, I left Chipotle."
good,The company is great to work for it's the management. They put inexperienced young people as managers instead of keeping the adult mature managers. Managers don't support their crew members and too much favoritism.
good,"i would rate my work experience here a 4/5, not every place you work at is going to be perfect but the experience was amazing. i really do recommend this job for anyone looking for a decent job."
good,I would still be working there if the school events didnt get in the way of working there. It is very fast pasted and stressful and loud. The harder jobs like the one I did there paid more than the others but I also had more work to do.
good,"I thought overall for a first job it was great. I was paid decently for my area and it was a good learning experience. As time went on the store ended up getting worse and worse as General Managers we’re coming and going and the schedule was really bad. As a student in high school I was working close to full time hours because they didn’t have anyone to fill in the gaps and I was only supposed to be part-time. I was accused of putting my schoolwork in front of my career by the end of me working there, so I just quit and left because I was only 16 and had high school to finish."
good,"The work was extremely strenuous and stressful, the lines would get crazy long to the point where it was out the door and the work line was backed up like crazy. Management wasn't always super helpful, although the younger managers were great."
good,Working here was amazing for me! I love the fast pace and team work the restaurant offers. It’s always clean and organized. I was able to expand my knowledge in the kitchen by working here as well.
good,"Chipotle will teach you how to use a knife, how to serve customers, and lots of other things. As you advance, it will teach you things like how to keep food safe and then move all the way up to business skills like PnLs and scheduling. Chipotle, however, is unlike any other company Ive ever worked for in how demanding and domineering it is in your life. The organization is also very top heavy and my region was chock full of some really difficult people doing some very shady things at the middle/area management level. I loved my store and my team and am thankful for what I got but it was time to go. This is a hard job and it was from Day 1."
good,"The job it self is great, but when the simple tasks become the most difficult thing because policy changes every few months. Or when we get a new general manager every 5 months. I have worked there for almost 2 years and I have gone through 7 general managers."
good,"Working at Chipotle, I've experienced many encounters with management, employees, and customer. Chipotle is a fast-paced environment, which was very equipped for me. Having critical thinking skills were mandatory."
good,"While working their was super stressful most of the time, and really damaging to your body. The only good part being your co-workers , and that you are provided a free meal each shift."
good,Depending who is in management can change the work environment/atmosphere. Some managers motivated me to do better while other managers made me not like working there at all.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"At Chipotle we were required a lot of labor for long periods of time.  i leared how to move fast and how to greet and treat custmers to keep them coming back. the hardest part of the job was the lack of help when yu need it the most, it can hget really stressful. my favorate parts were my coworkers keeping my attitude upbeat."
good,"i started out here as a line person. then moved to prep, and eventually i became the main grill guy. the environment is focused around micromanagement. Expect to be watched every couple minutes even by people doing completely different tasks. The field leader is terrible, and instructs the management to always be on everyone's back about every little thing. always short people so expect a call at least every other day asking you to come into work."
good,"The store was almost always packed, understaffed, nothing was clean due to being understaffed, managers were very rude, hours always changed and were constantly being scheduled on days asked off."
good,"The company doesn’t care about their workers anymore, they only care about making each restaurant look good on paper and making it seem like they are following food safety protocols.  I’ve worked in 3 restaurants on Long Island and none of them followed even half of the standards set by the company.  It is all corporate with people who have never worked in a chipotle restaurant making all of the rules. There’s no separation between work and personal life; groupchats, text messages, all with long paragraphs about tons of “important changes” that will most likely be forgotten about in 3 days when they change their minds."
good,"The company does a great job following procedures. Responsibilities included all aspects of a general manager position including scheduling, labor control , inventory, ect."
good,"Working here is horrible. They could not care less about your personal life. Management will blame you , especially when they don't tell you specific details. Training consists of web videos and short quizzes. They skip the seemingly mandatory walk-throughs and expect you to understand everything. I have received ""strikes"" for not taking certain measures when I did not know I had to take them. Working here feels terrible. Your back hurts endlessly because you are constantly bending over to serve customers."
good,"Personally working in the restaurant alongside the personnel was amazing, coming in from the outside they were very patient with me as I got trained and learned Chipotle procedures. Honestly not a lot of management training was provided to me being that I had been a General Manager for 7years in my previous employment and some of the systems I used before were very similar to the ones I used before it was just getting familiar with the Chipotle ones."
good,I had a overall an adventurous experience at the company for sure. And will take what I did learn there and succeed else where because they let me go on unfairness without giving me opportunity to fight for my job
good,"The culture the company wants to set for it's employee's is a great vision however tough to realize due to the often high stress, high risk-low reward situations you must handle. In my experience that does differ when the restaurant is staffed appropriately and is in the hands of a caring manager."
good,"May have been an isolated event, but I was discouraged by the store manager to pursue a degree in anything but business. My job was also constantly threatened if I ever called out sick, including the final time I called out when I was hospitalized."
good,"The time table given to do your daily work routine can be unrealistic, causing undo stress on the prep staff, management seems to care more about labor hours than its prep personnel."
good,Environment had confusing management structure needs to make that a much clearer picture.  The co-workers are nice and the work is steady.  Hours are inconsistent and there as nepotism.
good,"Okay to work at, until they were short staffed and treated their employees very poorly. The manager I worked with was so rude, that I started crying (I was 19 at the time summer between college classes), and he didn't care and kept pushing me. Team members were not helpful half the time and very discouraging and rude. I don't know how other stores were, but the store I worked at was not that great."
good,"Overall it is very fast paced and sometimes extremely stressful, but nothing that could not be handled. I have learned a lot about customer service and hospitality while working for this company."
good,Chipotle was a great place in the beginning. I honestly didn’t plan on leaving until management wouldn’t work with the fact that I was pregnant and couldn’t do certain things. Decided it was just best to leave
good,Line is out the door for hours on end with no break at all. I learned a lot but it wasn't worth working there. Very fast-paced and we only got a 30 minute break out of an 8 hour shift. Get dehydrated very quickly and then get yelled at for getting water. I would work my butt off and would get told that I'm not working. Management sucks.
good,Chipotle used to be a work hard/play hard culture.  That's not really the case.  It's now more of a work hard and worry each day if your job is going to be there.  Don't expect much acknowledgment for the hard work you put in and understand this time of transition is making everyone nervous about their continued ability to keep their jobs.
good,"Chipotle will always have special place to me because one I love the food and second it was a pleasure working here. Even though the pay is not sufficient to sustain yourself it is a great place to be to grab some experience. Experience like team environment, communication skills, how to deal with other people. Over all great experience"
good,"The job does require a lot and seems great at first but will quickly add to your responsibilities without pay increase. They will make you feel like a significant part of the team and make work enjoyable, but the disappointment is within the check. I am not the only employee that is underpaid, service managers are unpaid as well. The conflict has been ignored from day one."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I hated working here as a cashier. It was like working two jobs for one position. Working cash means you have to clean, mop, and maintain the entire dining area, which is understandable. However, also being responsible for deep cleaning the bathrooms shouldn't be the responsibility of the cashier. Chipotle needs to hire actual janitors to do the cleaning, rather than the cashier. Asides from the previously mentioned tasks, cashiers are responsible for re-stocking everything from utensils to ice in the soda machine. Some of our other tasks seem so stupid and unnecessary, like dusting the artwork in the store daily. I also don't understand why cashiers have to put chips in bags when we're not working with food. Cashiers are also responsible for a lot of other duties but I'm too tired to list them. "
good,Manager did not try to have healthy or any relationship with his staff as a leader. Constant gossip and drama. Miserable environment. Hectic customers
good,company does not live up to the culture it preaches and the higher level management makes you feel inadequate regardless of how hard you try to meet their demands. It's a thankless job that requires a lot out of you with somewhat inadequate pay that can be unnecessarily stressful for both managers and crew.
good,"If you are truly able to multitask; this is the job for you. Besides the food being great,  fast pace work is mandatory. There won’t be a time to stop for a second and the job will take a toll on you if you aren’t able to meet your tasks."
good,I really don't have nothing to incorporate to this review. I wasn't satisfied with the management of not one store but two stores throughout my tenure at Chipotle.
good,A typical day of work includes one coming in and helping out in whatever part of the store requires the most assistance. The work environment is very fast past and stressful.
good,"Busy, stressful cannot manage life if you work full time and as a manager overworked it was fun in the beginning but ever since the e coil outbreak it just got so stressful."
good,The management was extremely backhanded. I loved my coworkers and the job description itself. I made a lot of good connections through this job and realized  how much I love working with people.
good,"If you have good management the store you work at will be hassle free, but if you have poor management, it'll bring everyone down. A lot of opportunities to grow."
good,"Management is so focused on how they look when their supervisors come in, they tend to not focus on many things. Left due to another employee harassing and management didn't do anything."
good,"- typical work day is moderately busy"
good,Okay job for a teen looking to make so extra cash when living with their parents but not a practical job to make a living at. Fast passed job and under staffed.
good,Its a very fast paced job where you have to be fully energy and be very fast at your job responsibility. It is a fun job with the coolest people. You just have to handle all the stress you can.
good,pay was decent but work could get overwhelming due to co workers and management. There was always work to be done which is a plus for me. I truly believe under greater and more steady management it has the potential to be a great workplace. Not a place for people who are not prepared for hard work.
good,"This is a very fast paced work. Need to be constantly present in all working aspects, front and back. Lots of work hours and hours start as early as 5:30am."
good,"I feel as though the management is poor, scheduling is lacking and there is more expected of you in a short amount of time than is capable of being done."
good,"I worked at Chipotle since May and even though I did everything I was supposed to, the moment I got injured on the job, everything changed. Even though this was my first job, they fired me for being injured on their part."
good,A very past paced type of job. It depends on who you are working because everyone is different. I learned how to use cooking utensils properly. How to cook certain foods and learned a lot about health codes. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people I worked with.
good,"I loved working here, but overtime our store started to go downhill. It was a domino effect, management was failing and we started to fail as a store. The people being hired were not a good fit, resulting in a horrible turnover and the changes that Chipotle makes as a company is not beneficial all the time. They made a rule that minors cannot close (even in the summer), that left us shortstaffed at night."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,It's clean neat and it was a fun experience while it lasted. Typical day is you clock on get I usually got some of my closing duties ready and then i washed my hands and started helping customers.
good,It's very fast paced and can be stressful at times. There is room for learning but not advancement. It has free lunches which is always great and allows for a flexible schedule based on what you're looking for.
good,The people who go their to eat and including the employees are great and very friendly. This job is recommended for kids also coming out of high school.
good,"I wouldn't reccommend this place to anyone. Long hours, with terrible pay. Cashiers are responsible for way too much. It's about the job of 2 people put on 1 person"
good,"My experience with Chipotle was mixed. For the majority of my career there I enjoyed the learning curve and the room for transparent growth. Most my days started with register work and serving customers from the serving bar. As time progressed, I was allowed the space to pick up more heavy positions and responsibilities which included heavier labor and actual food preparations. As time passed, management has changed hands, and through irreversible differences between myself and particular parts of management, as an overall chipotle has started to lose the sense of magic and comradery that made it so appealing in the first place. I only recommend the job on the note that its a good first job for someone looking for structure and basic working skills. The environment is stressful and as the crew is shifted through more managerial hands management becomes less empathetic. This is a food service job where you should not expect much personal growth after a certain point. it plateaus leaving a certain air of neglect if you are not the mold to move on into management."
good,I would classify this company as an unhealthy culture. The way that it's managed fosters competitiveness and gossip among teammates.. The new CEO does not seem to really care about Chipotle or its corporate employees.
good,"Chipotle was a perfect first job, fun, crazy, hard, outgoing,... however with nay first job, it doesn't stay that way, in fact it just gets old- FAST. Upon working there from 16 to 17 and now 18 yrs of age I see how much the team has changed and in effect how I have changed.  I'm still trying to figure out if the changed in me was for better or for worst though....."
good,"Days at work are very fun, very high volume and fast paced. pressure is key to getting through the day. just keep pushing. staff  is  very respectful and positive."
good,Chipotle was a decent job for a college student. I enjoyed working in a team oriented.  No benefits or paid time off.  unless you were going to be a manager at one of these locations not a long term job.
good,"At first, this company had a rich culture all around. Now they only care about numbers and don't even bat an eye to develop people as before. Sure there are a few stores that still have this old culture. But the new way of chipotle is not the same as it once was."
good,"Overall was disappointed in the management. They play a lot of favoritism, not very fair in hours, don't offer enough opportunity. Can be a fun workplace when the workers are friendly."
good,"Usually when I went to work after school, I diid get a nice welcome from all of my co-workers. they were nice to work with. Then I'd go into work and it was a nice and friendly environment, were we all got along. The customers were easy going and respectful. Over all great store."
good,"Chipotle Mexican grill is somewhere you can start off and it will teach you how to handle high stress, fast paced work days. It taught me how to be more social and it helped me become more of a quick minded person. They do not promote the right people, being that I worked there for three years and still remained a crew member while picking up the slack for that wjole store. I would not recommend this job unless you need to it open up and be more social and fast paced."
good,"Typical day at work starts off with preparing and making food for the day. With salsa/ tortilla, you make the food then do a bit of cleaning work. Time was always tight since it was a busy college town and often coworkers called out due to educational, or ""sickness"". We were very often short staffed, but management did their best to let us off with circumstances such as school and travel. Due to the nature of college town it was always extremely busy and exhausting. "
good,"I started working at Chipotle during the summer. Once school started in the fall, I had less availability and my management seemed to disregard my availability more than a few times. It wasn't very hard work, but it was physically tiring."
good,The chipotle i worked for had a management change and everything became completely unorganized and the new gm was more on the lazy side of things he didn't really do much to keep the store running and w ran out of ingredients very often since he got there. the hardest part of this job was the management they always looked at the negatives in an employee and pointed them out in front of other employees. the managers even among themselves had troubles trying to get each other fired. I loved my benefits i loved that the job wasn't hard i been loved some of my coworkers but the management needed to be better than what it is which is what led me to leave.
good,"chipotle is a great place to work if your right our of highschool and are looking to get into a job that will take care of the bills you finally have to start paying for becuase your parents wont like your phone and your car. this job will not give you substantial pay in order to keep a roof over your head or take care of a child. tho the work place may be stressful, everyone works as a team to achieve one common goal and that is to make clean, healthy, good tasting food."
good,"As a high school student managing work and school was stressful. When I initially applied I applied as a part time worker. When the schedule came out I was assigned to work 36 hours my first week keep in mind I was only applying as a part-time employee and I was 16 years old. Secondly I lived relatively far from the work site and often times I would rush to work immediately after school. The apprentices were not willing to comprise until I threaten to leave. Although the company culture promoted a sense of community and company pride, it seemed like they expected me to live and breathe Chipotle. As a current college student I always knew I wanted to be a designer. Retroactively thinking even as a high school student I knew what I wanted to become however my short tenure at Chipotle made it seem like I could have no other ambitions than remaining in the company. Secondly when it came to evaluations for becoming a restaurateur, I felt forced to ""love"" the company and portray an image that was completely false. Chipotle wasn't going to be my career however the managers made it seem that it was. Coworkers were amazing which made the environment more tolerable however the way management made it out to be at least for the younger employees, Chipotle had to be their career."
good,"I would notice that many of the times, people would pick and choose favorites to try and get on people's good sides. It was more of a hierarchy than teamwork, and it made the job twice as stressful."
good,The pay is not enough for the work load expected at any level. I started as a crew and am a Service Manager now. I am choosing to leave the company instead of moving up because I am very stressed out and can see that it will only get worse. We are required to work both day and night shifts every week as a manager which added to the stress is causing me a lot of health issues. I also do not like the direction the company is headed in regards to how they treat the employees. They are slowing removing benefits.
good,"This job can be a bit stressful if you're not used to working in a fast-paced environment. You will do a lot of cleaning, lifting and it will always stay busy."
good,"A typical day is cleaning and handling food. I learned if you work as a team it’s less drama and quicker. The management was terrible here, especially the general manager who doesn’t care about his employees and doesnt want them to succeed"
good,"They'll try to overwork you, make you do many, many things in a very short amount of time. they'll try and fire you if you don't meet their ridiculous standards"
good,Pay is above average for entry level food jobs but there was not really good for advancement or a longtime future career. you can get assistance with college and health benefits are minimal unless you are full time.
good,It's an overall stressful kitchen and customer service based job. It is heavily in favor of pertaining to the needs of the customer no matter how rude or inappropriate they can be.
good,I was closing cashier at Chipotle so a typical day at work for me was to make sure customers were happy as they were leaving and during closing time I had to clean the seating area and restrooms of the restaurant.
good,"Regardless of your position you will be constantly working, constantly moving.  You are expected to have great vustomer service, cooperate with your team, and serve presentable bowls in a very quick manner."
good,"The work environment at Chipotle was enjoyable, until management was present. We were asked to work less but do more. Favoritism existed and hostility was towards employees who has personal life issues. Several people were fired without being informed whatsoever. It was very childish to do as a manager."
good,If you are looking to work part-time for a few years as a crew member during your college years this is a solid place to work. You can qualify for tuition reimbursement after a year of working there which is a great deal. Be weary of the high management turnover in stores and inept middle management that really just does not get what it takes to work in the store.
good,"busy, sometimes stressful, very productive and fast paced. the management was great, I learned how to prepare certain foods and how to communicate in a friendly way to customers under extreme pressure."
good,"This job is nice in flexibility, however, everyone gossiped. Free food and cool staff. You had to fight for hours though. Customers complained, but who doesn't?"
good,Treated you as a family. Good relationship between managers and crew. Fun environment. Motivation.they recognized your job. Help you to grow up. You have to have a lot of dedication to move to the next level.
good,It's a job that helps make you tougher and develops skill sets such as time management and maximizes efficiency. It is the type of job that helps you build yourself up to late on advance into another career.
good,"A typical day at my store was always crazy. The turnover rate is incredibly high, I had to train many new people myself when I did not have the qualifications to do so, and management changed a few times. Every shift was very fast paced and there is little to no chances to step away to get a drink or go to the bathroom if its not within your 30-minute break. You get one free meal during your shift, and 50% off when you're not working."
good,"One of the worst job experiences that I've experienced. Poor management and training. Workers are shown very little then expected to be great off the bat. Very little hours as a result of over-hiring. Employees get health care, dental, and free food benefits which is nice, but after working in the store, some of the food is much less appetizing. Acne breakouts are common among employees as well."
good,Managing was very poor. I loved the job but not managing. Loved working with my coworkers. Very nice and polite. I’ve learned to speak up and never let someone treat me differently.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,This is a fast paced job located at SDSU. I enjoy the job when there is something to do but if there isn't any customers then the time drags by slowly. It's not a bad job. I like that they feed us and we get discounts on the food.
good,"Very fast paced, extremely easy to move up in the company. However, if your management team is not up to par, you will not want to stay! Be prepared to work ridiculously long shifts, which is great if you can use the money, but also tiring. You also at times have to fight for your promotion, management will make you do a trainer's job on a crew member's salary if you allow them to."
good,"it was a cool fast paced work environment, i learned on how to keep your composure in a fast paced work environment, i didn't face to many challenges at the job"
good,This job isn't a good place to start off as a job for a mother and student. They don't work with your schedule. Horrible choices in managers. Hire whoever they want. Fire the ones that put in work.
good,I would recommend this work place for anyone who is looking for fast paced and steady work! They allow you to work overtime on certain days! It is also a very popular place to relax after a long hard day of work!
good,"people wont cover shifts and if they do will cancel"
good,"The store I was in differed from the others. In particular this store was very poor in management it was improperly designed for the volume of clients it received. However the culture that once stood in the beginning was unique and very well designed. My experiences are biased because of the management waves and cycles the high turnover rates and incompetence. In other stores they had everything right they this includes but is not limited to: ergonomics, culture, proper training, well staffed, competent managers."
good,I just wish they were a little more understanding of my availabilities when it came to my son and school. I gave my all to them as a company and in return they showed me that I was not valued as a top performing employee.
good,this company wants perfect people and unfortunately that don't exist they work the mess out there employees and they don't reward enough for all the hard work that is put into making this company flow
good,"Honestly depends on your gm, every location is different. Coworkers are always usually great. Stressful, fast paced environment. No breaks at times. Free meals."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle as a crew/TOS is started with preparation of bulk ingredients along with your crew. "
good,"A typical day at work consist of me taking orders from customers, prepping food items like marinating meat, chopping lemons, cooking meats, making salsas, and making chips for the customers. I also would work cashier when needed, and restocking items around the store for customers and for my co workers. The hardest part of my job was probably closing to clean everything up. The most enjoyable was probably interacting with customers."
good,Very hard to balance work and school schedules and had conflicts scheduling with managers. Environment was okay but there was no room for advancement.
good,I wish they treated people equally. They did a bad job at doing that. They also did a bad job at giving more hrs to people that really deserve and need it. But the managers there won't care about you until your really gone. Yeah he's a nice person and everything but bad working with him.
good,"A typical day at work started at 6 AM because we had to do food prep for the store to open at 10 AM.  Each person has one task and I had the task of making 4-5 boxes of avocados (about 50 in each box) into guacamole. I must say it really sucked. Then you would only get to go on break for the time that you finished before 10 AM. If you did not finish in time before 10 AM, which was pretty common, you did not get a break until the end of your shift."
good,This is a very demanding place to work at. the culture is very team oriented and there is always something new to do or learn. The hardest part of the job is making sure that the group of people you manage are all doing their job right and teaching them what the right thing to do is when they are not.
good,my time working for chipotle was great at first after the first couple of months you realize there's a lot of favoritism certain people do less work than others some managers are bullies. other than that the benefits are great but not worth the stress the company puts on you with their constant change of procedures
good,management just really didn't care and they would always schedule me when I asked off for school. Sometimes was also left alone on the line when we would have a crowd which was stressful.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Store manager racist and unfair. He doesn't know how to talk to employees or customers. If you where Hispanic your job was safe. He fired people without telling them you fired. Employees found out when the schedule came out and they wasn't on it.
good,Harassment is not properly addressed at the work place and training is not adequately handled. Otherwise it is an amazing work opportunity and the work is very rewarding.
good,"The work was fine, it was fast-paced and didn't interfere with life."
good,It's a fast paced restaurant where as a manager you are required to deliver great food to the customers and lead a successful shift by empowering your crew members and making sure their stations are mise en place
good,"To be honest, I did not much enjoy my time as a crew member at Chipotle. Everyday the work was the same, and I did not feel there was much that I could learn that could be applied to another job that I would want to pursue."
good,The supervisor was terrible. She was very unprofessional. Not willing to help. She had favorites would only help certain people. Bad attitude. Very rude
good,"Workday started at 7am for morning shift because of morning prep. Night shift ended at 1am sometimes because of clean up. Most people would not be able to go home at the end of their shift because we had to wait for the night shift people to come.Management played favorites sometimes. Customers were always rude, but you keep your head down and keep moving. I did make a few decent relationships,mostly because of how crazy the environment was."
good,Set up tables that have been used by customers and rest them to be presentable. Prep and cook food for customers who make online orders. Serve numerous amounts of people on a food line by taking orders. Restock accessories that are running low or missing. Provide good customer service and welcome customers to the positive environment.
good,"Pay is on the higher side, however, managers are inconsiderate, work is extremely hard for the minimal pay.  Asked to stay late every shift. Drama filled."
good,It can be hardwork but sometimes management need help but overall its a good  productive work experience.. team does cooperate which is good and food and health purposes are kept to code
good,Everyone loves chipotle so there will always be a rush every shift. Working at the company isn't that bad I just wish there was paid vacation for any and every worker.
good,"Very much a ready, fire, aim type of company. Certain leaders only care about what you have done for them today.  This creates a constant sense of fear that any mistake could be your last."
good,The work atmosphere was very fun and energetic. The time went fast and there was always something to do. There was pros and cons to being managed by your peers.Not being under a microscope but still having expectation and requirement to get he job done was a positive. But management was not always reliable when it came to getting the job done and being there to lead the team.
good,"Chipotle was a great job for me, especially since I love a fast paced job, but after the first year, things dramatically changed when we got a new GM who was not very into communicating with others and very big on racism/discrimination."
good,"Felt like Slavery.. HIgh work load and stagnation. Customers are rude. The employees are Very Fake and dishonest.. They used chemicals to clean dishes , eww."
good,"Filling out the prep sheet and deployment chart so employees know what needs to be prepped and how much as well as time requirements."
good,"Chipotle is a fast growing company in the food industry that provides opportunities to all walks of life. Having worked at 6 of their stores both on management and crew level, I have come to the conclusion that your experience at this company will all depend on your General Manager and Management Team. Though Chipotle has high standards when it comes to food quality, moving up in the company is not as simple as doing your job well. You will have to be liked by your upper management and find yourself in the right circumstance where management spots are even available. Despite the fact that Chipotle advertises promotions through hard work."
good,"Fun work environment, but can be stressful depending on management. Hardest part of the job is having to keep a positive attitude even though it's nearly impossible."
good,"the job was great for honing knife skills, and sanitation procedures. were it was lacking would be management, and training. often id run into an issue were i would be told to do a task multiple different ways, by different managers. all of whom would inform me that their way was how Chipotle wanted it."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I did not work here for long, management is not very good and very unorganized. Co workers are very friendly though, when i got hired everyone introduced themselves to me and applauded me."
good,Chipotle Mexican Grill is an amazing company to work for as it provides benefits and decent pay.  The work is hard and strenuous though for the minimal pay but the environment is amazing.
good,You get over worked and are required to perform at a high mental and physical way. No opportunity to have a social life outside of work. The people you work with are pretty amazing and you form life long bonds.
good,Working here was about what anyone would expect to get from working at a large fast food chain. My experience was brief as I began school a few months after beginning but still an overall positive time.
good,I was a cashier/crew member. I would come to work and look on the prep deployment sheet and see what I have to do for the day. I learned more about communication. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers.
good,"open up the store up, meaning prepping all the food for the day, helping others and assisting customers. "
good,"It was an good experience in fast food Mexican Restaurant. The training I received at Chipotle was not handled in a professional manner. The starting pay was 8.25 an hour for a manager trainee. It was fun place to work, I sharpened my knife skills while I was there. All ingredients are hand cut. It was my first experience in fast food.The culture was great and their devotion to quality, local ingredients was excellent."
good,Didnt Like It at all & Had Too Quick Because Of A Family Emergency . I do not recommend this job . It was really good structure but they are not nice and niether are they friendly.
good,Provides a good work environment with high standards but does not pay enough for the required amount of work to be done. Best part of the job is free food. Worst part if the job is the compensation.
good,This company fails to comply with employees schedules and don't manage to send the schedule out on time. I was only receiving less than 20 hours a week and would be called in an hour before work to show up
good,I don't recommend it. I had to work off clock in the morning in order to barely finish prepping for the day. A lot of the workers did this. I do not recommend working here.
good,I learned a lot but in the end of the day i never had someone to cover for me I would always cover for them. But I loved the fact that I would always see the same customers and know there orders right away.
good,To make sure that all chicken and stake was ready.make sure that innovatory was all straight and up to date.made sure that all training employees had a back around on what to do to make sure that they had everything they needed in order for everyone to have a good smooth day.
good,Fun working environment. Awesome food! You gain great cooking techniques and learn how to prepare save delicious food . You become part of changing how people view fast food.
good,Management is very poor. They have obvious favorites and will fire randomly without notice.  Very fast paced be prepared to walk a lot.
good,"Management is harsh and the employees were overworked due to understaffing, at least at the location where I was employed. There is a lot of opportunity to move up and they also provide benefits to anyone who can manage to get full-time hours, but overall the pay doesn't seem worth the workload."
good,"A very friendly place to work. Very good customer service, Management if very assertive and and it is a very well maintained place to work. Wonderful place to work will lots of amazing benefits and very great place to work for if your in school."
good,"Everyday was pretty much the same and fast-paced. The team had to be on top of everything in order for the day to go smoothly otherwise something would have gone wrong, since this location was the busiest in the area. Management tried to motivate us, but they should've tried other methods as well. I learned that it can be difficult to communicate with coworkers of other cultural backgrounds, but is very much needed for a restaurant to function properly."
good,"At Chipotle, you should expect a crowd. You must move with a sense of urgency/be an excellent multi-tasker, or you need not apply. Be prepared to work your tail off because people will call off minutes before their due to work. You do the same thing everyday: prepare food to serve to customers.Sooner than later, with precision you will able to do the job with your eyes closed and move with increased speed. The pay is steady and they are flexible with life matters that arise. Prospective employees must be able to take constructing feedback with professionalism and be eager to implement changes accordingly. One thing is for sure, there is never a dull moment working at Chipotle."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,to be entirely fair i loved the job and the staff was amazing but in my experience they have a trend to take advantage of you at time. this is not to say all branches do that but this particular branch did.
good,"good hours but will work you if they are understaffed, which is most of the time.  $11/hour was the pay rate. advancement is likely if you work hard enough."
good,"Typical workdays were great, fun, and upbeat. Management,on the other hand, was lazy or unavailable. Managers would not show up to work or call in ""sick"". Coworkers were lazy, rude, and pessimistic."
good,"I worked at Chipotle for nearly a year, I was a kitchen manager in training before I resign. Chipotle is very demanding job it can be fun when good management and proper training is in place but when not  no brakes, people over work, stress, food poisoning and even graves injuries can occur. If  you work handling food then you have to be cautious, before working in the kitchen people need to be train properly. when i used to work at chipotle there used to be a lot of call out and we could never find replacement do to the  lack of workers."
good,"Company has great values, principles and overall culture. Unfortunately, management chain  had trouble establishing said culture to achieve successful daily operations."
good,"Busy, very fast paced, management unprofessional, co-workers at times did not show up to work, employees were under appreciated and not heard"
good,"Made sure trained their employees, gave motivational pep talk  when needed. It eventually died down, not much progress occurred when it came to help uplifting their employees and helping them get promoted to higher ranks."
good,although I don't work there anymore I can say that this working place was a learning experience for because I learned how to be a leader how to hold myself accountable. I leaned a lot of cooking skills.
good,"For a typical day I would go in at 11 o'clock in the morning and help with lunch rush.  Then I would help get the dinner rush items in place and ready(Mis en plas). I would then wash dishes for most of the morning and then for the dinner rush at six o'clock, would be expo for the cashier or I would be in the lobby and not allowed any where else. Management was nice and helpful on some days; but most days they were rude and disrespectful. The co- workers were very nice and polite and caring.  It was like with crew members we were all a family, but then the managers were like a different family.  It was almost like a clash between the two groups.  The hardest part of the job was doing dishes for four hours straight because we are that busy, or working 9 hour shifts and only being able to have one free meal.  I mean in nine hours, you should be able to have maybe a snack taco like chicken and sour cream like two maybe throughout the shift because when you came in is when you ate.  The most enjoyable part of the job was serving some of the broncos players or working with some of the nicest people I've met."
good,"A typical day at this workplace was often a stressful one. However, I don't consider the stress to come from the Day Shifts. We were understandably busy due to the fact that we were located at the center of 4-5 Educational Institutions. The stress came mostly during the Night Shifts, where the help of management was even more crucial in order to close on time. The fact that we had multiple managers fired or quit within the timespan of a few months is not the most encouraging one. The other crew members that weren't fired ended up quitting as well. By the time that I left, almost the entire crew that I had first met when starting my job had left and been replaced with new hires. The only part that I enjoyed was being able to talk to/develop relationships with certain other crew members. I will say that the stress of having to perform at an unrealistic level did help me improve my own ability and work ethic as an employee. In the end, despite the decent benefits that are offered at this job, I will not say that the pay was worth the lack of organization and leadership at the Chipotle store that I worked."
good,Every day was different you never knew what to expect but saying that management was never able to handle a shift successfully the entire time i worked there. They relied a lot on their older employees to take care of situations and would sit in the office with the door locked to avoid the problems they needed to handle. Not to mention the management would promise many people the same position for advancement without having an actual say who would get it and would just drag people along until they would finally quit or transfer
good,The idea for the vision of what Chipotle should be and should represent was clear and showed in all of the employees. It is a well run company just not much growing room for me.
good,"Unfortunately, this location is one that has potential to do well however, there are just people who lack the skill to bring the store to a minimum functioning level."
good,"scheduling was not consistent. every week was a different schedule and it was usually based on who the managers felt like dealing with, i got my required hours but if i needed a day off they would lessen my hours because of that."
good,Large group of team members provides a positive family environment and creates a sense of community. Training is detailed and managers provide one on one discussions to monitor progress and receive feedback on how to be a better store. Very progressive ideas.
good,"Overall the Chipotle I worked with was an ok place. I love the food, the atmosphere, and the customers. I enjoyed seeing new faces and daily reoccurring faces! Getting to know the customers and being as much assistance as needed. The downside was actually me crew, the members I worked with. The girl that actually trained me stole money from me, some other employee gossip about me. Don't get me wrong there were some great employees too, just the majority wasn't so great."
good,"I worked at a very busy store before the weird e.coli outbreak, my managers were in their early to mid 20's. Coworkers were still in high school (I was the only one college educated) during the summer time the rush is non stop from the afternoon even until after you close. I learned nothing from this job besides people are always watching you. My whole team sucked, all on hardcore drugs except the GM and were always high coming to work. Hardest part of working here is trying to keep your cool during the rush, especially in front of managers..or visitors from corporate.The most enjoyable part of working here would be clocking out with chipotle for dinner if you weren't already sick of eating it during your break."
good,Management did not live up to the culture that they were supposed to live up to. I loved what the company is based but i n that store management things that they did not live up to they just did their on thing and that store has lost  what the Chipotle way is.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Working here has taught me life lessons. Dealing with a wide variety of people wit inconsistent work ethics was challenging. Yet I over came it. I've worked for them for a little over two years. I wouldn't change a thing about it but I wouldn't dare go back.
good,"Fun place to work management live up to there standards."
good,"A job where everything but the job is frustrating. The basic work is easy, reliable restaurant work, but being constantly asked to hop off my station to help someone else in need makes it feel like managers were less willing to train people to be good, and more expect the other crew members to fix the current problem. Constantly promised things like paid vacation after a year, sick days and other things to find that they couldn't be claimed after staying for the allotted time was another big issue."
good,"The job is likable, but the hardest part is dealing with rude customers or having a member of management critisizing you about going too slow or fast, or talking too loud or too soft. Other than that i liked working there."
good,You work as a team and just have fun for the day. Its easy very fun and going environment. Its very hands on and you can cross train in all most everything. Fast pace but you get to meet new people and enjoy what you do.
good,"My typical day at work was either working the line in Tort. 1 or frying chips from scratch. Management was okay. My co workers and were cordial but I didn't really ""fit in"". I really didn't enjoy anything about working for Chipotle but that was my first real job I had since 2012 so I made it work. The hardest part of my job was communication between the co workers and I, and lunch rush hour."
good,Everything had a set routine and was organied. The work itself was not hard. The only part that was hard about the job is the lack of team work and communication.
good,"Organize everything to start my food preparation assigned in advance. Finish everything before 10:30 am in order to get my 30 minutes break before we open the store."
good,"Pretty cool place to work, it can get crazy at times but if you have a good team that day to can go by fairly quick. At times the dining room can get really messy just cause it'll be short staffed that day and not enough people to keep it clean. Overtime was cool but by the week of the week you'd be so tired and burn out. Management was pretty chill at my store, as long as you did what you had to do they pretty much let you be."
good,"chipotle homewood is the most stressful place to work."
good,"It is indeed a very fun place to learn from front of the house being on cashier to back of the house doing prep. Having time expectations at Chipotle is a smart idea to set the employees some goals when working there. An employee needs to be empowered and deliver high standards to their co-workers and guest daily. Employees have to elevate and make sure everyone is on the right path is part of being a top performer, a top performer is someone who has the effort, ability, and desire to make the people around them better for the best of the restaurant culture and our customers."
good,"Chipotle prides itself on running semi-democratically. However if your team is a bunch of sociopaths who don't understand the value of teamwork, they will throw you under the bus at a moments notice and you will lose your job quicker than you may have started."
good,"Had a terrible work experience at this job."
good,"Chipotle is all about the Culture of the company, and is all about their employees, but as soon as you get settled into the job, you realize that it was a selling pitch, but it really isn't true. The particular Chipotle that I work at is very click-ish. It's really divided between the favorites and the non-favorites. Our assistant manager consistently walks around and rants about how much we suck.. Which is a real great feeling..... I don't think all the Chipotle's are like this. I think that some of them really do fallow their Culture and are better, but at this one everything is just in shambles. The training is terrible. To work at Chipotle you have to be good a being criticized, and learn from each other, but at this store, all the do is criticize and when you actually do something right for once it doesn't even matter! Cause no one cares if its right, only when its wrong."
good,"There are many things I've learned working in chipotle, I think it has made me a better person, and how to give excellent customer service."
good,"Typical day, I would go there at 4 and close at 10. I usually would not leave until about 12am."
good,"Basic management duties. "
good,"Chipotle definitely wasn't a bad place to work I just feel the store I was at needed a lot more help than we realized. You were basically given a position to work when you first get there, and unless you request to learn something else or take the initiative to learn something on your own you're pretty much stuck there day in and day out. I did grill for about 4 months straight and cutting that much food all day really does a number on your wrist. Its extremely busy pretty much a 12 hour rush, there is always a person in line from open to close and in the summer the store feels like a sauna. My favorite thing I learned in the store was the prep task. I very much enjoyed learning about all the cut sizes and how to become consistent and fast at all of them"
good,"prep early morning chopping, mixing, cutting, dicing, frying  and cleaning with great time management skills. Be prepared for lunch rush no moving from your spot 2-3 hrs.of scooping, spreading, folding , tossing and raping burritos."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"A typical day at Chiptole was very hectic. The hours were long and sometimes quite draining. However as always, it was a learning experience and made me grateful for everything I have. The most difficult part of the job was working with some inappropriate managers. The most enjoyable part about working there was the free meals employees get while on the clock."
good,"Great Business, I learned how to make some of the products offered at Chipotle Mexican Grill, I also Learned how to work in  fast paced environment. You have to treat the customers with respect. The hardest part of my job was leaving near midnight, i was exhausted. I love the food. Working here i now have great customer service skills."
good,"it is hard to advance in chipotle, but they have no problem in having you train new employees when your not equipped to do so"
good,"A typical day at work encompasses restocking supplies such as food, bowls and clean utensils for serving customers as well as kitchen utensils such as napkins, straws, plastic forks, etc. We serve customers on a line where they customize what they want in their salads, burritos, and bowls. I was majorly a cashier that worked the closing shift. After the store was closed, I would clean the bathrooms, mop the floors, and clean the tables and stocking stations, as well as the soda station. I learned how to work quickly and efficiently. I also learned how to work amongst co workers to optimize our customer output. My co-workers I got along with really well because we knew we had to work together as a team to move the line. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers and preparing food. The hardest part of the job was when you are a cashier and the line is backed up because there was a hold up in the line, but the station needs to be restocked for forks and napkins."
good,"I had an amazing team of people whom I worked with which caused the smooth flow of the store. We constantly had aces in their places and efficient communication on the line. I was the one that everyone knew would get things done. The hardest part of the job was when the management contradicted each other, making it hard to follow proper procedure. I trained new crew members and they ended up being just as good as me on the line or even better."
good,"Chipotle was a fun place to work at but there were a lot of days I wished I never worked there. My managers were not nice about a sick day or vacations. One of my co-workers' was pregnant and could not get a day off to go to the doctors. On the plus side, I did learn a lot of cooking skills which was what I liked most about Chipotle. And the hardest part of this job was just having the strength to go into work. Mostly because the people there made it hard to enjoy."
good,"There is a lot of rascism that went on at my restaurant."
good,"Worked at Chipotle for 6 months. Was promised at time of hire"
good,"overall a very fun place to work, opportunity for advancement. there is no job security and depending on how busy your store is depends your work/life balance."
good,"Although there is plenty of room for growth, the company is not in the business of giving people chances to correct their mistakes. You mess up once and you're gone."
good,Hardest part is dealing with the rude customers but that is typical and ever where. Co workers nice.
good,i learned how to make food and how to use different cooking materials
good,"Chipotle is a surprisingly professional place to work. Mornings start early at 8 am because there is a ton of daily prep work. Coworkers at this location were all outgoing and nice people, most are students though some are a little older and just live in the area. Long shifts can be a pro and a con, overall this is a great place for someone who can go to work and not feel the need to carry on conversations with their coworkers/managers throughout the day."
good,i loved this job when i first started but then i soon grew to hate it because i figured out how they really were they would make us like to corporate. the 2 main managers were sisters and the kitchen manager is screwing one of them. they are so unfair and fire people without giving a proper reason  
good,"Each store is run mostly by the General Manager who is pretty much the acting ""owner."""
good,"Its a good place to work for if you like to work fast. Good enviorment, friendly staff. management needs some work, but its coming together. co-workers are great."
good,"A typical work day was preparing the the food and cleaning the kitchen, from top to bottom. I learned how to prep food in a timely manner. Management varied from person to person, but co-workers were enjoyable to be around. The hardest part of the job was the clean up, it would take hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interesting people i was able to mee."
good,"Fun, fast paced environment where you deal with hundreds of customers a day."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Typical day started out by getting food prep work done and coaching and motivating the crew before opening. Once we were open it was a rush for the entire day.
good,"A typical day was non stop business for a cook and the out times varied based upon how busy the store was when you are scheduled to leave. I learned some good recipies and how to utilized some cool cooking equipment. The people were easy to get along with, but in my personal experience the managers were not very good with concealing their emotions when they got stressed and such. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to eat anything from the menu for luch once a day. It did get old very quickly for me, but when you don't have a job you can't really be that picky. I thought the managements that ran my restaurant was garbage, but that's just my opinion, (too long to explain all details) basically lack of professionalism and sincerity. Could be a good job for people who really want to excel in the restaurant industry, but I did not want to from the beginning because of the many inconsistancies and frustrations each day."
good,chipotle was a okay job its just alot of work and not enough pay. i believe if we had a better manager then things could be better but i feel she was laxy and only cared when she had to.
good,"The location I worked at for seven months was definitely a weird one, personally after seeing several people leave and enter I realized that a big part of this was management, the way they trained people was terrible and they were losing a lot of strong workers because of this. The pay wasn’t equal at all I was making more than grill people, and new workers were making more than me . All in all definitely not the best but I’m grateful for the opportunity if gave me"
good,"Very hostile environment. Cannot go to management with out being judged or it reflecting in your hours.Very fast paced a lot of the times. However, help isn't really given."
good,"I worked at chipotle for a very long time. The employees treated me well and we were like a family. The reason I quit was due to the lack of understanding of my personal issues. For example, I was belittled for taking time off due to the death of my grandfather. Everyone there was super fun to work with, but management didnt prioritize mental health."
good,This was a good experience for me to see what my limits are when it comes to how constant the work flow is and how hard it hits. Overall wasn't a good match do to scheduling and wanting to broaden my work experience in general.
good,I have had good times and bad times. Very labor intensive and I feel the employees should get paid a lot more. Corporate is trash and only cares about money and not the employees. A lot of call outs so I was stuck doing EVERYTHING (a lot of late nights (past 12am)). They don't allow enough employees on shift and send employees home early to save hours almost every shift. You may see some roaches or mice. yikes! On the bright side I met the love of my life and so many amazing friends that I will have for life!
good,"I think this is a great starter job. I learned a lot about the flow of food on a line and how to manage large groups of people so they flowed through. But it's not a great full-time job. They can be stingy on hours so you have to pester the managers. Honestly, talk to the employees before you accept the job. Ask to be honest and speak to more than one so you have idea of what the dynamis is like. I left for family reasons but i would've stayed longer if those reasons had not come up."
good,"A typical day at work could range from anywhere to happy customers, and then could change in a flash. Being yourself to change the customer's opinion for the better is a goal that everyone should have in Chipotle."
good,the job is easy but tedious and the amount of work they were required to do isn't really worth the pay and that's why I think it's only good as a first job and nothing else
good,"Decent company to work for. They say they want to train you but really don't. I ran 3 different stores after General Managers got fired and proved I was able to do it, still no promotions. Went elsewhere."
good,"After working in front of the grill every day, my face broke out so much. Expect working late and then having to come back in the morning the next day."
good,It’s a job that will get you payed for the work you do. There’s nothing special about the job. Managers are good. Job gets monotonous over time. It is exciting in the beginning.
good,"I had a blast in my time at Chipotle, I learned so many new skills that I can now take with me to different facets of my life. I think anyone looking for a first job or just looking for a way into the food industry should definitely apply. My time with my store came to a close because of discrepancies with management."
good,"My hours keep getting shorter each schedule, then the number of days kept decreasing without explain stions.. I was able to start keeping up and getting chips fried in the 2 1/2 I was told was time efficient."
good,I worked here for about 6 months before getting another job offer. It was fun in the beginning but then they hired people who put people down/ made fun of workers and it killed it for me. Management wouldn't really do anything about it either. But you get free chipotle.
good,"At least when I worked at Chipotle, there was very little concern given to the availability schedule. I was brought on as a part-time employee, and gave the management my class schedule and when I had study times blocked out. They agreed to this at my hiring, but a couple months in started scheduling me when I was in class, or expected me to be at work literally the second class ended. They also scheduled my for 20 hours in a week that I told them during the interview I would be out of town for, and got mad at me when I wasn't able to make those shifts."
good,a lot of work was put on us with. to many crew members and little pay. got worn out. management was great when first started because they cared about their employees but new management was horrible
good,I had a good experience working with Chipotle my trainers was great and taught me what I needed to know to get the job done. They take their time with employees to make sure they receive the proper training  needed to be great at the restaurant.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Everyone flirted and played around all day. The ones who were all on thr female managers bodies got the best treatment. Too much lying and politics. Food was great though!!
good,"My own General manager outright called me a liar for requesting a day off, but I verbally told him and another manager that I needed a specific days off."
good,This is where i did learn most of the stuff in the kitchen which is why it was intriguing at first learning everything. But the management really drove the motivation into the ground by abusing the good workers.
good,The hours are flexible but it’s not a forever career. It’s good if you’re going to school and need some extra cash. That’s about it. Management needs some work.
good,"Chipotle is an okay job, its nothing that is hard to do but it is extremely repetitive and gets quite boring.  Upper management likes to act as if they are listening to your feedback but often go in a completely different direction.  Overall the environment is okay, its nothing special."
good,"Management is horrible. They have so many rules it’s impossible to follow what they want bc it makes no sense, they’re ridiculous. They don’t take you into consideration"
good,"I really felt like some employees didn't like me because I was so energized at work. Maybe that was the case, maybe it wasn't, but there was some hostility. The managers were extremely nice to my face, but I couldn't tell if they really liked me. I was never formally fired, but received an automatic exit survey email. No one ever told me why I was being fired."
good,"This job is a lot of work, especially when we close. We run out of food just about every other day and the workers are the ones who have to tell the customers and deal with their disrespect. The job is also not considerate of our lives and understaffed."
good,"I did not enjoy my professional experience at Chipotle Corporate. I loved so many of the people and the camaraderie and activities. They pride themselves on hiring culture fits over skill or experience, which sounds great but is terrible in execution. I applied for one role and ended up doing something completely different. My manager was promoted from within and was not trained in management skills and was completely unprofessional so it was a chaotic and stressful time for the team and my entire time at the company. I left because I was extremely interested in continuing to grow my skills and was not provided that opportunity, in fact I felt stifled and discriminated against because of my ambitions. "
good,"I really liked working there, it was a great learning experience. For me i would just say they need better management for the time being but it’s a great place to have your first job at."
good,Very faced paced work environment being close to a college campus. Good management as far as I could see. Left due to relocation and better opportunites.
good,"working at chipotle was okay, there were obvious favorites being played between management and crew. weird break schedule (i would get sent on break 7 minutes after arriving just to finish a 6.30 hour shift with no break)"
good,Chipotle was my first job and it was a very great job to have the pay was good my managers at the start were very understanding you got free food on your shifts only an hour break but Chipotle remains very busy so they need all the help they can get. I worked on the line for closing shift. my coworkers were very nice we cared about each other and always helped each other out if we saw someone needed a minute when management changed that’s when i decided it would be best for me to make my exit I was going through a situation that made it a little bit more difficult to me to work the long hard hours and my manager did not acknowledge that or respect me so I ended up leaving
good,Been working with the company for 5 year and i love it. I enjoy working the my crew and love seeing my customers. I've been  a manager for over two years now and i wouldn't.
good,This is a really great job dont matter about age ..its a fast pace job but its also fun .. Great group of people to work with .they also have great benefits
good,Can be stressful if your not used to fast paced environment. Most of management is good except the actual boss. Hours get cut often due to corporate culture.
good,"Chipotle is great, but you have to be fast paced and be very friendly. There's no such thing as I'm having a bad day, at Chipotle they treat their employees as if they are the face of the company, which they are. Management was horrible, schedule was different every week, people always calling in, and managers were rude."
good,It was a very demanding job. Being the only service manager with a must-open availability made me have no life outside of chipotle but the pay was well so It's a good place to move up. The true reason i stayed for about 2 years was because i had a very emotional attatchment to the building and the people i met were very wholesome.It was a crazy high turnover rate constantly but I had to pull the team through.
good,hard job that time consuming. the hardest part of the job is dealing with upper management once food safety comes around. you have a chance to get a raise once a year.
good,The company overall has a good concept of what it wants to be. Great for teens or young adults in between jobs. Easy to move up if you apply yourself. Definitely somewhere you can build a career. Turn over rate is high. Chipotle is only for unique individuals. Pay is supposed to start off at 9.50. I even worked for the company and made it to management and they only offered 10. The second time. I won’t ever return
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Productive, fast pace, fun workplace.... Lots of cleaning throughout the day and night.. You meet a lot of new people every day and every night shift."
good,I worked at Chipotle on and off for a few years. I worked in on of the busiest location in Arizona. It was always busy with lines out the door. Due to how crazy busy it was it was hard to every move up to different positions and become a manager. I was always stuck training and working the front of the house because we needed effective people on the line to serve and make the lines move faster. The culture is awesome and the standards for food and cleanliness are very high.
good,"Chipotle was a good place to work with decent pay and the option of upward mobility if you are focused in this type of work. I was only a line worker and can't attest to any of the going ons of managers and assistant managers. I would come into work, help prep the food for the day and then start serving customers on the typical day."
good,"The location I worked at was very busy! People were coming in from Central Oregon, from Mt. Hood, the businesses around us, and students. It's rare for it to be dead, customers are always consistent! I enjoyed working with my coworkers, everyday was fun and manageable with them there. We are always doing our best to multitask with cleaning our stations, helping customers and restocking. Although we do get our occasional customer who is never happy with what we do. They try to make their experience extremely difficult by not allowing us to help them to the best of our abilities... customers are always right though, huh?"
good,When I worked there the hours were given to the managers favorites/friends. That is not the professional way of any job. There is a new manager at this one now so its a little better I heard but its choice good luck.
good,"I worked at chipotle for 10 months, through my senior year of high school.  As a line worker, it’s very stressful at times, and they expect you to do a lot with not much help. Closing is a lot as well, especially if you work at a chipotle which closes at 11 instead of 10. There is always too much to get done. the customers can be so rude but others make the job worthwhile. I rate my experience overall higher because of my amazing coworkers but if you do not have nice coworkers the job will another have redeeming qualities"
good,It’s run like a prison very strict. Can’t lift the knife off the cutting board. So prep take twice as long. Even tho you wear cut gloves. They are on you from the time you get and criticize you all the time when you make small mistakes.
good,"While working at chipotle we always ran out of something, we didn't get very many breaks, management shows favoritism, because there were a lot of high schoolers there was a lot of playing going on and not enough enthusiasm and not enjoyable."
good,"ok for part-time. Not a career choice. you meet cool people but very ""eh"" place to work for. management was pretty laid back but still would make sure things got done and your job was done correctly."
good,"I feel like we are always in competition to see who can get on the managers side more. If you do not know a certain role and ask, employees tend to make fun of you."
good,"Everyone told the manager we needed more workers. i had to do all the cleaning and was expected to get a days worth of dishes done in an hour. left 2 hours after my shift ended then told to close anyway for another 2 hours. couldnt go to doctor appointments after work, only day off was saturday because they were closed. too understaffed to have any other day off."
good,Working at chipotle was very awkward at first but that’s at any new job. It was a fast paced work place when busy but very relaxing when slow. I had fun some days and didn’t like it others. The job was a interesting experience. Just be ready for heat and very specific/difficult customers.
good,"As a seriously and is busy with their life, let's job piles on top of those burdens, alongside the fact that the work and life balance was not very good. There was not enough free time and my job put on too much stress for me. People were nice and it was great time free food. It is good for a first second job or a temporary job."
good,The team is filled with many interesting characters who make the shifts fun and easy but can be very stressful and demanding also. you need to be able to keep up or you will fall through the cracks.
good,"I worked a lot for 11.5/hr and felt like I really didn’t make much money. Especially not for the level of effort that went into the work that I had done. Overall it was a great experience, I learned a lot and met great people!"
good,"I don't feel that I was properly trained, and was expected to know a lot more than I was taught. I was unexpectedly let go, no warning or corrections as to what I was doing wrong, if I was even doing anything wrong. I suspect it was due to the hours having to be cut, and the company needed to downsize. Coworkers were friendly for the most part, but the environment at times was tense. It was very fast paced. Paid breaks and free employee meals were a plus. Overall not the best place to work, but not the worst either."
good,A very busy working place regardless of your position. Super heavy working experience with people who need their food in fast amounts of time. Have to have strong spine for rude people and the stress of management.
good,To many changes all the time management poor no proper training low pay high turnover very unorganized not enough hours mean and negative hostal environment
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Hardest part- always shortstaffed and looking for  help"
good,"Working there was great but the problems I had were the staff members treating you really bad. I would come home crying almost everyday. The managers were no where to found and if they were found they were conversing with other staff (which they would be their favorite. Half of the employees spoke Spanish which was no problem at all, it was the ones who barely spoke English that were messing up the things on the line and get upset with you like you're the one that did it. The place was very unorganized. We would run out of food and have to wait because they didn't have it. More importantly some of the other staff members would get nasty and tell me to do one thing and then five other people are telling me to do something different. I did not feel welcomed at all and they go through staff like a sick person using tissue. I called out because I was really sick and I called the store 6 times and emailed someone saying I wasn’t showing up. The day I decided I wasn’t working there anymore she told me that I never called to say I wasn’t coming, I told her I called at 6 am because someone was scheduled to be there and she said they don’t start work until 7 am. That’s not what it said on the schedule. I would have to wait a day before the new week started to get my schedule. I would call the store 4-5 times asking for it before someone decided to give it to me When I told the manager my reasons for leaving, she responds with I should have told her earlier which would have created more problems with the others."
good,"Hard to achieve goals with the company when management doesnt hire the right people. Hard to get people to buy into the systems in place, but when it does happen its truly unique and special."
good,"I had no support from my Field Leader or Team director to help my store or my team director, we were understaffed, yet they expected certain standards without realizing the severity of my situation or doing anything to help it."
good,"Everybody is friendly , takes care of eachother, always helping whenever needed, we bring cupcakes to celebrate people’s birthday it’s a really cool place to work in"
good,"Chipotle was a good start getting back into the workforce, was appreciative for the opportunity. Most of the crew were team players and there were issues with management showing favortism, otherwise a good place to work."
good,"Always busy, extra food safety steps, this is a hard job. Definitely not for anyone who doesn't plan on working hard whenever they come to work. Upper management can expect a lot out of crew and hourly managers."
good,"They never gave me hours and the manger never wanted to teach me anything. When i did come to work i did nothing but clean and help others, then i will get behind in my work"
good,"A typical day at Chipotle consisted of a fast paced environment and a friendly vibe. I learned many things such as some Spanish, I learned how to prepare food and what cleaning supplies do what. The hardest part of the job would... well there wasn't really anything that was difficult for me personally. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was the friendly vibe, everyone laughed it up but also took the job seriously when necessary."
good,A typical day at work required crisis management. There is a shortage of people to work and a lack of formal training to stop attrition. Staff is under prepared for peak due to the campus environment and flow.
good,"- The crew works together in a strong and efficient way each shift"
good,"Chipotle was okay, but the management and pay is horrible. It's not worth it. come in clock in, sign wellness check, get asked wellness question and go to station. managers send you on a 30 minute break where you eat free."
good,"Working there was excellent, however, a vision of a company must progress. Some of the regulations were abnormal but they grow on you. Overall staff was tight knit and we felt like a family."
good,The management at Chipotle was not the best considering that new managers were in and out on a monthly basis. There are lots of new management and it made the job a little harder than normal.
good,you get one little 30 min break no 15 min in between if you gotta go to the bathroom and we have 3 people in line forget it your gonna go in your pants. i would not recommend this job to anyone it was a huge mistake too work here and the company stock recently went down if you didn't notice so that is a sign also the management team is horrible they only care about themselves and not the well beaning of the crew. AGAIN I REPEAT DONT APPLY HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,"It was fun while it lasted kinda ,managers need to be more patient with new hires people make mistakes ...everyone deserves a second chance they need to remember how they were when they first got a job there"
good,"My experience wasn't the best at this certain location due to the fact that it was a brand new location in a VERY popular location. Not only was it my first 'official' job (which was difficult), but management was new too and they didn't adhere to certain things that needed to be done. Everyone was kind; even some customers, but that still couldn't shine a light bright enough to overshadow the downfalls. SPEED IS MANDATORY!!"
good,Good first job  I enjoyed my time there the manager was a little too much at times he did not care about my school he wouldn’t give me days off sometimes when I needed it even if I had a cover which was very odd to me I wouldn’t want to work there again
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Chipotle is always finding new ways to provide a safe and delicious service. It’s a fast paced environment and pushes you to get better. A crew member is also expected to know their role and basic principles of the company
good,"It's like everyone's first McDonalds job, but much much better, the food is better, the culture is better, and the pay is slightly better too, and you get free food."
good,"I became skilled at cutting vegetables and meat. The people who I worked with were fun and helpful. A great first job or part-time job for school. They also have a tuition reimbursement program. The job isn't fitting for someone who can't be on their feet 7+ hours a day, likes to to try creative solutions to improve processes (they're made by corporate and you are required to follow their approach), or wants to work at their own pace (this job can be very fast-paced)."
good,"Crazy and unrealistic standards. People promoted that shouldn't be. Company failing now because of being greedy, finally caught up with them. Would single people out."
good,"The hours can be tough, on a busy night I would sometimes not get home until 1 AM. This was not a deal-breaker in itself, rather the general manager was so bad at his job it put extra stress on all of his employees. GM's inability to retain new hires lead to a staff shortage that demanded more hours than I was willing to work because I was balancing work and school. If the GM is good at their job, Chipotle has potential to be a good place to work at. The benefits are good and there is opportunity for advancement."
good,"The work is fast-paced and difficult, but rewarding. The problem stems from upper management which cares very little for the actual in-store situation. Rarely did our Area Director or Regional Manager come by to check numbers or anything."
good,"The management was horrible and everything was unorganized and chaotic."
good,When at Chipotle to have a good day you must  have the right crew people working. The day will run by very smooth and easy. As long as you are working the day will just roll by.
good,"We always had to keep pace with the sudden surges of people, which isn't problematic at all. The common duties of the kitchen, such as cleaning dishes and cooking, as well as serving customers wasn't problematic either. However, management was somewhat in disarray. People were continuously being hired, even though there was a sufficient number of staff on the team."
good,Definitely one of the tougher jobs to start off with but you gain many applicable skills you need to grow in the future. I highly recommend to work at a Chipotle near you.
good,The crew is always on top and in tip top shape. Their energy is through the roof but the managers are very lazy and rude. To work here you have to have the mental stability or be a kiss up.
good,"I had managers who spent their shift talking about their workers and then smiling in their faces. Sometimes they would complain about someone doing something they've done before. Coworkers were the same way, those who felt above everyone."
good,"At Chipotle I learned a lot. I loved the job when I started because of the rush but being a student at the time required less time working. The general manager at the time found it difficult to be flexible with schedules which was included when I applied. I grew with my team and loved every second of working together. Unfortunately, the management at the time was very poor and about 70% of the staff quit because of it."
good,"Generally nice environment, isnt the best with management. Can be a bit over bearing for the amount you are paid. Alot of favouritism goes into play. which is annoying."
good,"great place to work if you want to advance, but the company has poor management and promotes with improper training. because of this the turnover rate is pretty high and its stressful working with new employees constantly. heavy cleaning. "
good,"If you are young its for you. If you been in the industry and want to work for accountable adults and shared responsibility among managers, this isnt the place."
good,The company's focus has always been about the customers experience but at the sacrifice of employees happiness. It was a fun place to work when I first started but as time went on the company just started to not show interest in keeping their employees happy. Underpaid with no benefits and sometimes hostile management. It was fun learning how to prep and cook food though.
good,"Definitely a place I would recommend to work at when you're young, good pay for a pretty easy job!"
good,chipotle is not that bad  of a place to work its juss im at the time in my life that i dont want to work with minor nor have 10 stripped off my work week because someone else has is off from school.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,This was a fun job for a college student but they promised advancements and I have watched many people who were hired in after me advance to management while I am still at the bottom of the ladder.
good,"I would only recommend to the lightest of heart with huge drive and ambition. Can be fun sometimes, but you must be on your A game at all times, smiling, moving, and interacting with people. I worked here for two years and always went to work with a smile on my face, willing to work hard and strive. I did my job, and I did it well, but was constantly pushed to move even faster, not complimented on my success, but everyone was quick to point out every little thing that I missed or did wrong. When I first started working here I loved the atmosphere and was promised quick advancement through the company. This is true, however managers are forced to do even more work for mere dollars added to their salary, and they also face corporate scrutiny. I loved the people I worked with, and free food every day was a plus, as well as insurance coverage and tuition reimbursement after a year, however the working environment is draining and stressful and the company will push you beyond human capabilities."
good,It was fun for a summer job but it was hard to get my hours adjusted when I went back to school like I was the only person that could do my job. They were inconsiderate of my home life but the food and pay was good.
good,"The jobs easy, pays better than a lot of fast food places, but often can be stressful and customers are fairly rude sometimes, also a lot of the other managers/workers I've come across have to be some of the laziest people I've met. Shouldn't expect any less from a fast food place but it gets irretating when you know what they're capable of and how easy the task are. Its not the worst job I've had but its definitely not the best, I don't see myself trying to work there again."
good,Very competitive work place. Managers seem to be more interested in how fast you could get a task done rather than how well the task is completed. Would not recommend if you don’t have tough skin.
good,"I worked here for over three years, and the only reason I stayed for as long as I did was because of the people I worked with. Chipotle has a great way of hiring really awesome people, however they do not care about their employees as much as they should. The amount of work expected of an employee is not equal to the amount that they pay you."
good,"working at chipotle is really a team workplace, if one mess up we all mess up. I've helped out alot of members,and a very fast learner. thats basically what I've learned working at chipotle."
good,"Chipotle is a very fast paced job, could get stressful at times, but could learn to manage it."
good,When I started chipotle it was a fast moving place I learned a lot there the people was nice some of the co workers were nice the hardest part of the job is you have to know a lot like temp food making sure its at the right temp and moving fast I enjoyed being there for the most part. I felt like the managers need to step up and run the restaurant more better not a lot of team players very poor communication skills
good,"Upper management is constantly being rotated. They don't care to guarantee you hours. Unless you're at a good location, this job is very stressful. I would not recommend this job."
good,"I worked really hard washing dishes, cleaning cooking and barely got a raise but had to be a top performer.Chipotle If you don't want to buy dish washers , at least pay the people that do more because the amount of dishes that comes out in stores that are busy is crazy!  No handbook can prepare you for the cuts and burning feeling of the dish soap. But Thank you for the employee meals ! if it wasn't for my coworkers I wouldn't survive  your buy one get one free dead deals."
good,Great place to work if you are looking for a full time job. Can be stressful but lots of room for advancement. There is a lot of chances to  move up for management and lots of incentive available!
good,"Make sure prep was done and that there’s enough for both shifts."
good,"A perfect job for those who are just starting work or are in need of a decent work environment. It's a pretty fast paced job during peak. But it's easy to learn, light labor, and not too difficult to understand."
good,"will teach you a lot about life skills and customer service was very fast paced, often meet rude customers, management is not the greatest, moving up takes forever sometimes"
good,"very busy restaurant. Competition for new positions. and plenty of mandatory hours for managers."
good,It was a lot of work for very little money but I loved all of my coworkers and management. They made it more enjoyable which is why I stayed longer than I intended
good,Can be very fun depending on the people you work with but sometimes managers and especially field leaders make it a stressful place to work with threats and unjust firings.
good,The job was very good. Great pay but not enough hours. I started off with 25 hours and everything was fine but the longer I worked there the more they hired and the less hours I got
good,"Usually there are alot of customers at any given time. Therefore, it is important to always be alert. Be sure to be good at multitasking because theres are alot of things to be done during and after resturant hours. It is doable if your co workers are fun to work with. All in all, the work experience isnt bad. Just be prepared."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"A typical day at chipotle for me was cashiering I was promoted to cashier after four moths of working there, My responsibilities were to ring out the customers at a fast past and serve to them whatever they needed. I also had to constantly check the dining room, sweep, wipe down tables, and check the ice in between customers. That was probably the most stressful part."
good,It was a great environment to work in when everyone was focused and determined to carry out a great shift. their is room for moving up depending on the severity of your work. Have great health benefits after the first 3 months of work.
good,"Working at Chipotle was a great experience because the people with whom you work with were understanding and worked as a group.  However, for the amount of work you have to do, the pay is not enough."
good,"My particular chipotle was busy 90 percent of the time but thats fine and we had a few good managers that made the shift run smoothley, for the most part. we had a few managers in the morning that would leave us with all of the dishes from the morning and they wouldnt even have any of the prep done except for the easy things. so they would have a great looking line but the rest of the house hadnt been taking care of. leaving the night crew to deal with picking up their slack that they didnt do while they snuck out without a word."
good,Fast paced work environment with long hours.  Great first job with plenty of opportunity to rise in the business. Stressful at times but nothing too unusual .
good,At Chipotle there was lots of work to do that was not worth getting paid minimum wage. The company expects too much for working at a minimum wage paying job.
good,"If you're able to keep the stress from following you home, the job isn't that bad. I was not able to do this, however. The culture is incredible, and is one of self-improvement. It is only healthy if everyone invests in that culture, however."
good,"Working at Chipotle was a character building experience that allowed me to practice my skills working in service but that could sometimes be difficult. My first day on the job, I wasn't told much more than to simply start, which pushed me to show initiative (which I appreciated) but which also left me in a precarious position occasionally as I seemed to be expected to know where everything was."
good,A typical day at work is great. All the crew members are on time everyone is in their places for when its time for peek hour. The store looks great and cleaned. I learned to always make sure i have enough crew members working and for them to know their positions for the day. As a manager you have to know how to run the shift and how to be ready for anything to happen. Like a big rush having enough food so costumers are not waiting for anything.The hardest part is not having enough people to work or not having the best person on grill. You have to makes sure you keep the flow going when it comes to running a shift. If people are late or the food delivery gets messed up it can effect the whole shift. The most enjoyable part is when it time to close up and clean. After completing the job and making sure everything is great for the next shift.
good,"Lacked knowledge to train new crew members, Lack of communication, Very judgmental, Management did not lead, Crew determined and driven, and unenjoyable work place"
good,"Typical Day depends on what position for example if I was grill I ensure the food was up to standards, make sure we don't run out of food and prep all the food. I learned that people are picky with what they want and you have to work with them to insure they come back. The management was alright, there is favoritism in the store because some people are more liked then others. The culture fell a part because Chipotle is trying to stabilize the company. The most enjoyable part of the company was the friendships I've made with all the employees. Hardest part was when it was busy and we were under staffed."
good,The job is fun. You get to meet a lot of different people and make a lot of new relationships. It is a joy to see the joy food can bring people and also how it can connect people.
good,Chipotle is great company to work for. They really have wonderful training procedures setup to ensure success. They also have very promising plan and opportunity for advancement within the company for people wanting to further their career in the restaurant business. This particular location has newer managers and is going through serious growing pains so the staff and management just are not working as a team.
good,"The location I am am is always very busy, breaks are rushed and customers are rude. You have to constantly multitask and be fast, it's not worth the pay"
good,This would've been a good job if there wa just different mangers or I worked at a different location there wasn't some pros I hated there short breaks you would never get the amount your suppose to because they will make you give them food if your the person in line so you would've get to eat with them you come at like the last five minutes but didn't really like it .
good,"My 90 day probation been up, and my manager still won't let me request time off. After all the hard work I do and even sometimes stay a llittle late to help out."
good,"A typical day working at chipotle can be challenging but fair. My reasoning for stating that is because you must be a top performer. I considered myself a top performer while employed with chipotle. I arrived to work at least 30 minutes early. Before clocking in to begin my shift I would prep my work station. By doing so I allowed myself to become more proactive toward my daily task. After setting up my work stations I would proceed to helping any co-workers that may need assistance completing morning task. After clocking in to begin my shift I follow all safety and health guidelines. After checking to assure all steps have been properly followed I began my food preps. Due to me being proactive I sometimes finish my orders early enough to assist co-workers before my morning break. After my morning break I return to front line to work cashier, fry chips, bag chips, work burrito grill etc. until the end of my shift."
good,"They worked people way to hard for the little pay thy gave, my manger would always gossip about people that is the reason i left. they food is amazing there but i wouldnt worlk there again"
good,"Would work full time and it would be very busy all the time, I would prepare for the day, cook during the day, and clean before leaving/closing. Food is awesome"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"working at chipotle its an fast,loud welcoming place to work. I have learned so much from working at chipotle.I have learned how to prep food, restock items and work at a fast pace. The management is not that good and some of the managers are unprofessional when it comes to dealing with there employees. The  workplace is laid back, family oriented, and up beat. I think the hardest thing about working at chipotle is how is some days there is none stop customers and you have to keep up the fast pace and also restocking at the same time . the most enjoyable part of working at chipotle is my coworkers is we all joke around but at the same time be professional with the customers"
good,"The other employees are the best part of the job, I've made so many friends working there, the only downside is the horrible work, the less then stellar pay, and the rude customers."
good,chipotle at first was a good job but the more i started to work there i started to see the flaws and scrutiny that job had. from stealing and to poor hygiene.
good,"Work consisted of cooking several food dishes at the same time and cleaning everything at the end of the day. There were plenty of opportunities for advancement, but the positions were so highly sought after that many of the staff were fighting against each other. More than once, another employee intentionally tried to make me look bad for something that wasn't my fault. Additionally, the hours make it difficult to spend time with friends or family unless they want to hang out at 9 am with you."
good,I like that the work schedule was flexible around my schedule. I went to out of town school and I was looking for something to work around my schedule.
good,"Pretty quick environment. Lots of people coming and going, there will be picky customers but you have to put customer service first just like any other job."
good,"Coworkers really made it for me here, other than that the management is poor. The district managers make it very hard for GMs to move you up or give a decent raise. The schedule was always late and often changed in the middle of the week."
good,Environment was very unhealthy management was very corrupted but customers were amazing. Also too much favoritism between managers and employees people feeling excluded and un wanted on the environment
good,The employees are awesome and the whole culture behind chipotle is amazing. The hours are not promised but thats with almost any restaurant job. Pretty decent place to work for .
good,"was okay to work at , got free food when we worked and half off meals when didnt work. went by pretty fast and you meet a bunch of people and you get repeat customers."
good,It's a very fast pace environment and its not for everybody. People get let go if you don't meet the requirement.  Pay is not very good for most employee's.
good,As someone who wants to pursue culinary arts it was not the most enjoyable place to work due to the lack of creativity allowed I felt like management had such a tight grasp on everything.
good,"Working at Chipotle Mexican Grill puts the phrase hard labor in perspective. Often times a designated task may be to work the line which is no easy task. The most challenging part is to deal with an irate customer, but still send said customer home with a full belly and a smile on their face. Making the customer happy is the most important and the most enjoyable part of the experience."
good,"Within a month of this new general manager coming into our store, he cut down all current employees hours down so he could hire all new people. Not a very professional person either. He had people that didn't even fully know how to do their positions train the new employees. Just a really bad new manager at this location"
good,a typical day at work is really just busy that's all I can honestly say. I learn hw to multitask in an high volume atmosphere. everyone there had great energy. the hardest part of the was keeping up when having to workmore than one station at a time. the most enjoyable part of the job was the people
good,"It was amazing when the majority of employees were top performers. After time passes those top performers move on, to better things. They are replaced, but new people who don't always step up. My job became harder after having to pick up the slack. I took it for a few months, but not many people stay in service forever."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,I enjoyed everyone that I worked with. I just didn't enjoy the actual job. At times they would have you punch out and still keep you working. Very stressful and hard to deal with the higher ups at times.
good,The work environment is fast past but it is very warming. The job itself can be very stressful because management is very stressed and you don't get paid for the amount of work you put in.
good,"Chipotle is the classic burrito shop around town. I worked both up front and back in prep. My tasks ranged from marinating meats, prepping salsas and guacamole. In addition to prep work, I also worked on grill searing steak and chicken. Chipotle runs a very tight shift. Every member of the crew team is essential to making the shift run."
good,Best place Ive ever worked great people great team great company. Only thing is the process for advancement isn't as fast moving or s effective as may like
good,"General manager made my job hard. Co workers made things very warm and comforting. Felt as though management wasn't as comforting, I felt unwanted and temporary."
good,"Overall, the work done was not very rewarding. There was a continuous cycle of working entering and leaving, the work was very hard requiring long rigorous hours and a lot was asked of you."
good,"The management is weakly decided upon, they care more that you put a huge fake smile on than to actually deliver adequate service. The employees teach employees which results in many corners being cut."
good,"Working at chipotle was a good first job experience, it taught me that the success of a business relies ion the motivation of the team as a whole. Management should be organized at all times because once the leaders don't show motivation or positivity it brings down the attitude of the team. Management should also respect that employees have lives outside of the job and not make employees feel like they have to choose between school and work. Aside from that I learned how to provide great customer service and work in a fast paced and pretty hectic environment."
good,"Chipotle workers work as hard as the store is busy. You have to get used to the extremely fast paced environment but it does sharpen your skills and mind. Yo often are trained in all or most duties but special in one. At corporate they really try to hammer in that Chipotle is a way of life and how you should invest yourself in the company. As a teenager with her first part time job, that's a lot to ask but if you want to move up in the company, the opportunities are there."
good,"It is an interesting job for thosei who are interested in the Fast Food industry.  I think that all the demands for safety food are a good tool and teach well to their crew, but sometimes they are not compensated accordingly with the demands of the job."
good,It was fun to work before management. They promise that you can rise up in the ranks but you have to fight tooth and nail in order to do so. They expect you to work off the clock if you don't finish your close by 11 o'clock.  However they do make everything fresh that day and the food is really good.
good,"Chipotle is a great stepping stone for anyone looking for management training. I have learned a lot from working there and advancing. More specifically how to lead and manage a restaurant. Upper management is very lack luster which induces a lot of stress on to the workers. A ""Work/Life Balance"" is almost impossible if you want to make this a career. But again, its a great stepping stone for your future success. I really loved the people I was fortunate enough to manage in my time there. Overall its not a terrible company, but they do have a lot to work on ""people"" wise."
good,Typical work day is a fast passed high energy and friendly atmosphere. The manager isn't the best and employee review and raises never happen.
good,"constant procedural change, and management lacking in responsibility led to many employees to walk out and quit during shifts, Was a common occurrence."
good,"i learned a lot about customer service, and have become more patient and productive in the way that i work. a typical day is coming in, getting your apron on, and making food for customers. management was ok although sometimes it seems as though they don't appreciate their employees. it is a hard job because of the amount of customers."
good,the company has removed focus from developing their people to only focusing on customers and its clear to see in the moral of the workers.
good,"Chipotle is a great place to work for people in highschool or looking for a summer job. It is mostly made up of young college students and high school students, but there are adults in the morning shifts. They provide opportunities to advance in your Chipotle Career, but not everyone gets the same attention to advance. The hours are unpredicatble while working, for example you could be scheduled 7am-4pm, but won't get out until 6 or 7 depending on who is coming in to cover you or who is getting sent on break. The people you work with will become like a family to you and you will love working with them, but like at any job there are rude customers. This is a great place for anyone that has a flexible schedule and is able to work in a fast paced and stressful environment."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,i learn  a lot of experience about how to consistently interact with children and families visitors and staff in courteous   and helped child achieve their academic and behavioral goals
good,I've been at Chipotle about a year they try to be flexible with my schedule but we are really short staffed so a lot of the time it's hard. We do hire and fire a lot of people. All my coworker are very different and very lively. If I didn't have great co workers that create a great work atmosphere then I would have quit a long time ago.
good,"Some days are good. Some days are bad. It's a toss up between which one overrides the other. I can't say Chipotle is a bad company to work for. It's great. The benefits you get are great. However, it takes a little longer than expected to get to them. I have learned so much in the year that I've been working at Chipotle. They really teach you what it means to be apart of a real team. However, if you don't have a good manager that isn't empowering their team to drive towards the goal of restaurateur then you will get no where. I tend to only do my job because if I don't they'll fire me. I don't do it because I want to anymore. The worst part about working at Chipotle is that they run a fast food restaurant like it's a Red Lobster so you have a lot of stuff to do and a time limit to do it in. It's as if they care about quantity over quality. Of course that's my certain store so don't make any rash decisions based on that. Just remember it is hard work and you won't always get the help you're wanting or needing. The most enjoyable part about working at Chipotle is the life-long friendships you make with not only the people you work with but the people you serve. You will fall in love with the people you work with (I'm not joking I fell in love here). It's really what keeps me going back in to work everyday. Knowing that I'll see my friends and they'll be right by my side working just as hard as me."
good,"Chipotle is a workplace were you can grow and learn, is a place were you get treated like family is a welcoming in comfortable place. Is a place were anything is possible."
good,What I was told in the interview to do I did to the best of my ability. I was trained as a cashier and line server. It was a fun job. There was minimal communication from the managers as to how I was doing as an employee which made it hard to know where I stood in the company.
good,"I enjoyed working here dealing with all types of people, being able to taste the food before serving the customers. My coworkers and I made it a great place to work being on each other team."
good,Arbys goals are much lower and more company and CEO focused rather individuals at each restuarnt and advancement thereof
good,Very fast paced work environment. Very specific tasks and time limit to complete tasks. Always fun. People are easy to work with. Management cares about the employees.
good,I'ts always a day full of excitement and hard work. Very constructive work place and everything is in its place. Most enjoyable part of this job is getting to see and interact with the customers.
good,"This job is great for kids who are looking for some extra cash while having fun doing it. It is fast paced, physically and mentally demanding, also has the perks to a free meal every day that you work. But management is a little touchy I never really know when I'm scheduled because they do not send a schedule out to everyone. Also hours are cut back with new hires so when they say part-time they really mean part-time. Overall great for some extra cash but nothing to live off of."
good,"Every day I would go in and prep food  in the mornings"
good,"The work Environment is decent depending on the crew members attitude and which manager is set for the day. over all, it falls on the people culture and how well each crew member can work as a team. In the store I worked, the management crew didn't work too well with the crew members and they were to focused on the little ""personal"" issues while remaining focused on the job."
good,"If you work hard you are rewarded, however sometimes you are forced to make decisions you don't agree with. The days are often long and stressful. Without any support you will not thrive.Lots of fun when things are done properly ."
good,"the day had it up and downs days were mostly good but when things got out of hand managers would cry and call other people, leave, or talk about there crew to other crew members."
good,I was never able to work on my development. I did not feel like management cared for every employee. But I was glad to always interact with customers.
good,It's an easy job but is very stressful due to the contradictions presented by the upper management. Wish they did a better job of actually following through with their culture.
good,"Chipotle is always busy with very little down time. While the daily tasks are repetitive there is always room to learn as well as develop future leaders for the company. The journey to restaurateur is a long and difficult one but in the end will be worth it. I love the people I work with and how they make me a better person every day. The best part of my job is teaching someone how to do something new, seeing the look on their face, and then watching them run with the knowledge they have received. When my employees are promoted to management or take-out specialists it makes me feel like I am making a difference in their life. The hardest part of my job is the inconsistent schedule I keep. I like to know when I will be working and when I will not but when you are constantly short staffed by three or four managers and up to five crew members that is not always possible. It is difficult to make plans with my family when I never know what days I will be working and if I will be called in on my day off or not."
good,i didn't like this job. i got hired by someone who couldn't speak English. my coworkers didnt care about there job. i only worked there because i needed the job.
good,It was very difficult working here. The management was overwhelmed. We sometimes didn't have enough people to cover the shift. Some employees will quit in the middle of a shift. It was just getting out of hand
good,"Chipotle is a great place to choose for a long term career path. Be prepared to be 110% to the job culture. Either you're committed or your not and lack of commitment will show through in the long run. Management can vary, due to fast promoting, management can vary and will have highs and lows."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Job was great but there was no room to move up within the company. Too many people were hired at once to do the same jobs. Food was great as well with it being organic and handmade everyday.
good,Great experience and a fun place to work at. Management needs to improve. It's very busy; the line always going towards the door or out the door. The co-workers are fun to be around but sometimes play too much. The hardest part of the job is trying to maintain everything clean during the process of work hours as in while your cooking and making food.
good,"always meeting new people everyday while providing great customer services, co workers are great to work with also great team players, management is ok. hardest part would be long intense line out the door"
good,"I worked a prep cook so I worked in the back. My managers basically used me as a full time closer when I applied as a part time day worker. Working with the food and learning some of the recipes and techniques are fun. A work day does go by fast since there is a set amount of tasks needed to be done every shift. However, if they are not finished fast and well, the management gives confusing feedback and often disrespected me even though I was fairly new to the job."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle starts around 8 a.m. for morning shift. There are different positions but mines consist of either frying chips or making the salsas. If I fry chips it takes about an hour to make about 6-7 hotels, which they will last until shift change at 3. For salsas I have to make anywhere from 4-18 of each one. I have to make sure that I measure out the ingredients correctly or else they could taste wrong. Then, after I am done I have to wrap them then store them in the front cooler."
good,I learned a lot moving up the ranks all the way to opening up a brand new store under my direction. But the work life balance took a huge toll as there is barely time to enjoy life outside of the restaurant.
good,"Working for Chipotle was the best experience of my career building thus far. Chipotle taught me what it means to be a great leader, how to run a multi-million dollar business, and how to lead a team through empowerment. Chipotle stands for a great vision which I will always stand behind and apply to anything I do; To change the way people think about and view fast food, and to create a special people culture where top performers are empowered to achieve high standards. Whether I work in another food industry or not, I will forever live by the people culture vision Chipotle stands for, helping to give a team of individuals a concise goal to accomplish; being the best you can be, helping others, knowing you have the power to make things better, and always striving for the highest of standards."
good,It's a great place to work for college students. The management can improve but are great in taking care of the needs of the employees.
good,What i learned was that i was not made for Chipotle. The management was great and thats were it starts and ends. The co-workers were clickish and rude and they were the hardest part of the job. the most enjoyable part of the job was the end of the shift knowing i had done my best for the day.
good,"The job overall was very good with fundamentals as for the management; unprofessional at times. "
good,"the people there are very nice, the work day is very busy. They get a high volume of customers, but the customers are very friendly. the co-workers work and help you."
good,"Chipotle is a great company to work for. They offer great opportunities for advancement and professionalism. Once you attain a management level position it does become a career that takes over your life. If you are looking for a great work/life balance, then Chipotle is not for you. If you are looking for a career that makes attaining a corporate level position possible, this may be the place to be."
good,"Working at Chipotle was very busy. There is always going to be a customer, and always something to do. "
good,I enjoyed working here because everyone was willing to work together as a team.  The management was very supportive.  The hardest part was getting the food prep done in the recommended time alloted.
good,great learning experiences. dealing with daily changes made me a stronger worker and it also taught me the do's and don't in the food industry.
good,The work is kind of heavy if your working and going to school. but you do learn how to cook and you make some great friends. there are some great befits as long as you are thinking of making it into a career.
good,I would come into work with my opening manager and we would prep and get the store ready for the day . My co workers arrived at 10 and we opened at 11 . Hardest part would be unloading trucks and the best part was the free food.
good,"chipotle itself is a good company i loved what they were doing and what they stood for. but my store in hagerstown md sucked the management played major favorites, they promoted ppl that didn't know what they were doing and the office politics were the worst i've ever seen."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"A typical day would include prepping of the days food. Once we opened the day would consist of assisting customers with orders. Also performing any side task that needed to be done that day."
good,Learned how to prepare different recipes and how to use certain utensils. Management was poor and co-workers had certain clicks which made the work environment uncomfortable. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the fast pace during rush hour. I enjoyed washing pots on time and have everything ready for my workers on time before my shift was over.
good,"•	Spoke with patrons to ensure satisfaction with food and service"
good,its an easy job. But the managers there were all fooling around and scheduled by favorites. They said if you talk to them they will fix it.  spoke to three of them.....nothing happened 1 day a week.
good,"came in worked, went home."
good,The people of walmart were always good to me. The pay wasn't the best but at the time it definitely took care of the business i had.
good,"I was put in a bad situation at this job, I was trained by someone who was only in my position for 2 months and obviously I was not taught everything. During training I would get done things hours before time limits and not taught more things that needed to be done, by the time I was on my own I did not know the small but very important things that needed to be done, which set me up for disaster, I started asking more and more about things that needed to be done, It was overwhelming and stressful doing things that some parts of management agreed on and some parts of management didn't agree on so I decided to terminate because of the lack of communication and agreement of management."
good,"A typical day of work would consist of me tending to our food and practicing food safety. I would say some of the things I learned from this would be time managing and staying persistent about consistency, it keeps the system running. Although management was in shambles before my final days, my fellow co-workers and I continued to pull out the days through-put and some times exceed that days quota. I will say the hardest part would be serving that line to the door every time things are not ready. The most enjoyable part of that job to me would be having that face to face interaction with the customers and seeing the joy they get out of the service a can provide."
good,"line cook for chipotle consisted of burrito making, serving customers, doing dishes , and cleaning the dining room. The job wasn't difficult in any category. It was your typical fast food job. Best part of the job has to do with the food."
good,I enjoyed interacting with customers on a daily basis and liking the people I worked with. My coworkers were hardworking and motivated.
good,"It wasnt a bad experience but the management are very rude, its a very hard work for the low pay rate that they offer.. A lot of work to do, chop over than 10 pans of veggies at day, work fast and make all those burritos.. Anyway I liked i little bit"
good,"Overall My experience with Chipotle was negative, they took no time to train me on any of the processes and while it was fun, you had no time t breath or learn, it was apron on go to work."
good,Chipotle's organization and lack of management skills leave me to question their standards. Co-workers is probably the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,I have been working for chipotle forol almost 3 years and I enjoy working with people and showing others what cux service is all about
good,"My responsibilities began with setting up for opening such as setting up the grill, stove top, rice cooker, and deep fryer. I was also responsible for prepping vegetables to be used for serving and cooking along with keeping work areas clean. I really learned about team work at an intense level and really enjoyed learning how to cut vegetables with precision. On some instances I believe a few of the managers could have stepped up with assisting the crew but overall I enjoyed working with my managers and the things that were taught to me. My co-workers I especially enjoyed. We were like family. The hardest part of the job was rush hour. It could get real intense but in the end I felt really good about what I accomplished for the day and that was the most enjoyable part of the job for me."
good,This job was great for a person in hs or in college. But they do little to retain people after graduation when it is time to pursue a real job.
good,I had only worked there a week and then after that they just stopped scheduling me. I was always persisted with trying to get hours. They just never gave me them.
good,The customers are very rude and the amount of work that you do is to much for how much your getting paid. The hours weren't that bad and the managers are really flexible with your schedule.
good,This is a job for someone at the high school level. I do not recommend working here if you are in it for the long haul. This is a place for some quick cash.
good,"Working at Chipotle Mexican Grill was not a great experience at the Maple Grove location. The way they ran things at this establishment was unfair, disrespectful, and inconsistent. Management was not on top of things and the store was always ran in a blur, a mess. They did not have it together."
good,"It was a typical workplace the location I worked at could use some work with one manager with attitude adjustment when you're talking to other employees , or if they have a question about something don't get so annoyed especially if they don't know. But the store manager was a great one, always had a great attitude."
good,I was a grill cook I was responsible to make sure the food got cooked to the right temp had to make sure I had my station was clean an that I had the next person set up for success
good,It was a great job it just wasnt for me and it could be stressful its very fast pace and you have to be on top of your tasks or you will fall behind and that will screw everyone up
good,Productive and fun workplace. Great for minors and students. A lot of hard work but many perks and benefits. Flexible schedules. Paid time off and sick days.
good,I don't have too much to say other than this is your typical food service job. It wasn't great but also wasn't bad. Good job for highschool because they work with school hours.
good,The company was very great as a whole but the management and organization of some shifts were not very great. I feel like you work a lil to hard for what you are getting paid though ..
good,this job tiring after a while working there when you have to wake up at five for a six o clock shift. then they dont pay for the amount of work you do there.
good,The work was fine but not enough time or people to do it.  I enjoyed learning a new system but the cutting of man hoursleft me feeling continuously discouraged and worried.
good,It was ok some people were ok others were eh. Communication was weak. A lot of people called in. It id a decent bade pay job to grind out while you look elsewhere
good,"Decent coworkers, horrible management - was racially profiled on several occasions. Worked every week while in school, was manageable. Mostly hire high school students first."
good,"After my experience of working with the company  "
good,Always worked more than scheduled which is good for money I guess but not for the balance in your life. It’s pretty fun if you get connected with the other employees and have good management that holds standards.
good,At this job you will be expected to juggle multiple food related tasks at once while in a high speed/pressure environment. Management tries their best to keep everyone in a good mindset but at the end of the day just want there to be food for the guest while all of the company’s many policies are being followed.
good,Working at Chipotle was a pivotal learning experience for a newbie in the food industry with coworkers around my age.
good,"This job is good for just starting out in the food industry. Fast pace, flexible hours, and nice co workers. I learned prep skills, and how to cook food while I was there."
good,I haven't worked at chipotle before but from what i was told you get pay a good amount. Long as you have good customer services work well with others  do what your suppose to do work wise.
good,"- learned fast food environment"
good,A typical day at work is busy alot of customers coming in and leaving out. I would say the hardest part of this job is having to be nice to rude customers
good,"Beautiful people work in the Safety Security and Risk department and I was very happy doing the customer service type work while I was there."
good,I love the fact that every week this company donates left overs to shelters. Individual management is wishy washy. I was told to do something specific my management and was reprimanded for it. Always go by what handbook says. Tips were great at the end of the night. One free meal while on the clock then one percentage off discount while off the clock. Room to move up in the company if desired.
good,Chipotle is a great place to learn. I learned a lot there as a young manager and it provided me with a lot of great skills for the future. The struggle with this company was that it was not easy to leave work at work as the commitment at least at my particular location was far greater than it should have been.
good,Its a constant job which is good but if ur left not backed up with either rice(especially white) or chicken(cut preferably) then ur gonna be busy till closing
good,Years of experience with chipotle brought me to one conclusion.  each location is unique to the people that are hired and learn to work together as a team.  some locations maintain the same group of people working for years which is good and bad.  Overall its whether the restaurant can achieve their respective goals without loosing too may people.
good,I am very hard working. I am a team player. I have fine and casual dining experience. I have been a server for 22 years. I have been a line cook for 16 years. I am a great closer. Don't mind staying late. Would love the opportunity to work with your company 😊.
good,"When you clock in, its important to have the mentality and awareness to work as much as you can.  I learned to have a sense of urgency.  It can be tough at first but depending on your shift, things get easier and you learn to adapt to situations.  Paid breaks and free meals are a plus (when working).  Chipotle is pretty good job but it does require a lot of attention to get things done."
good,"Chipotle was a fun place to work at first, but slowly went downhill. Managers started to not care about their job any more, and their negative attitudes affected the staff. Under staffing was a huge problem, as most employees left due to the negative environment. Pay is decent, and expectations were made clear."
good,"I learned how to cook. Management is great, super flexible with schedules. Great job for people that want to do part time job and part time school. Great hours"
good,"A lot of work and extensive hours when working a closing shift. Understaffed regularly leading having to stay 1 to 3 hours past schedule. Great people to work with and lots of hours if you desire, but a sufficient rate of pay for work required"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, I advanced from a crew member to a takeout specialist, to kitchen manager, to being a certified trainer, and finally a shift leader. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential."
good,Chipotle was a fun work environment with great food with quality ingredients. I learned lots of skills in the kitchen an got to make great food everyday.
good,"It was a great experience to work at Chipotle, I worked with a lot of great people and learned a lot. My coworkers, for the most part were friendly and helpful and everyone wanted to get their job done."
good,"Part time"
good,Culture of training and development not established. Tenure is very low at all levels causing high turnover. No local restaurant recruiting team or support.
good,The location that I have chose to work at is a very fun environment. It is very fast-paced so you have to be willing to learn very fast and be thrown in the game very early in your training.
good,"Fun workplace, great people, I've learned a lot about mexican food and how to prepare it. I was always doing the evening shifts and that was the worst part- ending work at midnight."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,your co workers are nice but the work isn't worth the pay. although the benefits are good the pay isn't worth the amount of work. i mean you work there if you want.
good,"Decent job, good pay. Don’t drink a lot of free fountain drinks or you’ll get fired for taking too many bathroom breaks like I did. Overall though was a fun job."
good,Great Part time job for anyone to start. They could be nicer to their customers. They could teach better. They could hire better experience cooks for the jobs.
good,It was fun but a lot of the time mangers seemed stressed or didn't have the best communication with the employees. It then became a stressful environment.
good,"Chipotle was amazing in the start, but as you move to salary, you lose your personal life. You have to be in contact with everyone all the time, they can make you work anywhere as salary. It’s like they own you at that point and don’t appreciate what you give."
good,Good place to work if you like to interact with customers very chill and relax place to work but also very fast paced and coworkers are very friendly and kind
good,"I learned alot of things working at chipotle but overall my experience was not great. I would recommend it for a high school kid but as an adult, you dont want to be baby sat at your job and some of the managers had trouble figuring out how to manage appropriately."
good,The hardest part about working at Chipotle Mexican Grill is having to assist more than two customers at once. Also the lack of help from other employees when it comes to work tasks.
good,I definitely loved working here tips were great just for being a cook loved cause I was doing something that I love doing which is cooking it brought back memories of me in the kitchen with my grandma
good,"On a typical day at Chipotle, I get very stressed out. I don't really get along with my coworkers. The managers aren't that great at helping out and doing their job. Doesn't really work around my schedule."
good,"If your looking to work in the fast-food industry, Chipotle is not a bad start. They provide employees with decent benefits and some vacation days. Overall, Chipotle is a fast-paced environment, but management is consistently striving to provide employees with the best environment they can."
good,It was alright it didn’t pay well there’s no chances to move up and your pay will never change no matter what even if your going to be there for a year plus
good,I had no problem since I’ve been there for a year and a half. As long as the crew come in and get straight to work everything ran smoothly. But if someone called off and we couldn’t get a replacement it was hectic but we got it done.
good,"A very fast paced and busy work day, would often make days go by very fast. Being on the grill and just cooking was a big distraction from the rest of the day, once I mastered the grill I started running multiple positions"
good,"Everyday be fast and clean .Always busy, sometime even don't have time to take break. The management was very rough about cleanliness. Do a lot of things in the same time."
good,"I do love working here, but it has come to a point where I need to branch out and explore other career options. I have worked at chipotle for over a year now and while I am sad to leave, I’m excited for new opportunities. A typical day at work would be very busy and stressful at times, but it has taught me patient and responsibility like nothing has before."
good,The manager was hardly there and when he was all he did was complain about everything until he left which was an hour after he showed up. And I barley got any hours.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotle isn’t the best job, but it’s something to work with if you are in desperate need of a job. It’s stressful at times when it’s busy. Chipotle isn’t a one man job..you need at least 4-5 other teammates to work with you or you will become overwhelmed."
good,"Chipotle Mexican Grill is a typical fast food restaurant job. They require similar tasks every shift, and the experience of the shift is dependent on how busy it is. It is fast paced, and requires customer service skills."
good,"It was good because you got a free meal each shift, something you will need as a broke college student! It did get hectic however because we were busy 24/7."
good,"Worked 10-14 hour days all of which are on my feet. Call offs are out of control. very fast paced which makes the day go by faster however, somedays bathroom breaks can't happen for hours."
good,"The lunch rush is crazy. I'm a cashier, but they always take me off the register when it gets really busy. My only complaint is that for an 8-hour shift I don't get a single official break. I bring granola bars with me to get through the shift."
good,"When I first started out, it was okay. A lot of things I had to learn as I go, and sometimes I didn't have much help. Our management changed halfway through and the new manager pushed efficiency, without actually helping out any newcomers, which forced a lot of people out. I felt uncomfortable working there at times because it went from a cool environment to a strict one."
good,"Extremely stressful at time, the company pushes for perfection. Team environment is fun, most management it alright as well. Inside the day to day store, can be fun with the right team and management."
good,Chipotle serves mexican food which gets really busy at peak time.Dealing with multiple people was difficult but this experience helped me a lot. Dealing with different kinds of customer was also a new task for me.
good,I worked the line meaning I asked what the customer would like then helped serve there food to them and assisted them with anything else they would like. For example chips or a drink and then worked the cash.
good,"I did enjoy my time working at Chipotle, the managers were relaxed most of the time but can be a real hassle too you for no reason. There tends to be a lot of drama sometimes in the store when people talk about rumors of each other. Customers are usually nice and straightforward but sometimes you get those Customers that feel as if they are entitled to the whole world."
good,its a good company but never i think they be over working they need to pay more and listen a little more to their employees if u looking to grow and be someone within the company i encourage u to do so
good,"typical day at work is very busy. I learned how to interact with customers, and how to prep some of the foods there. I also washed a lot of dishes, threw a lot of trash and cardboard, overall a good experience."
good,"This job is for specific people who are high-energy, willing to work quickly and carefully, and are not afraid to get dirty. One can learn about customer service, cleaning skills, and food preparation."
good,"Chipotle is a fast faced, fast growing business.  Management changes frequently and you have to keep up with the pace of the job.  It's a great learning opportunity to boost your skills and knowledge in the kitchen."
good,A long time employee that has been through all the changes for better or worse. The people culture was the best in the business but slowly dwindled away after the food safety scares.
good,Everyone had good communication skills regarding work talk. Aside from some  personal behaviour  the company could use a little more of a professional guidance and  direction when communicating with one another and not so comfortably open.
good,I’ve worked there for over a year and am still paid 9.50 an hour with only 30-35 hours a week when there are younger crew members getting paid more than I am and are at a higher rank than I am
good,It was my first job and it taught me how to work fast and efficient.  I carry that over to any job i have.  Good food and quality service.  Consistent and persice.
good,"Working at chipotle was ok but one thing I could never really get used to was the disorganized management, no communication within the team which slows us down."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Its a good place to work. I just think some changes are necessary in this particular location. I have friendly coworkers but I also have people who think the rules dont apply to them. Its a fair place to work and I respect that they give everyone an opportunity.
good,"When I worked for chipotle my job was to make sure that I clock in and wash my hands before I begin touching anything. I learned how to count a register and manager comps and employee break meals entering them into a computer and I learned how to make fresh chips in a deep fryer as well. The manager was very nice she was a good manager she had patience with her employees with wonderful people skills. The workplace was Relaxed and chilled with nice music for our customers. The hardest part of the job was closing and making sure that is was done the right way but as I got used to it, It got easier. The most enjoyable part of the job was learning the names of the meat it was like once you've gotten that down pack and understood it you were able to pick up speed."
good,"It was an ok job. I did make some awesome friends and everyone was like family. Free food was also a plus. However the manager at my location was definitely a reason why I quit, because they have favorites and those they favor get more advancement. I worked there for more than a year and they never trained me to do salsas which was more higher up than tortillas. Can be overwhelming when it is busy and can be stressful depending on who you are working with. I worked the morning shifts and if you dont finish your food prep on time you dont get a break even if you work an 8 hour shift. Overall its fast paced job if was not for the free food and the friends I made its a pretty terrible job but that all depends on who your manager is at your location."
good,amazing work is very active the hard part is when is really busy every orders is a challenge helping the customers to feel comfortable  but the orders
good,"While working at Chipotle, the stress and pace of the job can be overwhelming. The management was ok to work with but being able to learn new things at the location I was at was almost impossible. When I became good at something, the management did not encourage me to learn new things when I wanted to."
good,it was a hard days of work. preparing the food starts early and when customers come you get yelled at because they are hungry/cranky. if you need a job they will hire any one.
good,I probably am not the only one who is undervalued and over worked there but it sure feels like it. Everyday I make the guacamole 6 cases worth from scratch and I do it with a hand smasher no matter the stiffness of the avocado's. One day I had to drive my truck across town to pick up Avocados for Chipotle. First and foremost they don't pay me enough to rent me and my truck. They pay me $11.00 an hour and expect me to be doing management tasks.
good,It was definitely fast paced. It was a very clean environment. Overall it was a good place to work but didn't give you much time of your personal life.
good,"A position at Chipotle can be fun at times, and you should try and make it fun. Although the truth is it is stressful because all employees are not able to handle such a fast paced and demanding environment."
good,"I worked for chipotle became a manager.I like the benefits and opportunities that chipotle offers. I’ve grown and learned a lot here, but after a while the job gets old. Everyday is the same thing. Chipotle is definitely a temporary job. Pay is minimum wage which sucks because sometimes it feels like your doing a job of 2 or 3 people. It can be emotionally draining there, I can’t."
good,"chipotle has lots of completive workers to work with its a very interesting learning experience, you get to do and see many things.  its a very busy workplace keeps you on your toes."
good,Great place to work and get your foot into the food industry. Great food and working space. I learned a lot at this job and the days the lines was out the door helped me gain a sense of urgency and made me a harder worker and more efficient one too.
good,"Never satisfied. "
good,"The company is good over all alot of cleaning and handwashing, they only had me on dishes I wanted to move to a different position two weeks I asked and they said wait two weeks and in those two weeks they cuz my hours"
good,I've worked here for about 7 months and it's been an alright experience. I just have been having been getting my desired hours even after speaking to my GM
good,Tasks are simple enough but due to nature of business things tend to be hectic and involve a lot of work with a clear skill to do your tasks. falling behind even for a minute can result in extremely stressful situations where you play catch up your whole shift
good,It is a fast paced environment that teaches employees to be readily open to criticism and change. The way the weekly schedule is given out is inefficient and caused me to be unable to continue working with them.
good,This job required me to work with people who claimed to be a crew but did not act as such. They offered little to no training and had very disrespectful co-workers.
good,"Very clique-y, those who “excelled” made it very apparent their prime was high school and it was more than obvious management picked and chose favorites. Hours were variable, communication was absolutely lacking, and some management is most definitely not qualified to be so. A specific manager at my location would avoid multiple duties and straight up replied “I don’t know tell them to go away” when I asked for their help with a customer and a catering order yet she remained. As for the other managers they were very helpful and made it a point to recognize the hard work of all team members. The regular customers were common and great too."
good,I enjoyed working here a lot. I gained a lot of skills oriented around customer service and I also benefitted from learning the process for food prep.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Management was very disorganized and very confusing when it comes to instructions and protocol. Want you to move fast but doesn't provide clear instruction
good,"i had door dash in my face everyday yelling at me and my manager doing nothing about it, we were almost always running out of food, most of the employees got their breaks skipped because management doesnt seem to know the law. My manager told me she would stop scheduling me nights and continued to schedule me closing every week until i quit. Dont work here lol"
good,"I started with a different General Manager than who I ended with, the first one was great but the second one was an alcoholic and treated his employees unfairly. He would often leave the store to go get alcohol."
good,Too many high school kids working. Those with no clue what good work ethics are. Management somewhat disorganized. I will say though that the food is very fresh and measures are taken on clean gloves at all times!!
good,"I highly recommend working somewhere else. The work environment here is incredibly toxic and not very good. There was daily drama between workers and employees. Favoritism is a very big thing here so if you are disliked by one of the managers, don't plan on getting moved up, it won't happen. Some days were better than others. It was very poorly managed and lots of cliques."
good,Chipotle in my opinion was a fun job at first until you had to get up really early and prepare everything and got treated poorly. The most enjoyable part of the job was when customers gave me a lot of compliments. I did learn how to manage my time better and be more patient.
good,"Upon arriving into the job, I was very excited. They started me on the cash register and told me they'd move me to serving food soon, but that never happened. I worked there for two months, not a long time, but I got a good whiff of the work environment during that time. The cash position was especially tricky for several reasons. Of course, I had to ring up every customer, but I also had to refill the ice, frequently clean the drink station, clean tables, clean bathrooms, collect all trashes, restock, and sweep, and was expected to get all this done in a a short time span, while somehow, also ringing up customers. The demands were almost ludicrous. I don't know if that is the duty of every cashier at every location."
good,Our head manager did not get along with other managers and some of the crew members and resulted in many people leaving. There were times where restaurant would be very busy and other days where it is fairly quiet leaving you with not much to do.
good,"Somewhat unethical"
good,Chipotle is a great place to start. Helps you gain experience with customer interactions. Teaches you to keep up with the pace but it can also get stressful with the amount of customers daily. Managers are cool to you unless you get in there bad side.
good,working at chipotle was a great experience I had a lot of motivated people around me  and a great general manger who wanted to help his employees. I worked different positions and gained helpful knowledge.
good,Good overall first job for young people especially in high school. would definitely recommend to other people. Food is very good as well with decent management.
good,Most stressed out I have been working for this company. Higher ups are all new so they don’t even know what goes on in running a shift at chipotle. Look somewhere else.
good,In the beginning it was a good job but it’s very stressful. The people are nice but there’s always too much going on. The manager was not understanding at all
good,"It was stressful working there because I had to take care of a lot of stuff in a small amount of time, since I was new It would take me a while to finish everything. Management was okay, the hardest part was closing because it would take a while."
good,If you want to become a manager just prepare for Chipotle to become your life. Its a lot of work with long hours. Especially when your store is short staffed.
good,"Some management was great, some not so much, crew was always great, over worked, and very underappreciated.  If you did good, that wasn't good enough, if you did great, still not good enough, if you did outstanding, well ok ,that's what they expect. All the time, everytime. If some one sees you are great,look out, you will be doing everyone else's job. They will want you to work all the time. Getting time off wasn't to bad, just don't make it a habit. To many times have seen the wrong thing done, out of the top 3 managers, only 1 had honesty and integrity. 33% is not good. The place can wear you out."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Good manager in Bartrampark branch, family oriented, nice workplace, good people, happy place there is a sense of belongingness, clean and well maintained place"
good,Learning to to work in a fast paced environment. My skills in the food prepping and grilling area has grown. Dealing with situations in a busy area. Good customer service skills Over all a good growing experience
good,"Provided that you're looking for a means of income and would rather not work at a 'fast-food joint', then chipotle is a terrific choice. I would argue that their main-problem would be miscalculating how much an individual can take on by themselves."
good,"I worked at Chipotle through some of the biggest transitions in the companies history. While we made some strides, the pressure on store level managers and general managers was very high. It was definitely a ""sink or swim"" feeling most of the time as area managers were under their own pressures and many times they were responsible for too large of an area to where they could be effective. I loved working for Chipotle for a long time but towards the end I was burnt out from working 60 hour weeks and being unable to meet the absurd standards that were in place. As soon as I reached the goals, they were changed."
good,management was impressive. with good colleagues. A good workplace to start with you will learn a lot from them. they will teach and guide you all throughout your orientation. free uniform and meals.
good,I would clean and prep for the next person coming in for the shift and i mostly worked at the grill making food for the customers. I would also take out the trash and sometimes greet the customers.
good,"Pretty good company to work. Has some growing pains to go through, but they will get there. Has good benefits, flexible hours, paid time off, but is still pretty stressful because there is no full support with the position you have."
good,Nice people friendly environment easy to work with crew members good pay I love working with my crew manager he was a cool dude and helped me alot I learned a lot from working there
good,"It was okay for a while. At first I was getting paid well and working plentiful hours out of the week as well as covering shifts and doing overtime. Eventually, others were getting hired and my days started to get cut down. For example, I was working 5 days a week on average for 7 hours—6 if I do overtime—and for some odd reason, I noticed that my hours went down to four and narrowed my days down to two. Literally two! I found myself unable to do anything. I couldn’t go places, couldn’t help pay the bills nor treat myself. Things just got hard. I know they say, “Little money is better than no money”, but I’m not working in an environment in which the people don’t care. Not to mention, I was calling out of school most times because if I don’t get to work or go in on a day I’m not scheduled for, I would get fired. It got tiring and I just ended up voluntarily leaving. I didn’t say anything which was the smart thing to do. I just left. I love chipotle and the food, it’s a good place to start, but not for something long term."
good,"hope you get a nice manager and don't mind smelling of nasty burritos all dsay and night "
good,"Good job all around just short staff, which causes conflict throughout the store. Great opportunity to get started in the work field but not a career."
good,At Chipotle when I worked there in 2014 it was very busy almost every night. We always had a line out the door and had to make food constantly. As a cashier I made sure all customers were happy . I also cleaned the dining area as well as the bathrooms.
good,"Chipotle was a very clean and nice job, although the pay was not acceptable and the distance from my home costed more than my check. I still would recommend chipotle."
good,Working at Chipotle is good if you are trying to get into the Chef/Food Business. It is a good start to get customer and kitchen experience for future
good,A typical day at work was intense but fun. I learned how to work in food service in this job. The management was problematic and changed several times when I worked there. The hardest part of the job was the lunch rush. The most enjoyable part was the free food.
good,"Chipotle is a company run like a small business at the store level, but has major weaknesses in its corporate influence. The crew and managers in each store are incredibly hard working people, but the decisions made by Chipotle corporate negatively impact the working lives of its employees. Chipotle is always busy, and there is always much to be done whether there are customers or not."
good,This job was very time consuming and stressful. Customer service is the most important skill to have. I learned that you have to have lots of patience and determination to work here
good,there was days that I just did not want to go to work walking in the snow and rain ..then there was though days that I had to walk home late night and nobody ask you would you like a ride home ....
good,The company was really good when it was growing. Over expansion made them go from a great company that cared to a big company that just focus on numbers and not employees.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Honestly you can do much better. The stress that is associated with certain positions aren't easily dismissable. Certain positions are too easy and some are nearly impossible due to changing management.
good,"It will honestly depend on your chipotle, the one I worked at got shut down because my manager was embezzling money, and showing up to work drunk. So yeah, it could have worked out better with a better manager."
good,"Was interesting, got the feel for being put under pressure to make the food the way it needed to be made. Making sure all the temperatures were correct and that every customer was satisfied!"
good,I was a crew member and had the opportunity to learn a lot of customer service skills including cash handling and communication.  I also learned a lot of time management.
good,"Decent place to work.  Changing environment, culture, company focus, structure, etc.  Nice people.  Passionate about the company's mission on sustainability at scale."
good,I worked there for 2 years. Learned a lot. Would recommend it to others looking to work in a restaurant setting. There is always room for growth. I appreciated the experience.
good,"Super cool at first, you have to be willing to work hard and be punctual, some of the staff is passive aggressive in my experience. its an ok first job"
good,"One of my first jobs in food. Offers nice benefits for a HS Student like a free meal and great discount. If you remember the recipes even better. When you start they'll put you on chips, with that being said push for something better because you deserve more than sweating over sunflower oil for 2 hrs (but you do get to ""sample,"" so don't be too mad)."
good,"At the time when I started working at Chipotle, I indentified as transgender, female to male. I was accepted. I would recommend the job just not the manager I worked with."
good,"There's just too much drama, attitude and fakeness for me in this store specifically. Some coworkers are unwilling to be fair to each other and to me. Half the Management is okay. Some positions are too much work for little pay. EXTRA butt kissing here from some people."
good,"very fast paced when serving customers on lunch/dinner rush. Managers were never on the same page about many things. Never received proper orientation and training on food line, causes upset within co-workers and managers. Expected new trainees to do all the hard work without any help."
good,"I never ate chipotle until I started working there... now I love chipotle! Full time , well mannered individuals , great teamwork, work parties , just a fun environment."
good,"Pre-pare food for the day, Put truck orders away, I have learned how to cook, prep, and inventory. Culture was ok but I didn't like how they chose who they wanted to promote. Preparing and getting food ready in time for guest's in a short period of time. I enjoyed cooking and working for the staff."
good,The reason why I enjoyed working here was because working in the kitchen was fun because I always had something to do and it had me working 24/7. I also liked the environment that I was in with my co-workers and employees.
good,"Training was productive, crew was fun to work with, management was very caring about the work staff. The pay could be more appealing if bonuses or raises were in place."
good,It is a job that requires a lot of your mental and physical abilities. The pay is really low and not worth the struggle. Some days are good and others are just so stressful.
good,"If you are a high school student and you need a couple bucks in your pocket this is one of those jobs that can easily help with that, but if you are trying ti pay a bunch of bills as an adult Chipotle doesn't keep up."
good,"I don't think it's the machine they need to improve. It's power to weight ratio. If you had a much stronger man that was trained for endurance pedaling it might work. Like say those small men were 130 pounds and an Olympic cyclist would weigh 230. That's plus 100 pounds. But that man that weighs 130 can only bench press or leg press maybe just barely under his weight. But the Olympic cyclist would be able to bench press or leg press 300 lbs making his power to weight ratio very positive, with the perk of him or her being trained for endurance. I think Gatorade sponsored a video where they took a Olympic gold medalist cyclist and challenged him to power a toaster with a bicycle and he lasted I believe it was a good 3-4 minutes of consistent pedaling. Moral is, you can't just say hey try to do this with no past training. There are professions in life, get a professional cyclist for cycle like activities. Please, this challenge needs to be broken, I have to see the power of the human mind  be tested."
good,"Worked my way up from crew to upper management and was let down by my regional manager and company. Improper business handling, upper management and sexual relations with crew ruined my tenure with a company I fell in love with. The culture and family feel as an organization is something I haven't encountered since I left, I would strongly recommend not becoming a manager until your thoroughly meet with DM and AM. I was eased to hear my DM was let go for the reasons I left but it was too late for me and left a sour taste in my mouth about how the situation was handled and the time in which it was investigated"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Very easy job for people of a younger age. Management was slightly picky. They like who they like. You have to fight to get promoted and show them you are serious
good,Learned great communication skills. Built strong working relationships with coworkers and managers. Flexible hours. Learned strong multitasking. Has opportunity for growth in the company.
good,I believe the hardest part of chipotle is when your short people and you all have to work harder and faster to get everything ready for the day and when it’s rush hour it hard when your short
good,Great place gives a complimentary meal but does tend to be high intensity work environment. If you cant keep up youll get backed up with orders quickly
good,"This place at first is okay to work in but they don’t have a stable training program, also people daily call in and sometime the shift only runs with 4 people and you have to pick up the slack which isn’t fun."
good,"The only reason I stayed as long as I did was because I needed a job to pay for school. However, I had to work 37.5 hours a week and I was still in school at the time and I never had a day off. The managers are the reason why I quit. Reason being is they did not care if you were sick they made you come to work anyways. The job however taught me a lot about the food industry and that is the only grateful thing I got from my time working there."
good,"learned a bit about proportions, Mexican restaurant so had a Mexican feel and look to it, decent company to work for, hardest part of the job was the mean customers but everyone did their best to help them out"
good,Chipotle is a way of life not just a job. I have learned from many people and continued to learn and better myself. I would never take this work experience back I feel like its helped me better myself as a person as well as my work ethic.
good,this was my job from over 12 years ago. i really have forgotten the majority of what I learned. it was a tough job but most food/retail jobs are like that
good,"working at chipotle was very fun. it was one of my real jobs. it was very fast-pace job, had no time to rest. delt with customers that werent happy and one that were very very happy."
good,The place I worked with had favoritism and didnt really work with flexible hours. Didnt really train people that well. Was very judgey if you didnt do things specifically their way instead of your own
good,I went in and busted my butt everyday and even though I was taunted with being told I was considered for management I never got there. Gave me the run around. For how hard the employees work the pay is not there. Free food during your shift though.
good,"People loving the food so much and you just need to keep cooking everything. To me, I just want to fina a path to work as office job. I can handle the pressure but I would love to handld other ways."
good,You get tuition reimbursement after being there for a year. Management is really sucky. You never get breaks. Free food when you work a shift. Half off when you aren't working. Discount only works at the chipotle you work at.
good,"With good management, this restaurant is a great place to work in. The people I worked with were awesome. There is a lot of room for advancement if you have proper management. With poor management it is harder to move up, and it is not a fun place to be."
good,"It can be great but a lot of the workers are young and still act very childish, but if that doesn't bother you, it's really good pay and it can be like a family"
good,"in the heart of downtown, it was always busy so you always had things to do. lunch rush was where you really bonded with your team members because everyone had to work together in a timely manner to achieve excellence."
good,"Chipotle provides opportunity with a fast paced work environment.  There are lots of opportunities within the company and great benefits as well.  The hardest part of the job is problem-solving to please dissatisfied customer,  to make customers feel the company cared about their concerns, creating a positive culture and brand."
good,You must have a passion for food in order to be successful and happy here. It does get very stressful often. Your co-workers will make your work experience what it is on top of the stress you will have to deal with.
good,"it all depends on where you work the pay is better than most fast food, your experience here all depends on the people around you just come in do your job and leave"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotle. Hmm. At first this job seemed like a nice opportunity to learn a different aspect of a restaurant. I enjoyed working with the people there for the first few months. I was catching on quick with a lot of things. I was FOH when I started and eventually moved to the BOH to work in prep and dishwashing. I actually really liked the move. I think the biggest struggle was management thinking it was okay to leave me with a lot of work that seemed to be fit for a service manager. Although I never got a raise or title change. I was okay with it, until it became apparent that they were taking advantage of me when there would be nights I left at the same time with one of the other managers helping finish her duties which eventually became mine. The gm at the time would take breaks like he/she didn't have an important role to fill every day. They would get into arguments with fellow employees and managers till they requested a transfer. That's only the surface of it. Other than that, the environment with my coworkers made it work for me at the time."
good,Management can be bad because they promote within. Much of the managers don't have any educational background or training. But for students who want to learn and have experience is a great stepping stone.
good,you'd think chipotle would be a pretty good job but I was never super happy there. I always stayed positive but other employees were always negative or rude and it made it hard to work there.
good,"Working at chipotle Mexican grill is  one of the most fun, productive team work environments I ever experienced. It is a place where co workers assists each other and is always doing something you're never in one place."
good,Can be extremely stressful and busy which makes it very hard to uphold food safety standards. Since the company requires you to constantly improve throughput it can cause negligence of food safety standards.
good,"I prepped and cooked all the food on a regular basis at the end of the day i was responsible for cleaning the grill and grease filters. Everyone always got along, hardest part of the job is keeping up with the food during peek hour."
good,"Its nice working at chipotle.  The only thing that bothers me is that their is no opportunity for promotion once in kitchen and service manger roles.  The Leadership could be better too at the store level.  GM's are not held to any accountability for work performance or attendance.  Which leaves everything for the Apprentice, Service, and Kitchen managers.  Great company as a whole it really makes a difference in your life if you are led by the right leaders.  I would recommend to anyone who truly has passion.  I would just advise them to be open minded and very vocal when concerns come up."
good,Chipotle is a good company for a starter job to get back on your feet or first job. its not my ideal career but good starter. Chipotle does provide opportunities for education advancement as well as career advancement
good,es una compañía que te brinda la oportunidad al llegar al país pero se aprovechan de la personas porque no tiene grupo equivalente de trabajo
good,It was a good job for starters that are beginning work its not that difficult but you do have to fast and not talk back to the customer because customers are always right
good,"Lot of turnover at the Maryland Parkway store. Around 15 people have left/been fired this year alone."
good,"Hard working, fast past. Good people to work with sometimes. Didn't engoy being yelled at by the Management. Worked very hard and awhile as well. Not really sure if I remend people working there."
good,"They offer tuition assistance for any kind of degree if you've worked here longer than a year."
good,Very Flexible for college students or for people trying to find part-time work for. The management would change often and their would constantly be check ins.
good,"Management can make or break your store. Period. The gist of the job is that you must work hard with all the odds against you, like having the bare-minimum amount of people on, sales always exceeding what was projected, catering orders thrown in at the worst times, ridiculously high standards for cleanliness and food prep, and not enough time to get anything you need to get done actually done. The General and assistant managers will drill the ""Chipotle way"" into you only for the Regional Manager to come in and change thing that don't follow any established policies. For example. Our manager ordered his food order according to the standard. It cam in perfectly however the catering lids wouldn't fit on any of the shelves, so they had us throw them away. When prepping food one time, the onions were slightly too big... and i mean slightly, and the manager took the 16 pounds of onions that were cut and threw them away."
good,"I worked at two different chipotle’s In my time as an employee. The chipotle in Pikesville was amazing . Great atmosphere, management was very good. I can’t complain. But then I was transferred to Owings Mills chipotle to be a kitchen manager. Management sucked, co workers would not follow recipe or procedures. It was short staffed. Also lots of drama from everyone"
good,"Fast paced, sometimes really stressful, makes your question your life a lot.. BUT it’s you can make decent money here if you’re willing to put in good hours. Can easily pick up shifts if you wanted to."
good,"meh, it was fun for a little bit but then everything got way more difficult. i would always get yelled at for doing what i was supposed to be doing and some of the other workers wouldnt actually do their job"
good,This was my first ever job and I actually enjoyed it. Serving customers and putting a smile on some faces. enjoyed some of the girls I worked with. it was fast pace so I enjoyed that very much.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Great place to work. Definitely I great place for your first job. The management team could use some help but overall I’d recommend chipotle as a good place to work.
good,Chipotle is a pretty good place to work. Fast paced and a lot of work but the employees are all really great and there is a fun sense of culture for all who work there.
good,"good place to work, you work hard and stay busy, could be a couple things to help with making job a bit easier, tend to hire good people, overall a good job to have"
good,Got a lot done and had a good crew to work with. Very fast pace and everyone wanted to work together. It was a great experience that will help with custoer serive in the future
good,"Usually very fast paced. Tasks don't take too long to learn, unless you're grill. Management will be hit or miss. Flexible hours, barely acceptable pay for the amount of work."
good,Over all I feel grateful for the time i have spent with Chipotle. I feel that the hours I was working my quality of life greatly suffered. I am hoping to start a family and I need a career that will allow me to live my dream.
good,They are very much focus on always being prepared by opening time. They make sure the store is clean from top to bottom and they as a team at all time to keep a consistent and stable flow of work
good,"This job consisted of working as a team to get through the day. You need to be very good at multitasking and need to be patient. Overall, this job is a great way to work on social skills and management."
good,"Having ownership of equipment, providing safety procedures for food to be excellent for guests. Managing crew members to understand how to properly and efficiently satisfied costumers."
good,I wasn't all that into it because I was often in the back by myself doing dishes and it wasn't very fun. I would have enjoyed it more if I had more interaction with people.
good,"i did my job and that was it , i was always busy, the downside was on break. i had to eat fast in order to keep up with my tasks. Expect To be helping others too."
good,"I worked at chipotle for a year and a half and received 3 promotions and 4 raises. Growth within the company is there. I Enjoyed the actual job of chipotle it was the structure that really lead my resignation from the job. My  issue with chipotle is we often worked in sweat shop like conditions, worked a ridiculous amount of hours. They have policies in place that make it hard for managers to manage their employees. For example Chipotle has no formal write-ups for employees yet as a Manager you can be written up by your General Manager or Field Leader. Also there is a sick policy in place that allows employees to call out sick as many times they please with out repercussions. Policies such as these make it so easy for employees to walk over managers."
good,"Great pay and benefits but as a GM there is little time for anything but work.  Lots of vacation time but little allowed time to use it.  Newer safety considerations allows for dismissal of position without investigation.  "
good,Overall Chipotle was a pretty encouraging place to work. Some managers were very hands off which lead to dysfunction in the line up front. Other managers were very hands on and made sure everyones days went well.
good,"It is an overall okay job!! Not bad pay but just not for me! It is fast paced, but it's a good experience to have for working with people. Working cash and line are some of the easiest things to work there."
good,"Strong work ethic and sense of urgency is required. I like the company as a consumer but working there is too stressful and labor intensive for its pay. If you want to move up, you can fairly quickly but be prepared to dedicate your life to chipotle."
good,"This job is a lot of hard work. You can learn some great kitchen skills but you are under extreme pressure from the moment you walk in the door. This job can be fun however, as long as you have the right manager."
good,I really enjoyed my time here! Very fun envoirnment and flexible scheduling. Very open and fun coworkers and overall very friendly customers.  would recommend
good,"I started working at chipotle when I was 16, and was very excited, two years later not that excited. I love cooking, and love working with my coworkers, but balancing my personal life with work is very difficult here, especially when management is disorganized. Working every station all in one day can get exhausting 😪. I would only recommend this job to students who want to build work experience"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"when you work at chipotle you got crew members showing you what to do "
good,Worked there for 1 year and half and job seemed awesome till the management was out of line ! Its all worth is but at the same time itd alot of stress !
good,"Work life was definitely fast paced and does not tolerate anything less. However, the people i worked with and management was fun to be with and made work more tolerable. All in all, it's how you perceive the work environment and your work ethic. Pay was average with little to no chance or raises, may be depending on location"
good,"Culture was bomb asf. It was like working in a big family. Management at my location was very insufficient. You could get as many hours as you wanted. But doing the same thing over and over was too much. I got Carpel tunnel true story. Like, went to the doctor and everything."
good,Chipotle is a good first step for someone who is entering the workforce. It is fast paced at times and can be stressful but hard work and determination are what I get out of working there. It is a challenge and I don’t back down.
good,It was a nice job. But I felt like I wasn't growing in the company. It's not the best fit for someone older looking for a career . This job is more so for teenagers and young adults
good,A great place to work if you want a high energy job that’ll really get you moving. If you like working with energetic people I highly recommend working here.
good,A typical day at chipotle consist of  a very fast paced and demanding time. Most of the day is super busy so your constantly having to stay on top of things to ensure your shift is ran smoothly. i learned how to stay more focused and more disciplined the time that i spent there.
good,Our manager edits your hours if you hit 40 or go into overtime so you are not compensated. People try to rack their hours but sometimes when nights are slow whether youre on schedule or not you or someone may be sent home because labor is higher than the sales made at that shift. It sucks and lowers your pay for the next paycheck. One of the reasons i intend on quitted sometime soon. Ridiculous.
good,"They have a system for being on the line, serving people. But no one followed it, ever. My first day I was put on Tortilla 1, which would be simply getting a bowl or putting a tortilla in the press. The people next to me handle the rest. I get being understaffed, but I'd be out there by myself half the time. Which I guess I wouldn't mind, if I'd gotten trained to handle the rest of the things on the line. I was trained for maybe 15 minutes (that's high-balling it) before my trainer sent me off to work Tortilla 1 by myself. She literally left, she'd gotten off work. I didn't stay there for very long. I had to do most everything else. I'd be told I'm doing things wrong when I'd never even been shown how to do them. After that first day I'd never received any additional training. I quit because things got too busy for school and the environment just wasn't for me."
good,Chipotle is a great job but it’s hot and they don’t work with your school schedule. They’re also really fast paced and you’re on your feet the entire time.
good,"I've had both ends of the spectrum at Chipotle.  I've had a highly competent, motivated, and awesome GM who actively cared about his store and his employees.  And then after he left we had a poor GM who fired off many people she didn't like for personal reasons and actually said she didn't care about store morale. And from there everything went downhill fast for a lot of people.  Over half the store quit or was fired within a 5 month period due to incompetent management and a lack of care for employees. Many people who were in line for promotion prior to her appointment as GM were immediately pushed off the list, even those in mid-training for their promotion, in favor of someone who didn't even meet the bare minimum to be in the position.  "
good,There is more drama at chipotle than a high school. I have been told multiple times that I am going to be made a manager and there has been no strides taken to make that a reality. Chipotle as a company DOES NOT care about their employees.
good,"I used to love working at chipotle, still do for the most part. But once you are on the management team your life is consumed with chipotle and it eventually takes a toll on you. I was told they would work aroundmy scheduled because i am a single mother. Now i hardly see my kid"
good,prep.setup.serve.we do have fun as a team lots of jokes.singing.learned cut .dice .mix.management has turned over 4 times in 10 months.hardest part working without enough BOH crew.the most enjoyable part is coming together as a team and doing our best.i also enjoy our regulars who come in with their kids on special days.baseball.soccer.birthday.graduation.work place culture is heartwarming too see young people from all over learning about each other and becoming friends.
good,When I began at Chipotle in 2014 I very much appreciated the amount of effort the company put into training and making sure we as crew and management were prepared to be a part of a team and create and empowering and productive work environment.
good,The management was very bad and unorganized. Workers were nice but were in the dark about a lot of stuff that was going on behind the scenes of the company. New CEO never told employees about changes happening until last minute.
good,"A typical day at work was starting your prep work, customer service, clean as you go and very fast paced. I learned how to multitask during peak times and stay clean and organized. The management was definitely not the greatest at that location but the rest of the team was great and fun. The hardest part of the job was the miscommunication and poor management.  On the days where I did work with a great manager and good solid team those were the most enjoyable and productive days."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Low pay, just a job to get you through to the next one. Don't make a career out of it because you'll still never make enough money like even as a store manager you make like 30k a year. Is that worth it.. no."
good,"I left chipotle for a couple of reasons:"
good,Good company to grow with at the time i was unable to make it further up the chain but was a good place to learned a lot of different lessons that would prepare me in life
good,"It was enjoyable to work with a crew that was my age range. the favoritism was real, leading to unequal opportunity for growth. morning we fine, pm were crazy."
good,"Depending on the Chipotle you work at, the experience can be vastly different. I worked 2 years at a great Chipotle in Pittsburgh and I learned so so much about being reliable, having integrity and a hard work ethic. I learned about the power of loving your work and the people around you. My manager was more of a mentor and my career flourished because of that. But slowly as I worked there longer, the company as a whole changed slowly over time and compromised on its morals and shifted its priorities. I moved to Las Vegas and the Chipotle here is horribly managed and the working environment is so stressful that I don't see myself wanting to move up anymore in this company. Once you are a salary manager, they can work you as long and as hard as they want. I've seen many of my friends rise and fall and I've seen that Chipotle only truly cares about one thing: money."
good,"Chipotle is a company that wants everything to be done with extreme precision and quality. As a food service industry, that is something that is exceptional and positive for the customers' experience. However, the treatment faced by many employees deemed less prominent can be seen as manipulative and sometimes straight domineering. My advice is to work here if you are a strong and focused individual who PREFERS a chaotic environment and lots of responsibility, because this job is an eventful one."
good,The food  is amazing and the fact that employee meals are free when working was a bonus. Very faced paced environment to work in depending on the location of the store.
good,Chipotle pays well for a beginning job. Its a good job to have while you are going to school they work with your schedule. The only thing is that they expect a lot from you.
good,"Very hard work with very little appreciation. The staff is fun to work with, but upper management needs to re-evaluate their people culture. If they would give people to recognition and compensation they deserve, they might have better retention."
good,"Chipotle focuses on their food and the employees, not to mention the guest satisfaction. I loved the people I worked with, and in the end, the work itself was just not for me. A typical day would run smooth, busy, a few hiccups here and there but my manager and I would keep it going strong. The hardest part of the job was the time expectations, everything is done by hand, every ingredient is chopped up, mixed and cooked on sight, nothing is frozen and it is all fresh. The time expectations are too much for 5 people on a shift to handle, with the amount of profit our restaurant was bringing in. The most enjoyable part was easily the teamwork, the confidence, the empowerment that the bosses put on myself and the crew members. We were a huge family. I learned how to manage my time, do things properly at a quick and steady pace, how to run a register, how to handle customer complaints and employee conflicts."
good,most days are busy I learned to work fast and cleanly customer can be aggressive customers are probably the hardest part but most are friendly and thankful I like to do dishes and clean
good,Chipotle is a great job to have when you are in need of learning the basic skills needed in having employment in a career or job. Chipotle can be fast pace but you can thrive in the work environment.
good,"A typical day at work consists of a usually fun atmosphere with co-workers, sometimes managers. Low volume store with some rushes. Would get frustrating at times because of angry and hungry customers.  I learned a little bit of other positions but unfortunately, I wasn't able to progress because of poor management. My GM was known to have a great attitude and pumps you up. Unfortunately, because the managers were so young, they didn't have enough time management to help train new employees properly and barely had people progress in other positions. Lots of favoritism. The hardest part of the job was learning your positions as well as being adaptable, fast paced, organized, etc. Very difficult for new comers who aren't necessarily used to that kind of environment. The most enjoyable was definitely my coworkers."
good,"You are responsible for leading a modest team with a lot of responsibility. They provide resources for your guidance and have a great support system in place when you are in role. Management, however, is prone to look out for only what benefits them personally and are unaccountable for poor management style."
good,"A typical day includes a manager or apprentice telling you what to do during allotted time either opening or closing a shift. You come in feeling good about your workday until others start coming in feeling upset because they get micromanaged from the moment they clock in until the moment they clock out. Management couldn't seem to care less about your personal life. They usually try to make you stay over your scheduled leave time even an hour or two after. If you start at a certain position (line, cook, prep) and you're good, management will most likely never train you on anything else. Really irritating when management could 'fool' around and do what they wanted but once a crew member does, it's a write-up. "
good,"During my stay at Chipotle I experienced quite a bit, good managers (the ones that keep I touch with their employees and vibe with them), bad ones (the type of managers that seem not to care, regularly aggravate employees and never give them insight to how the employee is doing). I also experienced huge amounts of stress during peak hours and often off of peak. At some points I’d be working with only 3 people in the back of the house due to a lack of extra employees available to come in, and or managers taking obscenely long meetings. Also the work is too much for just minimum wage."
good,This job is a great job but the managers are not the best and they dont think about their employees before anything else. This workplace is great to work around fellow employees but the managers dont always think about whats best for the employees
good,"The typical day of work was busy and fast-paced. Breaks were short, and the amount of work was sometimes overwhelming. It most definitely is a high energy environment. Co-workers were always doing as told, which kept the company productive and successful. The stress of the job was overwhelming and tiring, but not terrible. The vibe of the work place was stressful and slightly toxic. On the contrary, the most enjoyable part of the job was having frequent customers that were always loyal to the company due to our hard effort."
good,"This job was fantastic at first, but then it got stressful as everyone within the store became angry with each other. Not great management, either. Very biased as to who they like."
good,For people who love working in a fast food environment this is the place for you. But they have poor room for advancement not a lot of opportunities for everyone.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Working for chipotle was just very average, I spent along time there and felt pretty unfulfilled when I decided todo something else , hopefully can achieve more somewhere else"
good,"The day-to-day was really affected by season and weekend customer fluctuations. During the week, it could be dead slow, especially during autumn. During the summer, there was a steady stream of customers and it could get quite busy though was usually manageable. The winter holidays caused the work to be insanely stressful, with non-stop, and sometimes rude, customers. The work could become repetitive, and either mindbogglingly slow or so demanding that one felt they could never get anything done in time, which became really discouraging. It helps you learn to become really quick at a task, and to prioritize. Developing friendships with coworkers, free meals, and friendly customers were the most enjoyable parts of the job."
good,For a year and a half it was the best job I had been at. After some bad press they started changing how we prepared everything on a month to month basis . The sad part was there was nothing wrong with the practices . Chipotle was by far the cleanest rest. I have been in and took by far more precautions than anywhere else . The issues they had were that the stores having issues were managed poorly and not following procedure. Then they fired the co ceo and now the founder has left . when I left they had fired some of the better GM's and kept the ones that could talk a big game when the big guys were around but on a day to day basis they helped very little? Biggest issue not everyone is treated the same.
good,As my for Chipotle being my first job I was not a fan. The job itself was very hard as I remember but that might be because it was my first job but it was very stressful environment all the prep work is timed because chipotle is very popular everyone loves it so it was always busy and it was insane.
good,"a typical day at work was usually high in pressure. Deliveries were often not made from vendors, or missing product, preparing the food by hand in a sort amount of time, and always aiming to open earlier than our actual opening time, and the giant rush for lunch that would lead our customers in a huge line that would wrap around the whole store to the bathrooms from 11:30am/12p,m. until sometimes 3pm."
good,"The way that Chipotle works is that they like to promote within the company, so anyone that is being promoted to Kitchen Manager, Service Manger, Apprentice, and General Manager all started off as crew members. Which is great until we began losing managers out of the blue and our area managers were just having to promote people that weren't ready just to fill the space. This caused a lot of problems with the store such as; food orders being done incorrectly, inventory being wrong, and even the food being cooked incorrectly."
good,"As i work there, the managers were very demanding, and would not help the front line when needed. also at the end of the shift you would have to clean bathrooms and for the most part they never really checked if it was clean or not."
good,"Chipoltle is a very fast paced environment. I learned how to work with a team under pressure, I enjoyed the fact the manager would jump in and help out the crew members when needed. The hardest part of the job I would say was the customer volume, there would be a rush of customers at a certain time. The most enjoyable part would be the co-workers, they definitely made the job easier."
good,"Great job for people out of high school. Its a team base job, they interview you with the working staff before you talk to a manager if the staff says you are hired"
good,"Super Stressful and wants you to give your entire life to the store. You never have a day off, you never get to enjoy yourself. My upper management hated me because i had a life outside the store."
good,I worked on the line and it was exactly what I expected when I started working at Chipotle. I leaned how to roll a beautiful burrito and show off my skills to this day.
good,This job wasnt for me. I found out pretty quickly that the fast pace of fast food mexican food was not working out. The cashier store clerk was much better for me.
good,It was alright. Decently hard work. Decently well paid though not for the amount of work they expect out of you. But overall it was pretty good yeah it
good,"I feel as if it wasn't a Bi week pay it would make the job more simple but other than that it is cool for a part time job you have a very friendly.enviornment alot of people who are willing to Help, I enjoy It"
good,"Management was not very good, a good amount of people use drugs as well as disobey the rules set in place. It was fun and stressful most times, but there are good people in every company."
good,"At Chipotle I mainly performed work on the line as in helping to prepare meals for guests . At times I also prepared products that we serve . Many times I have washed dishes , wiped tables , and swept floors ."
good,"Things go great until you get to the point where higher and higher expecations are constantly set. You find yourself working 80 hours a week and even that's not enough when you become a GM and are sent to your new restaurant! (probably failing all it's financial reports). Enjoy the crew life, but be wary of the gold and glitter that is upwards mobility in management."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Whole management team was a cliche of younger women who weren't separating their personal lives and professional lives. Management didn't notice or seem to accept my wants to advance and learn more and try and move up, and instead pushed out anyone they didn't as a whole like and instead slowly pushed them out."
good,"I worked at Chipotle for under a year so I could support working on my Associate's Degree. It wasn't the perfect job, but it was money. You work like a horse with the constant threat of termination looming over you if you do your job too poorly. Overall very stressful but it put money in my pocket that I needed to make it through school."
good,"Chipotle has the right idea going, the had ways of motivating you, but career advancement was slow, and they had really high expectations. Some of the things I witnessed while working there was how management took advantage of certain individuals. Often having them work off the clock to finish the days work. They would have a sheet with expected completion of tasks, often times telling you to work faster than what is expected to increase production with no additional pay."
good,"intense and fast-paced,"
good,"the culture is young because they hire high school kids then promote them after few years. "
good,"A typical work day included overseeing all operations at the restaurant like managing crew members, food orders, inventory, administrative tasks like posting invoices and responding to emails. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting free food."
good,It was a very fast paced working environment. It requires standing on your feet for long periods of time. I really enjoyed working there and never got tired of the food.
good,I didn't go through training but I caught on to the job pretty quickly. Started out pretty well I was getting good hours for part - time and then my hours just diminished.
good,as a crew member you could open or close. crew members can do anything from being a cashier to working on the grill and making foo for the customerss.
good,"You are worked to your breaking point, and somehow nothing you do seems adequate to the mangers. They often times made comments about me to other employees that I would consider unprofessional, and indecent. I overall never felt like a valued team member. I was also improperly trained by another employee (whom was later fired for unrelated reasons) and never had this corrected when I brought it up to management. Even with that, the pay is decent and the benefits are great, though I never was able to take advantage of said benefits."
good,The management team would not respect your time and effort that you give to the company  and often would abuse the people that truly cared about career.
good,"we were short staff and was able to keep it together and work as a team , we empowered our team to be better at every station to prep fresh food to customers"
good,This job I felt as if I was working back in my high school days. It was a tad bit unorganized. I enjoyed my job that was given but it was not much evaluating and properly advancing so enjoy being in your title of employment and learn the ends and out.
good,"chipotle was very face paced, and you're pretty much constantly working, so it really improves your multitasking skills, but it isn't a very fun job, and there's basically no way to get a raise or advance unless you want to work there for 10 years. Good for a 16 year old though, and you do get a free meal, but corporate is a pain, a useless pain. they throw out tons of food, but are strict about portions. Customers usually treated the staff as second class citizens."
good,Chipotle was alright for my first job. I think I would've stayed longer if management wasn't so hard on you for one little mistake. But you can't get enough of the discounts and the shifts are fair for everyone who wants to be paid. Almost 8 or more hours a day(depending if your full or part time).
good,"The Good: its a job, it’s steady income, free meals, for the most part it’s like a second family, I’ve been promoted three times within the 5 months of my chipotle employment (it’s easy to move up), you get to wear jeans and a hat to work."
good,"I learned everything I know, "
good,"The environment was very friendly, team work oriented, everyone helped each other when needed. Learned that working as team things gets done in an orderly and timely manner."
good,Line Cook Job Description. Line cooks are the cooks who are assigned particular tasks in the kitchen like grilling or cutting ingredients required for the preparation of dishes. They usually do not participate in the administration activities of the kitchen. The line cooks are miscellaneous workers.
good,"I'm sure it differs from region to region but my experience was not great. The DM would shout profanities at us in the cooler and frequently threaten to fire. However, it is my understanding that he is no longer with the company."
good,It was very enjoyable for the first few months. The work wasn’t difficult as long as you worked with your team. After about 4 months of being there my location got a new manager and that’s when everything changed. He had no experience in managing and it completely ruined the restaurant . He was so bad a his job that a service manager that had been there for 3 years just stopped showing up. It was aweful.
good,"I had to quit because of schooling and work was just too much of a load, they didn’t really work with my schedule when I asked them to but they did work with me to find a better position suited for my skills"
good,"worked at Chipotle full-time "
good,Don't plan to try to apply to this place if you're lazy because they will work you well at least mine did. Dealing with rude customers comes with the job and be prepared.
good,"A well company to start experience with. The hours are flexible which is a pretty great advantage. Co-workers are generally friendly. Your're able to be around amazing people, your're able to help each crew member you hire and they become the best version of themselves."
good,"The workers were always stressed, especially cooks. Manager took advantage of some crew workers like asking them to clock out but take lunches  later."
good,This was my first cook job and it was a great experience just for what it was a first job to advance in the restaurant field. The managers was not the best to work with they always messed up the schedule.
good,"Chipotle is a great company with a great product, but it's uncertain future has lead to development stagnation and talent shortages. Although the immediate future may be in question, if Chipotle continues to deliver a strong, sustainable product, it will continue to be a great employer."
good,"This place its very competitive and fast paced at the same time. They will not offer you a lot of hours if you are part time because of all the other co-workers.  If you are willing to work not a lot of hours but get paid very well, this place its for you."
good,"Chipotle was a get-by job.  They don't really value their employees.  Most line employees are chosen by the other employees, which leads to favoritism in the positions."
good,"chipotle was is an okay job , sadly not for me the whole lemme get extra rice even though i gave you extra rice was gonna make me explode . Overall this job got old pretty quick ."
good,"the management at the location i worked at was horrible. i am a full time college student, and i was working PART-TIME. I asked a month in advance to be off during finals weeks because i really needed that week to study. i was scheduled 38 hours that week."
good,Had a good time working there learned a lot about the food industry but poor lack of management led me to leave the company would recommend it to people who want to get there hands in the restaurant business
good,the work culture was fine. everyone got along perfectly and made friends with each other. the pay is not worth the labor even though you get free food and discounts. scheduling is a nightmare.
good,"Many of the managers weren’t willing to consider the crew’s opinion about how to make the store better, which led to them stressing themselves out. "
good,"I was pressured to do so much outside of my role. I was in the store more then the GM was but when i tried to confide in my field leader , she though nothing of it and just kept telling me to hang tight. She never praised me for what I did or even compensated me for my time."
good,"I learned how to prep meals in a very limited time period. My typical day consisted of opening, first prepping the cold foods that would be on the line, the setting up the line, setting up patio and cleaning the front of the house to make sure it looks presentable when customers walk through the door. Throughout the day I was either serving and maintaining a clean line or I was ringing up customers, maintaining the front of the house and answering the phone. I believe that management did not treat crew members with much respect."
good,A company known for their team mentality and a very close knit work culture. Food safety was of the highest importance. The ability to move up within the company was very strong
good,The quality of the food was good. But it was too fast paced and they were too far behind on washing dishes. They should have kept up on dishes. The dishes should have been soaked longer. They should have had more sinks. I worked at a hospital that had 10 sinks and they had enough staff to keep up with them. They hired people who had criminal records so that they could demand a faster pace. I don't have a criminal record so I should not have had to work with people who did.
good,"Over All I enjoyed working at Chipotle. I would work there again, if offered management position. I enjoyed the cohesive teamwork and easy going attitude overall."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"When I worked here, the only thing that satisfied me was the money that I would be getting from my hours. As a minor, they had me work hours that I wasn't supposed to work. The manager was crazy and the customers weren't always friendly."
good,"Not much to say  about this place, it's not for everybody. it's a fast pace enviorment and takes a lot of back bone to deal with the dramatics in their."
good,"Typical day starts with walking into the building, putting on an apron and washing your hands, then cleaning up and preparing food and interacting with customers."
good,This is a great place to work for a first job with great pay! I enjoyed working there but the management wasn't great and I received very little hours.
good,If things weren't together then everything was chaotic. Needs better management in certain criteria. Also depends if you get along with your team or not.
good,"Lots of fast-paced work, lots of yelling across the kitchen. Customer service is nice, lots of talking to customers. Employees are always doing something."
good,"Chipotle takes forever to get you on the schedule after being hired, and management don't really care your personal life no matter what it is they just won't you miss out on life and work even when it's emergencies"
good,There was too much going on without organization. STaff members were poorly train and could not hold their own weight in crucial situations. Never again.
good,"I work as a prep cook/dishwasher.  I would prep work until the restaurant closed and wash dishes before leaving for the night.  Some of the management were understanding, but others were somewhat rude.  The hardest part of the job was closing."
good,if u like a fun fast paced job chipotle is the way too go to give yourself a little challenge. u have to be motivated because the work will pile up on you. you now everyone loves chipotle lol
good,"There was always to much work out on certain people,and it made people bossy because they didn’t wanna do the work themselves and would leave it on the good workers. An the mangers couldn’t even tell who was doing all the work."
good,"Chipotle was a fun place to work for, and kept their locations very clean. There food was prepared fresh daily and there was never a lack of business."
good,"setting up and maintain the kitchen "
good,Never had a bad experience until new management was brought in. New management was not good at all. Not fully aware of the culture or guidelines. bad.
good,While working at Chipotle and PREGNANT the grill person shoved me purposely. I mentioned this issue to my manager and notified her and she stated that she will take care of the problem but when I came in the very next day it was NOT taking care of. I will not recommend because obviously they didn't care about the safety of myself and my unborn child.
good,its a great starter job for young teens looking to get some job experience. as my first job it taught me many skills that I can still use to this day.
good,Great environment good people just poor management when it  comes to scheduling and taking days off when Life has  unexpected things come your way. I really encourage them to work on communication skills and think about others.
good,did nothing wrong was working for a little over 3 months then laid off decided not to keep me as crew member completed all training and was doing good in my opinion seem to hire a lot of people then fire them within several months...
good,"Opens later in the morning just in time for lunch and closes pretty early. Due to this, work hours are less from 5 to 8 hours. You are standing up the whole time while taking in orders. You learn how to roll giant burritos."
good,"great place to learn basic culinary skills. pay is ok. POC shouldn't work @ the locations in the South imo but other than that, its good food and you serve good people"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,I had a great experience their even though a lot of times were not professional. The worst part is the favoritism that would happen from the management above me.
good,"· Served customers on the front line and cash register."
good,"At the beginning of working there, they want you to get everything in the first week. If you need time to get the hang of it, they'll heckle you until you cut corners to make the time or another batch of new employees come in. If you don't match the personalities there, they'll purposely assign unrealistic goal in order to say your not meeting protocol and will cut your hours until you leave."
good,"Recommends"
good,"Overall the job requires quick thinking and a very purpose driven movements. It is a great experience for the most part, the higher management at the particular store I work at is not always consistent with his attitude toward different employees. He will get mad at some for small things and then pass off big things with other employees that another would get fired or warnings for."
good,The job was an alright entry point to actually working. It was pretty laid back and didn't have too much responsibility but there were definitely times where there was too much work for how many people were there. ALSO growth there is not easy. Was basically promised a promotion that was then given to someone else without my knowledge.
good,Chipotle is a fast paced job where you will need to always have a sense of urgency. The company puts emphasis on making sure everyone understands the vision and culture of the restaurant.
good,"I loved the job it had some great people there but the management wasn’t great, I got a lot of calls on my days off during the week and I didn’t like that very much."
good,"If you do work here just learn to balance things out and be open minded. The co-workers are great, its just the lack of communcation with the mangers to the team."
good,"Everyone coming in had to be prepared to work, and were given a position for the day. Always prepping and cooking food. Always cleaning and assisting customers.  It was stressful because even though we had to work as a team, it was not a team environment."
good,"People at chipotle were very hardworking almost to the point they were over working themselves. It was a great work experience, I left because of they're lack of consideration of my availability. I worked full-time but was also a full-time student which requires study time at least once a week and a lot of homework. I can recall a lot of times when they scheduled me 15 minutes after my classes, knowing my school and chipotle wasn't walking distance. I enjoyed my work experience there but now I'm looking into third-shift work."
good,the work home life balance is not there. the hours expected for a manager or very high and stores are very busy and hard to keep staffed with some of the higher ups coming in and putting them down
good,Chipotle was a good work place until they let go of the general manager who hire me.. He was a understand guy. I stayed because im not a quieter. The new Gm feed me hopes and dream for 3 month
good,Fun place to work my manager was great had a wonderful experience working here! Interacted with a bunch of people! And enjoyed really being out in the public.
good,was a job that learned new things and learned new skills and met new people. Loved my managers and can say it was the best job i had to date. Enjoyed everything no complaints
good,"Cooked food to order. Seasoned, cooked, and cut all meats according to"
good,"As a salaried manager be prepared to hit the ground running! It is unlike any food environment. The focus on high standards and expectations is amazing. FOOD SAFETY IS A MUST. The food is fresh and delicious. "
good,It was a decent place to work while going to school. It was not a job that I cared to continue with but they treat their employees fair and have great opportunity for advancement.
good,Chipotle is a good job if you want to work for a company that treats you better than most fast food joints. It is not easy though. Those lines can get long
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Very hard work for very little pay. They expect you to be perfect, and they will make sure everyone knows when you aren't. If you work with the right people though, it can be fun."
good,It's cool if you don't like Fast paced job then this job is not for you but overall it's a nice job it has nice people there and a very nice environment
good,It was a nice place. But sometimes what you did was not even tak8ng into consideration. To say I can tell the management is not the same. And the culture of the company is really poor
good,Working at chipotle felt like a rollercoaster. There were good days and bad days. The managers seem to enjoy putting pressure on employees unnecessarily. The pressure causes unnecessary stress. Managers are unapproachable. There is no open door policy.
good,"the percs are great, especially if you have a family, however, the management is hit an miss, in my case the management was really poor, and would often times have the crew finish out the managers work."
good,The typical day at work had high and low points. The manager was consistent with giving me frequent hours and understanding when i left due to moving and health issues. Overall a good place to work.
good,"good place to work, learn a lot of things specially how to deal with people but got tired of working in a restaurant not my thing after about 15 years."
good,If you like to work in a fun fast paced environment with fun people this is the place to be. Great learning experiences and lots of opportunity to move up from within the company
good,"Chipotle needs to give more opportunity to people of color, I feel like the higher managers only cater to a certain color. And I find that chipotle is sexist having most of the woman to serve in the front and keep all the man in the back to prep."
good,The winter park location was one that always seemed unorganized and understaffed but promotion and advancement was not difficult if you are a hard worker.
good,Feel like they should help people move up more also should care more about their employees and make sure that they tried to make their employees better at their job
good,"Typical duties included serving customers food, preparing everything before rush time. Had to perform cleaning tasks everyday. Had to clean the whole restaurant after we close as we did not have cleaners. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with. The least enjoyable part of the job was the organisation of everything."
good,"A normal day in the morning shift includes morning prep starting at 08:30 with a 10 minute break around 09:00 and a 30 minute break before 10:00 . Then I would cook,serve customers, or be on the cash register(depending on personnel) from when we open at 10:30 until approximately 14:00 when we have a 10 minute break. Then I would work on afternoon prep (depending on the customer flow) and work on that until I clocked out at 1600. It was a very fun and informative workplace where most of the coworkers were friends and we motivated and pushed each other to get better until we became a restauranteur store. Once I transferred to a different store it was a different culture and less motivated crew members. The big issue was the frequency of the break down in communication between management and a lack of a centralized store vision. This company has its high points and low points, but it is all a learning experience that will help you grow as a person"
good,many changes. poor management. fun environment. flexible work schedule that allowed as many hours or as little hour as necessary. good stepping stone or starter job.
good,"The job can be very busy, where there is always something to do. Have to be able to multi-task and work at times on your own to finish tasks. Can be fun at times."
good,"the fact that chipotle has high standards and practice serv safe i really enjoyed working there,family orientated and most locations are people friendly with the 13 characteristics,the works are under paid"
good,A typical day was usually very busy you have to be able to multitask and time management is key. The most difficult part is keeping up with the fast paced environment.
good,I did not work here for long but in my experience its a fast paced job but doable. The coworkers that i worked with wasnt the nicest and thats the worse part of the job . You want to go to work to feel comfortable not hating each other.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"the food is great, the benefits are great and the crew with the exception of the general manager at the ventura location are great. other than that management is lazy on training people and only promote the ""favorite "" employees. not all locations are like this one but until the GM is gone this store gets 3 out of 5 stars."
good,Chipotle was great to me I started as there take out specialist and i ended my career with a Service Manager title. Restaurant life is definitely time consuming and you feel like your living there at one point or another. However I absolutely loved working here but at the end of five years I decided that I needed a career change with having a second baby and all.
good,"Co-workers were amazing, had very flexible hours for students, very fast paced, and energetic. It's definitely a job for those who are looking to gain some experience in restauranteur."
good,With chipotle easy advancement. Would refer if you just have a job and looking for a career. A lot of hard work but your success depends on you. Once you crack management totally different story.
good,Chipotle was an excellent place to work to work at because of the people that worked there with you. I only wished the managers could be nicer and make the place more enjoyable to work there.
good,"Allows flexibility in work schedule, this was very important while I finished my last year of high school. It is a fun place to work. I love to interact with the customers, they make being at work exciting."
good,"Some places are fun, some are bad, I like that they are willing to hire anyone as a manager if you work hard enough. Its not an easy job, but the people usually make it worthwhile."
good,It is a fun place to work at.  You meet a lot of different people while working there. You learn how to prepare food while getting cooking experience.
good,This is a great company and a great job culture. There is a lot of drama throughout the crew workers though. I would like it if people came and did their job and not talk.
good,Overall if you are looking for your first job it is perfect for you. They teach you everything and teach you how to be a top performer. Some of the mangers can be rude and harsh on you. But other then that working with the people you love can be fun sometimes.
good,"I learned a lot working for chipotle. I learned about how to be more personable with other employees and to help raise others up around you to create a wonderful team environment that is more similar to a family. I honed in my knife skills and learned to take pride in the cuts that I made and how to empower others to provide great work too. The most taxing part of this job, which is ultimately why I left, is the amount of work for the rate of pay is not nearly what it should be. Raises are capped at like 15 cents, which is understandable for a corporate business, but I take myself much more seriously in this line of work and I'm worth way more than $11.25 an hour for an assistant manager position for the amount of work needed to do the job."
good,"A typical day involved prepping all the food. Everything was fast paced, but the workers lacked energy and were always negative towards the job and others. The managers were more demanding and lacked the ""leadership"" qualities that chipotle represents in each of there managers."
good,"they management was okay, you do get free food which is nice. not really a fan of the work outfits thou. I would recommend a college student working here."
good,First job after highschool. Good for gaining experience and for first time workers or college students. Isnt too stressfull and pay is decent. Would recommend
good,Typical day at work consists me getting there around 8 am and starting to make chips and cut limes and lemons for the food station. Ensuring that the customers food is satisfactory and then cleaning the dining area after customers leave.
good,In short chipotle states they have a large focus on culture. To their credit may of the employees they hire display this. However management at least in my direct experience are not organised and cold to the point of being callous.
good,"They have a high demand for cleanliness and care about the quality of their food. They make everything from scratch and it can teach you some basic skills in knife skills, timing, and grilling meats. They offer great service to their customers."
good,"A fast paced and typically friendly work environment with flexible hours that are ideal for working while enrolled in school or recently graduated. Opportunity for advancement within the company if enough hard work and shown interest is put forth. Downside is that because most of the employees are teenagers and or young adults there is a certain lack of productivity that occasionally takes place, which can be frustrating to those with a high work drive."
good,"Always opportunities to learn something new. "
good,"Chipotle is a very busy and very popular chain. A typical day consists of manning the station you are assigned, taking customer orders and maintaining a clean, presentable, and fast-paced environment."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Customer service was great managers do it take the time to train properly work hours great incinitives great close too home for travel!! Great people to serve
good,"Great crew! Most of the managers are amazing! Chipotle sets you up with the most beneficial skills multitasking, moving fast, working hard, and time management."
good,I do not like chipotle because the management there is very poor. They do not appreciate their hard working employees as much as they should. They would rather keep hiring new people vs respect the good ones they have.
good,"The lunch and dinner rushes were pretty crazy, but aside from that, the job wasn't extremely fast paced. Know the recipes and be able to act happy even if you aren't, and you should be good to go."
good,Very good food clean environment great managers everyone's there is easy to get along with very fast pace and has a job Grill person has to do a lot stay on top of everything
good,"the energy was awesome, the workers were friendly. the job was pretty much self explanatory even though i still had to be taught how to do the job. my hours were really good."
good,"Its was a good company to work the manager it was a good person with us, time goes fast we were always busy and the time goes fast. We got only 15 minutes lunch."
good,"A typical day at work was very fast paced and filled with interactions. I learned how to effectively work with and depend on a team. Management often mixed business with pleasure. The workplace culture was mostly positive. The hardest part of the job was keeping up your work ethic and poise on a very busy day. The most enjoyable part was meeting different people and cultures,and bonding with co workers while getting the job done."
good,Manager had different rules for each employee.  Never could get a strait answer on procedures and rules.  No clear rules that didn't change from one day to the next.
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,My day included me serving and preparing the steak and greeting customers if I was on front line. I was also responsible for making sure bathrooms and other areas of the restaurant stayed clean and neat. Being here I learned a lot about time management because of how easily I lost my job on my birthday. Management could've been a lot better it was a lot of miscommunication and confusion towards the end of my days. The work culture was diverse and people were too. The hardest part of this job was most definitely clean up at the end of the day. My most enjoyable part of Chipotle was the foods and queso .
good,Developed great management and leadership skills.  We were proud to provide a great work environment and culture all team members could be proud of.  Very passionate team.
good,it wasnt for me if you are food prep you will have to chop everything a particullar way or else they would throw it out you will have to clean the entire restaurant at times also make you do dishes even tho that was not in your job description
good,"a typical day at work consisted of making a deployment sheet for employees, doing inventory count, and helping crew members with their work as well. I would maintain a safe work place as well as a fun work place where employees can learn from each other and benefit from one another. I make sure each employee is staying on top of their tasks and keep them motivated and working hard."
good,I had a fun time with all my coworkers. I enjoyed them we all became friends and always hung out after work. But the fun was good while it lasted. As everyone started going back to school things became stressful. I was a part time working full time hours with no benefits
good,Help customers with their orders through the line. Ring them out at the cash register. Clean the dining room at the end of the shift. Make sure the guests are well token care of.
good,"This job is not for the weak. It is ALWAYS busy and without the right management, it can break you. I worked with a horrible team so I wanted to quit every time I walked in the store BUT with a better team, it can be a good job. Employees get a free meal every time they work and 50% off on any other day."
good,"I enjoyed the full blown teamwork demonstrated by my crew . Almost as if we were all family , of different backgrounds and races . But as we were working I thouroughly enjoyed being there ."
good,A very good place to work good environment helpful team members good bosses a great company to grow can learn a lot at this job benefits are good I liked working there
good,This place was a great tool to use for an entry level position.  In this case individuals will work and learn.  Then quickly learn that is imperative to switch careers.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Good people and fun environment. Asked to do a lot for what they pay though. wage is not competitive anymore. Area Managers have unrealistic expectations of their supervisors.
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"the people I worked with felt like family. unfortunately I was supposed to be the next kitchen manager, but instead two people who I trained received the promotion over myself;lf"
good,If you want to pursue a career here make sure you are extremely dedicated to the vision. A lot of drama goes on in between management and crew. Thanks.
good,"Great energetic, dedicated, helpful individuals. Clean environment, reasonable hours, busy work. Requires alertness, speed, and diligence. Good food, good training program."
good,"It was a fun job, good food, decent benefits. New management was not very good with communication, and was not willing to work around my school schedule"
good,"Handled guest complaints, maintaining a positive dining experience for all restaurant patrons. Handled and prepared all single orders faxed in for lunch, as well as catering orders from 20-200 people. Single-handedly assured that preparation of all food was presentable and take-out orders were handled and sent out in a timely manner. Collaborated with co-workers and managers to ensure the delivery of efficient, high-quality service."
good,"Fun place to work, great culture food and management. There too much to do, not enough time or crew. They want everything chopped by hand, like get a food processor, so what if its not hand chopped?"
good,"...and by entry level, I mean first-job -- not the buzzword used to make sure you know you won't be paid very well. As a crew member, you'll be expected to crosstrain on MOST of the stations (line, grill, dishwash, etc) and basically be flexible should someone not show up (it'll happen. a lot.). "
good,Alot of customer service. Hint restaurant. Good place always staying busy making you better each day. Training available so not thrown to the wolves. Okay.
good,"Work place culture is fast pace, has cleanliness, mandatory sanitations, food validation, high restaurant standards, great customer service, open lines of communications, and constantly empowering one another."
good,"Our time is managed very closely, must be a fast worker to fare well with the company. The people tend to be good to work with. Coworkers that do very little work will not be with the company for long. It is a good place for serious workers looking to start out in a career."
good,The job was ok at first but then my hours started to drop and I wasn't moving on like the others were but the job was awesome and fun to work at. But I wouldn't recommend anyone working there.
good,"this is the job for those individuals that are in high school, because the hours are flexible. everyone works as a team to satisfy customers, sometimes there are miscommunications but overall everyone are always prepare."
good,"chipotle is a great environment to work with good people on a daily basis, however there would be shifts where I didn't get a break from 7 a.m. until 6 p.m."
good,The people were nice and they liked to help me learn about the different areas of the work place. I learned really quickly and the job was easy and time went by fast.
good,"It is always busy so it takes a lot out of you especially if someone doesn't show  up which seems to be everyday, the co-workers can be great and the food is great."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"A typical day at work would be arriving promptly either before or at eight am. You pull all your prep from the walk in after washing your hands then you set up your station. You must have everything ready by ten thirty am. Chipotle is a very busy company so it put me on a top notch pace. I learned how to work accurately, fast, clean, and friendly all at once. The culture of our job was very mixed. The hardest part of the job is during a rush when you have a line out or  to the door. A easy way to bypass that is making sure your stocked and staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job is creating different mixtures for customers. I always loved when a customer trust my taste buds."
good,maintain a positive attitude through the whole store. Provide each and every customer with great hospitality and give them nothing but the food to want them to come back again.
good,"It is not a professional job so the people are not really professional, but they are very nice and easy to get a long with. You can have a flexible schedule and management is willing to train you to move up to management if you express the willingness to learn."
good,Nice place to work. Fun fast pace. Good company to advance with. Very busy at times. Need to be able to work well under pressure. The environment can be fun and challenging and rewarding. They are a result based company.
good,"Work was fairly easy to accomplish, put spoonfuls of food onto a tortilla and pass it down the line. "
good,This is a great place for hard working individuals and those who are not afraid of hard work and gaining precision cutting skills with a knife. Great place for advancement
good,Managed a crew of 20 to follow the culture of the company which was freshness that came from all natural ingredients.  At the time of my employment this was a new brand to the Charlotte area.
good,working at chipotle is really fun but they expect to much from you and make you study and you have to know the vision and a whole bunch of stuff that is really unnecessary
good,"I liked working at chipotle. the co-workers were nice and welling to help you, but get really chaotic in rush hours. the manager was very helpful and taught the crew members well"
good,"Chipotle used to be a fun place to work at, but as company cutbacks and profit driven incentives increased more pressure was place on the few employees working."
good,Chipotle can be a great place to work under the right conditions. I learned about customer service and how rewarding it can be to deal directly with consumers. Work environment is heavily dependent on the management team and varies greatly from store to store.
good,"Blah place, very friend oriented. If you were cool with management you got away with any and everything. If not you were considered chopped liver. party house"
good,During the shift managers always urged growth timing when we would do stuff to ensure we that would could do our jobs as fast as possible without mistakes. I learned how to work well with customers and how to ensure a excellent restaurant experience.
good,"You go in open store up, make sure everyone is given a task to complete in time. This company is okay if you like to be over worked and get payed a small portion of what you actually deserve. I was one of the few lucky people who finlly moved up after slaving days, working double shifts, and constantly asking to be taught a new station. Chipotle has not been the same ever since the ecoli outbreak. They care more about the customers than your well being in the company. The old school chipotle was the best if you ask me. The best part of this job is actually the people you meet. Chipotle does hire the best people. At least from all the stores i have worked out i have grown to care for the crew members, we become family and care for each other. But chipotle is all about competition when it comes to moving up."
good,"Very strict, and very little laid back times. I loved everyone I worked with, and the management was good. I enjoyed the free meal every shift, but I did not like the hours."
good,You'll have some hard work ahead of you if you're on grill duty. Get ready to have your arms and legs and back hurt at the end of the day.
good,"Learned alot about serving food with quality. fast paced, friendly."
good,This job is very faced paced but can be also fun. Definitely room for structured advancement. A lot of work but very detailed and organized.
good,"Great job for college students. Long hours make it inappropriate for high school students. Free food while at work. 50% discount when off schedule, but only at location you are employed at."
good,"The management team is very encouraging. Some leads were better than others, but overall they all make sure you are properly trained."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,The workplace was not productive with an entire staff dedicated to goofing off more than working. Aside from this the manager would flip from an immature kid to proper manager whenever their supervisor would stop in. Leading to a less than favorable work experience.
good,It was an okay job but nothing special. Management was often disorganized and at times i was forced to go on lunch at the beginning of an 8 hour shift. This job is good if you want to stay for a short period of time.
good,This particular store is very stressful and tense. The crew does not respect the managers and the managers do not respect the crew.
good,"I opened the store in Salsa, meaning that I would make the salsas every morning and we would have 3 hours to make food for the rest of the day. When the store would opened, I typically was serving only salsas and around the end of my shift, I would have to make another batch of food for the night crew."
good,"I am grateful for the opportunity to work for this establishment. I Followed recipes, prepared food throughout the day as needed, served hot and cold food items to customers"
good,"Though Chipotle has amazing food and great culture of crew members, they lack love for their job. It becomes a hassle to remember everything management throws at you and they dont take the extra time to create a better team who motivate eachother from within not only when under pressure."
good,"Chipotle has an amazing system of teaching customer service to others.  In addition, how to create an amazing work environment with your fellow team members and management staff."
good,"Very strict here but that showed me that the store truly cared about their reputation and their customers. However, it was great place to work in because employees all got along and overall the atmosphere/environment was great."
good,great people to work with can can be very challenging at first. once you get the hang of it it can be extremely fun and exciting
good,the job was really fast paced and a great first job to have. but as i grew older the job became too demands for how little i was getting paid. sometimes the boss would have his favorites and treat everybody a little bit different. hardest part of the job
good,"Very fast paced, high stress environment. Excessive hours beyond scheduled hours required by management. Good learning experience for young workers."
good,This was a great place to work even though the management wasnt the best on communication.I learned great ways to talk to people and communicate with customers.
good,"I learned different types of foods, how to work in a team, and food preparations. Management was nice. Customers were nice as well. Overall good experience."
good,Chipotle is a very fast-paced restaurant.  My co-workers were pretty cool. The hardest part for me was staying on my feet for 8-9 hours.
good,i had to work hard here but people made it more fun. daily tasks involve a lot of cleaning and preps depending on what your position is.
good,the overall experience was amazing I learned a lot in the company about customer service and having high standards for ever aspect of the work place. over a 4 year span I worked my way up to assistant GM then decided I would like to try something new because I didn't have much of a personal life. I enjoy working but the amount of stress I had to deal with on a daily basis didn't add up to the pay I was getting. its a great company to grow from but I feel I need something new.
good,"I just felt that the location i was at has bad management. They tend not to follow chipotle culture, and would not take any responsibility for the lack of leadership and communication."
good,"Chipotle is a great company. Easy to move up. Fum place."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"time flies, nice coworkers, a lot of customer service, great food, opportunities to move up, not many hours, long time on your feet but its worth it, good pay"
good,"When I was working there everything was so inconsistent and the staff partied like they didn't have to work tomorrow, and then very hung-over, they stumbled in to work."
good,"Although Chipotle is a great company to work for and provides great benefits it does suck up most of your life."
good,"Chipotle is a great company because of the culture they have built and maintained around their employees, not to mention having a great business model. My challenges stemmed from the hours I worked, most shifts cut into my day and didn't allow for much else besides work, which was difficult especially while working in the city and attending school in the Bronx. The fast-paced work environment however, did help me develop a strong sense of urgency and an efficient work ethic which is something that you carry throughout any job. It definitely was a lot to learn at first, but if you apply yourself, you can get through it and be one of the best. With that being said, its difficult to stand out and gain recognition for growth opportunities. The location I originated from, it was difficult to integrate myself into the established dynamic and therefore even more difficult to climb the ladder."
good,"this is a great place if you like a good atmosphere with your co-workers, they arent just co-workers they are your friends! I never had a bad experience working here."
good,I have learned working with customer service how to pre prep food for the Moring make burritos on the line able to answer the phone make call in orders .
good,"the company is not a good company, where i worked they was racist and they cu hours and gave hours to people who they liked. i worked full time and only received 22 hours"
good,"Chipotle's crew members are one of a kind and work very hard, sometimes way to much for what it is worth. The skills you learn are forever imbedded in you; from simply learning how to cut properly to learning more important things such as food safety. The downside to all of this is it only takes one bad manager running a shift to completely and totally lose your enthusiasm for chipotle."
good,Really fun. As you progress through management Superiors are never on the same page. There is no clear path for success. Field leaders are not too encouraging. Very degrading to crew.
good,Very fast pace I learned to be very open with communicational skills at the cashier and  I definitely developed skills and experience in many different ways.
good,My review on my previous job was not the best experience but I got what I need to understand how to run a shift as well as be apart in a team and create a culture that many people feel that they are important not only to the business but as well to their leaders.
good,"Good food, fun coworkers, clean work environment, fast paced, room to develop and move up, the management could have been better. Our GM would close the store to yell at us in the back of house."
good,"False advertised appreciation, you get pushed to your limits and are expected to do several things all at once when its not humanly possible. They bring you up & when the chance comes along they bring you down. They try to forcefully make you believe in their vision and instill it in others"
good,"As a General Manager with Chipotle Mexican Grill my responsibilities include all aspects of the hiring process, from application review to orientation and training.  I also had a firm focus on building strong relationships with my customers and crew, controlling P+L, building sales through different marketing and outreach strategies and ensuring the serving of safe and delicious food  "
good,"Fast paced. But if you have a good team who knows what they're doing you'll be alright. Management kind of okay, they could be better they face a lot of pressure from higher management."
good,"- a typical day involved prepping/cooking food; training new hires and current team members; developing potential future managers; helping customers as quickly and efficiently as possible"
good,"Learned about food prep, kitchen safety, opeing and closing protocols as well. Highly enjoyed the team I worked with. Loved learning their recipes."
good,This jobs boost your overall view of self and working together as a team. Pretty fun environment yet very hectic and demanding.
good,"I enjoyed talking to the customers, and serving the customers but the management was not right for me. but me overall I loved working there but because of  management I left chipotle."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of many different objectives and assisting co-workers if in need of help. Management was rough, too many in training and none agreed with each other. Great people to be around and work with though. Made me feel like a part of the crew immediately which led to very enjoyable work days."
good,"The company has great benefits but the company culture that used to be a strength has really declined.  The company prefers to promote from within which provides ample opportunity for advancement.  However, the training comes from within stores which is inconsistent."
good,"Great crew, but asked for way too much for what i was getting paid. & took advantage with over time and never paid the overtime."
good,I loved working at chipotle. the people were awesome to work with and sometimes I got to make food for some of the spurs players
good,"fast pace, customer satisfaction guarantee type of environment anything less then this is not excepted. this is by far the cleanest fast food establishment I have seen."
good,"The environment is really rough and fast paced and you don't have much freedom at all , every second is monitored that you don't engage in and that is not paid."
good,"Chipotle is an amazing restaurant.  However, after working two stints with the company and attaining the position of Service Manager I wanted to see about getting involved again with the company and was told I would have to start all over again.  "
good,I enjoyed working at Chipotle and the people were friendly. It was usually busy and I learned to work at a fast pace while serving friendly faces. The management was awesome and very helpful. The hardest part of the job was learning so much in a short amount of time. The other employees were knowledgeable and helpful in every aspect.
good,"great company, also with great opportunities. "
good,Great place to learn how to produce a high amount of quality product. The company is growing very fast so it provides a changing environment with different things every day.
good,I learned many cooking and cleaning skills at chipotle that I did know before. Some of my co-workers were nice and chill and some were not but that is life.
good,Very realistic opportunities for those willing to commit themselves to their own work AND helping others to succeed.  The people you work with are awesome and everyone works together to make great things happen.
good,Was a cool environment to work in. The coworkers were fun to work with. Can get very busy from time to time. Manager was very rude.
good,"Really fast paced place to work, I enjoyed it though. I would absolutely work there again. The hardest part was rolling HUGE burritos."
good,"Work with great people but managers expect a LOT of you for $9 an hour. Great entry level job to get some kitchen experience though. Good benefits like tuition reimbursement. If you cannot multi task and tolerate rude customers, then Chipotle isn't for you. Management at my Chipotle was over the top. Barely any room for advancement, hard to get hours. 5/10"
good,"It's a fantastic company, but it has fell behind since they went to E-verify after the US government swept the Chipotles in Minnesota.  After the heavy fines they quietly started downsizing the Ohio Markets in 2010 and 2011.  All GM and up into all the offices were replaced with young adults to revamp the government fine for deporting all the illegals.  So therefore everyone lost their jobs to replace us with lower waged managers, Human resources, accounting department and so on.  They told many of us to leave and they were nit picking ways to fire us that was unorthodox.   However all restaurants downsize these days to keep their bottom line profitable especially the corporate chains."
good,fast paced fun great benefits and good starting pay managers dont arrive on time causing everyone else to be tardy. gret place to work with benfits as well
good,"I literally interviewed with 3 managers as each time I called the other manager was clueless that I already did the interview and passed to next step with the other manager. When I had questions about paperwork, could not reach anyone to help me with the application. No one calls you back to follow up. It took me 2 months to figure out things and finish the paperwork and get the phase of training. However, people were generally nice, team was very dynamic, it was fun and busy place."
good,"With my experience with working at Chipotle, it seems that job security isn't a priority unless you are planning to dedicate your life to Chipotle. It is hectic work that is very much rewarding at the end of the day. You will always need to be your absolute best. Make an impression."
good,"typical day was faced paced trying to meet the needs of the line and prepping food, as well as cooking and washing dishes."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"good place to start a new career and develop skills for the future,that will help in the restaurant business, P%L ,labor management, schedules,"
good,The management structure at this company could use some reshuffling but overall a great place to work. My management team worked effectively to implement changes and develop ways to improve our operations.
good,I like it a lot I enjoyed meeting the different people in my work place I also liked how all the food was made daily and from fresh clean hands
good,"Working at Chipotle, I learned how to work with food, attend to customers and work with my fellow crew members. I learned how to do multiple tasks and worked my way up quite quickly. I was on the path to being a kitchen manager however I left for a more profitable job."
good,"the manger had their favorites and if you weren't one, she was picky on everything you did. I enjoyed the atmosphere working at chipotle."
good,"Fast paced work place with decent pay. I always got my required hours which was nice. I liked my coworkers and managers, but the required loyalty to the brand was a little over the top for me."
good,"it allows you to learn a lot of the face to face working environment with the customers;also lets you have hands on practice with different foods,recipes."
good,Good place to work but need more hours. Need to be fair to rotate people over the weekend. Will be flexible if you tell them right off the bat if you are part time.
good,I learned a lot of customer service skills necessary for the ever-growing job market. Although the workload was too much for the rate of pay. Worth it? To some degree
good,"Chipotle has an interesting diversity of employees and creates a job culture that makes the work fun, until in my case, bad management came into place, at which point i moved forward with my career"
good,Fellow employees didn't take pride in work but management didn't seem to notice. Unexceptional treatment to customers caused me to leave this job.
good,Management was unfit to teach new employees how to preform daily tasks in an orderly and timely fashion. Management would dictate without proper training into situations where they would fail.
good,I learned alot how to fry chips how to do the burritos and how to wrap it. we worked as a crew i worked with the customer and staff Some customers were  very rude. i really enjoyed working there. Some co-workers was nice some rude.
good,"I learn food preparation with a good management and goods co-workers. The hardest part of the job is the time pressure, and finish you task on time is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,Being part of a crew can be fun or dramatic.  It is organize and you are giving a responsibility for the shift. You are provided with the proper training however their can be favoritism. It is fun but busy.  Depending on seniority it would define the amount of hours you will obtain for the week.
good,"A typical day at work would be, come in, check what needs to be done, wash hands, and start work. Normally, i worked in the back of the store taking orders, completing orders, keeping my station clean. My title was ""takeout specialist"". The hardest part about my job was just keeping up with all my orders. I loved working at this store."
good,"fun place to work but the company has horrible workers comp insurance.  fast paced environment, and friendly staff.  great food"
good,"At first there was a lot of things that could be changed but with the new management, everything was seeming to all come together. You could tell that they were really trying to grow, just needed the tools and people to do so. I loved this job."
good,"Sweep and mop floors."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"If you are a person without children this would be a perfect place to work, a lot of overtime. They are too demanding. Overall it's about personal experience."
good,"Our general manager was strict and not easy to understand, sometimes indecisive. Pay was the standard minimum, on the bright side you could save money on groceries if you opt to eat at Chipotle on your breaks. (You get 2 breaks and free meals)"
good,"Extremely fast pace where you are constantly moving. Interacting with a range of different customers daily. Great way to learn about the kitchen, enjoyed my 3 years but things got old very quick and become too mundane."
good,"Great place to work if you're young and need experience. Be prepared to be there all the time because it will consume your life, especially when you become a manager."
good,I never knew that assembly/production could actually be fun.  Each line had a playful competition with another to see who could get the most and best parts out by the end of the shift.
good,"A typical day at chipotle would be would be very busy with usually only a few people on the service line. It was hard to leave on time, it would be so busy, and the crew members set to cover you were minimum. So it never supported your ability to leave on time."
good,"●     Welcome guests and seat them in a positive and friendly manner."
good,"fast paced environment"
good,the most enjoyable part about this job is that you get to work with others as a team.The employees are fun to work around but sometimes they can be a little childish. The hardest part of this job is trying to understand there management crew or how they try to improve the store cause for some reason the store is getting worse and the managers don't take ownership for anything.
good,Theres was a day at work when a customer had a problem with a burrito i made and instead of making the problem any bigger i just re made the burrito exactly the way she wanted it.
good,"a day to day work experience at chipotle was to create a team of top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards, meaning that you worked hard everyday to make sure those around you were being made better by constantly elevating them to do better as well as creating a uniquely extraordinary restaurant experience for not only my customers but for the crew as well."
good,I learned a lot of Do's and Dont's in this place and trust me it wasn't all bad. I learned a lot about time and management here and sharing task. But i also learned that sometimes things cant always happen in our favor.
good,"Basic restaurant employment. Great to build experience and learn new skills. It is a fast past environment, and can be heavy at times depending on what you are doing. Overall good experience here."
good,The lines were long and the days became the same but the people you work with makes it enjoyable. The food there is great and freshly made everyday. Management were also enjoyable to work with.
good,It was always very hot and fast paced. I learned a lot of different food preparations and how to work on a assembly line. My co-workers were cool but kind of childish. Management was pretty unprofessional though. Best part about the job to be honest was our free meals.
good,"The culture and vision of Chipotle is great. Personally my General Manager made it a bad experience. They didn't know how to write a schedule, didn't know all the recipes, and had poor work ethic. I wonder how they got the position in the first place. Our field leader wasn't much better."
good,Great employees and wonderful workplace to work in. There are many great opportunities to move up in the company and be promoted which is nice for kids up and coming through all different ages.
good,Very busy pretty stressful hardest part of the job is remembering everything that comes with it. I learned a lot about customer service. Co-workers are fun to work with really a family team work type vibe.
good,"Great Team Atmosphere"
good,Nice place to work not to many opportunities. People are nice and customer are always nice. you get your breaks on time you have nice managers to work with
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Chipotle was an ok place to work. The hours are average as well as the money. Management was actually pretty good. Just a boring place to work.
good,i enjoyed the customers and the staff i worked with closer to the end of my employment i started to dislike the general manager and the kitchen manager.
good,"As much as I love Chipotle and their vision and how much of a people culture they are, the location I worked at was not the greatest. A typical day at work for me consisted of coming in at either 7 or 8am. I made salsa or guacamole, and if I finished early I'd help everyone else finish up their tasks so we could go on break on time. Which almost never happened. I'd work the line all the day and deal with customers in a polite and friendly manor. I've learned many skills that are useful for when I cook at home, but I'm not entirely interested in cooking much now since I work 5 days of the week with food. Management is...okay. Some managers are preferred much more than others. While I love my General Manager, he is not the brightest crayon in the box. My co-workers are alright. While they have good qualities, their not so good ones seem to out-weigh what I do like about them. For me, there isn't really any enjoyable part of the job, being that the environment is very stressful, hectic, and overwhelming. You never leave on time, there are always things to be done, and it doesn't matter what you do. A good chunk of the people there will never be satisfied with your work. Love the company, but not the location in which I worked at."
good,"Everything you do at Chipotle is about High Standards and being fast! If youre not the type of person that likes to be constantly moving, this is not the job for you. Chipotle is intense, but you learn a lot. You learn how to cut, prep, and cook a variety of food."
good,"Its a good place to work but I felt their was to much favoritism."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of going in an hour before opening and preparing the food and then when the store opened, taking orders in person as well as over the phone. The hours were long, and the people were fun, it was a good job, but hard work because you are on your feet the whole time."
good,"Typical day depends on position being worked and how management runs the restaurant. For rush hour all hands on deck to a designated position determined by managers  to ensure customers are helped as fast and friendly as possible. Really fun co-workers to the point you build bonds with the restaurant team. Management can expect a lot from crew. Hardest part is once again the fact that a lot is expected from crew. By a lot I mean that there is never ""nothing to do"". At closing you're expected to pre close line, help customers , and other task and sometimes it's just one person. Work/life balance is out the door. You NEVER get out at scheduled time, sometimes are asked if you can stay longer, and never have a consistent schedule. Good starter job as you do learn a lot if you're new to food service and advancement opportunities are there. I personally didn't see it as a life long career."
good,Working at Chipotle I've learned the importance of being a top performer. Having the desire and ability to preform excellent work and whose constant effort to do so elevates myself and my team. Also learned to be more confident in your ability and encouraged by your circumstances such that you feel motivated and at liberty to fully devote your talents to a purpose; Co-workers were amazing cause their wasn't anyone who never felt like helping. And being able to satisfy the customer was the most enjoyable part.
good,"clean the tables, run the cash registers, fill the fork and spoons section, make sure the customers visit is pleasant.  I also worked the food line, for example i would build the burritos and roll them."
good,I think that the company in of itself is great to work for.  But it is like a pyramid scheme.  Once someone higher up then you gets promoted then you can.
good,"Although chipotle finds great pride in it's values, (as it should), some of those values are very harmful to employees. Chipotle promotes 95% of it's managers from within. This sounds like a great plan on the surface, but the company ends up with a lot of staff who should not be management. "
good,"The work is very demanding yet enjoyable as well. The coworkers i had made the experience all the while more enjoyable. The only problem was that the management held everyone to such high standards yet didn't fully comply to them their selves. A typical day for me was working on the line( mainly on salsa) as well as linebacking, preping and closing. They required you to put Chipotle above all else because our store was a restaurateur, which is like the upper echelon on chipotle, yet for the most part some members didnt act that way. They say the want a team full of top performers yet the people who would be considered ""top performers"" would get fired for petty reasons. It was ok working there, but emotionally taxing."
good,"Lead a team of top performers to achieve our vision by setting  high standards and accomplishing our goals and removing obstacles as they arose to accomplish that vision in every opportunity I’ve had"
good,"Well very fast paced, you learn how to handle food, cut sizes. everyone works hard to provide great dining experience. Hardest part is finishing on time with all your tasks.. working with a team of people who are glad to be working there."
good,"A typical day includes a lot of work, for one person. If you work in the back of the house or the grill you will work alone, and must take care of the whole section your self. Preparation must finish all prep before taking a break. If you don't finish on time you will not have time to take your brake. Short on staff most of the time."
good,A typical day at work started with prepping all the food and making all the salsas.Then we would open the restaurant at 11 and serve food until 10pm. Then we would spend 2 hrs cleaning the restaurant and setting it up for the next day. Management had favoritism. Co-workers were good to work with.Hardest part of the job was learning knife skills. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with the customers.
good,Learned better cooking skills. Fast pace moving company but you have fun co workers are very respectful and nice people. Regular day was usually the same everyday .
good,"This is very hard work, harder than a factory for sure! It requires determination and willingness to work hard! Great experience and character building place."
good,"Fast food, customer service, food prep, sanitation, minimum wage, greets customers, handle money (cashier), stocking items, fast paced, slightly flexible. Store closer."
good,Crippled management due to inadequate training. Bad health insurance.  Great food.  My experience could be due to my location.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Had a fun time working with all of my fellow employees but the management team was bad.  Nobody listen to them because they didn't have a voice.  Nobody respect the management team because the were always friendly and never put a foot down.  Was a fun job like I said but the management really killed the experience for me.
good,"A typical day at Chipotle began with coming in between 7am and 8am and beginning the tasks asked of you on deployment for that day. Having mastered each station available at Chipotle, my tasks would range from opening Tortilla, where I fried chips, cut citrus for the drink station, and fried taco shells. Opening Salsa, where I diced tomatoes, mixed four different salsas and sour cream as well as setting up the line. I could open prep which included cutting, scooping and mixing guacamole, dicing jalapeños and onions, shredding cheese, julienning peppers and onions,and cutting salad and taco lettuce. Grill proving to be the most difficult position at Chipotle you went in and began plucking oregano, cutting oregano and cilantro for the day, making tea for the drink station, re-heating stove tops, throwing down chicken and steak on the grill, putting beans, carnitas, barbacoa and sofritas in the re-therm, cooking two batches each of white and brown rice, and having everything cooked to order by open at 11am. Management is young and developed within the store. My co-workers were my favorite thing about my job at Chipotle. All upbeat and holding the 13 required characteristics (ambitious, happy, smart, polite, respectful, honest, conscientious, presentable, curious, motivated, hospitable, high energy, and infectiously enthusiastic) of a Chipotle top-performer."
good,"A typical day at work would include duties such as management, sanitation, food preparation and customer service. Other duties included in management of co-wokrers and engaging with the customers with food service."
good,"Hard work, depending on the store.  You may be doing work yourself which seems it should be divided among multiple people."
good,"I love the food. The employees were relatively nice to each other, it felt like we were a family. I was able to grow from the line, to following recipes for salsas, to cleaning the lobby and stocking the line and lobby during rush hour. If I asked to try something new, my boss allowed me to do it. My manager was very laid back and understanding. The hardest part about the job was communicating during rush hour. Some times the noise level in the restaurant would grow so loud, I would have to yell to understand what the customers were saying. I enjoyed going to work. Between interacting with customers, to interacting with the employees as a team, I really enjoyed coming to work."
good,Fast pace place to work at. I learned many different things about the company and how to prepare the food. A typical day working at chipotle is like working at any other fast food restaurant. Chipotle is an okay place to work at.
good,A fun place to work when management is in place. Co-workers were fantastic!
good,Chipotle is a good starter job. They are always looking for fresh faces to serve food to the customers.
good,"Alot of psychical demand."
good,"Line worker at Chipotle. There were several duties; you could be in the meat portion, you actually distribute the meat and beans, or you could be in the tortilla machine, where you press the tortillas and get them ready, or you could be the sauce person, or the burrito roller. I was actually good at all the duties you had there, I was all across the line, but I was also in the back prepping the food as well. With that, you’re expected to wash the food for cooking, as well."
good,"I would not want to work there again, the management is poor."
good,"-Cooking using the grill"
good,"They grill into you the little goals and etc of Chipotle. About being a great team leader and about containing these certain qualities. A typical day was stressful at the particular Chipotle I worked at because it was a busy one."
good,"chipotle allowed me to remain myself as long as productivity demands were met. work was fun, prepping veggies, preparing beans and fajita veggies. grilling meat and mixing rice. chipotles management was hands on, taught me to be on my toes and at the ready anytime I work in the kitchen"
good,"fun place to work"
good,Creating the ultimate dinning experience for both customers and crew alike.
good,Chipotle is a very team oriented environment.  they focus on the people culture.  I enjoy the passion that the company embraces throughout all the emplolyees.
good,"Wonderful for first time job with good pay. Atmosphere is great, and the company offers many opportunities to move up."
good,"Very busy and learned a lot about food. nice management, and fun co-workers. the hardest part was keepin up with cooking food while busy... The fun part was seeing the customers leave happy."
good,"A typical day at chipotle was very, very quick paste. them put a lot of emphasis on being very quick. I learned how to idolize my time while being at work. every minute counts. my management team wasn't the best, co-workers tried to be team oriented, it was a very difficult taste for them to do. the hardest part about this job was dealing with obnoxious people. the most enjoyable part about the job was the experience."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotle is a great company with a great background and culture. It's a fairly new store and for that reason our general manager might find himself overwhelmed at times. A typical day at work consists of preparing delicious and healthy food to serve. I've learned how to work well with a team of co workers that i might not have even known otherwise. I have also learned the secrets to how chipotle makes their popular food. My co workers are great. Management is great, but again they tend to find themselves a little overwhelmed trying to work out some of the kinks of a new store. The hours are not always great. Every employee is hired in as part time and the hours you're given after you're hired are based off of your work ethic. The hardest part of the job is the fast paced nature of the work. It's very important to move with urgency while still trying to work clean and accurately. The most enjoyable part of the job is working on the line, serving the customers."
good,"My typical day at work, time went by fast."
good,"Customer Service oriented day and business productive"
good,"Heavy focus on team, positioned based work in a kitchen. Grill cooks knew some prep, prep cooks knew some grill but hardly traded shifts. The front of house was largely separated, but they all wanted to work in back due to that being the way to get promoted. Overall, the environment was stressful, lots of overtime hours, not enough people when they're needed."
good,Chipotles was a very upbeat job. there never a dual moment working there.
good,"At chipotle I loved the people I worked with because I got so close to them and that was honestly the only thing that got in going into work everyday. My manager was not the nicest, I felt as though he was more of a dictator and I was afraid to even speak with him about anything or ask a question. They would make you work off the clock because they could not afford the labor, and would constantly send you home early. There was no real hard part about the job besides feeling that you weren't needed. I mainly enjoyed making people smile and having small talk with customers, food is the way to anyones heart!"
good,"A typical day at work was coming in early, seeing what food stations I was on for the day. Then set up  my station and get to work. When done I may be assigned to a cleaning task or help one of my co-workers out if they needed help. The management team was pretty fair and co-workers were awesome. The hardest part of my job was nothing really, but the most enjoyable part was seeing customer smiling because the food was great quality."
good,A typical day at Chipotle Mexican Grill is very hectic and fast paced. Although it may be hectic it teaches you great work ethics and how to manage time very well. All of the managers and co-workers work together as a whole team to make the day productive. I would say the best thing about working for Chipotle is the customers that come in and actually getting to know them on a friend bases.
good,"They ask for a lot. The managers were not that great at actually managing and they purposefully give the harder jobs and make you do more things while working than the average worker there if they are trying to get rid of you. you have to ""Meet it or peak it"" if you peak it, you are fired. Did not happened to me but I saw it happen a lot of times."
good,making burritos was fun but you got to know what you are doing.
good,"Ensures food quality by adhering to Chipotle’s recipes, following procedures, and resolving food quality issues. Is a role model for the rest of the crew and sets the tone of Chipotle’s culture by delivering a great customer experience, having fun, being a team player and having a positive attitude. Provides great customer service- greets customers with a smile and in a timely manner; makes eye contact; is upbeat, friendly and helpful."
good,managers wouldn't stay long in and out someone new every week
good,the atmosphere at work was always fun. i just wasn't always getting the hours I needed to sustain a living.
good,I liked it a lil bit but there was no communication. It was alot of hard work.
good,"Always busy so the day goes by. Fun atmosphere! Also, very nice to know you are serving a high-quality product."
good,It was alright. I liked it while I was there. People were nice.
good,I like that its fast and always something to do. Co- workers are very helpful and reliable.
good,"I would open the store, count my money and set up my cash register. Opening the store consists of putting chairs down, putting down the carpets for the customers to step on, bag about 150 bags of chips, and fill the ice machine. I learned how to count my own cash drawer and how to close my register as well. The management was alright. My co-workers were great.The hardest part of my job was the the fast paced environment. The most enjoyable part about my job was seeing my co-workers, learning new things and making more than minimum wage."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,i learned that team work is very important and also being a leader sometimes is important.
good,"It is a very boring place to work out. For someone like me, I love excitement and to converse with others. Chipotle is not that type of place, the only thing being conversed is what food the customer wants."
good,No me gustó demasiado la actitud que la empresa te hacía coger hacia tus compañeros.
good,"Not much to say about this job. They pay above minimum, hire enthusiastic people, and have high standards."
good,"fast pace enviroment, friendly co-works and customers. clean enviroment and chances for advancement."
good,"Long hours great starting pay. Almost unreasonable time expectations for tasks given due to co-worker interference and shortage of space to complete task in a crammed area. Great staff, team work was a plus."
good,"Clean restaurant. clean atmostphere.Excellent food."
good,"Take orders, prepare food, and keep workstation clean.  The The Hardest part was dealing with the different dynamics and attitudes of customers"
good,Noodles was a fun place to work but didn't have the opportunity for me to advance to a higher level.
good,"Great company.the customers are great,sometimes the employees can be a little off but i loved every day ofworking there."
good,I learned a lot as working as a team. Great oppurtunities for peoples whos willing to work hard. Fast past environment and they will teach you to do everything.
good,"It's a great business model with some flaws in actual practices. Developing people is a top priority every day which in itself is good but, when you have solid employees who don't want to advance that's a problem. The hardest part of this job is finding the right people for management positions when there are so few really Chipotle qualified people."
good,It seems like everyone is crazy about chipotle nowadays so its an understatement to say we were busy. it was hot and miserable but a job is a job.
good,Alot of work for each worker. Alot of late nights closing the store.
good,"Typically managed well, only a few times were workloads overwhelming to the crew. Working here taught me the true meaning of customer service as well as the importance of teamwork, multi-tasking, and time management."
good,"There is alot of marketing towards their Food with Integrity, which has made the company successful. But within the walls of each store, you are taught Chipotle Standard. But when it comes to guidance and management, it then becomes ""Know Chiptole Standard when the big guns are around, but do it my way when they are gone"" . Great training, but promises of promotions are just that promises. I made it all the way to AGM before I really saw the company for what it was. All the promises of having a quality of life away from the restaurant quickly died. Hours became 7am-12am daily, and off days were months apart. Its may serve better fast food, but this company still treats its workers as slaves just like every other food chain around."
good,I would open the store and set up. I would serve the customers and make sure the shift ran smoothly.
good,"busy fast food chain"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"A typical Day at work, go get an a apron, fix your hat, wash your hands and then clock in. Then they have a paper of what you have to do that day and you tell the manager what you're going to be doing and you go do it. IF you're in the line you have to serve all the costumers that come in."
good,"some amazing leadership, some terrible leadership too. work your butt off and it may pay off or it may take away years from your life."
good,"Great Team"
good,"Too many people for the store to contain would come in, line would be out the door and not enough people would be available or be trained enough to have the line go quickly."
good,The chipotle i worked it seemed that everyone was a manager and they all NEEDED to have things done asap. even if i was doing something for another manager
good,A typical day at work is assembing and preparing food for the customer. I learned to creative food that is fresh and at the customer taste buds. Management works with the crew and makes sure stuff is organize and ready to go. Co-workers are friendly and eager to learn new stuff. The hardest part of the job is trying to satisfy everyone taste. The most enjoyable part of the job is working as a team and getting the job done.
good,This is a good job to have during college. It is a good experience to learn speaking and get some free chipotle
good,"Each day one was in charge of a station, Tortilla communicates with both the cooks and customer, serves the fresh meal to each customers specific liking switching gloves and pans periodically remaining both clean and efficient. Salsa communicates with tortilla cashier as well as the customer to finish the mouth watering meal specific to each customers liking concentrating on aesthetic and fast friendly service. Cashier receives payment for the meal and make sure the customer is overly satisfied with service and food. If any complaints result in free meal or manager comp. Cashier is also responsible for dinning area not only keeping clean but checking periodically with customers at each table (table touches) to make sure enjoying the meal. These three stations combined are considered the line or front of the house. On the long journey to management you must master all these stations before moving on to back of the house. Chipotle does only internal promotion so every manager from kitchen to general manager must first start from bottom as crew member. Back the house consists of cooking and preparing the food for the front line communication between line and BOH is key. Grill cooks chicken, steak and fajitas all marinated and prepared fresh from the morning. After cooking meats have to be cut to dime size and fajitas seasoned.Grill is responsible for keeping these items fresh on line focusing on taste and appeal running out food on the line results written warnings following termination.Prep the final station in BOH cooks rice prepares beans pork and beef for line on call throughout"
good,"In the beginning I worked at this Chipotle, it was fun, I liked meeting the people and customer interaction plus I was getting the hours I asked for(in the beginning) Once they hired new people my hours were cut to part-time. Then they would schedule certain people including myself these ridiculous hours and send us home early. Majority of the members of management pretend to care one but they of they don't care about anyone except themselves!!!! One of the assistant managers would give you the shirt off her back."
good,A typical day at work was Stressful work place on a daily basics
good,"fast paced environment, lunch rush was busy all the time every day of the week. be prepared to be rushed, awesome team however."
good,I greatly enjoyed being part of Chipotle. There was always something to do and I learned how to manage any situation. The hardest part of the job was when it was super bussy and we were backed up other than that it was very enjoyable to work at Chipotle.
good,I learned many skills working here. Most were with leading my crew and holding myself to high standards everyday. The management was very hands on and helpful and they took part in the development of the crew. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was when I would teach my crew something new or how to better themselves and then having them show me how they applied it and then seeing them teach it to someone else.
good,"Interacting with customers, keeping a smile and serving them according to their requests."
good,This restaurant is very fast paced. You should be able to pick things up quickly and work at a very fast pace.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"The thing with Chipotle is that you have to thrive in a rigid environment. The product is great and the empoyees you have really like working there, but at the end of the day it's all about the numbers. The allure of Chipotle as an employer is the image of a hip restaurant company similar to Google or other hip tech industry companies. However, the reality is that they are just as Orwellian as your parent's employers when it comes to the day to day operations and employee relations."
good,i wouldnt recommend workinjg here if you have a family at home.Chipotle expects alot out of their managers and dont want no distractions from home.If you are cut throat and ambitous perfect for you.
good,"During the 5 years that I've worked at Chipotle I have to say that the most frustrating thing is they change up their procedures WAY too often and buy time you learn to do something one way  within like 3 weeks you have to do it a completely different way just to get the same result either way.  Also another big thing is the system crashes! I can't tell you how many times I've had to sit on the phone with I.T while I've had stressed out crew members trying to use the crash kit."
good,"Fast paced, job advancements, and friendly customers. A well driven reason to want to succeed and make customers, employees, and future workers customers a priority."
good,"Working with other employees was fun and you can clock out of your shift with a better attitude than when you clocked in. When receiving your schedule for the next week and your paychecks (electronically), your pay might not be as satisfying"
good,"Working at chipotle Mexican Grill was pretty good. The people who work there were great, and the management was exceptional. The pay was okay. It’s a decent job to have."
good,"Chipotle is a place where you can easily grow and ascend position wise. Many times though It’s a job where you life has to be scheduled around. Especially when you are a manager because, people are always coming and leaving chipotle. So if you have no responsibilities and want to take on a lot of hours it would be a great place for you."
good,"Typical day is having a long line for hours."
good,If you are running a store that is not staffed you get no support and will work 80 to 120 hours a week.  They pay well but ask for a extreme amount of work in return.
good,"Ideal for college students who need work. "
good,"Work at chipotle is comfortable to an extent , the reason I said that is because I’m on grill and being on grill is a lot dealing with heat and peeping also not always having the help that is required"
good,"If you are a hard-worker and love a busy and delicious place, you should apply to Chipotle in the Dundas location, just try to adapt to the team and will go very fast."
good,Very fast paste and meet lots of people.  It is a company which lets you express who you are. You are able to work doing different tasks. I enjoy working here because the management is really nice and understanding. .
good,It was a good job as a first one. Would not recommend staying for a career which some people do do. The people I worked with were mostly welcoming and the job was enjoyable most of the time.
good,"Opportunities for advancement"
good,"I have currently been working at Chipotle for over two years now, and honestly, it's hard to say what the overall experience feels like. I've had plenty of ups and downs, but that's with just about any job out there. I would probably say it's been a great learning experience for what it was."
good,Not the greatest place to work considering unprofessional and immature management. Although the pay is definitely decent. I got paid $15/hour. New employees get $12
good,If you’re a crew member working at chipotle it can be very fun and quite rewarding depending on what store you go to. I had a lot of fun as a crew member but once I moved into management it was chaos. I got all the way up to assistant general manager and realized all the time and effort wasn’t worth the stress and constant worry about your job being on the line.
good,Fast moving work. Urgency is essential to your ability to succeed. Less than personable experience when starting. opportunities for advancement abound.
good,"Overall it’s a great place to work for maybe a year or two, but that really depends on the kind of managers you have. I had a very poor experience with the managers at my location which favored some employees over others and were also very unprofessional when communicating in our work group chat/ or in person.. they guilted you for becoming sick and not being able to show up to work. Managers have a huge impact on your decision to stay or not. I left because their managements and favoritism was frustrating and uncomfortable to work at."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Worked more than others, no credit was given . Learned how to work fast pace on busy days . Kept my area clean and always made sure the food was cook properly."
good,"Really fast paced & productive shifts, fun & allows for a chance of advancement within the company values  employees thoughts & intuitions when hiring"
good,"The workload here is generally okay. However, during the summer and the holidays, it is crazy here. To make it worse, they don't genuinely schedule enough people as well. "
good,"The store I currently work at has some issues, management is not the best especially in hiring employees who actually fit the specifications and who have good attitudes. I will say that if your going through a transition from jobs and need an in between than this might me a good place to work at for a while."
good,This is for a job if you like fast paced work you will get paid depending on how long your shift is then you would get some good money from this job and in your time there at least it will be some good co workers in the job environment
good,"Depending on the crew and managers you have it can be great to work here. Area supervisors can be helpful or an all out terror."
good,"I loved working in Chipotle and looked forward to going to work everyday. Everyone is friendly and the job is very simple and well paying for fast food. Job comes with countless benefits (one of those being tuition reimbursement and even English learning classes) that makes it one of the best companies to work at. The only problem was the management. My managers were extremely unprofessional. Not only would they forget their employees and not schedule some people some weeks but they would also make group chats with their employees and leave out the majority of workers save their small friend group. I quit my job after my General Manager refused to give me the days I requested off two months in advance for prom, my father's birthday and grad bash but instead gave them to someone who had asked for the days off a few days earlier. All in all the job can be a wonderful place for those who need part-time but can be horrible if your managers also lack the professionalism like mine did."
good,Very friendly environment (also varies on the location you work in). Good to work and grow as a team player. Teaches you how to maintain a calm demeanor in such a fast paced environment. Very flexible for whoever attempts to school. Great benefits are available but not always offered (depends on your job status).
good,was happy about getting to work there at first until i was put in the back to do nothing but dishes.. Also they were sending me work places i never heard of
good,Working at chipotle was a great experience. The customers were appreciative and made employees feel productive. We were also given benifits by generous customers.
good,"great social place for workers and customers,bosses are caring and fair most times,fast paced work and it almost never stops until closing time,discount on food"
good,Fun environment to work In. Very flexible hours. Can easily move up in positions with time and dedication if wanting to make a career out of it. Would reccomend if you enjoy a fast pace environment.
good,"The manager had a professional and enthusiastic attitude, but communication between managers and myself was patchy despite my efforts and the schedule often disregarded my days needed off (e.g. high school graduation) and was rarely in my best interest. I didn't feel like I was learning a lot by being there, and gained very little experience."
good,"The company is good but its the locations that lack. I WORKED at 5 different locations and some were good and some bad. I got paid good $14 an hr but still i hated the drama. Some managers didnt play far and its like high school. plus gossip and a lot more which not gonna say... thats why i changed locations a lot. But if you find the right location and management its a great place to work at and they will make you fell good about your job. The breaks are about 45 mins to an hour depending on if you get your work done on time, you get discounts, free meals on break, different positions to try in the restaurant like cashier, line back, grill 1 and 2, expo, etc."
good,"Working for this company was eye opening. A lot of work goes into people getting the delicious food they expect each day. As a manager I often had to cover for shift leads with little to no support from other neighboring Chipotle’s and from upper management which cause me to work 16hr days sometimes. The work life balance is the worst part about Chipotle. They’ll pay you a sizable amount but they expect you to pick up any and all slack that your staff lacks and overtime is expected. Not worth the money for all the stress you have to endure to hit sales goals and other targets. Also expect changes to happen weekly, sometimes daily within the company which will cause you to have to retrain your staff on things and or update them to certain changes effective immediately."
good,Compensation needs to get better for the amount of work that’s put in. Management does not always understand their employees. The environment is nice but the job is too much and it’s not well appreciated.
good,"Entitled customers, flighty management and structure, very high stress due to open make line, make all our own food daily sometimes multiple times a day. Depending on location it may be busier than others. Started off as worth the pay, but gradually became understaffed, overworked, and overwhelming."
good,I prepared and grilled food. I was hard work but rewarding.  I learned how to work in a group. The managers were good organizers for the team.  It was a good experience.
good,"Working at chipotle south miami is controversial. The management is not so great depending on the day, when the line gets long, no one really moves except for the people on the line. Sometimes it gets very very stressful at peek hours, and youre always standing."
good,"Can easily get chaotic, some areas are very understaffed. Where I worked, this was mostly because the while the starting salary was above minimum wage, it was not enough to afford rent or school for many workers compared to other nearby businesses."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I really loved the people I worked with, however the managers at the time would make us clock out and continue working. If that didn't happen I wouldn't have quit."
good,"This was a great job, I really enjoyed working here, and my coworkers were genuinely nice people. The only issue I had was with the general manager. Many employees left due to mistreatment, name calling, and intimidation from him which was completely unacceptable. I had my own coworkers telling me to call HR because they were too scared to, but I just left, plain and simple. It could have been a great job, but I don't do being treated like and being called trash."
good,"Chipotle was really a great place to work until the food safety issues began. Soon after, everything changed and the culture turned into that of threatening if 100% of the new standards were not abided by."
good,You got a learn fast pace you gonna be quick And know  your position if you didn’t learn it by two weeks or three weeks they fire you .  Managers  over work  the  coworkers there .
good,Not much to say about this job other than you can get great hours for being part time. I wouldn't go back unless new management was there other than that it was great.
good,"I really enjoyed the organizational, team-oriented focus of this job. It was extremely clean, fun, and the management was nice. The best part of the job was the ability to be in niche positions, as well as feeling like you have fulfilling roles on the team."
good,A typical day at work will Monday. What I learned was to be a better cook. Management wasn't the best. Workplace was okay. The hardest part of the job was grill closing . The most enjoyable part of the job was crew friendliness.
good,"When I started working for this company I was in love. It was the best job I've ever had until they changed management. Due to the amount of peers who quit and the change in management, my chance to advance in the company was taken from me. The told me they had to wait for them to hire more employees before moving me up which I understood, but the when we got new worker my new manager made sure her friend was given the proper manger training instead of me. Her friend hadn't been there for more than 2 months when I was working on a year. After leaving the company I found out that this manage was not only stealing from the company but made it impossible for me to get rehired. Loved this job but they choose the wrong management. Went through 4 managers in my time there."
good,I started in october of 2017 and  the jo started out great. I really enjoyed the management and my coworkers. However they fired the managers and sent in new managers from toronto and they really killed the team dynamic. They made the experience so unpleasant so I quit.
good,They barely train their employees at all they make their staff watch a brief video and that’s it on my very first it was only me and two other staff on hand that day it’s supposed to be at least 6-7 people on hand everyday but the managers let almost everyone call out every day so everyday will be extremely stressful
good,"Everyday was a new challenge, but it was fun and exciting. The coworkers were delightful and made every day worth it."
good,"People love Chipotle, so it gets very busy. I was at a location next to big hospital and a big shopping center, so we had a lot of people coming in every day. The team members were all very supportive and friendly."
good,"Chipotle does a lot of quick hire which doesn’t help, during my time there many people quit because of the lack of hours, salary, and communication from the management."
good,"Its a fact pace work environment which makes it stressful to be a part of. The managers dont do anything but delagate making more worknfor everyone else. Its basically like McDonalds but on steroids and thats coming frome someone whos worked at some pretty unprofessional places. When i say thst the best part about this job is the food and pay and maybe a voqorker here and there, i am being more thst dead serious. I still work there now, but only qhile i look for a new place of work."
good,"While working here keep in mind that whatever you apply for will not be the only thing you are working, or may not be trained for at all. There is very minimal training you basically have to train yourself. When closing at night you are not supposed to be in the building past 11:30, but some night you may not leave until after 2 am. When your coworkers don't show up to work you may be placed to work somewhere that you may not have ever worked before; and you may have to learn this task on your own."
good,I worked 4 and a half hours a week my pay checks were always less than 100 dollars. My managements team was always a hit or miss a day and I never felt like some of them really cared.
good,"I loved the coworkers, they always made work fun and teamwork was always good depending on who worked. The only downfall was poor communications skills with management to the crew."
good,"The job itself is not always easy and you will leave tired, but you know you are working for your money. The staff is amazing, you will love your coworkers. Beware of making friends with managers, the store is their priority, thats it. Still if you need help in anything they will help you, they do want you to succeed."
good,it would get really busy and we would have to move quick . it was a stressful place I have worked at but atbthe same time It was fun because we all worked as a team and would meet new people
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I love working at Chipotle because of the people I am surrounded by, but it can be very stressful during peak hours. When there are not enough employees scheduled the day does not run smoothly, and we constantly run out of food on the line."
good,"Chipotle is definitely a job for younger employees. Their is a lack of advancement and financial gain for more experienced workers. It sounds counterintuitive, but sadly chipotle neglects so many of its veteren workers and leaves them feeling unappreciated."
good,you would start out at work at seven thirty in the morning then begin your morning duties which would take about two hours. Getting everything prepped for the days work.
good,even though the job itself was hectic during my shifts i always looked forward to the end of my shift because i knew that all of us co worker would go and hang out after.
good,"I loved working at Chipotle. However, there is now a new CEO and everything has gotten just a little worse. Multiple times I have seen hard working individuals let go for small infractions, sometimes days after the infractions occurred, such as an employee fired three days after forgetting to sign in when they entered the restaurant. Also, certain positions were removed reducing the pay of the workers formally in the positions."
good,"I learned a lot from this job and it helped in molding me into the worker I am today. I have a very high tolerance for stress and can perform efficiently and quickly no matter what. It's a fun job, always new challenges because I worked at a busy store, but as I took on new responsibilities I was pushed to do more and more while earning a measly 10 a hour. I now work somewhere much easier for 12 an hour and it's easier to advance there as well."
good,"When I first was hired at Chipotle, I enjoyed it a lot. The work was the perfect balance of tough and fun, and I really felt like I developed good life skills. Unfortunately, the company has taken a few wrong turns in my opinion. The work culture has changed drastically in the past few year, with less priority on the employee and customer and more on food safety. Although they would deny that being the case, it was very obvious to anyone working under the company. They also don't take much feedback, whether it be from crew members or managers. I can't deny that the benefits they provide however are very good, and kept me with them longer than I planned. Overall it's a stressful job (depending on the store) but it can be rewarding. I'd like to see where the company goes in the next few years."
good,"My normal day was coming in and geting preped for my cash shift, i would hurry and switch drawers with the other cashier. Handles all the cash roles.Cleaned the lobby, then at night preped for am shift."
good,Chipotle Mexican Grill opened up a world of opportunity for me. I gained tons of experience working both BOH and FOH and learning how to run both effectively.
good,Chipotle Mexican Grill is a work hard play hard company. It has a wonderful culture and it will definitely make you work for every cent won. It will definitely make you a grow not only as a employee but as a person. The pay could be better but at least it teaches to hustle and be humble. I recommend it to anybody who's looking for a temporary job or for a first time job. It will teach you a lot!
good,Working at chipotle was fun but the lack of communication was bad. In order to work at chipotle you have to be a fast learner quick on your feet and have to have good customer service (:
good,This restaurant was poorly ran by managers who were always arguing amongs themselves sometimes I had to work long hours with no breaks minors were cutting chicken and using box cutters which is u acceptable
good,It’s a hard job to do if you are not fast enough to keep up with the speed. But overall It was enjoyable and I would recommend It to first timers so they can learn what a fast work environment is
good,If youre at a high volume store everyones going to be stressed out. You may or may not get a break. Be prepared to stay over your shift. Poor managment.
good,If it’s slow those are the best days but it’s stressful if the AM shift doesn’t do what they are supposed to it’s leaves you with so much on your back and even if your working your fastest if you don’t finish the time they do it’s gone be on your head
good,"By the end of my experience here, everyone wanted to leave because during summertime things get busier and busier, and everyone gets more stressed. The managers had a serious empathy deficiency."
good,"This restaurant was fast paced and sometimes stressful. "
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Depending on the location it could be more relaxed and fun or very fast paced and stressful. If the management is good then the work life is good. Enjoyed working there.
good,Es un buen trabajo pero faltan mas oportunidades de crecimiento
good,Overall a decent job. It has it’s difficulties but nothing that is to hard to learn. It is a lot of multi-tasking and always fast paced. You definitely have to prepare to go to this job everyday.
good,"Walk in, notice tables that are messy, trash hasn't been changed, napkins aren't stocked, barely any straws. Back of house dish pit looking horrendous, low stock of food on the line to serve, floor messy with all types of stuff on it like dirty gloves. I believe no one cared enough, I had to come and tell people to clean up after themselves. In some instances I would walk in and do the cleaning up myself as the others clocked out or pretended not to see me doing stuff to help the place be better for the customer experience. Most times the manager on duty would be stuck in the office doing something and not realizing what's going on with how the place looks or what their employees are doing. Absolutely no discrimination against one another, one big team. Hardest part of the job was definitely doing other peoples jobs. The whole thing about coming into work and finding nothing to be clean or stocked was frustrating but I did it anyways. Most enjoyable part of the job was getting to see customers faces light up when their food was made to perfection or when someone engaged in conversation about how great the food tastes, smells, and looks."
good,the culture of chipotle made the job bearable when the work day went south. communication was well and the pace was fast keeping everyone aware of there tasks
good,"I normally don't mind losing time, but with Chipotle they will absorb every single bit of your time. Weekends are simply nuts, the people there are wonderful to work with, but the hours and the ridiculous amount of time you have to put into this as a part time worker is outrageous. Unless you have a lot of free time, I would not recommend this job."
good,This company prides itself on maintaining extremely high standards under extremely tight time expectations. This pressure helped me acclimate quickly to the workload but can easily become overwhelming for younger or less experienced employees.
good,"this is good if you don't want to go to college. the one i work at, the people are what make it worth it, not the management. it is possible to get promoted, but its hard work and the only way to be successful is to tell people what they want to hear your way up the chain. it's a fun place to work and the people there are like family. however, there are defiantly problems. I've noticed its either great working in one, or horrible. it really depends on the store. the stress level varies. i wouldn't trust management because they will use you and take advantage of you. if your good and your trying to go to college, they may make it difficult for you in hopes you'll just work there. if you keep that in mind, its a fun work environment. the coworkers are nice and so are the customers. the trick is to just be aware and know what you are getting into."
good,It’s a great place to work only because of the people who work with you. The environment is quite stressful but at the end of the day you have the crew to help you.
good,"Usually the work day flows pretty well at Chipotle but it really depends on the mood of the managers. Sometimes if they're in a bad mood its almost as if they want you to do their part just because they're too grumpy or lazy to do so. Overall, i am happy there."
good,Decent job but a lot of work is done throughout the entire day or it comes in waves. Wages starts at $9.00 a hour but it should pay more honestly. Hard-workers strive in this job.
good,"Overall Chipotle is a good company and if your someone that works hard and have no other obligations then this is the job for you. Management team has 2 sides to it, depending if everyone works together then it's smooth but if you have people that are out for themselves then it's going to be a horrible experience. There's no balance between work and life and the high ups don't really support the restaurant staff. The care more about their numbers than how the people are feeling and how the management team are treating them."
good,"People at this job are very fun to work with. I always had a good time working, but I felt I was not being paid enough. They hire at 10.50 per hour and McDonald's starting wage is 12.00."
good,Chipotle works like an coporation. Fast paced and you always have to be on your feet and expect the unexpected every time you enter for your shift. Great environment also
good,"For the line server position, prep work could begin as early as 7:45 in the morning, which was quite exhausting while working 30-40 hours a week. Once established in the team, crew members who worked together consistently formed a strong personal bond. Daily tasks were monotonous after a month or so, but this meant that the job was not overly challenging. Though I grew to dislike the routine, my morning crew was a group of people I will never forget and intend to stay in contact with."
good,the hours are long and demanding for the amount you get paid it seems to not be worth it. Although yo u make new friends easily and if you are a people person you will be fine.
good,"A typical day includes preparing food, serving guests, and cleaning for all employees.  Management is hands on with daily tasks however are responsible for the overall training, hiring, retention, standards, etc.  Field Leaders used to be understanding and respectful of employee and restaurant manager's work-life balance."
good,Every crew member performs a fast paced duty. Things move very quickly in the kitchen on most days. You have to pay attention to food amounts when serving customers. The culture is very collaborative and most of the employees are college age. This particular location had bad management because they did not take the time to train me thoroughly. The hardest part of working here was the lack of thorough training. The most enjoyable part was learning new skills and getting a free employee lunch.
good,"Efficiency was highly stressed by the employers of this store. I was required to complete tasks such as preparing food, serving customers, and cleaning  at a very fast pace. I learned a lot about focusing my attention towards possible sources of contamination. The restaurant was very driven towards food cleanliness. The culture was in the workplace was professional, and geared towards a physically laborious staff. The hardest part of the job was the heavy lifting. The most enjoyable part of the job was making guacamole."
good,The job was very rewarding and was fun with the right leader and team. The role was very demanding on time but with developing the right people it can be very rewarding also. I have learn a lot working for them.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Working at Chipotle was an experience like no other. Dealing with other coworkers your age was fun to work with at first.. then after awhile you start to dread coming to work. Other than the annoying coworkers you can get by working here. Management can be a pain too.
good,"Working at Chipotle never feels like work, until things are not going the way they are supposed to. The people I have worked with, are some of the most fun people ever. They make the day fly by. Becoming a manager really put my skills to the test, and teaching me new ones along the way. I've learned how to approach all kinds of people, and how to manage time better. Along the way we get grades based on cleanliness, production, and amount of labor saved. I have succeeded in achieving most of these, but ultimately Chipotle wants more, and more which makes things difficult. I started as a crew member at Chipotle ,and quickly moved up to a Service Manager. I think there needs to be a easier way to achieve goals that Chipotle wants, it almost feels like they are working against you."
good,"You would go in and start customer orders and press down tortillas. Made sure the customers were happy with their order. I had to make callbacks to the kitchen. I learned that no matter what you are doing, you have to be adaptable and do what the customers wants no matter what. The management was different. I wasn't all the schedule all that much and I had to call in to see if I could get put on the schedule. There was also some miscommunication with having to miss days off work as well. The culture was good. My co-workers are good people and fun to be around. The hardest part about my job is making sure the customer got what they needed. The most enjoyable part about my job were the breaks."
good,The crew was reluctant to help me due to my hire-in above crew member. I was not paid enough for work in my opinion and i had to try extremely hard to get my paperwork done and start my training. it took like three weeks.
good,"When getting to work you could usually expect  a busy day making burritos. I would recommend this job to any younger adults just trying to get a college job or post high school job. "
good,I believe that this place is a great place for your first job when you just want to have extra money in your wallet. I left this job due to schooling priorities.
good,"This is my first job, but it's making me want to switch over to retail. I work cash and I'm required to sweep, wipe down tables, stock the drink station, clean and restock the bathrooms, do table touches with customers, clean trays and baskets, take out the trash, etc. Doing all of these chores at once can get to be overwhelming, especially when it's busy. If you work well in a fast-paced environment with strict guidelines, then I would highly recommend it. However, it just wasn't a good place for me to start my first job experience. Within three weeks of working, my manager expected me to be as good as their best cashier and threatened to fire me if I didn't improve on my ""time management"". Not the best experience here."
good,"My typical day at Chipotle involves prepping multiple salsas for the entire day. This includes, making roughly 16 deep pans of each, mild salsa (pico de gallo) and corn salsa. Around 4-5 1/6th pans for hot salsa and medium salsa (salsa verde). As well as shredding around 12+ deep pans of cheese. There is also sour cream and vinaigrette to prepare as well. Once completed, preparation for lunch rush is done and the start of the opening the store and serving customers until you need to prep extra food for the evening."
good,"Chipotle is great when it comes to honoring customers, the workers are amazing, but the issue is the pay. The labor isn't the best, due to  people being under paid."
good,"I enjoyed working there at first but under a change in management it became increasingly difficult to enjoy my job. Given how harsh the environment became, with a harsh boss at my location and the attitude they exuded essentially stressing everyone out and mocking other managers. I rarely got breaks even when working for 8 hours at a time with no food or drink."
good,the restaurant I worked at had poor management but overall it taught me a lot about handling high pressure and stress and still maintaining great customer service.
good,"Chipotle is an experience all its own. It's fast paced, you're never bored. It's easy work, there's just a lot of it. I personally don't see that as a bad thing. I love working hard. So if you do too, you'll love it."
good,Chipotle is a overall good place to work especially if your starting out and looking for a place to grow. It's fast paced busy and will keep you on your toes when following company guidelines and giving great customer service.
good,"A really safe environment for workers to be in. I really like the people I'm around [customers, coworkers]. I get paid well, I love my post as a cashier."
good,"before new management, chipotle was an amazing place to work. management was amazing, crew was amazing and everybody helped everybody. the main reason I left was due to poor management, the new managers at the store I went to are rude, problematic, selfish and don't truly care about their crew. I have had several previous coworkers either quit or transfer stores specifically due to bad management, I definitely recommend chipotle as a job if you want to advance in opportunity, just make sure you have good management."
good,"I liked the actual job a lot. The customers were great and time passed by quickly because it was fast-paced. I also find it very fun whenever I go but they would often have me work 7 days a week for at least 7 hours a day although I'm a high school student and then wouldn't pay me for all the hours that they had me work overtime. (My pay check was missing at LEAST $60 every time I got paid since I began working for the company) Also, my coworkers who seemed very nice at first quickly became very rude and would sit around gossiping about me over the tiniest things. They relaxed and gossiped more than they did their actual jobs. Which sucks, because I really wanted to be friends with my coworkers. It's such a close knit community that they aren't accepting of outsiders and new-hires so it makes it difficult to seem like a comfortable environment but other than these cons it was great."
good,It is a great opportunity but it full of workload for low salary. I had to work 75hrs a week but i was getting paid for 40 hrs a week. The workplace was fun and I had a lot of friends however the work is really hard and stressful. Too much demands from the top employers but we never get any help from them.
good,"Management cut short your hours, they relocate you without even asking if you want to, it's not about the job it's about how you're doing the best you can and they pay won't add up to how much work you're putting in!"
good,I loved all of my co workers and managers to death! I just wasn't a big fan of the intensity and fast paced ness of everything but otherwise I have no complaints! Loved getting a free chipotle meal every day!
good,It was a great beginner job but they paid me so bad the lost check I had was like $37. Also I was only maybe working once a week for like 4 hours. However I did like the tips I got when closing and free meals. People who I worked with were super nice.
good,"Overall, it is a good company to work for. (external success rate is extremely low). Chipotle has made the decision to source great ingredients and use classic cooking techniques to prepare them. However, the skills and time that it takes to master these skills do not work in the industry that the company is in. It creates a very stressful environment where salaried managers are not able to fully execute their roles since they need to support the daily operation of the restaurant too often."
good,The company was fun to work for and a great learning experience. The store I was in had some troubles with management which then fell onto the crew workers to fix. I no longer wanted to be employed there and resigned.
good,"Come in 10mins before your shift go downstairs change up come back up clock in."
good,"Due to the volume of customers, the work environment is rushed and stressful resulting in frequent omission of breaks.  "
good,"Busy workplace with generally friendly employees. Each store is different, the CEO is unpleasant but depending on your store it will vary. Fast paced work, high cleaning standards and positive culture."
good,Management team was very unfair and it was a playful environment that needed more structure not a place that I could retire from. My experience there was not pleasant very stressful.
good,This store is one of the busiest in Long Island its very fast paced and requires a lot of prep. Most stations do require a good amount of effort as you need to work fast and make sure customers still feel like you care. Cons are typical ones of a food company and its understaffed.
good,It's just a line factory and instead of making cars you're making burritos which can be good but constant management over you make sure you don't eat the guac.
good,"Always Busy"
good,very fast paced and occasionally stressful but a great experience. there is a high turn out rate and we were often understaffed. Most of the managers are just as ignorant if not more than the crew members.
good,"Good job with good benefits and always make everything fresh in the mornings. Although, you have to be very open and happy to work here. Clean place to work."
good,some days are good. but its unfair how people are getting m]paid more then you are and they just starting there. When the peopelt hat been there for more then a year get paid lower and still have to do the work for them.
good,Its extremely fun and challenging.  I've learned alot about leading others to achieve great things.  Every store's culture is different.  The hardest part of the job is the ever changing job requirements
good,"Chipotle is a very fast paced restaraunt"
good,Great job awesome benefits but can be very stressful at times.. don't get a lot of time to be home with family with the flexible schedule.. and different shifts
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Your typical day at work, comprised of making chipotle burritos and burrito bowls. management felt a little racist while I was there. If you didn't speak Spanish then you were automatically marked as a lazy worker. The hardest part of the job is that it gets super busy and you don't get a chance to get a drink or use the restroom for hours on end because of it."
good,Typically my days are easy since I'm competent enough to complete my task. Except when I work with people that for some odd reason have so much time to gossip but cannot do their simple task until it's too late. Hardest part of the day is making sure there isn't any left over food so proper cooking.
good,"no notice for schedule, you find out your next week's schedule the Friday before the week."
good,It was a fun experience while It lasted. A great place to learn leadership ship skills and work with people. Loved the culture and there message they are trying to send.
good,"Be ready to be a little on edge, especially during a lunch or dinner rush. Can be very fun at times, but also very stressful. Management was decent, but could be improved."
good,"Good advancement opportunities, but poor scheduling. If you are short staffed and cannot prepare all the food before opening then you sacrifice part or all of your break."
good,"Depends on your location. Management can be a huge problem but you still meet a lot of great new people. Free meal every shift, lots of room for progressing into management"
good,I loved working at chipotle but the manager was just overbearing. I left the job because every little thing was watched in detail. And I was employed around the time of the ecoli breakout so everything was mointered and the mangers at the time took their jobs too seriously. 2 of the mangers made our worklife so complicated that people began to quit left and right.
good,"Work typically consists of entering the store, donning the apron and washing your hands and then proceeding to your position. I worked prep, line, and cash. So on line, you essentially will stand there all day waiting to make food and in between you wipe down your station and change the food. You must also monitor the levels and freshness of your food as you serve, which can be hard during rushes. Also, the second location I worked for was not Restaurateur, although the first one was. It was a wildly different experience between the two and at the second location, many of the procedures and food safety regulations are outright ignored, which I found extremely frustrating. Prep is just dishes and food stuff, pretty easy but takes good time management and you have to be really efficient. Cash was also easy, it was typically just counting your drawer, ringing people up and bagging food, performing table touches (at first store anyway) and wiping down the dining room. The closes for each of them are pretty much the same sort of tasks in mildly different forms and a lot of cleaning. The culture, when it is actually there, is awesome and I used to really enjoy working for Chipotle before I moved to Tucson. The management's lack of leadership and overall disregard for standards was infuriating and made me dread going in. The most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers, especially in stores that hire for the 13 characteristics (second location did not). You can meet some really cool people that way."
good,"Overall, it was a great experience except for days requested off, and the poor management that took over. The crew makes it worth it, and the benefits and pay are  definitely worth it."
good,"A taxing job that requires a lot of workers. Great skills to learn that I take everywhere now, but the culture is much too forced and kind of sickening."
good,Love my experience with the company as a whole but ready to take my talents to a job that will allow me to achieve optimal work-life balance in order to start a family and complete my degree for which I only have 12 credits left to complete.
good,"I was a crew member at Chipotle. I loved working there, but the management is not very appealing to me. The company itself is great, is just the people that works there, makes it bad. I love the food and everything, but I had to separate myself because I felt like I was constantly harassed by the young managers that they have working for them. One of them even went do low, by telling me to go back to Africa and feed the monkeys and zebras."
good,Can be a great first job to build off of. good for learning the meaning of hard work. I didn't like that you almost always have to work 8 to 7-hour shifts with only one 10 minute break. Also very hard to finish close on time and management will give you a hard time for it.
good,"As far as first jobs go, Chipotle is not a bad start. When it comes to a typical day, it's pretty chill until we hit our peak times when people are coming in for lunch. It's not as hectic as it used to be. So keeping up with the pace isn't hard. The hardest part of the job is probably being around people the entire time. It's overwhelming sometimes to constantly be respectful and nice to customers. Not even mentioning trying to stay positive when customers will sometimes nitpick about things they don't like. For me, it's all worth it in the end because I'm a people person. The customers and my coworkers at my job can be so amazing, it's heartwarming. Some of the people who I work with and who come in, I truly see them as friends and others even more."
good,"Working for Chipotle has been a valuable experience and has taught me a lot. The benefits are great! Above minimum wage, part time employee benefits, tuition reimbursement, 401k, etc. The culture is good but the company is constantly changing the ways and procedures in which to do things, so that can be a bit frustrating. Management is good and you can easily move your way up in the company if you are willing to put the time in and have managers above you willing to help you. I've been working here for two years and have yet to progress past crew."
good,Love working at chipotle but as a manager the balance between work and home is terrible. The culture is amazing and the teams are always so great but thats if you do the correct hiring. Most enjoyable is having fun while working with all the great people you hired. Hardest part is knowing you're basically on call as a manager and they don't respect your outside life.
good,"The work was easy and mundane, repetition was key. Although promised training in other stations, management over looked many employees requests. They play favoritism with senior employees, even if their work ethic is not up to par"
good,"love working here, great environment awesome co worker, great costumers, very easy one you get the hang of things, awesome perks, free food and insurances"
good,Chipotle was like a playground for me I've gotten  to learn so many different things and try them with the things i already know. Which has made my work ethic stronger. The customers make it great with the enthusiasm they bring when they walk in the place. They Love Chipotle. I love a satisfied customer great service ends with a great smile.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"They teach you alot about food and resturant stuff but its underpaying for other amounts you could b making. I was thankfull to GOD for the job tho, bless up"
good,Taking and relaying orders I learned to work at a fast pace management was okay workplace culture diverse the hardest part to still smile while serving a upset customer the most enjoyable part was I learned the fast food industry
good,I'm not currently working there but it's a cool place when I was working there so if anyone wants to work there it's a cool place to be at for work and working with food and cash handling you will like it they hire fast so great job for anyone i learned a lot working with cut sizes and knife handling and measurement
good,"Chipotle was a good place to work, though chipotle has a very strong  meaning for building beginners to the top. It has it's flaws, for example the management at my store was not very keen on regulations and procedures. It did felt as If I were being singled out as one who was taught from beginning to follow these regulations because its the chipotle way. Through out the day it would be busy it was a great challenge and learning experience. I think in my honest opinion , the best part of the job was the people culture, It was nothing like I've experienced."
good,"This job is very hourly demanding and physically demanding, however the pay and the benefits as well as the opportunity for advancement is there if you work hard enough. The management is hit or miss depending on your location and can change often enough so you must be good at adapting to different types of management."
good,"Always doing something. The best thing of this job is you cannot stay with free mind. And for me is a beautiful thing for people loving improve theirself."
good,"Every day it is the same tasks, but with quantity differences some days. You have until noon to finish your morning tasks which is a very tight window to complete everything. Managers expect you to take your breaks during your tasks without a cover so you just fall behind. There is no morale in the store, good deeds or outstanding performance goes unnoticed. Constant nitpicking. Great place to get kitchen training but don't expect to move up quickly."
good,Fun employment with a fast paced company. Not enough hours to maintain a single parent household. Management changes quite often. Enjoyed customers more than fellow employees.
good,"While the crew members you are surrounded by may make work tolerable, you will come to the realization that you simply do not get paid enough for all you have to do or what you have to deal with. They are amazingly flexible with your schedule and if you have good management, you'll only have to ask them once."
good,"Overall, I found working at Chipotle to be fairly dissatisfying. The pay wasn't quite high enough for what's expected from you and some promises made from the company weren't kept, in my experience at least. Although the crew is absolutely phenomenal most of the management is not."
good,"Chipotle was a nice place to work. Team work was always emphasized and there was always good energy. Management was a little unreasonable at times, but the company is a good one to work for."
good,"Wanted part time hours hours which they said would work, but then pressured to work more and more and scheduled 30+ hrs/wk. At times crew did not communicate well, but the culture Chipotle intended to build was great. Overall a management issue probably exclusive to the store. Love the restaurant and their values!"
good,Typical day involves preparing everything you'll need in an average day from meats to salads dressings. In a busy store there really is hardly much time to do anything but work the line or make sure the store is kept tidy.
good,I learned many things but the co-workers always took advantage of me for being the new one. I always helped out when I wasn't on cashier but when I asked for help they never did.
good,"The co-workers were nice, some of them liked to pick on people. I learned a lot, how to be nice and cooperate with everyone. The most enjoyable part of he job was meeting my co-workers and becoming so close with them."
good,"I have worked in food service before, Panera Bread specifically for three years. There I felt encouraged and at home, but Chipotle lacks that quality. It seems that they only care about their employees as workers rather than their people, and the job is very strenuous with not much benefit to make up for it. I have been there since May, and I am already ready to expand my horizons and find something different. I know that I can do better and help people more than just food service. A typical day for me consists of coming in at about 8 am, and doing the food preparation necessary for the day. Many times it is rushed and does not feel put together. If I do not finish my prep before we open I do not get a break and I do not get to eat. Most coworkers are helpful, but there is a good amount of people who call out and leave us hanging. I am a cashier and ring people up during the day, as well as keeping up with the dining room cleaning, dishes, and other prep. Some days I do not get off at the time I am scheduled to, as people are late or we are busy and I do not get the help I need to get off on time. All in all, if I come in with a positive attitude my day is good, but there are circumstances out of my control that make my job stressful."
good,I don't think fast paced food service jobs are for me really. Too much was expected out of me starting my first week which caused a lot of pressure and stress.
good,"I worked here for a while in my earliest twenties and was appalled at the high hours and work conditions, yet people were kind still and all aside the food is great."
good,"I was crew member and worked as everybody else in all areas. The team was nice and helpful, managers understood my needs if i had any. Room for advancement. Too much assigned to just one person (that means if you have any of the Grills)!"
good,"A typical work day is as simple as completing a series of tasks in a timely manner.Overall as a company Chipotle is great. Under correct management it is an excellent way to move up and gain opportunities. Working at Chipotle is not overly difficult the main requirements are a sense of urgency and a desire to be efficient. The basic foundation of the company teaches how to manage time, and work efficiently, conscientiously, and honestly."
good,"This is a fast moving job. There is something to do at all times. The people there are great, everyone works as a team. The management can be a bit better, but overall it was a fun first job."
good,"Chipotle is a fast pase Enviorment , you have to learn quick , you get unlimited food , great pay , excellent hours , good tips , and great co-workers ."
good,"The best parts of the job was the team that you worked with and working with the high quality ingredients that this company is known for. However, work-life balance was very poor and was often put in situations where I was required to work 70-80+ hrs a week. Turnover was always very high , from the crew level all the way up to the corporate level."
good,Chipotle is a great company to work for if you're the type of person who enjoys a challenge. The hours can get long being a fast casual restaurant. Don't expect much of a work/life balance. Overall the work is rewarding when done right.
good,"Although the environment of the workplace can vary per location that you work, Chipotle Mexican Grill provides an understanding environment for all of those wishing to enter the food and customer-service industry.  Like Safeway Inc. there are numerous opportunities for employment based on how hard and well that a specific worker functions."
good,"Chipotle brought a lot of good things to my life and helped sharpen my customer service and team building skills quite a bit. The management started off good, but only a couple months after being hired the general manager was fired. This created chaos from management that wasn't quite ready to step up. I don't have many negative things to say about this place, but things got to be very disorganized towards the end. However, I will say that the way they take such heavy precautions and safety guidelines to keep the workers and customers safe is admirable."
good,"[Typical Day at work]"
good,"Chipotle taught me many things along the lines of food safety and food handling. I was taught how to cook various meats on an open range grill, how to cut varieties of produce, and how to properly maintain a clean work place throughout the shift. The culture is something that I very much enjoyed as I saw my co-workers as a family. They really try to make you feel part of a bigger picture. The hardest part was finding a person to promote to a higher position as everyone in our store had a say in who got promoted. It seemed as if no matter how much hard work and effort you put into working there, it may not come with rewards. Unless your peers see to it that you are fit to be their leader. As I had witnessed this had caused an issue. Everyone saw themselves as the next person to be promoted, and so conflicting opinions played a heavy role in either the wrong person being promoted, or nobody being promoted at all for the current quarter. Chipotle was a fantastic opportunity to get my foot into the door of the workplace."
good,"Chipotle Mexican Grill was a great place to work in regards to schedule flexibility, the culture of the employees, restaurant standards, and location. I always felt confident recommending the location to friends and family because I knew that they would receive excellently prepared food, a clean environment, and a reasonable price."
good,it was a very good place to work but i couldnt stay with that compony cuz i wanted to move from the state .i became a chef and master prep in this compony.
good,"Now that I have ended my month and a half employment at chipotle. I realize that it truly was a family. Although I left on bad terms, (and they made a joke out of my leaving) I realize that this place had great potential to become a great place of employment. However, for the pay and stress your put under by employees with ""fake attitudes"", it was not worth my time. It was a great run, but chipotle was just not a fit for me. Maybe it was the sloppiness of the schedules, or even the major miscommunication between management and employees. I can say I'm glad I didn't stress myself to much over this place. I belive that what you guys are doing is a good thing, but you need to reavaluate your team before becoming the best. I hope the team can read this and see things that need change. I have nothing else to say ,but good luck. Hope you make it to restrsunture. I'm Doming it. I'm out."
good,"Working at Chipotle was an interesting experience. I am not going to say it was ALL bad. There were some perks, like some of the people as well as the FREE food. I did  eventually get tired of asking the same stuff everyday however. At the end of the day what I learned is how to work in a fast paced environment as well as multi task. What I did like about my manager was that he truly cared for his workers and always asked how we were doing, how school was going, how our families were doing. That was a nice quality to see. But I never got to try other stations. I always was on the line."
good,A great job for someone looking to break into the restaurant industry. One learns at there own pace which is great for someone working their first job or is only looking for part-time work. High volume periods during lunch and dinner so you must be able to think on your feet.
good,"An a typical day in the week, most of the time I'm the first one to arrive at work and my job is to create a deployment chart according to the predicted sales, the programmed schedule and the amount inventory we had available i assigned the amount of time my coworkers needed to complete their task prepare for the busiest hours and make sure that everything is left organized and working properly so the next manager on duty can take the turn, its very simple job but the only hard part was the training of new poeple"
good,Worked at a university location and I always felt like there was not a chance to catch my breath because we where so busy. I would not recommend working at a location that is so busy.
good,Once you get situated your daily tasks are handled with ease. The most difficult part would be handling customer complaints in the beginning but with experience you gain confidence and problem-solving skills. It was always my pleasure to see a customer walk off with a genuine smile indicating a great service overall.
good,"I thoroughly enjoyed working with every coworker and manager that I had. Although we worked in a faced paced environment, we always had smiles on our faces and had a great time. Each day, I was constantly pushed to do better than the day before and was always given the opportunity to learn new skills to use in and out of the work place."
good,I really enjoyed working with most of my co- workers. there were a few that are lazy but ugh gotta learn how to ignore and not say any thing bad because if not you will want to quit or get fired!!!
good,The job was okay. They have a lot of unrealistic expectations on what they want from the staff. They want you to work off the clock if all tasks are not complete.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"The work hours are not realistic for someone who has a life (school), inconvenient standing hours that are not worth the pay."
good,"This was a pretty busy and overwhelming experience. If you like serving food and hungry guests, this is the place for you! You are overworked and not for the pay you get."
good,Chiptole is a great company to work for. Ive learned so much working there from food preparation to grilling food. My co workers were amazing ive made great relationships with most of them. Hardest part of the job was dealing with the management. i feel they were very unprofessional. Extremely hard to connect with them and work.
good,"When I was in high school the hours of my job were pretty flexible and the pay was not that bad. I learned very quickly and the goals the managers set for their employees are extremely valuable both in and outside the workplace. However, management would sometimes get carried away with other priorities in their lives and would not think about the needs of the employees. For example, forgetting days people would ask off and would not change them."
good,"Once I started working at chipotle, I didn't have time to spend with my family. so I decide  to nit be there and start working for a new company"
good,"Chipotle has amazing philosophies and positive intention. From a crew-hourly manager perspective, it is great. From a salary perspective, it really depends on who your field leaders are. If you have great managers and you work your butt off, you will be rewarded. It's a great job, but I cannot exaggerate enough that you must be willing to work!"
good,"Great training, I learned how to work under pressure, in a fast paced environment and had fun doing it. The management was the only downfall. My team was awesome, they always coached and developed me more than more own managers did. The hardest part of the job would be having to put up with getting taken advantage of. I felt like I did so much for that restaurant and didn't get honored for any of it."
good,Chipotle grill was a very energetic and fast place work enviormnet with a very determined crew. The food quality was excellent.
good,"Chipotle was a very cultured place to work. With a lot of focus on empowerment and the ability to make your own decisions. I worked for a restaurant that was on the verge of ""restaurateur"", which means an elite restaurant. I learned basically all the positions from prep to cook, line to cashier. Although the management was superb (For the most part) they do a lot of cross training with other lesser quality restaurants. I was once stuck with a GM from another store who spent a large majority of her time on her phone, would take other employees free meals, and would force other employees to her harder work (She eventually walked out of the restaurant mid shift, leaving the store under managed). I was also offered a raise (anywhere from $.25 to $1.00) at""The end of the month"" for two to three months straight, but my time for evaluation never came up, before I left for a more flexible management job."
good,"You can get somewhere here, if you have the right type of employment. Otherwise, you will most likely not be pleased or not have a full advantage."
good,Overall Chipotle is a friendly place to work at. Our vision is to produce top performer and to create high standards when prepping our cooking food. I learned that being empower to do things help create leaders.
good,"A typical day at work was busy. but still managed to get through the day. I've learned that you have to be patienced and not everyone is the same. My co-workers we're the reason I sayed moviated. I hardest thing about this job was some people were very lazy, and it was unorganized. The most enjoyable thing about chipotle would be the people."
good,Interesting and fast-paced work environment. I enjoyed working with most of my coworkers. Management was heavily involved with all activities.
good,"I was lucky enough to have good management and co-workers to make this an enjoyable job. You have to make the best of it, busy and fast paced so your always busy and day usually flies by."
good,Dont work here they dont provide no type of hours and low pay smh. Other than that if a fun place to work if youre into fashion.
good,"This job is a a very team based job. there is one goal in mind and that is to become restauranteur, in other words, and elite restaurant. you can express yourself and everyone cares about your success within the company."
good,"Almost all co-workers are easy and fun to work with. Strong focus on empowerment and making sure you have the resources needed to succeed. Time off policies very flexible even for contractors."
good,"It was good, good co workers, nice atmosphere. just didnt like that moving up takes a very long time"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Chipotle Is a unique restaurant because they believe team work is very valuable to reach high goal with and for the company. They really focus on development within the crew daily. When chipotle hire a crew member their intention is to make this crew a possible GM in a year because that recruit has 13 characteristics . The hardest part of the job is when crew members are overworked and there tired and there attitude change it can cause a bad vibe to the atmosphere and effect other workers.
good,Co-workers and Managers are fun and loving people. This job can be mentally grueling especially when your store averages 15k of sales a day. Worked at the chipotle in Pittsburgh and in State College( restaurateur)
good,the crew was awesome at chipotle a lot of team effort. I was just disappointed in management due to they played to favoritism. So i thought that was very unprofessional.
good,A typical day at work would be meeting new or existing customers. Preparing food and maintaining a clean environment. What I leaned from Chipotle is if you want to have a good experience is you have to have a positive attitude about everything you do. My co workers were fun and exciting to work with and be around. The hardest part of the job would be the cleaning regime...it's very thorough and takes up a significant amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the social interactions I have had with different people and the different experiences each one has had.
good,It's a fast food restaurant that sells all natural food that's healthy and at the same time it taste good. And I enjoy working for this company.
good,"I started on-line with the hot side of the food and mornings consisted of making chips and hard taco shells. After they moved me to the salsa side of the table I still had to make chips and shells which was no longer my responsibility as we had new people working that side who were supposed to be learning how to do that job. I was on salsa but never got to make it in the afternoons like I was supposed to for the night shift. One manager was a good person, the others seemed to be very judgemental and unfriendly. My cousin was training to become a manager and he was the most helpful person at the whole establishment and was very good at pushing me to do the best I could and stay motivated. I enjoyed working mornings and days, enjoyed the pressure of the lunch rush, and the company of the people I worked with."
good,"I loved working here, but I was mistreated more than a few times and never given a real opportunity to advance. They never told me what my next steps to becoming a manager are even though I asked 50+ times. The general manager at the chipotle I worked at was a hypocrite. She would tell her managers to send home managers if they were off the clock but distracting our employees. Then I would see her after hours distracting our employees when she was off the clock and all the other managers wouldn't confront her. I was reprimanded, not on paper, for voicing these concerns, but in my supervisor's attitude toward me. I loved the environment they provided and the people I got to work with, but Chipotle danced around the bush with me, got their use out of me, and when they were sick of me complaining about them doing things wrong, even if i was right, they fired me."
good,"On a typical day, line will go to the door and everyone will have to be upbeat and friendly with the customers. I learned everything about the  restaurant and the culture of Chipotle working there. My cash handling skills has improved, I learned a lot about customer service while i served the food the customers, always be friendly and not to nickle and dime everything so that the customer will have a wonderful experience and they will feel welcomed to come again. I also learn how to prepare the food and cook the food, some say I have manager  qualifications because I'm a very fast learner. Management was pretty good they always tried to make all the crew member by giving them the right shift that they needed. My coworker was very nice and friendly actually the best people I've meet because they were very outgoing. Hardest part about the job is that sometimes if someone isn't able to come into work everyone will struggle a little trying to do their job and someones elses. I enjoyed the environment the most and meeting new people each day."
good,"learn cooking temps/times"
good,"This is a great multi-billion dollar company. It's a great place to make friends, great place to work, but if you want to be promoted you need to make Chipotle your life. You won't get promoted easily at all. It takes some time, but if you really want Chipotle to be your career it won't take long at all."
good,"Very strong company with rapid growth possibilities. "
good,"While at Chipotle, I learned the importance of being a team player who can really hold her own. Due to the fact that we were usually short staffed, I have become a great multi-tasker who does not neglect providing the customer with quality service and an even better quality product. The chaotic work atmosphere has truly helped me become a hard working employee who is often times the girl called on in a time of crisis."
good,"I genuinely believe in the product and the ""mission"" of Chipotle. Their commitment to the use of locally and sustaniably sourced products is at the forefront of a change that needs to happen in the US. Their compensation and benefits are also good, my problem comes with the internal management structure of the company."
good,"It is, on average, a VERY busy place. We try to keep our customers happy while getting them in and out in a more than timely manner. The management could be better. The very things they teach they don't always follow which in turn causes alot of the coworkers do the same. I would say the hardest part of woking at chipotle would be being able to get it all done in one day! There is so much to do in so little time because of how hectic it gets there but we always finish somehow! The most enjoyable part of the job would be the regular costumers! I love building connections with people and getting to see a face that I can always make smile just from them seeing that I work that day"
good,"Recieving phone, fax and online orders, working fast to get the customers in and out. Ensuring customers recieve the best customer service experience when they enter. Making sure the food is fresh and the line is clean. Helping train the new employees to become better and faster and more equipped with the typical day at work. All cashiering responsibilities and bussing. Food prep and ordering."
good,"Very strict workplace, overall our attention was majorly on our customers other than a healthy division from customers to employers. Management encouraged us to work harder everyday to meet our customer service goals. hardest part of the job was transition from employee to manager. the most enjoyable part of the job was accomplishing our daily goal of service"
good,I have a chain of customer relationships that keeps coming back because of my service and for what i didn't know i learned from customers how to make them satisfied. The music and clean working conditions had made it easier to make it a great day at work but that the hardest part is pleasing a customer when i've tried everything. co-workers were typically friendly and worked as a team.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"A typical day at work would be to clock in then look at the white board to see your position for the day. You would most likely stay in one position if you are the kitchen manager or service manager but if you're a cashier, you will be put from the front to the dishes to the dining room. I learned that organization is key to working in a restaurant env't but also keeping connections with resources and structuring your work schedule. My co-workers in the most part were hard workers but it was very chaotic due to the lack of employment and ppl getting discharged. The hardest part of the job is: ""the drive"" to excel"" in all parts of the job meanwhile being constantly put from one spot to the other. Also, the lack of enforcement of the policies and the treatment of the managers. The most enjoyable part was: working with the actual food and preparing them."
good,"making food and preparing it for people, getting to see and now different people"
good,The hardest part of the job is rude customers. A lot of people who go to Chipotle feel entitled. I've had so many people talk down to me or think I'm dumb. I loved working there because of my coworkers but the customers can really ruin your day. You have to remind yourself to not let their comments get to you.
good,They fire you when you require to go on maternity leave. A typical day is very busy and noisy. Employees are nice and very easy to get along with. Customers are rude and very disrespectful.
good,"Job was amazing. Company had great rules and benefits. Staff was pleasant and easy to get along with and work together as a team. Hardest part of the job was the general manager. She was very harsh and mean towards me, I felt as if she personally did not like me which resulted in her treating me unfair compared to the others. Called me out in an embarrassing manner and made me feel less of a person half the time. Other than that the job was great."
good,"A typical day at working at chipotle is slow at first but when 6 hits, it’s face pace people coming in and out, must be ready to work fast and have everything you need for the 6 o’clock rush"
good,"Extremely stressful and monotonous but fun coworkers, lots of opportunities to move up, and decent benefits, however, the pay is minimal. If you're good with stress and time management this job is probably good for you."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle was hearing ""guac is extra"". Working with Chipotle taught me how to manage my time and problem solve. My workplace was very enjoyable as my co workers made it fun while working hard. Not only did i enjoy working and teaching my team we enjoyed the diversity of customers that walked in as we learned from them too."
good,"Working for nearly two years initially felt like a place for growth and fulfillment but later became just a job with limited compensation and advancement. Though expecting to become versed in all that was available, I've been stuck in one position that I exceed at but not given the chance for more, yet promised."
good,Its harder worker when your alone with no teamwork effort.. There is no solid form of communication looks like it makes it harder for everyone that is working there
good,"Loud Music, Repetitious, Extremely busy store with very little help to the point where you do 3 other people's jobs some days. Flexible Scheduling, Fair Pay. Rewards Employees for jobs well done."
good,It wasn't a bad place to work at but being stuck on prep for months and told that I'd be swapping back to crew was a lie never happened. Management was good made friends had a good time just didn't like being lied to that I was gonna be swapped to what I wanted to stay as.
good,"Recently(the past year and a half or so), the company has become a lot harder to work for. They are pushing the numbers more and focusing less on the people who work there."
good,"Chipotle corporate is a highly organized establishment who expects a lot from their employees. Corporate itself is very involved and schedules semi-regular meetings and frequently visits the restaurants. Chipotle has very strict rules and regulations which can be tedious, but also lead it to be the the cleanest environment I've ever worked in."
good,"At Chipotle I learned the value of working as a team, and learning how to always deliver great customer service. There were times where it could be stressful, but employees and management always worked together to make it through the rush. Management was great, and were always looking out for us employees."
good,I got this job as soon As I was old enough. I’ve been there for over two years and I have received a total raise of 25 cents. Not a good job if you need to support yourself.
good,The manager was nice to me but my coworkers didn’t communicate with me often leaving me clueless while I was on my training which was three day. That was when I decided to reassign.
good,"On your feet hunched over all day its rough. Decent pay for college kids, but getting time off is really hard.  Managers are mostly very nice but working with college and high school students who just dont show up. Hard to make people want to come to work here. Overall not a bad job, just hard on the body. Washing dishes gave plenty of cuts on the hands from sharp edges"
good,Chipotle really helped me grow as a person and developed my urgent work style. I enjoyed the team and the training in learning new styles of cooking compared to my other workplace experiences.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"A place to learn to work as a team, gain people's skills and go up the ladder  based on management skills. Opportunities to open up own store as we are encouraged to move forward."
good,Overall it has been a learning experience I learned everything I needed to continue and excel in life and to chase what I want. I was unfortunately unhappy with my fellow managers and superiors but I learned from them the good qualities.
good,It’s a great place to work right after high school. Very flexible hours and great pay. You know everyday what you’re doing since you work the same position every day. Management is very helpful throughout the shift.
good,"I loved working there at first, but after a while, the management was being very controlling and rude to the employees. I was being disrespected and belittled."
good,"This company is good for a like a paying for college job. Not all management is bad but the majority and that's more than I like. Be careful working here. I loved a lot of my coworkers but we all have the same thing to say and that is this company ask to much of their employees for the amount they pay us. It's true there are many great benefits but sometimes the customers just aren't worth it. But if you want to work go ahead it's truly not as bad as all that. If you do want a career in Fast food try chipotle, because they will help you rise through the ranks and teach you what you need to know and most filed leaders do truly care about their managers so don't be afraid just be careful."
good,Chipotle is a good place for a part-time job the pay is alright for beginners (9.00). But the raise were terrible it only went up 10 cents never a dollar and the managers are very lazy half of the time always in the office “counting the drawer” for about an hour when it only takes minutes
good,"There is a lot to remember, and the managers there like perfection. You deal with the same type of customers every single day. If you don't like doing the same thing every day, this may not be the job for you. It is really easy to get annoyed with the customers, because a lot of them are unaware of the correct terms, and the over all routine from where to order, what to order, to how to pay. Sometimes they have no idea where the trash can is. You know typical stuff. If you can handle all of that you will like working here."
good,it was a temporary job but a good learning experience for young kids. flexible with schedules and assist you with the skills needed and help you move up in different positions.
good,"Fast paced, easy job that requires you to be on your feet serving food to customers. Great bridge job for someone who is getting through school and looking for a job."
good,"Change in management, started steering the store into the wrong direction. Stopping my development as a leader with the company. I moved up from crew and stopped at assistant GM because of faulty managers above me."
good,"Most time spent working was to prepare food in the back of the house. Management had played favorites often, thankfully I was lucky enough to be on good side of managers."
good,"It was a fun place to work at but it got to stressful, they wouldn’t let you leave until everybody was done with their stations. Nobody could leave the line to grab something from the cooler unless somebody who knew how to run line came and took over."
good,"A typical day at work was very busy. Your heels do not touch the floor as you are rushing to stay in stock and keep up with the line. I was often unappreciated in my work, as I would do a majority of the work while my coworkers stood around in the back. When taking these complaints to my manager, the blame would be twisted back onto myself. I would not recommend this as my coworkers were very immature and obviously did not care about their job, coming in out of uniform or intoxicated. This job put a lot of stress on me and my friend (also working there) which was a surprise considering the introduction had me very convinced it would be a friendly work environment. They label their work as ""competitive pay,"" but I was being paid less as a hard worker than my coworkers who were scolding me for leaving for the restroom. My availability schedule was often ignored and I would be scheduled for hours that I could not work, which would ultimately put me in a bad place having to find people to cover these shifts."
good,"I didn’t work here for very long and here’s why: inconsistent hours (38.5 one week and 15 the next), free meals only if you work opening shift or have a super nice closing manager who lets you take a break (to get food, go to the bathroom, catch up on lobby, etc.), an ungodly amount of closing duties as a cashier (we’ll get into that in a minute), and some of the rudest customers anyone will ever experience. Cashier’s closing duties include, but aren’t limited to: counting the drawer, cleaning the patio, breaking down, restocking, and disinfecting the drink station; cleaning bathrooms (bleaching toilets too), disinfecting the tables and register area, and cleaning all glass in the restaurant (doors, windows, sneeze guard, bathroom mirrors). All within about an hour and a half. The turnover rate and burnout rate here are pretty quick, but all of my managers were fantastic. Some of them had expectations that could be deemed as a little too high for a fast-food place though. Breaks as a cashier are very slim to none, and if there happens to be a break in the line you’re expected to clean your lobby (wipe down tables, push in chairs, sweep the floor, taking out the trash, restock straws, spoons, forks, knives, napkins, toilet paper, etc.) in a very quick manner. Along with any work place you get your fair share of nasty, entitled customers, but you also get your regulars who you love. All in all, I don’t regret working here but I do wish that there was always a lobby person, rather than just on Friday and Saturday night dinner rushes."
good,"Higher ups and upper management put way too much emphasis on cult-like corporate culture for regular team/crew. Corporate feild leaders and team directors stress meeting sales and similar goals that are all related to hourly crew performance, but do not reward hourly crew or hourly managers for effort, and instead give bonuses to GMs and salary managers, and take bonuses themselves without actually ever working on food lines. Chipotle does, however, offer AMAZING healthcare, dental, and vision insurance/benefits, for hourly employees, as well matching on a 401k, which was incredible for hourly managers. Good company, but they would do well to reward their hourly employees, who work harder than any other team you could find, as well as they reward their corporate team."
good,"Fast paced "
good,"I think Chipotle has a great culture. They take care of the employees that's for sure. Employees get one free meal per day!! Plus a 50% off any to go meal. That was the best part of working there. But there was a lot of favoritism where hours were concern. People that had been there for a while would get the best hours and I couldn't live on the pay after a while. Also, the general manager at the time was 21, immature and would sleep on the job from time to time. It's really the same no matter where you go. Just stay away from all retail, food, and other service jobs."
good,"A typical day included arriving to work an 8hour shift, but staying for 10 hours, while co workers left you to do a job you didn't mess up. I learned to be efficient in any job I'm thrown into."
good,"I loved working there, hated the mangers. Super mean to me. Loved the food and the customers. Trained a lot of people. I loved how they teach you how to make the food but they honestly talk a lot during the job."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Great place to work for a part time job. But I can’t imagine making a career out of it. Upper management doesn’t listen to suggestions of any sorts even if it was to improve the company.
good,"At a typical day at work, I work usually 7-8 hour shifts. I've learned that Team works important to success. The store management is unorganized. The work place and culture is very energetic because of the crew members. The hardest part of the job is most likely working on the grill. And the most enjoyable part of the job is working with the customers because there friendly also."
good,"Show up and get to work at your station. either making food, washing dishes, cooking or managing which does it all. laid back place, but huge roll in health"
good,"Prepping the food for the day, then cooking as well as serving food to customers. I learned to work with many different types of personalities as well as dealing with difficult customers. The hardest part of the job were the hours as I  worked the night shift after work."
good,Content prepping for the day. Being on the grill cooking food. Learned guest hospitality and culinary skills. Management was nothing to complain about except lack of promoting and raises.
good,"I worked for Chipotle for a good 3 years starting off as a crew member and left a Kitchen Manager. It was pretty cool the "
good,"A typical day in this company will depend on your personal position. As a crew member you are either in the front of house - Line and Cash Register, or back of house - grill and prep. Each position has a set of tasks that are consistently delegated and you yourself have to manage and assure the completion of them throughout and  before the end of ones shift. Now this is all while dealing with a high volume of customers from open to close, while that depends on the location the 4 stores i have worked at all had steady influxes of customers throughout the day. The overall goals of the company and expectation of the crew are to uphold the companies standards and provide excellent customer service to every guest. "
good,"Free lunch"
good,Good work culture. Questionable upper management in the region I was in. Culture started to take a hit with new CEO of company. When outside hiring for general manager positions started the decline of the stores started.
good,I learned a lot of things over the course of time working there but it was an very uncomfortable when it came to certain things and certain  people. Taking from that everything was fine and great.
good,"People I work with are not bad, there’s just so much drama that happens especially since most workers are teenagers. One of the managers also likes to play favorites and treat others very poorly. It’s a nice environment and is fast paced if you like that, but there is just a lot that goes on behind the scenes that is bad."
good,I worked here for 3 years and loved the fast paced environment. There was a sense of comradery among employees and relationships with the management on site were usually good. problems started when employment got low and all of the crew was forced to take on the responsibility of other members. All of us were overworked and forced to do tasks we were not trained for every day. As a cashier I often had to work the line making burritos and ring  customers up simply because there was no one else to help. In the later days there would sometimes be only 4 people closing the entire store. When we closed however 1 person would go home because they are a minor and cannot be forced to stay. That leaves 3 people (including the manager) to clean 4 positions in the allotted 1 hour time space. The manager has other responsibilities as well so I would be obligated to clean a whole other station on my own as well. I learned the importance of not panicking here and I would never take back my time due to what I've learned.
good,"Great coworkers and managers, but stressful work environment, fast-paced, usually short on employees, lacks a efficient schedule method to ensure good hours and enough people per shift."
good,"I have been working at chipotle for about a year and 3 months now, Ive learned all the positions and have made great memories working their. The people culture that chipotle has created is undoubtedly the best experience I've had in my career thus far. However, towards the ending off my chipotle career i feel like the company lost the spark it once had and stopped caring about its employees and customers and only focused on sales. I used to like coming to work, but now i dread every day that I have to wake up and work in that place. Progression is very slow if one wants to become a manager. the benefits are not enough to compensate for the work load. Depending on the location of the store the management there can be terrible and kill the overall experience of working. I understand we are there to work, its not supposed to be a place for fun and games, but sometimes it feels like slavery.  I used to love this place, its a great temporary job, but do not make this a career.  Stay no longer than 5-6 months."
good,"The staff is great. The job is stressful. Management expects the impossible of you and the customers tend to be rude. However, you get free food when you work and they are willing to work around school schedules"
good,"I didn't work there long but from what I got was fun, serious, fast pace, clean, humor, happy, no drama, comfortable, easy to follow rules, nice managers, good payment"
good,"I've been in the culinary business for years, so of course, I was disappointed when I got to Chipotle."
good,"Can't no more with chipotle, not much great management, there was always delays and long lines that could never get shorter and lots of rude people so Don't even bother"
good,"Though I loved the food at chipotle, my coworkers weren't the best to be around. I did enjoy making the guacamole the most, because it was fast paced but also efficient."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Fast paced enviorment. Great food! As long as you work as a team everything is great. Management helps a lot, Customer service is great and you learn all positions."
good,"At first it was a great place to work. I loved my job and the people that I worked with, but then everything changed and all went bad. That and their employee meal policy is ridiculous."
good,"Fun fast paced job with high demand for cleanliness and quality food and customer service. Greet company. Management was not good. Discriminated against the older employees. Raises given to younger employees and not to older employees, and when issue was addressed they had many excuses. Other stores from the branch were much more tolerable to work with and for."
good,"I honestly wish there were a better scheduling guideline, I feel like Its never enough time to do my job as I want to, and managers should focus more on team development as they’re supposed to improve restaurant food service and its not possible without a great team."
good,"Overall, nice company. However, there are many inconsistencies that need to be worked out. There is plenty of room for advancement and they typically promote internally."
good,"temporary job unless fast food is your thing. the hours are never guaranteed unless your up the store managers tail. The pay is minimum wage, customers are irritating at times, but free, good lunch."
good,"Chipotle was a good place to work for a short time, in my experience it fell short due to the excessive amount of drama between employees, and the lack of tasks completed by the day crews replacing shift. Chipotle offered very flexible scheduling, and discounted employee meals to-go and free meals to eat while on duty."
good,it can be a very fun and fulfilling job or one that is very difficult to return to every day but its almost exclusively contingent on whether you have good management or not. the workload is tasking physically but not too  much.
good,"A typical  day was fast and up beat. It was critical for everyone to stay communicated and focus on what they were doing while also making sure everyone was doing the same, but of course the customers were our main priority. Making absolutely sure every single one of them were well taken care of."
good,This job is very fast paced. The management at the location I was at were very strict. Most of the team I worked with within a week had been fired and replaced with less efficient workers because of simple mistakes.
good,"In the beginning I mentioned wanting to only work about 20-25 hours, part time, because I’m a student still in high school. But, the manager continuously scheduled me to close and had me working 30-40 hours. I felt taken advantage of :("
good,"Working at Chipotle is enjoyable for around 1-2 years. The high employee turnover had some shifts with people who had no idea what they were doing, and others where you will know no one. It was a good part time job, until my second year where my hours were cut because I was going off to college. Store managers are strongly deterred from letting employees reach overtime hours. On multiple occasions, I was either told to clock out and finish my job, or scheduled for a shift just short enough to not earn a break, and then forced to stay longer. This job was fun while it lasted, but I would not go back."
good,"chipotle teaches you discipline and character "
good,"My working experience at Chipotle was very different. I learned how to interact with customers. I also learned how to be fast paste and how to multi task. Something that I found hard about my working expirence there was closing. Not because of all the duties I would do, but because it was tiring on my back. But other than that, my job experience at Chipotle was good."
good,"It was like working with a family: there are things I loves and things you could not stand. My hours were terribly short, I only took the garbage out and it took forever for someone tot each me how to role, and the management was disorderly. Although, how everyone felt about working was something that the managers focused on, the act of bettering the workers was not as important"
good,"The job is fine, you work hard but you get paid for what you do. The hours are good for students and the environment is very friendly. Its kind of like a family setting."
good,"A typical day of work at Chipotle Mexican Grill includes fast-paced,  team-oriented, and hospitable environment. I learned to cook, charge and serve guests. As well as, a few manager techniques to run the store. The management varies from person to person. The workplace culture is hospitable. Cooking on time and opening the store is the most difficult part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job is hearing good feedback on your work ethic, which needs to be emphasized more frequently."
good,"Very team oriented job, a lot of help offered and fast paced rushes. Have to pay attention to the foods being dealt with, but this job can become more stressful depending on how much the manager is putting on you."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I've been working at Chipotle for almost half a year now. It was great at first; I had two managers (only one did most of the paperwork, and she was my favorite), wonderful coworkers, and I wasn't being scheduled over my availability at all."
good,They pay above minimum wage and you get an employee meal on shifts that you work and 50% off your meal when you are not working. It's a fast paced work environment
good,great place to work but the managers need to work on there time management if you have a second job after you WILL be late and they don't care so make sure you stress what time you need to be gone by and also they don't like to pay over time!
good,it was a new experience the people was very nice the the work place was for the most part was clean. the management was good no complaints i love being there
good,very poor communication from managers to crew. everyone has their own ideas of how things should be done. cliques are formed and managers allow it. poor compensation and violation of labor laws
good,Learned a lot about the business side of chipotle. Worked with cool people. Some stores are better than others. Hopefully you land at a good store because if not it will suck.
good,Very busy place which is to be expected. Customers can be a bit rude but again it's the food industry. Fellow employees are typically very friendly while managers are hit or miss. Management at the store that I worked at lacked communication to all employees about possible changes in the work place so if you work less than 20 hrs a week expect not to be in the know of what's going on.
good,Chipotle is a fast-paced environment with a micromanaged requirements. Training is limited an time-management is vital. Management was difficult to communicate with. And very little job security. Pay was comparable for the job. Definitely an upscale environment that was educational and much different than other food service. No breaks if your jobs weren't completed.
good,"My experience when I started at chipotle... I was very nervous because it was my first time working in food service. Right away I should say that I do NOT recommend working at Chipotle as your first job or if you haven't worked at any restaurant/fast food place before. The training I shall say is really good. It's practically an entire week of (paid) training and it's really just learning what Chipotle is all about. Starting off, it's very overwhelming. You have a paper with all of your tasks to follow everyday and you're basically being timed. If you don't finish in time it starts being a problem but it can take a couple of months to get used to the flow of your store... depending on what location you work at. The longer you stay at Chipotle the more you run out of excuses to say that you didn't know how to do this/that. Drama does occur whether it's crew on crew or crew to managers. Managers are NOT aloud to hang out with crew outside of work. Drama is started outside and affects the workplace environment. Managers only notice crew who go above and beyond for the company and you will notice favoritism. If you DO stand out from the rest of the crew, managers will notice you and they WILL use and abuse you to their benefit and sometimes/most of the time it's not a good thing. Moving up might sound great, but the closer you get to becoming manager is the closer you get to over-working yourself, getting absolutely no breaks, going through so many headaches/breakdowns, potentially getting fired if anything goes wrong at your store, and not getting paid for all of the over time"
good,"It was a fun place to work for. Very fast pace but everyone was up to par so everything flowed smoothly. Very detailed about the way things are done such as cooking procedures, sanitation and safety procedures."
good,"On a typical work day, it is known as the busiest chipotle in the Springs, so sometime the line reaches out through the door. It can be a bit stressful for those who are not use to those conditions but otherwise just another busy night. I learned how to better my multitasking and how to take charge of the help on the line when there is no one else available. The management is fine but there is room for improvement. They do know what they are doing but can be taken in another way. The culture is like any other Chipotle in the Springs but is more energetic. A lot of guests like the hospitality and then some don't like the speed. The hardest part of the job is having to run out of the guests most favorite food items and trying to explain to the newer employees what to do and what not to do when they refuse to listen. But, the most enjoyable part of the job is the coworkers that I had the pleasure to work with. Once everyone found the pace and how things fell into place, it was easier to work there."
good,It was fun when i started because the management cared about its employees and their happiness within the company. After new management took over it was nothing but stress and there was always something wrong that I️ was doing.
good,"Everything about Chipotle is designed to make you a productive and fast paced worker. The standards they set were something I brought back to other restaurants I worked at, making a place that was known for fine dining seem lax in comparison to the dedication Chipotle put into their process."
good,"Working here at Chipotle I have been exposed to so many lifestyles and culture, It has afforded me the chance for advancement without any discrimination."
good,"Chipotle is a great place to learn skills and build a work ethic. I think that they had trouble keeping good workers because their pay when I was there, did not match the effort the job asked."
good,"Management was not the best. Would constantly hire people who had no idea what they were doing, unenthusiastic people, and people who just wouldn't show up to their shifts. Not only was it crew members, but management as well."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Working at chipotle taught me a lot about a fast paced environment and taught me a lot about my attitude. Co-workers were amazing, management was not the best and the regular customers always made me happy."
good,I would recommend chipotle if you’re interested in advancing in the resteraunt business . You can learn a lot and they have the tools to get you there .
good,"i enjoyed working at chipotle though my expierence there was brief it was good it was my first food job and gave me a basic knowledge of the industry i learned alot there and was able to pull it over into other jobs, thankful i got out before all the poisoned food nonsense."
good,I really enjoyed working for this company until they hired a very unprofessional general manager . She was 22 which isn’t a bad age for a general manager but she was just too young and unprofessional
good,"fast pace working environment, paid breaks, once you learn everything the job is very easy. things can get overwhelming sometimes, but if you work good under pressure then you'll be fine."
good,"The job pays better than the other fast food businesses for a reason. You're expected to do everything quickly and efficiently, know all the roles of the kitchen, and be able to handle a stressful environment."
good,"Very fast past environmental, it’s alqays something to do at every minute of the day. I was able to star t as a crew member and eventually promoted to manager the second year of my care there."
good,"It was great , it was a fast pace environment , especially in the back . i really enjoyed preping the food. My manager was good and my job was real close to home."
good,"Days went by quickly and I was never bored. The local management was amazing and did what they said they would.  The regional management was awful, cut throat and didn't care about anyone."
good,"I enjoyed working here. I was always interacting with staff and customers. Always kept busy from preparing meals, taking phone orders, cleaning the dining area/restrooms, washing dishes."
good,I use to love Chipotle until it becasue stressful with no help and no back up from managers. It has a great mission but only if followed. If Chipotle was the same as I sgtarted I would have never left.
good,Chipotle Mexican grill is a very fast paste work place. You learn how to make things from scratch and the right and healthy way. It requires quick learning and huge customer service.
good,"Work you so hard, but don't care about you. It doesn't matter how sick you get they think you're lying and want you to come in and if you don't they'll make you feel bad about it."
good,"Working for Chipotle is really hard work, but with the right team in place, it can also be very rewarding work. I believed I worked in one of the busier stores which was 42nd street and Bryant Park. The hardest thing is probably anything having to do with Grill. Unlike the other positions, Prep, Line and Cash, it sometimes requires heavy lifting such as when lifting a 40 pound rice pot, moving the grill, stove, or fryer when opening or closing that station, or doing wet or dry deliveries when opening. Doing delivery, wet or dry, is the most strenuous task for me. A lot of lifting and you have to organize the all the new supplies that came in about an hour. I liked the fast pace of the job overall. However, if you're at a store with a team that under performs it makes life harder. I liked how much I was able to come out of my shell. By the time I stopped working there I had mastered most of the stations which is something I could not have imagined doing when I first started working there. The best parts are when everything goes the way it was supposed go; bringing down a large line of customers or Linebacking during the rush and all of the food makes it to the line at the right time. The key to success at Chipotle is proper training, working with team members that have the 13 characteristics, communication and teamwork. If you work at a store like mine and can handle it, to make all the hard work worth it, I would recommend considering becoming a Manager. If you're going to be working so hard anyway you may as well push yourself to become manager in pursuit of a higher salary."
good,"Great place to start your first job. I worked from 7-2 pm everyday I learned that you have to fast paced and quick to react to situation."
good,"Job is horrible, constantly changing rules, and not enough hours. I learned that not every manager is cooperative. The most enjoyable thing about this job was some customers who actually spoke to the employs with respect"
good,"Chez chipotle on a une vrai possibilité de carrière, car on a des superieur qui croit en nous et notre talent."
good,"despite being a restaurant job, it was very demanding due to its popularity with its customer base. The culture is top notch comparable to Starbucks workplace culture, i learned allot about team work and leading small groups in a fast pace. Also my kitchen skills increased allot but sadly the pay rate in comparison to the cost of living in the areas these restaurants are located is hard to justify to stay there for long. but for anyone looking to get some in depth kitchen manager experience i highly recommend it."
good,I have never really worked at a fast pace restaurant until I worked at Chipotle. I have learned how to multitask and have a great sense of urgency. I plan to take the skills that chipotle has given me and use it somewhere else.
good,"Working in the food service industry provides many challenges.  In order to maintain the best product possible, taking the best attitude towards the job is very important.  Producing food-to-order is very challenging but provides the best quality food products to the consumer.  Working in a restaurant that produces very good tasting food is awesome and quite honestly the best part of the job."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotle is good at taking care of their own, however management is rewarding, it is also very stressful and time consuming. There isnt much room for work life balance."
good,"Overall, Chipotle is a very demanding job. There is tough restrictions on showing up early or leaving late to avoid paying overtime. Along with that, if tasks aren't finished on time, there is no break to go on. The customers are generally polite, but some expect discounts/free items. Management can either be very relaxed or highly demanding, depending on the manager on duty."
good,"The only thing I hated about working in Chipotle, was the lack of discipline when it comes to the managers. Managers can get away with being lazy and allowing the crew to do most of the work."
good,"I learned a lot of good customer service skills and how to work in a fast-paced environment. Management varied. Some of them really helpful, others were unfair and not professional. For example, they encouraged working as a team and claimed to not have ""favorites"" but it was apparent."
good,I knew from the moment I stepped inside chipotle that the management would be terrible. It showed in how unorganized and  chaotic the staff was before even beginning the job. Took me much longer then usual to start working but I love the environment and the messages chipotle sends ! The only big problem is management ! I expressed that my car was broken down and I could no longer work night shifts and they completely ignored my request for weeks and got upset because it was difficult for me to come to every shift and get home.
good,General Manager made it fun to be there and he was a great mentor and teacher. Sadly this place is losing to many good managers because it is not the same place it was 5 years ago.
good,"The people determine how much you will like the job. If you have people you dont get along with, you wont like the job. Also Chipotle has some of the worst customers in the industry."
good,"Too Many chiefs, not enough Indians.  People want to be in charge and say what should be done but don't want to actually do the work.  EVerything is hypocritical and backward."
good,Managers in the store are nice but the area managers did not understand how the restaurant worked. Crew was always nice but I usually had to do the work of two
good,"Starting at Chipotle, I felt very comfortable being new and asking questions. This is when I started in the Portage location. My manager had amazing relationships with every employee she had. The environment was always lively. When I transferred locations, I had an issue with the management there. If you did not know something, management did not accept it. They expected you to know every inch of the restaurant even if you were new to the environment. They did not care for their employees whatsoever. They hardly gave us breaks due to the fact that they had their own breaks to worry about."
good,"While employed a this particular Chipotle Mexican Grill, I found it to be a great way to learn a few cooking secrets for home. Most days you would be coached and groomed up for a management position, however it would take ages for said promotion. The crew was not very diverse, but they were willing to teach."
good,"Chipotle was a very good job, Decent Pay. In Some Locations, The job is very difficult. You might have to work hard for your money some days, but somedays you will be learning more about the company. The Place is filled with people who want to see you become better than them within steps, It takes hard work but the culture in chipotle is amazing. Great Staff, Amazing Workplace just needs more pay."
good,Takes all of my time and i get to see my family very little.  I work no less than 50 hours per week and it is a 30 minute commute to and from plus another 10 minutes to walk fron the parking garage.  This combined leaves me with little to no time on most days to spend with my husband and children.
good,"I learned a lot working for chipotle. I learned about how to be more personable with other employees and to help raise others up around you to create a wonderful team environment that is more similar to a family. I honed in my knife skills and learned to take pride in the cuts that I made and how to empower others to provide great work too. The most taxing part of this job, which is ultimately why I left, is the amount of work for the rate of pay is not nearly what it should be. Raises are capped at like 15 cents, which is understandable for a corporate business, but I take myself much more seriously in this line of work and I'm worth way more than $11.25 an hour for an assistant manager position for the amount of work needed to do the job."
good,Very high energy and productive place to work. Made the best of friends here and learned a lot about maintaining standards and pushing myself to always be better and more efficient.
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced."
good,"Specific location that I worked at twice, was a great atmosphere to work in my first time around.  The second time I returned a year later, the atmosphere was different. Specifically, management changes had taken place and it seemed like things were not as good. Rotation of people coming and going."
good,"for me, it wasn't the co-workers. more like the managers. a average day would go by fine, except for when the line suddenly started growing but i had gotten used to it. i got along with almost everyone but the commute is pretty bad and i was offered a transfer and when i discussed it with one co worker and my kitchen manager overheard and assumed that i hated this place and wanted to just leave. i always felt like i didnt belong when it came with some of the managers."
good,"It was a good 5 year experience where I had the pleasure of building myself as a leader. Fast paced, and upheld high standards in the fast food industry."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Not bashing the company because i love Chipotle food.I would've had a better experience if I had better managers. Didn't know it was legal to give some one no hours for the week to teach them a lesson though.
good,Chipotle not only has great food but hard working employees. Not once did I hear staff members complain about their schedule. Everyone was helpful but management was horrible.
good,"I started my day by food prepping every morning. I start by frying 6-10 batches of chips, making salsa, making taco shells, and by the time we open there is already a line almost out the door. Working at Chipotle taught me to stay focused, communication is key, and the customers opinion matters more than anyone. It's all about having a good experience. The hardest part of working here was the long hours, sometimes I worked from 3pm-12am. They over work you but it's worth it in the end. I enjoyed the nice benefits the job offered."
good,"I loved working at Chipotle. It was kind of hard adjusting to the fast pace tempo, but i managed to catch on fast. The managers were very lenient with my schedule and i got along with all my coworkers. I have yet to work for another restaurant with the same vibe as Chipotle. I guess you could say it was unmatched. The only reason i left was because they fired me for cutting myself (and also paying for my 5 stitches) while i was performing my prep duties. If i had it my way I would still be working there, but i'm on the non-rehirable list."
good,"Employees often find themselves overworked. Most will usually find that the workplace culture is the only thing keeping them hooked, otherwise most will leave immediately."
good,"I love the friendly culture of Chipotle and the organic food, I also like that they have high standards for what is acceptable. The hardest part of it all was the fact that the company is very unstable. The operation procedures were always changing and it made for a very inconsistent day to day flow, and work rate of the Crew and management.  I"
good,Through my short time at this establishment brings out the absolute best of you on daily basis. Opportunities lies in every form for a person looking to rank in management.
good,Apply yourself and be apart of the team environment And the opportunity for advancement is endless. If you want to be taken seriously as a top performer than the stage us set for you to do so until you reach your goals.
good,Fun place to work if the conditions are right. The people really make the job or break the job. Chipotle as a company is very good about their standards and how you treat the food and the customers. Some managers are too aggressive in assuring that everything is perfect I understand that we as a team need to meet the company standards but the way in which the managers work with their team has a huge influence.
good,Some were just as young as me and didn't have an idea about what to do sometimes. I would recommend this job for high school students and college students visiting for breaks.
good,you don't get many hours or many days. The average day went by with ease you prep food. You start off with a kind environment. People there find the littlest thing to complain about even if your working to improve. I recommend no one to work here.
good,Chipotle has made me learn to catch on quickly and never stop moving. I am a fast learner and I love to learn new things! Chipotle does have a large amounts of benefits for the employees as well as payed breaks.
good,"My location was really busy. You had to be a fast learner and move quickly. At my store management could have been better. I felt they all wanted different things and couldn't agree to one common goal. I would work for the company again, just not at that store."
good,Overall an encouraging work environment with great co-workers and managers. I do feel that the pay/compensation was not enough for the amount of work and stress that came with the job.
good,"The best part in working for Chipotle Mexican Grill is the culture. Everybody cares for each other and take time to know each other. The most enjoyable part is the rush hour, time seem to go fast when everybody is focus to serve our guest. The hardest part of the job is to get to it because traffic is horrible in the mornings. What i learn at CMG is that a job is more than a job, it is my responsibility to make the people around me better."
good,"I loved working with my co-workers. We all work hard together and helped one another as a team. However, our pay was very low. Most of the time we were low on staff, therefore we had to work extra hard. I learned how to be more efficient with my time and finish any job assigned to me. Encountering many difficulties and striving to get the job done was one of the most important core values I learned to exceed in as a cashier in Chipotle."
good,"It's alright I guess I mean the bosses aren;t all that great, the hours suck, the place is always under many watchful eyes, the customers are rude, and it's not as clean as you'd like. The only upside is how the food taste."
good,It can be fun and all but it is stressing When you have a staff that likes to rush you in everything and the line can be long .. so you would be standing up for hours .
good,I learned a lot quickly but the people I work with are extremely immature and borderline rude. Managers haze and show favoritism. Never got proper trainings so I went into my first week or two of work completely lost.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Depending on what position I was assigned I would start by stocking my work station or prepping food. The training is really helpful and they focus a lot on time-management and food standards.
good,It was a substantial job. I really didn't expect to excel in their business. It was a very fast paced and friendly environment but often there was little team-work.
good,"I enjoyed working there but, I wouldn't go back because you must drink the juice to work there. You are used as a front line employee always. You must wash dishes, perp, cook, and work in the linelike an hourly employee."
good,"they were very conscious about what was put into the food, if the farms gave their animals any hormones/vaccines/etc. they would stop buying their product until they found a new local farm who didn't. There were great oppurtunities to advance and/or expand your horizons, but there was no job security."
good,"Work began the second you clock in. Depending on your station, you could be washing dishes, prepping food, cooking food, or even serving food. I have learned a lot about having a sense of urgency and having high standards. The managers seem to have little knowledge about running the business despite having years of experience. Many co-workers were lazy and complained often. Most of which cared very little about their work and almost refuse to put forth much effort."
good,Everyone there (besides management) is amazing and helpful but when you advance you gain the responsibilities of everyone else and it becomes so stressful it's not worth what you're getting paid.
good,"Culture is great, very laid back. The work is hard and very fast paced. Don't expect to be taking it easy. People love the food so there is rarely a slow day."
good,"Great first job opportunity with a lot of promotion potential. Difficult schedule for workers with families. High turn over rate, high enthusiasm in coworkers."
good,"Good relationships among employees. Fun place to work, always smiling. Bad management, not following child labor laws."
good,"I really enjoyed working for this company as I love to cook and interact with other people at the same time. I recently came across a barrier with my hands, carpal tunnel as gotten the best of me. I am currently working on improving this barrier in the near future. I am looking for employment where I can wear a brace if needed. I was the main cook at Chipotle with the title of Kitchen Manager so my work load was strenuous."
good,"Managers work 50+ hours a week the culture is great for the most part however your crew are the ones who make the decisions on who you hire and fire also its up to them if you get promoted or not so that can be good and bad, if some people just don't like you, you may be stuck and never be promoted or loose your job. Nice music you get to wear jeans and you get to be yourself."
good,"If you're looking for a good first job then this is the place to be. Lots of  responsibility and challenging work with people that care about you. Management can be good or bad depending on where you end up. Benefits are awesome if you can actually get them, I personally wasn't given my tuition reimbursement even though i qualified for it."
good,I was fun learning from people who took there job seriously and still know how to have fun and make the best of certain situations.
good,Great people and great company culture but it sucks up a lot of time and the pay is not good.  The crew really cares about what they do but being a manager is extremely stressful.  However there is lots of room to move up and the job gets better at higher levels.
good,good job and great place to work. fun and exciting place to work. they give many benefits to all of their employees. A typical day at work would be answering phone calls and speaking to all of our costumers in a professional way.
good,my particular store was not the best workplace. Great company with good benefits. hires within so always place for advancement. Good for improving knife skills.
good,"Busy, meet some good people, some mangers were great while others were not and overall working there was alright. Not enough hours and issues with scheduling. I learned a lot from a few coworkers. There is room to grow working there but not for everyone."
good,Not a place I want to advance but a good job nonetheless. I learned how to get everything done quickly seeing as most jobs here are very much deadline driven.
good,"It is a stressful, fast paced environment. If you enjoy that sort of work it is definitely the place for you! It is a good company to grow in and move up if you're looking to be there long term. The pay started above minimum wage and I was given benefits from day 1 as well. It is a company that is built around creating a culture that begins with a team of top performers that feel empowered to achieve high standards so that we can change the way people think about eating fast food. And they pride themselves on serving food with integrity (free range proteins and all things served that do not contain chemicals or preservatives.) So it's an awesome company in that sense. Chipotle is not where I want to be forever but it's a job to get me through school."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I'm not going to lie, a typical day at work can be the most stressful thing in the world. You have to be able to move fast and be able to effectively multitask in order to keep up with the demanding line of customers Chipotle generates. I ended up learning that I love moving in a fast paced environment. The best part of the job though, is the co workers. Over time you and your peers become a sort of family, which in turn makes you never want to leave."
good,Trained new workers on various stations. Adjusted schedule to workers needs and store hours. Insured customer satisfaction.
good,"As it was my first job, I had realized it wasn't the right job for me. I thought it would be a fun job, and fun to work in the food business but there were to many problems along the way. I tried to overcome them but it was to much"
good,"A Typical day working at chipoltle is A smooth sail. We;re usually busy around 11:30-1:00 & then things start to calm down as far as customers coming inside. I learned with this job that the sooner you master your hired position, you can get promoted fast! My co-workers are great. Getting along with my coworkers is half the job in my opinion. The hardest part about the job as a Grill cook is time management. Foods have to be ready ahead of time so that there can be no waiting points!"
good,"Chipotle promotes from within and I took advantage of it. Great place to learn restaurant management. Fast paced and sometimes stressful the days fly by. The field managers I had were not the most supportive, but that's anywhere. If you are just starting out a great place to learn."
good,"Good company to work for, young managers which sometime don't follow through with what they say.  Had fun and learned many food service skills."
good,"A typical day started off by showing up to work at 830 in the morning and preparing the needed amounts and ingredients needed for the day. What I learned form this job was that communication is a must. I was working two jobs at the time of being here, Chipotle during the day and Spectators at night, and I had to make sure that they had the days that I was off from the bar and when I wasn't. Management was the best that I worked at, they were consistent for the most part but I got promised to move up in the business and it fell through because one manager did not care for me. The hardest part of this job was dealing with the empty promises and keep doing everything I was supposed to do to advance. The most enjoyable part of this job was learning more kitchen skills because I love too cook and eat!"
good,I was not employed with Chipotle very long but I can say that the management was considerate of the fact that I have children and a busy class schedule. Pay is higher than minimum wage but was not enough for my situation.
good,"A typical work day, for me, in Chipotle was that I basically prepped a lot of the food that we would use for the day like guacamole, chips, taco shells, lettuce, etc. I also worked the line, attended to the customers, washed dishes, bagged chips, made vinaigrette, and also did the cash register. I learned how to make all of these things, how to handle a knife and I also learned how to be a better leader. In Chipotle they teach you how to be able to empower those around you and take charge. The management was OK. But, they do work with your hours and if they see you really want to work they will give you more hours. My co workers were also OK, but better than the management. The hardest part of the job would be, for others, handling the stress and the fast paced environment. If you're not use to it, I don't think this is the type of job for you because their peak hour can get very busy. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to move up and the environment and also, the customers."
good,"Upon arriving at work, our first priority is to prepare the restaurant for opening. That's about all that's easy during the work day. Even before we open, there are customer's waiting to come in and eat, which tends to annoy a few of the co-workers. There's probably only one good manager there, who is always more than willing to help with schedule needs or just giving out information pertaining to the store. The rest aren't, and expect way too much out of you. The training is usually rushed, but that's because the store is going through a translation in terms of management. It's a great place to work, just don't expect a lot of time off."
good,"I learn a plethora of things working for this company and had the opportunity to try many new things.  However, if you want to go far you do not have a work life balance it is all work, work, work.  I met many great people and made life long connections here and enjoyed almost every day I went to work."
good,"It was way to crowded, way to busy all the time, and was to much stress"
good,"a typical day a Chipotle included working on the line assembling food such as burritos, bowls and tacos while also working as a cashier and handling money. Also at the end of the day we would clean the whole restaurant and make it look brand new. this included scrubbing the floor, washing dishes, cleaning and packing all the left over food. While working here for a year i learned many things. For example, how to deal with demanding customers and also how to work in a very fast paced job. The hardest part of the job was dealing with workers who didn't care about the company and didn't want to be there because they didn't care about the customers or how well we did. the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting very interesting customers from different parts of the country.The original management was very hard working and down to earth and tried to help us work as a team, but a couple months after i started working there, there was a complete change in management without warning and the new management didn't seem very experienced but the job was still bearable."
good,"Its a very busy work flow and fun positive environment. I learned very much about the food quality,culture of the company and overall experience of a great restaurant, as well as kitchen /cooking procedures. However, the work flow and some personal labor demands become very stressful/tiring after a long period of time. Overall, there is much Knowledge one can gain from this company that helps improve your own work strategies and personal qualities in one's self."
good,Hungry customers will make you think twice about working at a fast food chain/restaurant.  That was the hard part.
good,Sucks getting sick when first getting a job. Fun to work there. It was a good experience minus being let go cause I had to be out of the job for a week in the first 90 day period
good,good place to eat but they need to work on caring for hard workers
good,"I loved working here! The people you work with are AWESOME, and the customers are actually enjoyable 90% of the time. The pay was good as long as you go to work and the tip always paid for my gas! My only complaint is that there is A LOT OF WORK that goes into opening and closing. Even more then I've seen before"
good,A typical day at work would be going in through the back of the house greeting all of my coworkers and starting the day of with positive vibes. I would then ask my manager what my work was for the day either cashier or food server on the line.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,is that i get to go into work every single day with a huge smile on my face. the atmosphere is amazing everyone is so nice and friendly.
good,"a typical day at work is cooking food nonstop, and doing dishes nonstop. i have learned the different ways to prepare foods and management still needs some work."
good,The management their was really not up to par. I stopped working their without notification because I was not receiving the treatment I deserved.
good,I learned all positions in the restaurant and coached at the same time on success and service.
good,"I learned to listen and teach myself on the fly, without coaching. Fast-paced work. I enjoyed working with the crew and the customers."
good,"Chipotle was a great part time job. I always had a lot of fun working there, my managers/co-workers were always in a great mood, and I feel I created a family type bond with them."
good,Great place if you in college or just coming out of high school
good,"-Clock in"
good,In my experience at chipotle i had a manager who in which was very impolite. None the less co workers made the job enjoyable fun and the customers are great.
good,"Start the day off by prepping for the day. I learned to fry chips and wrap burritos. The managers were very nice and supportive and the co-workers were awesome. All great people. All around good work environment. The hardest part was completing all of the prep on time. Any miscues or unexpected obstacles would mess everything up so that made me a ""perfectionist"". The most enjoyable part would have been interacting with the customers."
good,"At chipotle its a decent work place but has many flaws, management is not all to great. But you meet great employees and new people each day. But you have to have patience with the customers and do things at a fast pace and multitask"
good,Well we all know that Chipotle is a good food company. They have great food and I learned a lot from there. I learned how to have cutting skills in a fast pace. I learned to make burritos and served pretty much anything the customers wanted. The most enjoyable par of my job is staying busy. Time went by way much faster than what I expected.
good,"during my time working for chipotle i learned many ways to produce and manufacture many types of food in a fast and clean environment "
good,"Working at Chipotle is a great experience because it has taught me a lot to grow, how to teach others, to work professional, and progress myself further. I am a Kitchen Manager In Training (KMIT) and ready to be a Kitchen Manager. There are a few things that my store needs to improve: have better communication and help each other more."
good,"Great experience on leading and training a crew, being responsible for productive shifts, lead by example, and making personel around you better each day"
good,"Lost too much time with my daughter with 70+ hr work weeks. Quite easy to move up if you have a strong desire to succeed. Also, offered benefits day one. Chipotle will teach you very useful knife skills."
good,"This is a great company to work for. This was a very very demanding position and requirers a very high energy level at all times. I learned to manage multi-millon dollar restaurants by controlling inventory, running highly effective shifts, control staffing levels, train future; Kitchen Managers, Service Managers, Apprentices, General Managers. I also helped develop Restauranteur restaurant by training the crew on proper procedures and created a culture of exceptional customer service. The most enjoyable part of my job was turning restaurants that were below company standards to above and beyond company standards."
good,"Working at Chipotle can be a great experience. I learned a lot about the importance and affects of the culture and people on a successful business. They have the right idea of setting a fun, fast-paced environment. In my time at Chipotle I was not treated as a valuable employee despite working double-shifts, being a top-performer, averaging 50+ hours a week for an entire year as an hourly employee and always going the extra mile. I was let go after being mistreated and under-trained by my GM for 2 years."
good,"I was a apprentice manager, so i oversaw operations and did cash and resturant audits. I made sure that the 2 managers under me were doing their jobs aswell. The hardest part was doing cash audits and the most enjoyable was working and talkiong to the people."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,As manager they do not accommodate your schedule nor care if your a single parent so they don’t consider your hours and how much you can actually see your kid. If you have no kids this job is perfect
good,"A typical day at work would start with getting all the prep done, clean around the restaurant. Grill all the meats. get all things on line, eat before opening and after we would welcome costumers and serve them."
good,"It was a very nice experience working for chipotle."
good,Great business to work for. They really want you to grow with the company. Honestly a great first job. Would love to go back if I could get paid a little more.
good,"I have enjoyed working for Chipotle, mostly. It has its issues just like any other company. I've gotten paid more and had a better experience overall than I would at some other restaurant in my area."
good,"I had fun with my coworkers but.."
good,A general day would be Cashiering and scrubbing the bathroom floors on my hands and knees. It's a great paying job there's just quite a bit of tediousness when it comes to certain tasks. Like one time I spent a solid two hours polishing brass pipes.
good,"I personally was hesitant to work for this company but once I started to work, I was able to learn new things and meet amazing people. I worked there for 2 years and it was a great experience."
good,My review on chipotle they are a good place to work at they are very hands on and everything is made fresh. They wake up early and start working early.
good,"Good benefits, Fast paced so can be a little stressful. I love my job just having to pick up others slack is annoying at times. Tuition assistance is great."
good,"LOVED working for Chipotle before i stepped into management. The pay is decent- good for the area. The breaks were really nice, free food and in the middle of your shift. The fast paced environment was very competitive and fun! The only thing that made me leave was my manager threatening to fire me due to goals she did not meet and because our area supervisor threatened her. I was good at my job which made all the things that didn't happen turn out to be my responsibility. I was in charge of the kitchen, but was blamed for things happening outside of the kitchen. They push you to be their slave and expect you to be there regardless of your out time or other things you have planned. Also don't even think about being sick or having any medical issues because you are NOT allowed to be sick. You will be talked about and bullied for having sick days."
good,"I worked at Chipotle for 8 months as a a cashier initially, and later on the line as well. The managers were all great and I would consider most of my coworkers friends.  The work environment was fun and positive and we always had a good time. Customers are fine most of the time, but as a cashier, you’re the one who gets the complaints from unhappy customers and it gets old really fast. Also as a cashier, you are expected to keep the whole dining room clean, even when there’s a line out the door. Don’t expect much, if any, help from managers in this area. The breaks are paid, but that’s for a good reason. The manager covering your break doesn’t do anything to keep things clean while you’re gone, so when you get back it’s always trashed. One good thing about working cash is that you can do your own thing because there isn’t as much manager supervision since you’re more on your own. On the other hand, working the line is stressful because when it’s busy there can be up to four people working on the line and people can get a little snippy. In my area, Chipotle pays minimum wage, but as I understand it that’s not true everywhere. We have a higher minimum wage here, but elsewhere they do pay above minimum. Overall, I would recomend working here, as long as you don’t plan to stay for long because you can get fed up with everything after a while. My recommendation would be to work the line over cash, since I had way more fun doing that."
good,les equipes sont sympas et vous aide a mieux travailler en equipe.
good,"It was certainly not a bad experience overall, I just wish there was more in the way of moving up in the business.  The food is so fantastic, it's worth it just for that."
good,a typical day at work for managers was about 12 hours. I learned a lot about my leadership style and where my weak spots are. i perfected my leadership and relied a lot on the training and skills id acquired as a Eagle Scout. I tried to reinforce the atmosphere of a team and won the loyalty of my team. but our store was plagued by staffing issues.
good,"Not a great job in my opinion but that’s only if your stuck with back of house. The amount of time you are given along with the amount of tasks for the back of house workers isn’t manageable for most people and quite frankly explains Chipotles problems with sanitation. Do everything by the book and you will clock out late. I promise you that. It seems as though every employee has a different way of going about their prep/back of house duties (not to “chipotle standards”) just to ensure they can clock out a little bit sooner, and to be honest I don’t blame them. Make friends with everyon and your job will be a little easier. Make especially sure your buddy buddy with the grill master. You’ll see why. Oh by the way, dishes!"
good,"They have good benefits for a food service job like about a dollar above min wage starting, health, dental, vision, paid breaks, paid time off, free food and usually flexible scheduling. However, it is a very fast paced high demand workplace and they will work you very hard for those good benefits. You learn a very good work ethic though."
good,Working at Chipotle definitely made me a better worker by being able to keep up with the pace and all the while remaining level headed to avoid any mistakes.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"It’s cool, depends on where your going. Every stores different and something they’ll ask you to go to a different store. Just don’t let them walk all over you"
good,A typical day at chipotle as a grill cook consist of continuing team members task from last shift making sure line is filled and updated with temperatures and next need refills on line foods.  I learned at chipotle how to work at a fast pace and with team members to get things done sufficiently.  Hardest part of a grill cook at chipotle is making sure all task are finished in a sufficient and timely manner while keeping temperatures and food amounts updated.  Most enjoyable part of this job is the discounted food and the integration of team members into a family.
good,This was my first job so they're great for young people. A great company if you're looking for a career in food because they have tons of opportunity for advancement.
good,"It was an interesting experience. There was a lot going on with the management and a lot of conflicts at the restaurant because of it. Very frustrating, but overall, it was an interesting experience."
good,"Chipotle hires some of the best, energetic, and friendly people. The job requires people to actually work and be doing things at all times, not just standing around or passing time. It is a fast-paced environment and most times requires you to know how to multi-task and use critical thinking to solve problems. Although, I believe management does not get paid enough for all the work and time they put into their jobs."
good,really enjoy the culture there. very busy and everything needs to be as fast as possible. managers were bad so the restaurant wasn't as best as it could be
good,They create a culture where everyone is encouraged to show enthusiasm and exemplify mutualism and cooperation. It's competitive and fast but you are valued and appreciate (by your fellow staff anyway)
good,"-come in, work"
good,"Management is great and they get involved in the work and help you when needed or asked upon. Chipotle has many great plus’s and negatives as well. One great thing is you get free food on your shift and it’s paid the 30 minutes your on it. There is also full benefits to all crew and management (including tuition reimbursement) no matter if you’re in a salary or hourly position. Payment methods consist of a payroll card or direct deposit into your bank account. The earliest you can clock in is 5 minutes before your shift time. There are a ton of lazy people that work here and either don’t know what they are doing, or just don’t do there job correctly. The morning crew leaves a lot of stuff and some stuff undone for the night shift to do which is pretty unfair considering they do it on a regular basis..... busy or not. TIME IS NOT ON YOUR SIDE so get done with your job ASAP. It’s hard to fit 8 hour work into 6 or less hours but has to be done and is very tiring since I have mounds of dishes piling in when you have other work to do including other people’s work. Note that everyone will not help you but a few will so pray you get a shift with them. The biggest con of this location is career advancement. It’s hard to move up in a management position. Ive been working here 8 months going on 9 and haven’t been asked of a management position nor have been cross trained to work any other position. It gets tiring doing the same hard work every day of the week. Overall good, needs some work."
good,"Although it was only a few months of my life, working at Chipotle was my first ever job. It wasn’t too terrible for me personally, but a lot of my coworkers voiced their grievances about issues within the workplace and it was disheartening. The only true time I got “played” by the management was when my hours got cut for being a minor."
good,"Faced paced, freedom, room to grow but not many options to move up career wise. The main thing that irritated me was that I was never off at the time I was scheduled to be off."
good,"my typical day consists of cooking meet on the grill, cutting said meat after properly prepared. always serve food with a positive attitude as should be done at all restaurant businesses. Employees always make the day better, we try to always make the best out of a work day."
good,Great place to work unless you have the wrong area manager that sexually harassed you! But not all of them are the same it can actually be an amazing job with amazing apportunities if the management they choose were on top of thing better instead of harassing there employees!
good,"I enjoyed the people I worked with, the job I did was very simple and easy to do all day, time went by at a good pace but i always went home sweaty and my management staff didn't listen to my availability."
good,"I worked here for 8 months as a Kitchen Manager, it was my first job and it was amazing. I left due to difficulties balancing school and work, this is a great place to work though."
good,This job is very fast paced and can get pretty stressful. But I always had good managers and Chipotles business model is great. There is always room for advancement and the pay is good. I stopped working there because of the shifts and I needed a more consistent schedule
good,If your somebody has never knew how to work in a fast pace job Chipotle Mexican Grill would be perfect why because I believe the work itself is fast so that will give somebody the advantage to take heed on working and moving fast but still getting the job done the right way
good,Once was a great place to work. Till the media ruined our reputation. Sales dropped and opportunities to continue to grow decreased. Company lost consistency of procedures and operations. Made it very complicated to teach and train employees. Strict sick policy.
good,"It is a faced paced job that requires energy and hard work. It can be stressful at times for certain employees. The company is strict on food safety and health codes. It provides good training for the job, so employees feel confident once they begin working."
good,At this job i lerarned about sense of urgency and consistency with doing my job good. Also i learned how to deal with situations as a team. Also helped me adapt to pressured circumstances.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotle is a difficult company, but it compensates you for the troubles u seem to go through over time. I live the atmosphere of working with your everyday crew. Managers at the time werent very lenient on others opinions more about the standards, and sometimes those standards cooldnt be reached from certain people."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was getting the job done earlier then expected.  The hardest part were the holidays when chipotle would have fundraisers and the lines would be back up to the door or passed that.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a great deal of multitasking. For example, while the chicken and steak were cooking on the grill, previously cooked meats were in need of being cut into pieces. At the same time, rice and beans were prepared on the side. This is a very fast-paced job, with little to no breaks on the job, especially around busy times such as dinner time. I learned how to perform well under pressure and complete several tasks at once. The management did well in teaching me all of the tricks of the trade. Workplace culture was exceptional, all employees were sociable and good to each other, and cleaning sessions were fun and involved listening to music at the same time. Most enjoyable part of the job was seeing friends come into the shop to eat, so make sure you appear presentable at work."
good,"they need to pay more for the amount of work you do $9 for being there to prep fresh 3 hours before opening and also they have problem with managing time. They'll have 10 employees but somehow you end up leaving 2 hours after your clock out time and then get in trouble for overtime but your coworkers are amazing  time goes by fast because its always busy, interview was easy its a group interview where they ask basics questions such as ""where do you see yourself in the future "" ""what can you bring to the table that makes you different than the others"" questions like that. They basically want someone that is willing to move up the ladder if you pass they will call you to come for second interview and then to come again to meet the crew to see if they like you and then you're in it takes about a week or two to get hired."
good,Chipotle asks a lot of its employees and doesn't compensate them very well as far as hourly pay. The benefits almost make up for the pay. Its very challenging but rewarding work. I wouldn't suggest working here unless you plan on moving up into management.
good,"It was a very diverse restaurant. The food was excellent and the customers helped to brighten my days. I got to meet all kinds of new wonderful people, one woman was from France and even spoke a little french to me one time. I even had a coworker who was from Africa and another who was from Jamaica, I really enjoyed and appreciated that because I had never met anyone from a different country before so it was nice to hear and actually to speak to them about their lives and experiences. The free meals with work shifts really helped me because of my school schedule and the distance from my home to the job. If it wasn’t for the free meals, I wouldn’t have been able to eat. Everything was excellent the first couple of months until I noticed the managers would freely abuse their power and authority. Honestly if it wasn’t for the unfair treatment of the managers then my overall experience would’ve been excellent. It’s a wonderful place to eat at but the workers do have it pretty tough."
good,"Chipotle is a very fun place to work and offers good benefits for a standard part-time employee. It took me about 2 and 1/2 years to promote to a Service Manager. My pay was 13.50 an hour. After being manager for about 3 years I lost my job along with another manager on the spot, with no warning, for failing to validate an employee's signature in a book verifying they are well enough to work. It is a good atmosphere but if you do not follow strict guidelines that are constantly changing then your job is on the line."
good,Depending on the store you were hired at you either got a great experience or bad. Both ways hard work will get you very far. Show you mean business and they will take you seriously.
good,"You get a free meal every shift, which is nice. I was a cashier that oftentimes came in the morning, which meant opening the entire front of the house. You're given a time limit to count your money, bring down all the dining room chairs (inside and patio), unwind the umbrellas, and make all the salad dressing for the day. You have to clock in and out of your shifts with a special ID, so you're kind of screwed if you've lost it."
good,"I enjoyed my time there, a lot of the people there were really great and seemed to truly care about you and how you felt about the work place, my location needed some new management in certain areas."
good,"Chipotle is a decent job for someone if they are interest in a rough start and moved up to a manager if you want that experience. If taught me a lot but I have advanced in the company twice in the first 8 months of working from a crew member to kitchen manager to service managers. Also I have prior emails from corporate, when customers send good emails about me."
good,"I'd go in, clock in, and would get to work. Breaks were good. We get free food while on the clock. We would get one 30 minute break every 5 hours. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to be around your coworkers and have fun. The hardest part is when it gets really busy and you're scrambling to call foods, make the food, and keep customers happy and the line clean."
good,"Chipotle is a great company to work for. It's fast paced, stressful, and very much a fast food environment. But you can advance quickly if you want to and learn many new skills."
good,"Chipotle is a super fast paced job. Management was a little unprofessional. I left for my personal reasons involving another employee and the manager told my business to the whole store. I thought that was confidential but.... guess not. The environment was pretty fun, workers were pretty cool."
good,"-The work load is a lot and not suitable for everyone"
good,"A typical day at chipotle was very easy if you know what you're doing. For someone just starting out, it is very overwhelming. You are expected to do a lot for not enough pay. It's also a very fast paste job, you are expected to do everything fast but the people you work with are wonderful, and it is like a family."
good,"At some point I loved working at Chipotle but, we all know things change. People weren't showing up for their shifts and we would have to pick up others slack but weren't allowed to get over time. Employees that knew only one position was getting paid more than the ones who knew every position. With the closing crew you never got out on time, for one being understaffed and workers who did not care."
good,Chipotle is a great place to start if you're interested in culinary or restaurant management. Management overall is okay but could use more organization with the new changes that come frequently from corporate.
good,"It goes by fast you must be quick pace. Be able to stand for almost all eight hours. Be ready to be stressed out, must be able to meet deadline with food preparation. This is the environment I worked with when i was there."
good,The shifts are face paced and stressful if you arent prepared for it.The crew can be very welcoming me when there is a major obstacle we are trying to accomplish.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"The job is very fast paced, especially for being located in a college town. The biggest pro of this job is the work space atmosphere, as many of my coworkers are fun and very easy to get along with."
good,"In my opinion Chipotle is a good place to work, and I would recommend it to any young friend who is looking for a first job, or someone looking to move up the chain in restaurant management. An average day at Chipotle has it's ups and downs. The least enjoyable part of the job is dealing with customers. Chipotle allows their customers to get away with murder, and they mistreat us because of that. The best part of the job was working with lots of good people. There were many days where I felt as though my crew brought me out of a negative place, and vice versa. That is something that you can't take for granted, for sure! The hardest part of my job was inevitably having to let people go, it is never fun, but it is a necessity."
good,"It's cool here, most people love it. Can advance positions with hard work and great work ethic not a bad entry level job or for high school students and college students"
good,"When staffing is in place, crew is trained, and there's a culture of training and advancement, crew has fun, work is fast-paced, and you get to watch people grow and get better. Now that there's so much attention being paid to food safety because of the health issues over the past two years, it sometimes puts a damper on the enjoyment of the job as a manager because there's more to handle."
good,"Very fast paced and stressful environment. Unhelpful managers, rude coworkers, rude customers, a very negative place. Decent paying job and a good first job, but not for long."
good,Chipotle is definitely still a fairly young company. The chain is still going through many changes as it grows. Hopefully they will continue to improve as they expand.
good,"extremely busy atmosphere and it can be very tiring, but overall staff tends to be very laid-back and you gets opportunities to move up. One of the down-sides is that you can't stay in one position for too long, since they stress the importance of cross-training"
good,We're always kept busy. If we have any free time we spend cleaning. We do our best to uphold high standards and keep up with expectations. The hardest part of the job is staying motivated when we get short staffed.
good,"I was a crew member at Chipotle and it was amazing. Most of the time, you already know what is expected of you to do once you walk in for the day."
good,"A typical work day starts out by putting on your apron and washing your hands,then putting on gloves; no work was to be started unless I was in complete uniform. I was to perform my normal duties of making chips and I was taught to season the meat and make guacamole as I moved up in the company. I made it as far as a cashier and this stage was most enjoyable because I got a little more time to talk with the customers. The least enjoyable of wo0rking for Chipotle is that the managers were bad communicators. In the time that I spent there we went through two managers. This put stress on the workers because we were under the impression that we were a team but instead we were working as individuals. Overall I learned to greet customers as soon as they walk in the door and I developed a sense of urgency. This company helps you to become literate on their vision, food safety and the thirteen characteristics of being a top performer."
good,It's a easy job to move up the ladder. However you do more than the job description. Hard work but could also be fun with he right team. a pro is you get free food with extra guac ;)
good,"A day typical day for a crew member involves serving food to customers by being on the line, doing table touches and asking customer feedback for the food and communicating that to members working on grill and prep."
good,"It's a great company to work for, but unfortunately every ""new"" thing they implement into the restaurant, actually makes the job a lot more difficult for the employees instead of facilitating."
good,"start of my day at chipotle is coming in putting on my apron and hat and clock in to the computer system, then I would be on salsa 2 because I was one more advance workers on my shift for this given day. when work on salsa 2 it consist of adding last 3 condiments then even wrapping the burritos close or closing up the burrito bowls. I learned at chipotle how to be a  better  team player and helping my peers not when just ask but just because its right thing to do. I have also got some hands on learning from some my kitchen supervisor such as able marinated steaks, chicken for next shift or day. Able to cook on the grill with minimum help from my shift supervisor. Some the hardest part at chipotle is when rudely customers come in and every rude and disturbing guest and staff and not much I can say or do about it. Some most enjoyable part job is all the works makes feel like your family there and that you can do anything you put your mind too at chipotle."
good,"Good job overall to start out with. Lots of opportunities to advance and become managers and even own stores. Work pace is lightning speed. If you're someone that's slow and methodical, don't work there."
good,"Demanding, much responsibility. Need to be on top of tasks. Management is relaxed if you are good with handling work. Great team of individuals to work with."
good,a lot of work not the best job if you have other things to do after  work. they work with your schedule. help you grow in the company and make something better for your future
good,"Chipotle is a fast-paced job in which teaches you multitasking, handling difficult situations between customers and servers and how to quickly, properly and smoothly work without overworking yourself. The best part is being able to deliver food and customer service. The negatives coincide with management. Management tends to be too personal and childish, and often slows down the crew members more than helping them"
good,"This job wasn't completely awful. My crew and managers were very amazing, high energy people. The job itself wasn't hard, the pay was decent and overall was doable. However, the work environment was often very stressful and I found myself overworked and eventually came to the conclusion that it just wasn't worth it anymore."
good,"Overall, it was great working with people who enjoyed coming to work. I've learned a lot of kitchen skills and basically how to run my own business. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing success in business numbers such as sales, labor, and controllable costs. The hardest part of the job definitely has to be the amount of hours put in daily without getting paid overtime, when you're a salaried manager of course."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,while i was a crew member i usually opened so i would come in at 8:00 am and i would assist on turning on everything necessary for prepping food which was probably the hardest part because every minute really counted but it was also the most enjoyable part because it was fun working with and getting to know my co workers while getting ready for the day because chipotle has a way of hiring people who have great chemistry with each other and that's actually a big part of their culture which is working as a team and making sure the customers were being taken care of.
good,"A typical day at work would be arriving promptly either before or at eight am. You pull all your prep from the walk in after washing your hands then you set up your station. You must have everything ready by ten thirty am. Chipotle is a very busy company so it put me on a top notch pace. I learned how to work accurately, fast, clean, and friendly all at once. The culture of our job was very mixed. The hardest part of the job is during a rush when you have a line out or to the door. A easy way to bypass that is making sure your stocked and staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job is creating different mixtures for customers. I always loved when a customer trust my taste buds."
good,"Chipotle is the ideal work place for teenagers looking for extra money. However, be prepared to spend all of your weekends at work. This job consists of heavy emphasis on customer service, and less on the employees themselves."
good,Taught you ways how to cut new things and ways.Very multicultural had lots of different type of people. People wouldnt do there job so  would have to pick yup the slack.
good,I was working at Chipotle for a little over a year. Loved all my coworkers like they were family. Their food was great of course and i got to eat as much as i wanted LOL. kidding! But working their is the best experience ever!
good,When I was a manager here I was busy all the time. I usually had an 8 hour shift and taking even a 5 minute break was a lot for me to have. As a manager there's just always work that needs to be done from paperwork on the computer to serving customers to delegating tasks to the crew members.
good,Chipotle Is a good company that gives a lot of room for progression and advancement within the company. My employees were very nice and management was the same.
good,"This is a job that requires you to move at an extremely quick pace. It is hard to find free moments and even though I worked with good people I could hardly find time to talk to them because I was so constantly busy. I got laid off after a month. Very high turnover rate, but a lot of opportunities to advance your position."
good,High stress job working with individuals who are not helpful. Loved it when i first started but now the management team has changed certain rules and now making our jobs almost unbearable
good,"A typical day at work is painstakingly preparing high quality food for hours, taking a rushed break with a meal and then serving the food in the morning, or at night serving food with a full break and meal then quickly cleaning up. The management and workplace culture is great overall. They really focus on people development and making sure crew members are accommodated. The food quality is great and sometimes conveniently located near health food grocery stores. The hardest part of the job is the physical labor. If you think about becoming a manager like I did, do not take the physical labor lightly, because it takes a long time to be promoted beyond this point. Middle level managers have to put up trucks, skip breaks, come in to clean for hours for facilities audits, come in for additional meetings, and stay late for about the same pay as a crew member. The most enjoyable part was being able to connect with amazing people. The people that work here and many of the customers are very strong, smart, and inclusive. Being here lays the foundation for growth and many opportunities."
good,"The family feel of the crew is great. It's easy to become close to your co-workers, but employee turnover is usually high. Management and co-workers are constantly changing which makes training effectively difficult, and you have to put in extra unscheduled hours to get the job done. Besides that the benefits are amazing and the work is dynamic."
good,"Chipotle was a fun environment for a teen to work in, but the management was very poor. In my time there, we'd been through 5 General Managers and 7 Service Managers. Some people's attitudes weren't the best either. Other than that, the workplace was very upbeat and friendly. Customer interaction was priceless, and I loved it for the most part."
good,It's fast past but not enough hours I enjoyed working there but at the same time they didn't have stuff in order there I loved the experience and was always working
good,The turn over rate is very high. Sometime unfair treatment and way to much work for what we get paid in such a short period of time. Very stressful but i love dealing with the customers.
good,"Chipotle is a great place to work if you don't have other outside activities going on. I picked up a lot of hours and moved up fairly quick due to always being available to pick up people's shifts and requesting more hours. If you show them you want to be there, they'll definitely want you there too."
good,"Good for teenagers or adults who want to move to management. They were always pushing for people to move up and become managers or supervisors. I also didn't like that I had to work around so many teens. Overall I think for the right person its the ideal job with great benefits, It just wasn't for me, they were always cutting my hours expecting me to waste my time and come in for 3-4 hours everyday."
good,"Hard work, comes with benefits such as school reimbursement, healthcare, and food. Caters to customers, will not always be the most encouraging circumstances. It does improve character and work ethic."
good,"it is a busy day filled with constructive criticism and business, i learned how to manage my labor and time and manage the staff and where they are supposed to work what positions, the hardest part of the job is the business and the most enjoyable part is the crew and how much they want to be there and be apart of the team."
good,On a typical day depending on where you're stationed you are required to keep the dining room clean and stocked. Keep the line clean and presentable. And keep the kitchen clean at all times. Persons on the line have to provide quick service at all times and be friendly to all guests. Cashier is responsible for charging the customers.
good,Store is very fast pace. Some cusomers were rude. Work very tiring.   management simply didnt care and was rude. Co workers were lazy.
good,Working at Chipotle was a pretty good experience. The work was hard but it was manageable. Most of my co-workers were fun to work with and easy to talk to. The problems I had was with my managers. All of them. Some of them didn't seem like they cared about their job and the general manager was very rude. Overall I think Chipotle is a good place to work at especially for your first job it just depends on who you are working with. If you want an enjoyable experience with Chipotle you have to try to work together as a team and I did not feel like that with my team most of the time. You need a good team if you want a nice experience with Chipotle.
good,"Learned how to use cash register, prepare food for customers and serve orders. Learned how to prepare online food orders as well as over the phone orders. Restocked utensils, napkins, soda lids, condiments, drinks and food items. Performed cleaning duties and distributed tips accordingly."
good,Depending on what position you are hired as it can be easy but also very tiring if you get prep or really anything in the back its very stressful .The line and cash are much easier but more tedious because you are dealing with customers but less strenuous. They do offer benefits like scholarships and moving up in the company.
good,Great time working in an enviroment of top perfomers who are impowered to achieve high standards. Cleaning the kitchen was hard but so is writing this review considering i dont know what it has to do with this job im applying for?
good,Everyday is a busy day at chipotle with a line out the door every night around 4-6. Its important each employee withholds a great attitude and prompt service every day. I'm comfortable with working in fast moving environments while ensuring the customer has satisfactory customer service.This company taught me to take more initiative and call out any problems witnessed also to treat the restaurant as my own.
good,"Chipotle was a great learning experience for me after high school. I made a lot of friends while I worked there, my co-workers were great and they helped me when I needed it. The hardest part of the job was when we would get online orders right before we opened so we had to juggle the online orders as well as the customers that were usually waiting at the door. The most enjoyable part about the job was knowing that I was able to help my parents with bills and even partly take care of myself."
good,I enjoy working with the customers. I enjoy giving excellent service and want to pursue a career in making people smile.
good,Great culture and integrity. Challenging work environment that rewards in team growth and compensation. Talented and focused leadership.
good,"It's a lot of work, you have to know how to do prep, line and grill. You hardly ever leave on time and a lot is expected of you. You can only really take your break when the line dies down so you're gonna be working hungry a lot."
good,"I loved working at Chipotle, I definitely learned a lot about working with people, problem solving, and the fundamentals of how a business is run. I loved my co-workers and management, not the best pay unless working as a gm of your own branch of the company. Overall i really loved my work environment, and can honestly say i looked forward to walking into work everyday, even on weekends."
good,"Great place to work in high school/college, time expectations from management can be ridiculous sometimes, great benefits, free chipotle at work!"
good,"Overall, a great experience. Learned how to be a top performer, while providing excellent customer service by empowering those around me."
good,"Management is poor."
good,Daily prep is required before the restaurant opens and throughout the work day. High standards and work ethics are required for success in the business.
good,"I did not mind doing the work, I loved the company. it was more so some of the people I was working with. I wish to not talk so much about this."
good,High volume of customers.  High quality food and spices.  Maintained as a cashier and food prep cook.  Delighted customers with a personable state of mind and upsold sides/family meals well.
good,"My coworkers were much younger and immature than me so I didnt get along with them very well, you get one free meal every shift which was great because I love Chipotle's food. You tend to stay very busy so you'll get experice in multi tasking and doing things very quickly."
good,Chipotle is a wonderful place to work at don't get me wrong everyone is like family. Then you have some of the management that let power get to their heads and most of the management don't have actual leadership skills they just promote them.
good,Chipotle is the best job I ever had.  I am looking for a career at this stage of my life. Will work extremely hard to exceed in the work place.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Learned much more specially costumer servise."
good,"The first year I worked at Chipotle was an awesome experience. It was my first job, it was different and fun for me. Within one year we went through two General Managers, we lost our Restaurantuer Title, and we still have not been able to bounce back. We have lost quite a few employees within the last month."
good,"They will work you ounce for ounce, and company culture sometimes blinds the management from access to true solutions. While the visions are easy to get behind, you can't help but wonder if its over simplified or not as pragmatic as its presented."
good,I really liked the job and everything but the two things that stuck with me was being told to call back every week for on call and never getting anything and being told later about meeting quotas when you are doing prep.
good,"Chipotle is a fun place to work and it has alot of opportunity to advance. We listen to fun music, get to move around the store, and it is very relaxed"
good,Shifts were short but fufilling. I like making good food for people. Boss micro managed which was a big negative.
good,great place to work where I enjoyed where I have a passion for because it makes me feel important because I have to make sure that nothing happens for example theft or even a fight. I always get along with my cow workers because we help each other  and the most enjoyable part of the job is the satisfaction that I have and a pleasure that I feel when I left off the work just because i make or made the day perfect of what i did or what  i do
good,"steady paced, easy going peers and enjoyed working with everyone"
good,"Chiptole is a notoriously known burrito restaurant. However that doesn't save the name from personal experience. Every company has it's downfalls. For instance if management isn't at it's best they tend to pressure the workers. Meaning? they'd down talk the weakest link and encourage other employees. Why is that an issue? Not to mention the company message is to bring people to their best level, people being EVERY employee. Nothing is wrong with pressure, I mean that could be the best message in the world, but displaying confidence like a military ad isn't attractive and can be disheartening. So day to day working was a little bit more slaving than enjoyable."
good,a day at work at chipotle is always fun and super busy always full of suprises with the wide variety of customers we would have coming in every day.
good,"Working as a cashier, which is the starting position they first place you on, you're in charge of asking the customers if they'd like chips or a drink and keep the dining area clean. During the rush hours, it can be quite hectic balancing both customers at the register and needing to wipe down tables/sweep the floors, but the fast pace kept you occupied and made the time fly if you're into that sort of thing."
good,"All of the co-workers were very awesome to get along with. We worked together in teams to get the front line moving so customers will come in and get out quickly. By the end of our first half shift, we would be sweating like we just came out of the shower (sarcastically). Everyone were all hard workers but, had fun at the extra times when customers weren't present. The Managers were more lenient than I would have expect but they knew how to control the restaurant quite well. Working at this restaurant actually gave me the idea of wanting to pursue my career in culinary art, one day owning a restaurant! So that's one huge plus for this restaurant!!   "
good,Typical day of work was very busy
good,Something that stands out about working for this company is the crew itself. Amazing people who give amazing service. Makes us all unique and to freely express ourself in a professional way.
good,I only worked at a Chipotle for a month but it wasn't that bad.  I marinated meats at the beginning of my shift and washed dishes the rest of the day until I got off.  It was incredibly easy.
good,I would either work 11 to 8 or 3 to 11with one break standing all day working 6 days a week. I would request time off wouldn't give me the days off after I work the worse shifts and everyone else got off early or enjoyed the day they wanted to.
good,"I started working here when I was still in high school, never thinking I would pursue it as a career. I fell in love with the culture and found that the company's values really aligned with my own. The struggle is many stores are severely manager understaffed which makes it very difficult to maintain life/work balance."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"As a crew member working there I had many good experiences but bad experiences as well some of the Managers didn’t know how to talk to there crew members and the store wasn’t well taken care as in we ran out of supplies as in sized gloves, Marinating aprons and etc, there’s always something breaking down either it was the retherm or the cheese machine, soap depsenser, drink dispensers would give flat soda or the ice machine would break"
good,"While working at Chipotle, the stress and pace of the job can be overwhelming. The management was good to work with but being able to learn new things at the location I was at was almost impossible. When I became good at something, the management did not encourage me to learn new things when I wanted to. so the only complain would be lack of progress and promotions."
good,"A typical day at work for me was to get to Chipotle early and prep everything on time with two more team members before we opened, I learned how to cut vegetables, the hardest part was being really fast and doing everything good at a quick past"
good,"My career at Chipotle lasted for only three months.  It was a great company to work for if you enjoy free food, but there are other things to consider.  If you're unfortunate enough to have poor management it would truly affects you.  My manager at that time forgot to schedule me sometimes!  The assistant manager was rude and bossy particularly to me."
good,"Good job experience. Nice people. Good place to work. Thanks for the knowledge, and the experience. Will use what I learned moving forward with my journey."
good,"Overall, this company has been decent for a starting job. It is very fast paced and demanding. The environment was decent, but it had its moments. The people that come in there can give you a real hard time, but you can have that anywhere. Management at my location was alright, but I was suppose to be promoted, but when GM’s were changed, the new one decided they did not wish to promote anyone at the time. That was a bummer. The job just takes a lot out of you."
good,"Chipotle gives many opportunities to move up in their company. I dedicated three years of my time, and managed for one. Pros are that they have paid time off, decent pay, easily move up, good vibe environment (at times)"
good,Chipotle not that bad and the environment is pretty cool just need better management and need to go by people schedule but over all I like to work there the people are cool and fun
good,"I think the right intentions are there, but the grind is causing too many managers, leaders to walk off the job due to the pressures of working as crew when crew do not show up. I do not agree with the type of employees the upper scaled restaurant attracts. Our food with integrity program and classically trained chef who started the company give a better than fast food experience, we need to pay and attract a caliber of applicants that match the image the company wants to portray."
good,"Depending on the job the day wont be too bad, people on the line the job is very normal. But cooks and managers can get alot of work on their hands becoming very stressful. Personally not work the pay at that point. But otherwise a fairly good experience."
good,"As a part of management, I have learned that to succeed you need to direct and help your employees as need be. Proper training goes a long way and you must practice patience because everyone does not learn the same."
good,"Chipotle overall is a pretty good part time job.  My complaints would include management and other co-workers.  My current manager is good, but my co-workers..."
good,Great pay and free meal with every shift so you can't really complain. The hours are long and tiring but the pay is worth it in my opinion. Management wasn't the most understanding of school issues so I had to leave.
good,Es bueno agradable buena empresa para empezar a trabajar
good,"It was a very fast-paced place of work. You could get along with everyone there.  The food was great and the benefits was awesome, if you got it.  I would definitely suggest someone working there."
good,"Mnagannet was great co workers were great my"
good,Great job to have if you're trying to balance going to school and having a social life. Sometimes the hours are flexible and depending if you are in a fast pace store vs a slow pace store the amount of work could vary.
good,"Show up, Prep Food then you take a break then you work on the line and make food until you leave, and normally its busy for 8 hours at  a time."
good,"Working here is almost like doing chores because you are always cleaning. It is efficient to maintain a safe, clean, environment especially because food is involved. Extra caution measures are taken on an hourly basis and specific cleaning rules apply."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I had a lot of fun with my co workers and it was a super fun environment, however my manager was not the best. It was a very high paced work environment and you always had something to do."
good,I simply couldnt work while sick and I tend to get sick A lot. I also just didnt care for the job. The people I worked with were great though. It was very clean and organized which impressed me.
good,fast pace restaurant in manhattan NY. have to be prepared for anything. Great crew members to work with management not so much. Grill was the worst at chipotle .
good,"Chipotle is a fun fast paced enviroment yu get to learn alot about the food industry and alot about food culture.."
good,Working at chipotle was ultimately fun for me but the workers and managers were fairly biased and liked to go along with what the original workers had to say
good,"Chipotle is a good company to work with, especially as a first job, but as a food service job, it is very fast paced and I don't recommend it to people easily affected by stress. Every day is usually the same, and shifts are morning, afternoon/night and short shifts. As a cashier, you will usually come in for a morning shift at 10:30 and leave at 3, and for afternoon/night shifts you will come in at 3 and get off at 10:30. Other positions usually come in earlier and stay later. For morning shifts as cashier you will get one 10 minute break and afternoon/night shifts as cashier you will get one 30 minute break and one 10 minute break."
good,"I believe that where I worked, Chipotle was a popular and accessible fast food place where locals flushed the restaurant 3 times a day.  It was hard to manage as the cashier because during many rush times the staff wasn't enough to handle the load.  But, it gives a lot of room to grow into manager positions if you give it your all."
good,The work it self is not stressful but if the manager is weak it will cause for the whole shift to be slow or stuck. For the most part the culture is very friendly and welcoming but it can be very problematic.
good,It was ok very steresful I wasnt to happy with managment tho I even was managment but higher up managment was not very professsional.. and did not preform their job correctly
good,"I learned a lot from working with chipotle i became a better leader because of it, I was able to lead a shift successfully without any problems, the most enjoyable part of the job was moving up the ranking to become a service manager"
good,As soon as you clock in it is time to start cooking food. Once you have your things on the grill you make sure everything is clean. After everything is clean you have to hustle and wash dishes.
good,started as a fun place to work but I ended up quitting because I moved and didnt want to make the drive for a fast food job. pay was good and i loved the people i worked with at that time
good,"I love Chipotle’s culture but not the management.they will gonna lie to you what you will gonna be a general manager and soon you will get promoted and this never happens.management never appreciate all the hard work you are doing for the restaurant.a lots of hours and always short on people.have to do your job as a manager and to open grill ,making chips and opening fax and cash!!!got my bonus just one time in 2 years...company is great but management is not professional,talking about people behind"
good,"No matter what station you are, you have a series of tasks at work all deployed to a chart breaking down how long each activity takes while working clean, and following high standards all through out the shift. I worked on Grill a lot. If you open grill you have to come in around 7:30, clean your vents, plug in the grill, start cooking two big pots of rice, start cooking tea and then cut enough cilantro for all the rices and salsas that will be made that day. You then have to get everything on the line by at least 10 (both rices, both beans, fajats, 5 different meats and queso) so you can take your break and come back at 10:30 when we open. Sometimes we'll have catering orders as small as 20 people or as big as 150 people. Many times I've had to make enough for the orders while opening or during the middle of a rush when I already struggling to keep the food on the line from running out. The pay is unfair but if you're looking for professional kitchen training and experience, go to chipotle. "
good,"It never gets easier working there. They expect you to perform multiple positions quickly and efficiently. And as you attempt to do the job of 2 people by yourself at minimum wage you'll want to quit. "
good,"this job has great pay, great, job security, great hours, be prepared to put everything on hold for this job. being a GM or  a Apprentice at Chipotle give u time for nothing else. No school, Social life, Relationships. The pay is great . but even on your vacation time u are bothered. Very needy job."
good,"The fast paced environment was very tiring but it gets you through the day quickly and with the help of very cool coworkers, kept the work environment fun."
good,"I had a great management team before they chose to get rid of a hard working manager for someone with a felony to run that place. The culture is very good, I learned a lot about customer service while my old general  manager was still working there. I would recommend this place for people that are still in high school and want to learn a bit more about jobs, the pay isn't great."
good,"Great place to work but, depending on the managment, your work may be complicated. I became a manager, but working with other managers there, especially if they are in a relationship with other managers is dangerous workplace for everyone else. Chipotle lacks communication between employees and management."
good,Working at chipotle was fun yet stressfully at times. I was able to meet some great people throughout my time there as well as get to understand how a fast paced restaurant works and how to manage school and work while being there. Management was great sometime good but as well as demanding for more and didn't give me as much in return. Great part about working there was getting to work in an environment where people actually cared about you and at the same time worked with you. So id say that chipotle was a great experience besides the mishaps with the management.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"quickdays, hard work, dealing with different attitudes, keep a clean enviroment. the hardest part would be dealing with customers, being quick, and watching portion sizes. Otherwise i would recoommend this to others, easy and quick to move up, and good to eat."
good,I have worked here for a few months now but its not what I really want for a part-time job while I'm in college. I do like most of the managers but there are a few that really get under my skin. When I have to work with them my shift becomes a drag.
good,"The upper management there played favorites. I was there for 7 years, and ever since our new Area Manager came to power, I feared my job everyday simply because she didn't like me. It was a kiss-a** kind of situation. I was ultimately terminated over something I had no control over."
good,"As a customer you would see how long the lines were when you would walk in to get a bowl so imagine the work being put in on the other side of the glass- and unfortunately not all customers showed appreciation for our effort to still provide a great experience for them. However, I still enjoyed the job during my time of employment."
good,"During the time I worked at Chipotle, there were many changes within 2 years. Management, coworkers, etc. I enjoyed most of the people that I worked with along the way. However, communication between the managers and the coworkers was a major issue at the location I worked at. I somewhat sensed favoritism from new management as well."
good,Under right management it's awesome needs better training for peopleneeds to be more flexible. Needs more people who wants to make a career out of it . Needs to do better about hiring process
good,"Working at Chipotle was a very stressful job. Being one of the busiest fast-casual restaurants there is, a typical day will keep anyone pretty busy. Almost everything at Chipotle is made from scratch. You are constantly prepping food throughout the day, for either that day or the next day. However much stress there is though, there is a lot to learn from the company. I learned in the 2 years that I have worked there, basic knife skills, communication skills, leadership skills, restaurant operations, proper food safety, time management skills, and relationship building skills. The hardest part of my job though was coming into a shift short staffed, especially working at a very busy store. Business doesn't stop if you're short staffed. Guest experience at Chipotle always has to be first, so there would be times my crew and I would be there 'til 1 am or later finishing up work that we weren't able to get to due to having to focus on our guests. But even through all the stressful shifts, the best part about working at Chipotle was getting to meet all the people I got to meet. Working at such a corporate company, you have the full ability to work at other Chipotles within the area. I've met a lot of great people along the way. In fact, some of the closest people to me I have met through Chipotle. The relationships you build at that company will not only be very important but will be life long relationships. I am also walking away with essential skills that will help me be confident in finding another job."
good,Challenging yet rewarding. Lots of variety as far as different ways to improve your skills. Team of empowered individuals with high standards. Lots of fun.
good,"Very quick paced, due to amount of customers. Very clean area and communication could use a little bit of work. Management is slightly unorganized, especially with schedules. Although, lots of positivity and room for growth in Chipotle."
good,"A day of my life at chipotle was get there 5 mins early clocked in wash hands put gloves on and get to my line at the time I was schedule. "
good,"Chipoyle is a fun place to work ,but when they dont have enough people is a nigtmare. The worst is when they dont have enough people you have to do alot of extra  work and the  managers dont really help much."
good,"Good company, with room for advancement.  If trying to balance school and this job as a manager not really accommodating. Great atmosphere, with friendly staff. Favoritism by upper management"
good,"The hardest part of the job would be the unrealistic time standards for the completion of a mass amount of tasks or prep work. I felt as if my manager's didn't care as much about how I was doing, and more about just working, except one of the service managers."
good,"Every day is different at Chipotle some are good and some are bad. "
good,"very fast paced environment, learned a a lot and had great people friendly co workers. has lots of growth opportunity very stressful at times and helped me a lot build better experiences"
good,"A typical day at Chipotle mexican grill is very fast paced. I learned how to properly run a restaurant and lead through my team. Management was great and there's plenty of opportunity to move up. The hardest part of the job is the high turnover rate, making it hard to properly run shifts. The most enjoyable part is the bond between coworkers."
good,"This is an incredible place to work and you really feel like you are creating a culture not only for your customers but within your crew as well. You will feel empowered and motivated to elevate your skills so that you are able to reach chipotle's high standards. Management, however, is a tight knit group and the only way to be promoted or to move up in this particular restaurant is to talk negatively about your fellow crew members. It is a wonderful restaurant with wonderful crew members. If the hierarchy and immaturity from management was taken out of the equation, it would be an even better place to be employed. The hardest part about the job is making sure you are efficient and executing your duties while upholding chipotle's high standards while getting hounded by management in a very demeaning and inappropriate way. The most enjoyable part was working with fresh ingredients and creating a positive working environment with my fellow crew members. This particular restaurant on Clemson Blvd just received a very high honor of becoming a restaurateur restaurant but i feel that they should re-evaluate their management team and it could be an even better restaurant that is more than deserving of becoming restaurateur."
good,Didn't utilize the staff well enough. Hours were very little. Work load wasn't very much and really the management was bouncing around from location to location.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Since i was mainly available during the mornings, all I really did was fry chips and make guacamole. During the early afternoons I would wash dishes or marinate meat or greet customers."
good,When I started working at Chipotle I absolutely loved it when I first got I hired it was great i was very excited and inspired by the vision I was told i could have 35 to 40 hours a week and that never happened i got 20 to 22 and I have bills to pay so that wasn't the best and then I started being bullied by the girls I worked with needless to say I could not stay at this job
good,"Here it was fast paced. But one of many lessons i learned is sometimes when being quick,you have to be precise too.Everybody there was was positive.The only hard thing about it if you could not do it was keep up because we all had to work with each other in a cycle to stay caught up.Since i could do the job good anyway, one of the most enjoyable things about this job were the beautiful women."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle Mexican Grille included coming in to work on time and preparing food for the line (salsas, meats, stocking condiments, etc.) before opening to serve."
good,Great place to meet new people that you would love to work with. Hardest part would be being able to finish prep in the morning but after that the day is a breeze.
good,"A typical day was a constant rush of people, from open to close there were lines. "
good,"Great business model for fast casual dining.  Good opportunities to advance, great new training programs.  Good food supply for maintaining healthy choices, including no hormones, no antibiotics, and so forth."
good,"In the morning I checked in with my uniform "
good,Very cool job and always something new to learn there with opportunities to advance. Management was horrible and some seemed very spiteful
good,fun workplace. very  fast paced though. Learned a lot. Management was tight and close knit. Co workers were very fun to be around. Lots of complaining though. Hardest part of the job is dealing with rude customers and cleaning. Ennjoyable part is being around cool people.
good,"A typical day at work would be prepping. I would be marinating the steak and chicken, dicing onions, blocking cheese, slicing peppers, and also washing dishes. It is indeed a lot of work but also very therapeutic. I learned how to definitely NOT be lazy and getting alone with people. Also to have patience, because as a prepper you are standing up all day doing many different things. "
good,"The work day usually went by fast because it is always busy there, but management had a hard time with lots of things while i was there.  The managers would have us work and not clock in, and a couple managers would clock in and not care if they were wasting time, they would sit and do there makeup, or talk on the phone."
good,"A typical day at work includes coming in, saying a quick hello to all my co-workers and seeing what my daily task will be. Even though Chipotle is considered to be fast food for some, it is also known to be food with integrity. The hardest part of working at Chipotle would be in my opinion, even though it is still fast-paced, time goes by very slow (for some odd reason). I enjoy working for Chipotle, the food is great, the management is awesome, and we work as a team. I've learned that not all fast-food is greasy, not so healthy food, there are the very few places like Chipotle that serve naturally raised meats, and local produce. "
good,"Very busy and fast pace, every one is full of energy and always moving. I've learned how to communicate effectively with customers and co workers and how to present myself in a work place. Each manager does a great job with running the store and setting examples for employees to follow. Every employee is always full of energy and makes a fun evironment for customers and other employees. The hardest part is having to remain in the same spot for long periods of time. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people from different areas."
good,The management is very motivating but at times certain supervisors can be overbearing and pushy to the point where i was physically injured trying to hurry on demands.
good,Very nice staff and customers. The scheduling was very hectic making it almost impossible to have a life outside of work!
good,"Great hours, availability, and management was always fun and amazing. I just didn't like the chaotic work atmosphere."
good,"I think the company is a great, but I feel as if you’re not appreciated enough for your work. Not only that I also feel that with the standards that Chipotle has as a company, it makes it seem like employees are underpaid"
good,Great place for moving up in the company. Great place for diversity. I love the chance to work as a prep chef. Learning to move fast and stay up beat.
good,"Chipotle is a great first job. It helps you gain a lot of customer service skills, especially as a cashier. Some customers can  be very rude but you learn to cope with it. You meet a lot of great people working there, whether its your coworkers or regular customers. It's definitely a great first job."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,The job is great but I’m looking for something more I can put my passions in so I set out to get a better feel the work force and more opportunities for my ya desire my future
good,I love chipotke because it a very easy job to do in i love the fact you dont have to pay for lunch you get your lunch free there in the fact there very reasonable
good,Good job for someone getting started in the restaurant scene. I learned a lot being on prep and being a dishwasher that would benefit me in the long run
good,"always ready for a customer to walk in, with your gloves on and counter cleaned. I learned a lot about food Saftey and the hardest part about the job was definitely time managment"
good,Valorar mas a los empleado que cada dia se esfuerzan mas
good,"it was okay to work there, everything was fresh made and super clean environment to work. Team members were so nice and helpful for me as a new worker."
good,"The pay was great but the working hours took a toll on my life. Since the restaurant has a high expectation to live up to, the demand to fulfill that expectation is stressful."
good,Great place as long as you don't have a certain type felony. Dont work at the Oxford Ohio location because its literally the busiest in the nation and globally.
good,"Working at chipotle was really fast paced and quick. You have to constantly help customers and update the portions of food and what to cook. Its a lot of social work, so if you are uncomfortable communicating with people its not the perfect job for you."
good,"It is a rough job. Alot of room for advancement but management is messy. GM left for a week and never came back to the store, never answered calls so we were stuck without a gm. Then the apprentice argued with coworkers infront of customers and quit then stormed out. No one knew how to make a schedule afterwards. They scheduled everyone off their availability and everyone got really upset. But the job aspect is not that bad. The worst part is that you get really sweaty and hot. Otherwise, very fast-paced and the customers can be very rude here over you doing your job"
good,"Very chillimg music, friendly environment amongst the crew, fast paced, overall I had a good experience working there. It can get overwhelming during peaks. However, the key to success in the workplace is teamwork. You won’t ever feel alone in terms of getting the hang of things and getting the job done"
good,Great place for students to work but it can be really quick paced and stressful as a grill cook or food prep. The Lines could get long enough to be out the door on a normal day. It’d be best if you took holidays off.
good,Chipotle is great to work for I left due to the fact after the E Coli break out the CEO changed the entire core values and it's mission and it's take on food with integrity and I have a lot of integrity when it comes to food so I took it harder.. I loved the old mission and values that Chipotle was based upon. The quality of the food was amazing and then they changed it and didn't work as well..
good,"You either work on the line, serving the customers, or the cashier or on the grill or in the back washing dishes, prepping food that is going to be used through out the day by the other crew members and helping the person on grill if it gets very busy."
good,"Everyone has there own stations to open or close during the day. Managers are great and get along with the crew very well. Hardest part of the job is being rushed when you are opening, especially when short staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to know the customers that come in everyday and getting to know the crew."
good,"Chipotle is a place where if you go into it expecting an easy job in fast food, you should look elsewhere. Compared to the work you do, your pay should be a lot higher, although work load can vary depending on if your store is busy or not."
good,"Very relaxed environment often filled with people ready to help you. But, also often, a bad manager or lack of caring co-workers make's it VERY difficult and or intolerable. GREAT job if money isn't an issue and you are trying to go to school as well."
good,I would be on grill which is making the food i would have to be on point with everything im doing. also i had to be ahead of time because if i wanted to get home early to go to school next day i would have to start closing early.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,good until you get on the managers bad side. watch for yourself and work hard because thats the pnly thing they care about at the end of the day. hours are cut if youre not good enough.
good,"much love here"
good,"Team oriented work place, grow together, learn together. You feel good about the work being done because it can definitely leave some people feeling good."
good,Chipotle is a great company with fresh food and great products. The work is just very repetitive due to the limited menu and usually if you are assigned to a certain task you are stuck on this task every day. Management picked favorites especially the big bosses.
good,"I learned how to work at fast paced environment. Hardest part of the job was during peak hour. The work culture was really great, nice & friendly people."
good,"With the right people the job can be done and a fun place to work. But a lot is required to get the job done and their requirements are much. You must constantly be running back and forth to get everything done properly. If one person in your crew is lazy, forget it, it'll be a nightmare!"
good,Demanding and fast-paced but definitely recommended for ambitious individuals or business-savy college graduates. Plenty of room for advancement and networking in many areas of the company.
good,This is a very high pace environment. Be prepared to work really hard no matter what position you are holding. Depending on your management its how easy str difficult your experience will be.
good,"I really enjoyed working in the Denver Market. I truly believe that I saw the Restaurateur culture come to life there. Outside of that I had bad experiences. I found that there was a lack of consistency in the market that I moved to, and a lack of trust in the vision."
good,There is many opportunities for advancement if your willing to work hard and stay focused. Working here i was taught anything i was willing to learn. The morrisville location required a need for employees to go above and beyond.
good,It's a great place to work but like they don't really appreciate you data really make you feel like you want to work there you just feel like you're a slave.
good,"i love working there wanted to move up with company, they teach and train and give you all the knowledge that you need to be successful."
good,It is a good company and fun work place.And you can grow with the company. It gets very busy in the holidays and customer love our food.
good,I like working at chipotle it's a very cool Job. The people are nice and so are my coworkers.i just feel like I do better with my life
good,"A typical day as General Manager would include making a weekly schedule, overseeing all operations in the store/outside marketing potential, training employees at a new station, creating a great restaurant experience for all of the customers and staff. I learned a lot working with Chipotle, everything from knife skills and time management, up to running an entire restaurant and a full staff. Running audits once a month on my store and creating food orders based on our usage. The hardest part of the job for me was balancing every part of my job while trying to have one on one conversations with every employee while training every day. The most enjoyable part of my job was my co-workers and how much fun we would have on a daily basis."
good,"a typical day at work would be truck orders, sales projections, profit and loss reviews, keeping the BOH organized and stocked, elevating and validating team members, and also providing food with integrity."
good,"a typical day at chipotle. First you clock in next, you get to work change into your work clothes, grab an apron and if you do not have shoes that have the non slip soles, you have to hunt down sole for shoes so you will not slip in kitchen. The next step is to look on the schedule to check where you will be located. Then you start your shift. You are to be in your position for the entire shift unless the managers change you. Now at chipotle there is a time called ALMA time where every spot on the line is full and it is the busiest time of the day. You are going fast and there is no time for mistakes. You take your lunch sometime in the middle of the shift. PRO FREE LUNCH. Then it's back to your shift. Your job at chipotle is some of everything. You are required to sweep where the customers are eating, clean bathrooms, wash pans which can be up to 500 pans/pots that they use for the day, cashier, make burritos, and roll them."
good,Good experince all around fast paced no relaxation but did not accomedate mental illness well. Hours are Flexible. Managment is understanding mostly and easy to work with.
good,"The job environment was a challenge but it helped build my character for very demanding job."
good,"Really cultured place to work at. Supportive management team, passionate about following through with company vision, ie. (to create a team of top performers who are empowered to promote high standards). Enjoyable place to work but like any other job it has its faults so teamwork is a must! Hardest part of the job is following through with culture. When everyone's not on the same page things tend to fall apart and an enjoyable workday can easily turn into a bad one."
good,"Chipotle was a wonderful experience for me and opportunities  , I was able to grow from the bottom starting as a crew member up to General manager. was my first job in Restaurant business great company to work"
good,"The most enjoyable part of the day was working with customers and working with different types of people"
good,Nice place to work and great crowd. The company has a vision and trying to change the way people look at fast food. It also taste the best with nothing but the best ingredients!
good,I really enjoyed my time at Chipotle. It is a typical fast food restaurant in the sense that you do the same things at the same time every day but it wasn't too bad.
good,"If you work at a busy chipotle, the pay doesn't make up from the crazy needs."
good,Its great staff and managers are such a great help to you. The customers are real kind
good,A lot of happy customers come in. I learned that how you serve the people food the better it taste and No matter how many customers it is make sure you count the money right. The manager helps out a lot when needed. Everyone is happy positive attitudes. The hardest part of the job is you have to stay on top of the game in make sure everything is clean but also stay working. The most enjoyable part is the customers that come in.
good,"Getting hired at a place like Chipotle, I was sooooo excited. As I had become accustomed with the company, I learned of the great pressure that was placed over the employees at the location I worked. We'd just opened the store, and many of us were unexperienced. For many different reasons, ranging from pregnancy to slowness, I began to see alot of employees who were fairly well employees become terminated in unprofessional ways. This was THE worst I had ever seen a company handle this kind of situation. Besides this matter, the company's quick expansions allowed quick turn overs for higher pay."
good,Working for Chipotle initially surrounds you in a very fast paced enviornment. I've learned its main focus is to change the way people eat and think about fast food. I grew to love Chipotle because I worked with individuals who started from the bottom and worked their way up. I am one fond of its management program because I gained appreciation for dedication and hard work. My only challenge was to surround myself around co-workers who weren't as inspired as I was. I appreciated this outcome because I was given the opportunity to elevate everyone around me and lead them through struggles and gained success within the work enviornment. The most enjoyable part of the job was reaching excellence and working for a comany who truly strives to make a difference.
good,I only worked their for avout a month because I found out I had some health problems that made it hard to work. My manager was really nice and understanding when I told him. The only thing I really disliked was how awful the training was I had no idea what I was doing my first day. But I think it was just my specific Chipotle.
good,"Chipotle was fun while it lasted, I can't really speak too much on my working experience at Chipotle; due to the fact that I was only scheduled two days a week."
good,Nice place to work help me build my sense of business. Help me grow more into what I wanted to do .  They paid good money . Being able to do more as a manager
good,It was a good experience for me to learn about and it had me get out my cofront zone and i learned a lot i learn how to move at a very fast pace n move quickly & easy
good,Chipotle is good but management isn’t good and to grow in the company is hard and company only cares for there costumer never their employers that make Chipotle . But chipotle was good before not with this management
good,"Great job experience, the environment varies from fast to slow pace. Customer service skills needed and the ability to work well with others. ........"
good,"Chipotle es una empresa que ofrece muchas oportunidades, capacitaciones y beneficios. Sin embargo existe un abuso laboral para los empleados salariados, es dificil tener un horario estable."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Management very unprofessional"
good,The hardest part about the job was simply trying to get them to follow with my school schedule. Other than that they are a pretty amazing crew and pay good.
good,The management at the Chipotle was horrible. The general manager cared only about her store and the way she was perceived.The other managers were ok it was easy to talk to them. My co workers were always there for me and always made me smile. At one point we all had a talk as a team because things were becoming unprofessional and we just needed to come back together.
good,"I really didnt get into the job culture which had been a sorta high school culture vibe. I really enjoyed it because I had gotten free chipotle every shift, and half off when I wasnt working."
good,I overal liked it but it wasn't for me I like doing things I have a desire to do and working at chipotle wasn't it. Food was always prepared and changed through out the day.
good,"The job is ok as a cashier but as a closing cashier, I feel I have too much responsibility and tasks to complete at the time management would like me to finish. As a pregnant worker, the work I do feels like too much for my body, but overall, the job is ok. You're constantly doing something and never find yourself bored. The pay and benefits are amazing. The culture there is pretty upbeat as well."
good,Typical day of work usually involves assisting customers on the line and it usually is that way until you go on break and then you get right back on line. I usually work 8 hour shifts and it gets tiring but the payday every two weeks makes it worth it.
good,"If you really love cooking, so chipotle is the right place to start, respectful, friendship, communication, and the best part of it is the way they treat their customers everyday single day."
good,Fast-paced job that involves an immense amount of responsibility per crew member. Work experience all depends on management and how closely they follow regulations.
good,"Working at Chipotle was great while it lasted. The one where I worked at wasn't that busy, however, it did get moderately busy at random times. The management at mine was spectacular. They enforced their rules, and they made it a fun and productive workplace. It was tough at times, especially when training because you don't want to mess up, however my co-workers there were extremely supportive and did everything they could to help support me and my ambitions. The pay was okay for a bi-weekly job, but that's the thing. It is biweekly pay and sometimes that's a bit of a turnoff for some. However, you do get free meals! But even that could be tiresome. You could go out and buy what you want though haha. The only thing"
good,Management is good. Team is okay for the most part. You get out very late if you close. You have short breaks in the morning if you open. And you get a lot of very rude customers. There's only two shifts if you're a cashier.
good,Not a bad job very fun. It was the people who could not handle challenges that made it difficult. 2 customers is considered hard and stressful to the employees.
good,They pushed me hard to become a good worker but it I couldn't handle it. There was a lot of cleaning & onion cutting & I cried every time. I haven't ate there ever since my last day
good,"Requires intense work ethic, full time attention to detail, and a positive work environment. I learned to work with a positive attitude, and provide excellent customer service. My co-workers made the job much easier. It was very fun. The hardest part of the job was working at such an intense level nonstop.The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the crew."
good,"Fun, fast, easy, but lacks personal scheduling and RTO compliance. "
good,"When first hired, going to work was joyful for me as it should be. I had great relationships with my coworkers and met some really great customers. Learned a lot about food safety and food handling while working for the company. Unfortunately the store was going a low and we were dealing with finding a fit manager. The store had gone through about 3 managers until one was finally hired. The manager that was hired was a very nice man, But i felt that the vision of the store was not there. No one was excited to work anymore. He lacked the strong, energetic, ambitious personality a manager needs. It become difficult working for a company that i felt didn't care about their direction."
good,Chipotle was an great job where you learn a lot & have fun doing it. You learn to work your best under high pressure in one of the fastest pace environments. Their is never a dull day & always something you can be doing to improve yourself or your team. The only downfall with this company is the ratio of pay per amount of work. Otherwise I would happily still be at this company & am still always welcomed to come back.
good,"It can get very overwhelming on the first few days but it mostly has to do with customers. Hardest part of the job is keeping a smile on your face while servicing rude customers. The most enjoyable part is the paid lunch breaks, and the free food."
good,Fun place to work but stressful. If you are understaffed expect to be overworked. I did like the people who I worked with they made it all worth it. The work culture was great.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Great place for advancement. Management plays a huge role in the environment and feel for working at the store. Crew is the most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"I love working at chipotle on days the customers aren't rude, and my co-workers aren't stressed. Chipotle has really taught me great customer service, and how to be apart of a team. Usually, long lines that can go from 2-4 hours straight and if you're working with no breaks it can be a little hectic. My co-workers made the job so much better but the stress is not worth the pay."
good,It's a good workplace to work at if your thinking of becoming a chef but it is hard. My hands got bumps from cutting so many ingredients. Be prepared for a lot of work because there isn't anything to make life easier.
good,"Fast pace food chain, pay above the minimun wage, have to work fast and learn fast if not they are going to give you less hours, learn the mission vission is a most."
good,"Great first job, very fast paced, the food is good and the co-workers are friendly and exceptional. Would recommend to a friend. The culture and environment is one that you want to be in"
good,"Working at chipotle is actually ok for a fast food resturant. You get in you get out, the managment is more the happy to work with you, and the job is not hard in itself. Its just the customers, some of the worst people you will meet in your life go to chipoltle. Yet i enjoyed being part of a team who all understood the struggle."
good,I would come in and and get right to work it was fun to work there all my co-workers where very nice and fun to work with.
good,"i was the cook so i had all the ppl looking and counting on me to get the job done,i have learned that it was my place to take on big job. make myself gud for leadership."
good,This job pays 9/hr and makes you do a whole bunch of things that has nothing to do with your position. You get discounts and food which is the best part
good,yes everyone have there difference an you may not agree with certain things but one thing for sure Chipotle is life an if so an if i could i would love to be apart of the crew again
good,Chipotle provides a well organized schedule of things to accomplish and at what times they need to be completed by. Also provides great customer interaction and co-workers are always positive and looking for improving their skill and themselves. The management teams gives us feedback as we have sit downs with them allowing us to figure out what we need to better ourselves on. The hardest part of the job is washing dishes and lifting. The most enjoyable aspect at work is having great people understand you and help you through the day.
good,"the line stays busy throughout the day, most often managers will have you stay after your scheduled time, must have open availability to balance"
good,"liked working there, pay was terrible for the amount of work that had to be done. BOH deserves more than FOH. The crew was the best part, everyone is similar so friendships happen fast."
good,Nice people great place to work. Fast pace. Like that you taste everything before putting out. A nice starter job. The end of day is the best time. Clean up everybody do their share.
good,Chipotle helped my life financially. Before the jobs I were working only gave me baby hours and not enough pay plus they provide tuition reimbursement.
good,"overall working for chipotle was a great experience and i learned a lot of different management techniques"
good,Have to learn many stations. Very flexible with work schedules
good,"you get free lunch, break is 30 minutes and can wear anything long as you have on your work shirt and hair pulled back .food is great"
good,"work for company to find out.                                                thanks."
good,I left because of terrible management from my GM. She would talk about co workers she had not seen for 3 months or more including me . not helping us but putting us down
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Chipotle has zero work life balance. They expect this to be the only thing going on in your life at the time. I was going to school full time and listed as a part time employee but worked 40+ hours a week for the nine months I worked there. They were unwilling to let me work less hours in order to do well in school which is part of the reason I left.
good,"Good people , very high pace jon, must be on your feet and moving quickly must be able to work under pressure and have to be very friendly and good communication skills"
good,"Bad management, angry co-workers, too many managers, the main manager isn't around enough, too fast-paced to even keep up with, pretty much slave work because you get yelled at if you do not complete tasks at a pace they are happy with."
good,The store kept switching between managers and general mangers. They were very unorganized. The task was easy and fun to learn new recipes. I'm a customer service person and loved being in the front with the customers
good,It was overall a good experience working here. At times it was tough since i was pregnant and some of it was hard labor having to lift heavy things. I enjoyed the employees i worked with but had to quit to take cars of my Father who was diagnosed with cancer.
good,i believe that chipotle is a great work environment you just really have to be willing to deal with a lot there. a typical day at work means a very busy day at work you have to be prepared for anything that could and would happen
good,it was real slow and not to many customers.But  the working there part was kinda cool.I had a great team & we tried our best to keep the store running.
good,prepping at work is always fun I always had a blast with my crew members we are always chatting because we all work together as a unified team to get the job done.
good,The environment is fast paced and always moving. The work life balance is not good at all. In management you are expected to work 50-60 hours a weeks and the pay does not match it.
good,While my store is not the best location to be at I do know that Chipotle has done amazing things for me. It's given me confidence and just a higher standard for my work. But I didn't receive any of that from my current location. So it really varies on location. Management makes poor choices if poorly trained. Also they don't pay you for all the time that you work they consistently edit your time so that you don't get overtime even if you actually did.
good,"I love working at chipotle, I just don''t like the management they are very disrespectful to non- hispanics workers. The workplace culture is not really diverse it is mostly hispanics and they are rude and talk about you in  spanish."
good,"a typical day I dealt with customers with all type of attitudes, I learned how to deal with it and I learned how to operate a grille"
good,laid back quiet day. very structured i learned how to serve there did multiple positions management was more helpful. co workers showed team work.the hardest part really none maybe the cleaning. just pleasing the customers.
good,Working there was good at first untill they decided to change there veiws on work performance as if i wasn't working to the best of my ability.. good luck to Chipotle!
good,"Work is very stressful, Managers will keep you there all night almost 2 hours past scheduled to “clean”. Pay is state minimum and actual work is time consuming, stressful."
good,"First time I started to work at Chipotle Mexican Grill, I learned key components of customer service, cooking food, prepping and cutting food, and lastly, being a team player."
good,Co workers would always get on me about something when i was just trying to do my job. They were great people to work with in the beginning than i started to dread going to work
good,Working at chipotle wasnt that bad. actually its a fast paste job where u have to move quickly down the line to make sure that every customer is being served with great work. the hardest part for me personally was not getting paid on time. In the work place was kind of neat but more so messy because of how fast we had to work . I enjoyed the most was being on the line seeing the customers come in and ask for me to roll their burrito.
good,"My coworkers were mean, one of the girls there was the sister of the manager and she was especially mean i was not trained properly and would get in trouble because I didn’t know how to do the job properly and i only made like 50$ every two weeks.  I love chipotle but working there was a bad experience"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"This is a fun job, although it can be very stressful. English speaking coworkers are very much left out of the loop, because everyone speaks spanish, and most dont even understand English. Lots of the employees give away free food to their families that stop in and hang out with them for about a half hour even during rush times. This place is really laid back, but sometimes, its too laid back."
good,"working in the location i was working at in chipotle was very disturbing but progressive."
good,"Everything about it was wrong, the work life balance is non existent and the upper management is crumbling.  The company is in a crisis and they are bring in outside hires instead of promoting from within and that is destroying this company's former great people culture."
good,"Aprendi mucho, pero son muy pocas horas de trabajo, hay un buen ambiente laboral, la comida esta rica"
good,"Clock in, get your register put in by management, then do shift requirements. Management was very poor, acted like children. Hardest part of the job was that no matter how much you help you are still not appreciated."
good,The schedule was never done correctly and if you absolutely needed a day off it was very hard to get it even if you asked a month in advance.
good,"Chipotle has amazing food and You get to eat free upon lunch. Workers are great if your restaurant already have a team. Most of the time we were under staffed. I worked hard at work on the daily with lazy managers and lazy team. Not really a stress free enviroment,"
good,"It's fun if you can do slot on your shift,  employees are jolly and polite. I loved it because I learned how to prep, cook and learned the FOH /boh position."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle. There is none! You never know what you'll be doing from day to day. You could be working on the grill, you could be in the back working on prep because the morning shift fell short for the late night crew, you could be working the cash register, you could be on the line working etc. You just have to stay focused and be ready to multitask. Sometimes dealing with pleasant customers, sometimes unpleasant, you just have to remain as professional as possible and understand that you work in the food industry which is a people industry and people wont always be pleasant but that shouldn't change your character."
good,They didn't give enough hours and there was no room for growth fin this  particular company at the time. It  is under new management so I can not speak on the past 2 years or so.
good,"While working at Chipotle, there were many challenges and few advantages. It was mainly a high school like culture, where a select few had secure jobs. The customers varied between awesome and so terrible I wanted to walk out. The work - prep and closing- not worth eight dollars. So much to do in such a short time."
good,A typical day is helping guest and working at a fast pace. I learned how to defuse a bad situation and how to keep my work area clean. You need to be organized and always running everywhere.
good,"Chipotle Mexican Grill is a great company. Their restaurant's serve high quality food everyday with an enjoyable work environment. Repetition is key, as far as doing the same tasks everyday to ensure shifts run smoothly and productively. Staff is relatively friendly and managers have no problem working on you're hours."
good,"Long hours with little pay benefit. Raises come seldom, unless favored by management. No benefits. Hot and crowded most of the time. No extra pay for extra skills learned, so if you're hired on as a line worker, just stay there. No extra pay for prepping or cooking."
good,"A typical day at work was stressful and busy, i learned that you should always treat others with respect and appreciate others of their hard work, management was debatable depending on the person it could change but with a lot of work, the workplace culture was relaxing to a point depending on the people on shift, the hardest part of the job was the hours and cooking because your working on a 400 degree grill from the start of your shift till the end, the most enjoyable part of the job was the customers and making their meals i only did that for a couple months there and once that was over they had me just do grill all the time or dishes in the back i never felt apart of the team due to the lack of appreciation from my managers and boss."
good,This place is a great starter for people who want to get a job after school or on the weekends. If you choose to open your day will mostly consist of prepping sauces and making whatever was needed in the walk in cooler and then you would spend the rest of the morning serving food or charging the food. For evening shifts it will consist of serving food and then following the correct pre-closing procedures and then finally closing
good,Really enjoyed my stay with chipotle. the team was great and worked hard everyday. all in all I would go back as long as the same management isn't still running the store. had  issues with new management. It effected my job unprofessionally to which I choose to leave to further my career elsewhere.
good,"I will say Chipotle has a system to make it run smoothly and I enjoy the people I work with, however, it is making my life more stressful than it should be since I am not being given the hours that I was promised and the main management is poor."
good,"Wouldn't go back to working there. Leaders are somewhat rude depending on which ones. Co workers are irresponsible by calling in a lot, being rude, and not completing their own job/responsibilities."
good,A typical day at Chipotle would be to do prep work or being on the line serving customers. I learned food prep. The management was difficult at times.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,I like my job at Chipotle. I did a lot of new thing as a waitress I never did before. I also enjoyed the food. I did a lot of learning Spanish foods and how there made
good,focused on changing America's food culture and the way people think about and eat fast food. providing great customer services and remain a top performer.
good,management comes from within. upper management not so great. expectations super high. crew is great. enjoy the customers in the lakewood area. hardest part is accepting constant changes.
good,Good place to learn. Management can be selective on promotions. Most positions revolve around food safety and customer service. Nothing Special or particular stands out.
good,Overall i liked working here. It started off great and ended in tragedy. Quick pace and friendly people. You can't beat it. You really get to know people and it was a lot of great times.
good,"Fun environment with great benefits. The job tends to get a little hectic and stressful, but manageable. I still think the pay is not worth the intense labor they make you do."
good,"Fun place to work, really busy and always have to be on track with every task. Very flexible upon request for scheduling or days off. I would recommend to a friend to work here only if they're willing to hard work."
good,A typical day at work was keeping busy and keeping service moving. Everyday we had customers rapped around the buidling craving our food. I learned to keep my patience maintained.
good,"fun community with supportive management."
good,A typical workday was working in the dining room. Which isn't a problem but being there for two weeks straight makes you lose enthusiasm in the job. The general manager where i worked had terrible people skills. She did not communicate with any of her employees at all about anything that was going on.
good,"Chipotle as a company is great. They are innovative, fun, team oriented, and overall have it together. However, the way the restaurant staff is treated compared to corporate staff is surprising. We held our restaurant teams in high esteem because they work incredibly hard. Our corporate staff does as well, however, we are not offered the same advancement opportunities and do not have the fun work environment culture that the restaurants do. There is a huge gap between the office and the restaurants in terms of how employees are treated."
good,good place to work fun energetic just not enough hours the management is good career oppurtunities
good,my typical day was fun and easy going until it get busy. i learned how to greet customers better and how to move at a fast pace also how to prep and keep food safe.
good,"In a typical day of work, a lot of work, spacially at luch time, i learned to deal with different personality and no to take anything personal, it was funa working with people fron diferent cultures and giving the best services to our new and day by day clients."
good,It will be 7 months aug 20th being employed at chipotle thank you so much god bless you indeed!
good,"When I was working at Chipotle out in Fair Lakes I had a fantastic time because the culture there was awesome. When I started working in Ashburn at a new location, I was miserable. The people you work with make working fun or not."
good,The manager all he does is sit on his office not do his job . They talk behind everyone’s back.he offer jobs to people and he doesn’tcall back.  It’s jus all drama aside from that the job is great
good,"Good place to work, people are friendly. Management works with you. Benefits are great doesn't matter if you're full time or part time. Great food handling safety."
good,"My manager at the time was the best manager I have over had. Extremely loyal to the work and to keep others on track in the work environment, it's unfortunate that he was removed to a different location if it were not the cast I would still be there. after he left everything was a disaster."
good,"I've worked for 2 different chipotles  and both vary greatly against each other. The one I used to work at was very organized, management was great and personable, coworkers actually worked as a team- overall pretty great experience. However, the chipotle I'm at now... IT'S A NIGHTMARE!!! The store manager has no time management skill whatsoever,  she's extremely disrespectful to both employees and customers, and she makes you come in when you're sick because she's always understaffing shifts. Coworkers here are pretty alr is ght for the most part, but nothing is every organized and you basically end up having to do other people's jobs because they can't do them themselves. The main thing that keeps me at chipotle are the benefits. And they ARE AMAZING BENEFITS"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotle is a good company to work for, but some of the managers are not qualified to run a restaurant. The hours are flexible and most of the employees are friendly"
good,loved working there when everyone was working together a lot of the staff mostly did what they wanted and talked behind your back. i had fun when i worked there i had a lot of my regular customers and they loved how i already knew there orders
good,It was a great place to work people were friendly and nice at first had great hours and didn't mind it... after about 3 months of working there they had almost 20 people quit thus making everybody else's job alot harder.. managers got really rude and started treating their staff like dirt and walking all over people my hours got really cut back and my paycheck were barely $400 on most checks
good,It was a really good place to work and full of great people. Everything was really easy to learn and catch on with and they offered really good hours. However we were left with no GM for about 2 months. When new management came in everyone began to quit left and right.
good,To me chipotle was like a big family everybody got along easy the work staff was kind the mangers were okay and it was easy to learn things over there we got free food on breaks so it was a cool place to work
good,I eoyed working here but the hours i was recieving was terriable and i was barely getting the pay i wanted. however they're nice people and kind and understanding.
good,I worked at chipotle for a while but this last store was very unorganized. The management and workers were very undermining. There was little to no help.
good,Chipotle was a good first job me. The management was not the best but all employees were every supportive and helpful to each other it was a great environment to work in knowing that my coworkers were all helpful.
good,As a cashier I mostly processed cash and credit card purchases. I did work on the line making burritos and bowls. As a take out specialist I took catering orders over the phone and made sure the catered food was ready for pickup. I made sure that all outgoing food was labeled correctly.
good,"manager wasn't the greatest, strict and too many rules that keep changing and changing made working there very uncomfortable and not enjoyable. loved my coworkers"
good,"Chipotle was great but I'm looking for a change.the company has done alot of good for it's employees but food with integrity is what im after and neither are they. I liked getting to know customers and the days we were ""doing good"" were nice. Salary managers are 100% leadership and 0% labor. I spent more time prepping than managing. I didn't enjoy that I worked hard to move up and still worked like a crew member. I didn't feel supported by my leaders."
good,"Great energy "
good,"They expect a lot from you. That can be good, but at the Chipotle I worked at it was very cut-throat and I constantly felt pressure to work more hours per week than I wanted to."
good,"Depending on what role you take in this job, it will be a lot of work. You have to be willing to learn the section you apply for and at a fast pace. Once these skills are mastered then you may be able to move on to a higher level"
good,"I had my issues, times I had to contact corporate. overall the team I had was helpful. I didn't like the turn over rate, I seen a lot of people come and go."
good,"Overall I liked working for Chipotle, it just became too time consuming for the little pay. There were also several things with upper management that made it nearly impossible to like to come to work. Between the negative work environment as well as the stressful unrealistic job expectations for salary positions, the job became TOO MUCH. This is primarily the reason for the high turnover in most restaurants."
good,"Besides having to work your tail off and doing it quickly, the management wasn't really good with working with the employees. They gave us high work loads and not much time to do so, all the while not giving us over time. Had to give up most of my day working too half shifts just to make up hours, not to mention trying to take days off other employees that wanted a day off."
good,Everything is okay but the pay is not what you can live off and the benefits are only half if that. The people are good but the job is in a small area
good,Things can be better if management was selective about who they hire and making sure to put everyone in the right positions so the shift runs more smoothly
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"It is a pretty easy job, in theory, basic stuff. The managers are very inappropriate, at least at my location. They forced unrealistic expectations on you and mostly cared about making corporate happy, and the customers did not really care about the employees."
good,"The work itself was not bad, and the hours were decent even at minimum wage. However, at the location I worked for, there was a distinct language barrier between certain employees and it was used to make rude comments towards those employees that couldn't understand them or customers for the same reason."
good,"Sometimes stressful, not having help. Very busy everyday always on your feet. Management not understanding over work there workers. but was my first customer service job and learned how not to be so shy."
good,The job was a good one for a high school student. Great advancement opportunities but favoritism was showed when i worked there.Otherwise a decent beginners job
good,"I wish I could say more. The work place was fine. Some attitude problem within the managers. However, they were good people. Just nonunderstanding of medical problems."
good,"The management and team they build is a great environment, you can easily turn this job into a career. I learned a lot of my kitchen skills from this job."
good,it was great at first there was a lot of talk about growth within the company and being treated equal but that was all talk to make you feel good don't get me wrong it was fair but not equal and growth was impossible because they didn't train anybody once you were on a station you were pretty much stuck there
good,I absolutely love working at chipotle! The environment is safe and uplifting. The store I was at kind of lost site of the Chipotle vision but for the most part I would recommend Chipotle to anyone.
good,"prep lots of different things, had to work alone, did get to listen to music, was great working around campus, the workload was really hard, would not suggest this job to another person."
good,Chipotle was a very interesting place to work on is a great first job to have but as in a career  I would not have liked to advance with chipotle him. A lot of the management wanted you to live and breathe in a chipotle. A lot of times they did not want you to  take breaks like lunch breaks and if you had an emergency they would actually get mad at you for not coming in even if you're in the hospital it was crazy but I did have some really awesome times there. I did have one or two managers who were awesome and understanding yeah motivating and firm.  I honestly would not take back the experience that I have experience with chipotle. I did enjoy my time there but I could not be there any longer.
good,"I love working at  chipotle , its was always a great day . people where always nice and respectable . It was always clean and packed !"
good,"I work so hard at this restaraunt, and was promoted twice, but the newer staff wasn't treated right by management. If you didn't work hard, you didn't last here, and in that aspect, there was never enough staff."
good,"Work was usually very busy and fast paced. Management would do a decent job, expect for a few of them. Most enjoyable part of the job was being able to make food for so many people."
good,the standards were great the place was very clean.
good,the standards were great the place was very clean.
good,We were isolated from other locations and could not get the area managger or others from the coorporate office to come and validate or promote our crew members to move into management therefore i couldnt advance
good,I worked at a chipotle close to a convention center so there was always a chance of an unannounced rush. This issue quickly built my stamina on the job and improved my customer service skills by consistently requiring unexpected lengthy shifts and quick service. The people there can become real close during times like those; when you’re bodies are begging for a break but you all   Have to hang in until the end.
good,"I’ve worked at chipotle for 3 months, and I’ve decided it’s finally time to quit  Free food is great, but I’m starting to get sick of it. At my store, we don’t currently have a manager - simply managers from other stores across the state come in and help, while our line is out the door through the parking lot while we’re extremely understaffed.  At this point, every single coworker I was hired with have quit, and I’m sick and tired of training the quitpeople without the pay benefits that come with it  The atmosphere of the coworkers changed from 18-23 all the way to 40’s +, and I just don’t feel like it’s worth it to work here without any social connection to any of my coworkers  I love my job when I’m working with people I enjoy, but if you don’t like your coworkers, this job is not fun"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,I love the company but there are way too many complaints about workers and management. There is no team thete its everyone for themself. You cant work with people if people cant work with you.
good,"I love that they always gave me the schedule I wanted and the job is easy. However, people always kept calling off and that ruined the job atmosphere."
good,"Working here was okay, until i received hour cuts but have been working at this store for over a year and didn't receive an increase in pay but was then trained in another position to be more qualified. I felt under appreciated and undeserved."
good,"taught me how to work in a fast paced environment and serious food handling safety, however management was poor and was never given quarterly pay raised as told I would..."
good,Working at chipotle was a great experience . They work hard to see progress. They want to see everybody have goals and ambition. You take care of your customers and the vibe is family like
good,"Good clean place, job is pretty easy. Work isn’t hard at all. In my experience no room for opportunities, management is childish, and everyone feels like a chief."
good,"It's a high stress environment with a high turn over rate. I've worked here twice now, for a year while I was in high school (had to quit because of school). All though fast paced I considered it to be a fairly easy job."
good,"Cool place to work, everyone pretty much gets along. Lots of minors who don’t really pull there weight in the store so I ended up having to stay late to clean up behind them. I was being paid as crew but working as a manger which I thought was unfair but more hours for me I suppose"
good,"The job is not hard,just busy,some management shouldn't be management,the ones that should be aren't,too many young workers compared to adults,so sometimes you have to either babysit or pull there weight,under paid compared to local other Restraunts and the pay at other locations are more."
good,Great company pre-ecoli outbreak. things have changed the new eco seems to be putting them back on track. Fun place to work however you can never seem to get time away.
good,"While it offered great experience in a busy setting , unfortunately management could’ve offered more solutions to complications within our store. A lot of tension was felt within the managers causing me to search for better career opportunities."
good,"Chipotle is usually always very busy. Although keeping up with customers or internet orders can get stressful, the team strives to always be on point."
good,"Great job to have going into college, especially with the tuition reimbursement. However, difficult to advance and not paid well for amount of work. Management can often change a lot, as well as high turnover rate depending on the location. Can often do more than one job during a shift."
good,It's a great place for high school student. They like to form cliques and leave the rest out. If you didn't fit in then it was difficult to have a good day at work.
good,"Chipotle is wonderful when there’s organized and supportive upper management. However, it’s such a high stress environment that a healthy work/life balance can be hard to achieve when growing with the company. The workplace culture is almost always very fun and focused on teamwork."
good,"flexible hours worked on the cash register which helped develop communication skills as this was my first job, decent pay compared to other fast food restaurants and benefits available as well"
good,I know the idea of the customer is always right but I feel like the staff should have a say as well because we’re the one who have to deal with the BS of the people and we’re the one who has to stay quiet. I did a mistake of cursing but not at them they heard it and I get fired like they should be banned for talking about how the food taste out loud and screaming at the customers coming in.
good,"You have to deal with extremely rude customers, they are not all like that but you should have the patience to put up with things like that. Coworkers are usually fairly close, okay environment."
good,"management was horrible and disorganized. coworkers worked together to make the job less painful, but we kept our heads up. The E-Coli outbreak happened three times in between the time I was working there, so that was gross. Overall it was an OK experience."
good,While working at Chipotle I did learn a lot. I learned how to manage people effectively. The workforce is very diverse there so it helps you learn different personality types and being effective.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Management is all over you and creates a stressful environment when one is not needed. The employees are fun to work with most of the time, but performance decreases when someone is breathing down your neck."
good,Was my first job and not a bad place to work at just not my style. Worked too many hours because I was a full time student and was working late and leaving late.
good,"A typical day at work was quick and productive "
good,"Very sanitary, always busy and crew members hated working there. I didnt. I thought chipotle was great until they began scheduling me 12-7 on weekends 😂"
good,"Depending on the shift, prepping everything from scratch every morning."
good,Overall was a very great place to work where I learned a lot of valuable skills. The store I was at had a lot of issues with management and that ended up making it very difficult on a lot of the crew
good,The crew there at chipotle became my family with so much time spent there. We work hard to maintain the restaurant up to standards of our own. A downside is that the pay isn't worth  all the work we as employees put into the store. we as a group know what the store demands of us and it is worth more than what is offered.
good,A typical day a consist of using the deep fryer to make chips. Chipotle taught me about there idea of customer service. I have nothing but good thing to say about the workplace and my coworkers. Management started off well but slowly declined. The hardest part about the job was waking up at 5:00am.
good,"Its a great place to get growth in graduated management experience from the ground up.  If you are already educated and do that..prepare to work your life away.  You will find that as you grow you grow fast because your are smart, but the people are brought in above you from the outside who get 3months of traning compared to your 5 years of growth within the company"
good,"This review is coming from a die-hard Chipotle fan that thought working in that store would be great because hey I love the food why wouldn't I love working there. In my opinion its a great company and they're awesome to work for if you want to move up with the company but that in its self is a difficult task. If you're just looking for a job while you're in school even though they have Tuition Reimbursement I wouldn't recommend it. For one you have to have been with company for a year and all your monthly reviews have to be good, two after you get the money you need to spend an extra 6 months with the company. Then theres the monthly reviews, its a performance check on who you're doing throughout the store. Cons about it is that in my store its done by one person only and he also does his own review.. so you know you have to be on his good side. For me personally who was only there while looking for employment in my field of study it was not worth it. They ask too much of you for minimum wage, they try to be a restaurant at minimum wage pay."
good,everyday is something else going wrong or not as planned. very high standards and constantly critiquing. the shifts arebt great either its either a early morning or a late night
good,"Chipotle is a great place for someone who is willing to work like a dog in order to advance quickly; however, becoming a manager means working more hours for less money than some of the hourly employees."
good,"It was a very fun environment at first. the staff become family. however, changing in general managers was hard because had to build up a spot that you made for yourself."
good,It can be a fast day or slow but either way u will always be working but what u do can go unnoticed. I you learn to find your own way of doing things to learn quicker.
good,Good company to work for. However can get frustrating because every couple months corporate switches what we she be focusing on in the restaurant to somthing different . Example spending a month on focusing on labor to be told to blow labor to train current crew. Also field leaders tend to be out of touch with how stores really run and operate .
good,"Not a bad place to work but its consist of long hours of working with food and washing dishes with 8-9 hour shifts back to back. Closing is also a pain, there is a lot of work to be done therefore, they may close at 10:00 pm but employees never really leave the building until 12:30 am. Great work environment but the food industry isn't for everyone."
good,"the company is constantly changing for the worst, when i first started they treated the crew better than any company, by letting the crew step up to the plate. currently they lost interest in caring for their employees"
good,"Fast stressful workplace to work. A lot of the expectations were ridiculous, and when the GM was working it was hard to have a good time, poor management skills only made works more stressful. Guess its a good place for a first job to pick up some skills. Oddly the majority of his employees are school girls."
good,"Its not a bad place, the people have fun, they cater in chips and salsa alot of the time and have a special coffee machine. Everyone is super nice."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Typical work day at chipotle is to work in team to get things done quickly. always be prepare for pick up time meaning for lunch time and dinner the busiest hours.
good,"I loved what Chipotle represented.  But, there has been no promotions from the GM position since the company set foot in CT.  Small market optics prevail.  The churn in labor rose to above the district manager level, swapping executive management at least three times in three years."
good,"I learned to money handle as well as working side by side with the manager because i was, without a doubt, a fast worker and great learner. Working at Chipotle did teach me how to think for myself in times where it mattered as well as doing it fast and efficient."
good,Management needs improvement. Their issues radiate across the team and greatly reduced opportunities for advancement. Otherwise a fun place to work with yummy food.
good,"Even when it was busy this was typically a stress free work zone, Co-Workers were great and fun to work around. The management essentially did make the jon sometimes harder than it needed to be and the starting pay and hours were not that great but still a fun place to work."
good,"Work on the line or in the back of house. I gained much food prep, restaurant management and sanitation skills there. The management was not always on top of its job which reflected in the team and restaurant from time to time. The hardest part was getting training and advancement."
good,"I would come in and get my station ready i would refill oils, citrus juice, and i'd get more chicken, steak and whatever is needed for the day. I learned a lot while working at Chipotle I learned to communicate well with co-workers and other. The co-workers where awesome everyone was positive and respectful to one another.The hardest part of the job is cleaning the grease traps. The enjoyable part of the job is making the food."
good,"-Helped Learn New Skills"
good,The hours were long the pay was not enough. But the company was good and so were the bosses.
good,it was nice work inviroment to gain experience they gave me plenty of hours a good starting pay with little bit of expeirence
good,>It was a really busy place everyday. It was my first experience to work in a restaurant and most of the time to help work on the grill.
good,"To be successful in Chipotle, you have to plan out your tasks. If your hands are not always moving or doing something, you will most likely fall behind during peak time. Being able to multi-task, work fast and adapt to different situation is a good trait to have if you want to be successful in the kitchen. To be successful at the line(server) or cashier you have to present yourself well, smile and make sure the food is presentable. If you are willing to work hard and take-up challenges you will move up."
good,Great company to work for and full of integrity. Love the energy and environment. Management at Stanford Shopping Center needs work though. Love the food there. Clean and healthy working environment.
good,Amazing place to be apart of. They have a great work Eithnic  atmosphere great people to be around and room to move up in the company. They take good care of you too
good,It’s a fun job different than any other cooking place I’ve been at. I would recommend anyone to give Chipotle a try as far as bringing yourself out of your normal/shell
good,"Chipotle is a good place to work. but u have too be very fast and sometimes it gets to stressful but people are nice and everyone have fun at work. you will be fine if u can work fast enough,"
good,I like working there just ready for something  new and organized . I transfered from my home store to another one to help them out and its just unorganized  no staff
good,General manager was always in a bad mood. Never happy. Half of the employees weren't nice or friendly. Paid $10/hr but I felt like it wasn't worth the stress.
good,"It wasn't an extremely difficult job and I personally enjoy working in food-related jobs and so it was easy for me. Serving customers was quite easy and the tasks were not difficult. The only downside was having to wash the dishes. They would pile up quickly and you could be standing there for hours just rinsing and scrubbing. It's an easy job if you're starting out and the free meal you get while working is a nice addition to it as well. If you decide to get food while you're not working, you are also able to get 50% off your meal (only at your store's location). Management was quite dreadful, they weren't necessarily mean people but if you wanted to advance to a manager, which pays quite a bit more, then you'd have to do a lot of sucking up. There is favouritism involved and it's quite hard to advance if you're not favoured although you might be qualified."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"If you like working in a fast-paced environment, then it is for you. It can be stressful at some times. Otherwise, it's not that bad. The management was nice and cared about you. Also, the coworkers were kind. You do have to learn a lot during the training."
good,"Management is very poor! Manager have conflicts with employees and aren’t dealt with. Management needs to be work on . Other then that chipotle is a amazing place to work at, but is stressful when the top of the management as no discipline done towards them when In the wrong ."
good,"The job was easy, I am a naturally silly and fun person and try to get the customers to enjoy their time there. The workers were all miserable and were very mean to me because they did not view my behavior as appropriate even though the manager loved me."
good,"Same as most fast food places. Pay was ok for the time, but I was in school and had no bills. That may be different now. Manager took me off the schedule before my two-weeks was up since I was going to college. Could have used that money."
good,"Pays enough but doesn't raise other coworkers wages if someone else gets a higher pay. Sometimes, they purposely don't give me more hours because they didn't want me to get my paid 30 minute break."
good,I worked at 2 different Chipotle restaurants and it was one of y favorite places to work. I loved the customers and the vibe within the workplace and my coworkers was always good and happy.
good,Cooking for the line.  Learned how to cook and clean efficiently.  Management was great.  Hardest part: cooking and cleaning during rush.  Enjoyable part: cooking and serving delicious foods.
good,"My first job. It was really fun with all the people close to your age. However working there i swear my location was like a thing out of  tv. We could have had a reality tv show with our restaurant alone. Maybe some spin offs with the restaurants in our district area. So much drama, so many young people. It was like high school. But the job itself  can get so stressful but putting yourself in this really highschool like environment it becomes easier having these people by your side. They make the job easier. The older crew members usually worked morning shifts and they were all like family or parent figures. Lot of drama but what to expect when you’re working often and going through it all together."
good,The job itself is quick and fast pace the management is great it just isn’t for me. Sometimes they wouldn’t listen if you were sick and other times they would grow attitudes when you were sick for too long
good,"Some days would be slow and get sent home early, some times do double shift 3 days in row, which effect when you got school to do. Everything is pretty common sense"
good,Chipotle has great fresh and delicious food. Working here was a very fun experience the managers and co workers. Working here taught me how to have patience and as well as better my communication skills.
good,"This job was great in the beginning but later down the road it became super stressful and, the management started to become fake and unfair towards the workers."
good,"No work experience required, a great option for a first job teaching work habit and accountablility. If you have a good personality’s you’ll get along well with your coworkers."
good,"At first one of the manager's-who later left- was very rude to me, and some other employees.  Soon after getting there, one of my colleagues who had been only working there for a short period of time left because of her.  On top of this, many of the other employees-even some who were lower level management- were just as rude.  Fortunately, there was a new manager that had just taken over the store. He helped me a lot throughout my time there.  When I had complaints, I took them to him and he solved them as best as he could.  He helped me with a lot of enthusiasm.  When I left, he let me know that he was more than willing to hire me again.  Most of the customers there were great.  Although, some were not the best to deal with. The location of this store was in Folsom, CA in the the Palladio Center."
good,i would say it was fun until the management started to treat workers diffrently and not the same as other workers management would put down if you where to do something wrong insted of explain on how to do it
good,"This is my first job and was really great at first. A typical day at work is pretty good, it can get busy but when you have an excellent team it goes by like a breeze. I've learned many things working at Chipotle considering a lot of it is hands on. The management team is sub par in my opinion, its like they let anyone become a manager. The workplace culture is pretty fun at my location everyone gets along for the most part. The hardest part of the job is how stressful it can become. However the most enjoyable part of the job is the different people you get to meet and work with."
good,Employees got along for the most part; the place is always packed though. Management constantly changed; I loved working with friends and also customers.
good,Well you get to get free food before during or after your shift.As soon as you clock in your rushed to fix your position for your shift so the other person can leave faster because they freak out over labor. Then once thats done you have to work until they decide you get a break.
good,Great management but poor workplace culture. Low salary in a high cost of living area and no job advancement. Great for a teenager but due to the limited growth space I'm looking elsewhere for employment.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"At Chipotle they never let you have some flexibility with choosing your shifts, every week they would unreasonably change your hours. Sometimes you're given 6 hours a week, other times you might have to work 32 hours a week. Having to work on Thanksgiving day with no added perks is lame. I appreciate the job given to me but I think they could definitely reduce the turnover rate dramatically if they just tweaked a few things here."
good,Fast paced working environment that is stress full at times. Managers are friendly. They rotate through employees fairly quickly as people quit about 3 or 4 months after the start. Workers are always on their toes and busy
good,Chipotle offers free employee meals and vacation days. Employees also receive a daily discount on store product. It is a good place to work if you are in college or high school. flexible hours are available.
good,"I mainly left Chipotle due to poor management, my managers seemed to have not liked me and all even though it was my first ever job. The pay is good though, so it would probably be good to work at another store than mine."
good,"Working at chipolt prepares you for working in a busy quick paced envirnment so you learn how to work with other people very quickly, all in all ist was a good learning experience."
good,"Work a fast pace atmosphere with good quality food, preparing foods fresh daily, fun place to work, excellent guests and staff with opportunities to grow"
good,"It became a regular jobs and sometimes the amount of work you didnt just didnt amount to what you were getting paid.  It was great because you go free food, your lunch break is paid but it is only 30 minutes. if you want to go into food and administration this is a great starting point."
good,"There is not much to say besides it was a very fun and productive place to work, if you needed help with something someone will help you and if you had a life situation most of the time they will understand"
good,It had its perks working for chipotle because everyone was friendly and we all enjoyed working there because we were family and it made it fun t work.
good,The positive side was how productive the environment is. There was always something new to learn. The down side is how the General Manager treated our team members and how much pressure I felt.
good,"Chipotle, despite it's recent challenges, is still a good company to work for.  The stress level and expectations have recently rendered it a more demanding company to work for than it's competitors.  I enjoy my job overall and am proud to work for the company, but I do hope a more favorable balance is achieved."
good,"As said above Chipotle was a good place to start and a foundation, however I am a single mom and the hours and flexablity are not suited for parents. Also the professional aspect of the work place does not exist. I do not want to work in a place where I will be taken outside and yelled at if I am not preforming to standards, I would just like to be spoken to."
good,It’s fun and the people that work there are all really nice but there is a lot of favoritism with managers and some people from crew and they’re very unorganized when it comes to requesting time off and availability for crew members.
good,"Pros and Cons, if you aren't prepared to work and keep up, then don't apply. It's a lot of work, with strict health and safety rules in order to maintain the food. It's not for the faint of heart."
good,Working at chipotle was easily the most fun I had. they knew exactly when to be professional and exactly when it was a little relax time where things are not that crazy with a line of customers. Handle complaints and everything else very well.
good,"i enjoyed my time with chipotle, but the only thing is that the pay was very low and there wasnt any benefits for working there. no paid time off either"
good,This is not a job for everyone (depending on the location) it is a high intensity job where you are always busy. there are short breaks but other than that you are always doing something draining.
good,"The company is very demanding. You basically have to work have atleast a day off and then go back to a stressful workday. You wont have an out of work life if you go to school aswell. It also depends on your management team. If they are bad at what they do, you will become bad."
good,"Chipotle is not a place I recommend to work at, Management will throw a promotion in front of your face, you'll give them the time of day, and they will give it to someone else. There is always drama no matter what store you go to. They do not hire based on individuality like they did when I got hired. Managers will complain about crew members to other crew members or complain about other managers to crew members."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Was a fun job some days and on other days it could be really stressful. Also was difficult to do school and the job at the same time  since their scheduling wasn't organized.
good,When you start they value your pay on what your interview is like not based on work ethic and skill. Advancement at least at my location was almost impossible unless the store is in need.
good,Working at Chipotle was stressful because of my circumstances. I can't speak for others but working as a cook was not a good choice because the amount of work you have to do and the fact that cooks get paid the same as cashiers which is not ok since cooks do almost three times the amount of work.
good,"Chipotle is a great working environment where you can meet a diverse crowd of people, along with giving you a boost of confidence and knwoledge, but it can become a little stressful at times if your team is not synchronizng with everyone else when a big line comes.  If you don't communicate and give your best in the job, it can become  overwhelming."
good,Probably the best fast food place you could work at. Management can be really picky about scheduling time off or calling in sick. Always the regular fast food cons
good,It is good to work because also we learn things to apply on other situations but also stressful because there are many things to do and have to be multitasking
good,working for this company was manageable. I did not find the work difficult or challenging. The only thing I did not care for to much was the way the manager ran the store.  The one I worked at in particular.
good,"Come in, wash hands hop on the line. or if the shift is an opening shift then you prep all the sala for the day. There are occasional breaks to get hydrated. once the shift has come to an end the line gets swept and stocked for the incoming employee"
good,"The work at Chipotle was never ending. It was enjoyable at times because the shifts would go by quickly but tiring at other times. The other employees were friendly but sometimes felt ""clique-ish"". Overall I enjoyed working alongside and meeting new people but wouldn't work there again."
good,A typical day at work was a good balance between fast-paced food serving and working together as a team to produce the highest quality food in the most efficient amount of time. The most enjoyable part of the job is working with determined coworkers.
good,"It wasn't all that bad... we had a high volume store which kept us quite busy, but the work environment was cool. My boss wasn't horrible and the food is amazing!"
good,I liked seeing the faces of the customers i checked out at the register. The best part of the job was the repeat customers that knew my name and were excited to see me when they came in.
good,"It was a physically difficult job, but people there were amazing."
good,Work hard and you'll be rewarded. Workers were always great and it's a great environment for someone looking for part time work. Their vision and culture is completely bull. Some of the managers don't understand this is just a part time job for many students and not a career choice. Builds some great cooking skills for a beginning.
good,"This place is a fun place to work at, because of the amazing crew there is! The management team make it a friendly environment to work at and easy to learn the job."
good,"work will start 3 hours before open, with that being said we have 3 hrs to prep all the foods. everything is fresh, I learned how to cook meats as well as make chips. the workplaces were always clean not a crumb on the ground table swipe quickly and efficiently. family-base employers"
good,"Chioptle was a fun place to work, I was able to make a lot of new great people to help me learn for my future and better my self. ill will always recommend to a friend."
good,"Good mission statement, clear purpose and goals lying within the company's ambitions for standardization adhering to the highest quality. Execution of said beliefs could use a little work and the hiring process isn't perfect, sometimes gems come through and people promote within months but there are also those who get hired and become dead weight. Overall, appreciation and morale was high for those of us who performed well. Physically strenuous, somewhat tasking if you aim to have a life outside of work. Management can be pushy with hours, guilting people into working past/before their shifts often. Not a perfect job but better than most considering the lack of qualification. One big con for me was that people were expected to work hours before or after their shifts lest they be threatened with dissention or firing by the management. Crew members were expected to say yes to unreasonable favors like this even though people had appointments and other engagements to keep based on what we assumed were reliable shift schedules. Regardless, some good financial benefits for part-time and easily the best ""burger-flipping"" job out there."
good,A fun and fast pace environment with a workout for a job. The customers always complained about the portion policy of the meat. The pay was a good amount for a part time. There was always hours available to work if wanted to pick up shifts or additional hours.
good,Overally I enjoyed my time working for Chipotle met great people and enjoy the work I did. Management lackef in many ways due to personal issues but overall their a group of great people.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Love working with all people and helping customers enjoy great customer service and delicious Mexican food! Training was fairly informal and quick, so I picked up any skills by experience and help from co-workers. "
good,"Working there was definitely a mixed bag."
good,"I had a blast working here, but they are always severely understaffed. You constantly get called in on your days off. A lot of coworkers also call in sick, so the crew members that could work more than one station, usually ended up working multiple stations in a shift. Everyone is stressed out due to the low staffing, so there's a lot of tension between management and crew. "
good,"Working at Chipotle is very fun, the crew members are great, hard workers, everyone is supportive of you and willing to help. The ranking for management is a little unorganized though. It seems too rushed and a lot of time people are moved into management when they are not ready simply because the company needs the position filled. But everyone in the restaurant pushes you to be a better worker and always learn more and never settle for mediocre work. Overall, it's a good company to work for."
good,"While the literature the company puts out on proper execution makes Chipotle a great place to work, the follow through is as poor as can be. ""Right place, right time"" is all it takes to make it big within the company. Excellent and proper training does not happen. Instead, money is thrown at people to be paid to be fired when the poor execution is noticed by higher ups."
good,"Chipotle offers a great standard of food for its customers and serves high quality and ethical food."
good,"The concept of the Chipotle vision embraces what any work culture should embrace. A team of top-performers inspired to achieve high standards. Unfortunately, management seemed to not embrace that vision as much as others had."
good,I loved working here. The only thing that would upset me at this job was the job culture and no time to interact with the customers
good,"Chipotle haves a great background and love there culture but needs security at some points in time, Also for the amount of work you do wish they can pay you more. but overall its a great business."
good,"Fun place to work for, quick advancement, but you will still have low pay. No overtime ever. Learning to make the food was one of the best parts. very relaxed and comfortable place to be."
good,Typically fun working and interacting with customers whom are mostly regulars. Building and training a strong team of top performers was very rewarding. Some days can be overwhelming  but overall it is part of the daily operation to make sure everything runs smoothly.
good,"Coming to work everyday was an eventful thing: you saw many people and met everyone's demands. The crowd was typically friendly and patient; it's Chipotle, for goodness' sake. The management team was alright; each person had a different standpoint and a different goal for you to attain. Coworkers were the best because these are the people that you were with everyday: learning from them, growing with them, laughing with them, and even crying with few. The hardest part was coming in and doing doubles day after day after day, that got tiring. Overall, I loved this job and loved seeing new people come eat Chipotle."
good,"Working your way up is all about if the team likes you or not, not if you can run the restaurant correctly. The company has a great concept but having younger people running a restaurant many not truly be the best option."
good,"I'd go in clock in look at the deployment hart see what my tasks where and I would just do my task all day until my shift was over."
good,"Incredibly busy work not for those who can't handle stress, will make sure you are taken care of. Training is lacking but they do work with you for a very long amount of time"
good,typical day at work consisted of preparing all food necessary and cleaning stations that needed to be cleaned when i had time to spare. i learn how a fast past line style business is operated and also learned that your their for a job and thats only it
good,"not a bad second job, if ya need the cash. can be trying with all of the call in and and late people. i wouldnt work there again unless i had to. but for some its perfect."
good,"hipotle, Cashier/Charlotte, NC"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,I was in need of more of a career. Family income. They did not start off very high. was hard to make it with the rate of pay.
good,A typical work day is always fast and busy. There is always something to do during the day. Chipotle really does serve fresh food fast.
good,"Chipotle was a fun place to work intill new maagement came in and ruined the store. many people fired and some quit because it wasin't the same. Other than the management things where good, great cusomers and good co- workers."
good,"•	Provided customer service assistance for a fast growing food company with a daily through put of over $10,000."
good,"I was supposed to be working part-time, but I was over-scheduled and working full-time. The environment was fun. I loved the people I worked with but the hours were just not compatible with my current school schedule."
good,"work day isn't that bad just you work your butt off and it gets you nothing. hoping for more hours and it doesn't come. a typical work day for me is driving 35mins to work to only work 4.5 hours, to clock 830 or 930am to make salsas by scratch, prep everything wrap and have label put into the cooler, have station cleaned and ready to open at 1045am. And I work at a high volume store were I can be making over 60 kinds of salsa, sour cream, grating cheese, making vinaigrettes all to be done in less than 2hrs. over all its a good job to get you to work harder and faster for seed and to have fun doing it. but to me for the drive and the hours, I'm looking to better myself."
good,"Long hours"
good,Very challenging and high stress job full of outgoing people.  I learned how to manage a store and work with all types of people under stressful environments. 
good,"working at chiotle was a over all great expereince, theres many culinary like experiences at the work place. recipes to follow ,cutting skills grill work it was a very productie place"
good,"I enjoyed the money I made and the fact that they understood when I needed a schedule change. The challenges of helping rude cranky costumers and constantly prepping vast amount of food somehow began to take a toll on my body. It ached everyday and I was exhausted and I cried at home a few  nights. I did work at a very touristy location though. My favorite tasks were cleaning, refilling ice, or throwing out the garbage. Feel free to take full advantage of the free food you are entitled to."
good,I’m chipotle I fell like there’s a huge amount of diversity and that everyone gets along well. If was a minimum wage page but being there working with good people made the job better!
good,At select Chipotles you come to understand what being in a mostly Hispanic community job is like. When working its always a diverse attitude towards an non hispanic or a different race. Me knowing spanish showed me that no matter how much you are a little hispanic you are not one of them and you have to deal with that.
good,"I worked in line, so basically what i would do was i would clock in, check the fridges to see if they needed to be restocked & if they did then restock them. After that I'd get wash my hands w soap & water then use hand sanitizer afterwards then get in line & start taking orders. For closing i would mop, clean the tortilla thing, wipe the glass, broom etc"
good,"Quick paced work environment, mostly helpful mangers and fun functional crew. Hours were usually consistent. Opportunities to learn different positions."
good,It is a good place to work.  I have been there for a few months with minimal issues.  It is a great place for teens to start their working career out at.
good,It was a beautiful experience while I was there I learned and it definitely helped me mature in the restaurant business. I took it very serious and always gave 100%. This job is more preferable for a student or a person looking for a honest part- time job because there’s job you can make much more and do less work with a lot of benefits.
good,"the specific store i worked in i loved, my coworkers and my managers. we had became like a family. we always got the job done and had built strong relationships with our customers"
good,"Great place to work if love working with people who share the same excitement as you! Everyone was nice and friendly, the company will definitely make you feel at home."
good,"Chipotle is a excellent job for a first job. Teaches you teamwork, leadership and how to work under pressure. In my time there, I met some great people. Had excellent Managers."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,for a second job it want that bad compared to my first although their was a lot of dishes that the morning people did not wash and it made it real  annoying also my manner never didn't always help
good,"Chipotle upholds very high standards in many respects, which can make a good work environment with good workers. However, this job is not for everyone, you will have to actually do work and not just be lazy. If you have free time you aren't doing your job properly, there is always something you can be doing."
good,"A typical chipotle day gets pretty busy, be prepared make a new batch of chips or guacamole because we usually tend to run out of things because customers are in and out. But always serve customers with a smile on your face because we have to make it a great experience for them as well. The hardest part for new hires would be keeping up with our fast pace because customers will get upset if they wait more than a certain time they expect to be in and out of the restaurant. The most enjoyable part is the crew since its small everyone knows everyone and we have little parties to celebrate our hard work the crew will become like a family."
good,Good place to work. Good managers. A lot of stress from how busy it gets but it Is manageable. People are friendly. It can be a fun environment to work in
good,I learned at this job the importance of being fast and efficient. I created great relationships with every customer and that really advanced my own situation. The hardest part of the job was the management team I worked with at the time. Very clean workplace and I did enjoy the compensation/benefits however the management is what made me resign my position.
good,Enjoyed working for this company very diversity clean environment I recommend this job for anyone who is just now starting customer service career great place to start
good,"It’s a pretty good place to start a job. It is a bit fast paced when we get out lunch rushes but as long as you communicate, everything goes smoothly. I did work at 2 different restaurants but I ended up leaving both because one, although amazing, didn’t provide me with enough hours and was a bit far.  The other one, the manager was a bit 2-faced and pretty rude."
good,"It's an okay job. You get free food during shifts. somewhat fast paced during the rushes. keeps you on your toes. you won't always leave when scheduled, give or take 15 minutes."
good,It was ok kind of not to bad i was the km in tar ........... an it was fun i leaned my cookin skills there an i did ny best but they had  bad management
good,Morning prep is easy and fun. The hardest part would be the grill but other than that everything was simple to learn. I liked the fact that we were able to eat the food for free.
good,Basically it will be hard at some point but as long you do your job and don’t let the customer affect you. You be fine just go with positive attitude and everything will come out smooth
good,I liked working in this building. Not only did I have fun but I learned a lot of new skills. I made new friends and I was able to work with old friends. I would recommend this job to anyone
good,"While it was an easy and friendly place to work, there were problems with the general manager in terms of communication. The training received was confusing as there were 5 separate people telling me a new way to run my position everyday, leading to me making several mistakes and taking the price for it. Majority of the managers are understanding and kind to others, but a few may stick out as arrogant. They are easy on you if you make a mistake at first because you are just starting, but that soon goes away quickly as you will be lectured on things you didn't do because you weren't aware of it. Biggest flaw was I was promised to work full-time, but instead got part time. With part timers you don't get a break until after  your shift or if closing you have to come up with a time if your lucky. This means you can be working from 9:45 am till 4-5 pm with NO break what so ever."
good,"At first it seemed way harder than usual to work here, but as time progresses things get much less complicated. All it takes is common sense, more so than anything."
good,"I learned a lot by working at Chipotle. Although it could get stressful at times, there were some good days. The members there, when I worked, really helped me get through the work days."
good,chipotle was a great place to work I learned a lot about the kitchen and the managers were very attentive and on top of their employees great place to learn about food handling
good,Very basic job just alot of following things by the book environment. It can be easy or hard it just depends on you mostly. If youre looking for a start up job or something to fallback on this is a good start.
good,I check my meats rice an mixes if not fully ready for my shift I prep my shift to make sure it goes by smoothly then about 8-9 I start closing it’s like a pre close so it won’t be so hard an 10 o’clock an the hard part is the grill
good,Chipotle is a fast paced friendly place to work with a lot of opportunity but long hours. U have the chance to move up quickly in position and meet new people at the same time. Great environment.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"It is fast-paced. Making quality food on-demand doesn't allow for many shortcuts. You gotta stay on your toes and be alert and present. The heat, pace, and noise can be unpleasant at times, but the efficiency of your team's roles makes it bearable."
good,A typical day at work would include working the line making chips and helping where ever I am needed. Iv learned to work with people I don't always like but to keep it professional. The hardest part about this job is learning portion sizes and how fast paced it is. The most enjoyable is the wonderful customers we have. Once you get to know them seeing them will make everything that much better.
good,"I enjoy working there. also, i get to be faster than i was. It always busy and because of that you get to work hard. But great place to work for part time."
good,"It is very hard and stressful , especially if you work hard others don't really work its lazy and people use to much food and expect you to do everything."
good,"I would recommend,most friends to work therecause it's a friendly and healthy environment.and you have an opportunity to meet and make new friends,the pay is pretty good,plus ,we all got split the tips at the end of the night,but after all that's been said, the job was too far away for me to get to work on time,that's why I had to let it go"
good,It was a very busy work environment where we had to make most of our food from scratch.  We were kept very active throughout our shifts. I learned how to work with others to accomplish a common goal.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with a great crew who made the workdays flow smoothly.
good,"Clock in find out where you are working. Put on hat, get apron and wash hands. Begin your position by either restocking, starting to cook, or begin making burritos, tacos, or bowls. Restocking and making food throughout the shift possibly making more food."
good,"Chipotle was a great place to have as a first job. I learned how to work with people and solve problems respectfully. A typical day at chipotle is setting the line with fresh food, making  fresh batch of chips, and serving plenty of customers with a smile."
good,I had a great time working here fasted pace place. They feed you a free meal once a day help to and from work if you had a problem with getting to work.
good,The reason my experience was so good at chipotle was because the fellow staff made it a really fun and productive enviornment where we all worked effectively and efficiently.
good,"The managers were super nice and treated me and everyone treated me with kindness. Even though I ended up getting sick and having to quit due to a missed shift, I really liked working there and I would go back again. At the end of your shift you can eat for free if you say at the restaurant, but if you go home to eat it, it is 50% off which was awesome. And I totally reccomend the steak burritos bowls with all of the toppings (except the hot sauces unless you like them)"
good,"It is a nice place after I resigned I still come back as a customer, because I enjoy their food, apparently the labor they do doesn't equal the pay, and they need to have a grip on the management, because they slack a lot and leave it to the crew members all the time."
good,Chipotle is a really good place to work if your ok with actually following the standards of how to handle food and deal directly with customers and helps with customers service
good,"Fun place to work, but very stressful and high paced. The pay could be better for all the work involved. It's a lot of work for one person to be responsible for."
good,A typical work day would be fast and extra busy. Like the line will be out the door and some days was worse than others. Ive learned that being organize is the main key of being fast.
good,"All workers were like a little work family, everyone helps everyone. management actually jumps in when busy to make sure the restaurant runs smoothly and that all guest are happy, they don't just seat behind a desk not knowing what's going on in their store."
good,"I learned you can do a lot if you work as a team, chipotle showed me that in a lot ways. It can make you go crazy but i can also shaped you in who you are."
good,"I had a good time over all at Chipotle. I had very fun coworkers. Management was alright but towards the end of my time there is got much better. It changes since there tends to be a new Lead every couple months. "
good,I have made several friends working at Chipotle and it was an excellent place to work but the upper out of store management was easily the worst i have ever had to deal with
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Typical day wasn't hard once I got a hang of things. I learned how to manage time to get all the food out on time. I like my managers, they were always helpful. Hardest part of the job was closing all the time. It was just a little rough getting home after 11 most nights. Most enjoyable part was definitely rising to the challenge of a busy night."
good,"chipotle was a fun place to work, they had a flexible schedule for you to pick from, they offer free food every shift that you work there and a 50% off when you're off the clock. The only reason I left was because I wanted a change of pace and most of the people that made it enjoyable to work there had left for their own reasons."
good,"I loved the fast pace. The work was hard, and the shifts were long. There was not a lot of training because of short staff. Once you get into the fast pace the work becomes easier."
good,"Through this job, I was able to gain experience in the food industry, along with communication and customer service skills. It is a very friendly atmosphere to work in."
good,"At Chipotle , it was a nice experience with pleasant customers and and a calm setting. The employees were decent and we worked together for a bettering goal and striving for perfection for our restaurant to be the best."
good,This is my 3rd job. I would recommend this for someone who needs a part time job. I get no hours and some weeks I only work 1 4 hour shift. If you can find a better job go for it but it is a good start.
good,"The store was always very clean, the food was always wonderful, and the management wasn’t so bad, although there’s always a wishy-washy manager somewhere. Hours were really good considering I was only a minor at the time & they have a policy for that. Definitely recommend it if it’s your first job or if you are going to become a manager."
good,I have loved working at chiptole. All my co-workers were enjoyable and my managers are understanding and cooperative. Just make sure you request a high pay rate because the room for growth is large but takes time.
good,"It was a great company to work at I wloud love you work at Chipotle again , it was fast and comfortable there and the people was nice and great to sever food too"
good,"This was a great place to work. Hours, work/life balance is awesome with this company. When I started out here, crew members were getting payed more than min wage."
good,"Management was pretty okay pushed their workers a bit too hard but still great. Good hours, good pay. Very reasonable when it comes to certain things."
good,"Job was rather intensive when it came to grill management and preparation albeit my store was extremely busy relatively to surrounding chipotles."
good,"Typically, work was very busy and stressful. Once you fell into routine, things became a little easier. Management needed improvement, as they seemed rather cliquey and they took favorites."
good,I learned that the sorounding so make a differemce in the overall costumer experience. For example if the long musoc is too loud the costumer may mean to speak louder which is an uncomfortable position to be in. To make the cpstumer feel welcome simce the moment they step in and to always make their day.
good,Management is the only part about this job that ultimately makes everyone leave. Other then that you learn many skills in a fast paced environment. Your coworkers become family and it creates a very heart worming environment. Its a job that time passes by like nothing which makes it great. I think its a real challenge for anyone deciding to apply.
good,"No two days at Chipotle are the same, you rely heavily on the crew around you so team work and communication is key. The culture is fast paced and customer service heavy. Hardest part is dealing with stress and learning to stay positive. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with, since you rely on them so much you become like a small family."
good,Bad manager the staff is great it’s better to keep to yourself the work is easy but again managers are new and not vary nice quite rude and intitled and vary two faced
good,They are overall flexible with hours. You have to have fast hands and keep up during rush hour. Some workers are friendlier than others of course.  It's pretty fast paced but overall great for a first job.
good,"Working at Chipotle is simple in the way that task/prep is always the same on any given day. What makes Chipotle difficult and challenging is the quantity of work that needs to be done that changes from day to day, and still take care of all the needs of the customers."
good,"this is the best job I've had yet. everyone true to the company recognizes that it's a true team effort and the opportunities for advancement are rarely seen elsewhere. Management program is also great, if you get a good trainer. However, a good boss is necessary for such a hands on working environment, so make sure you vibe with the GM."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I feel like had I not had so much going on, this job would have been perfect. The atmosphere was accepting and wonderful. So anything I personally have against it, is of my own fault."
good,"Typical day consists of prepping items ready for lunch/dinner rushes, clean as you go in a fast paced environment. Many entry positions to learn if interesting in cooking or customer service. Management is very unstable and unorganized on the admin side, for example scheduling comes out late and training is not planned well. Hardest part of the job is miscommunication between the team and management leading to problems. Most enjoyable part of the job is accomplishing the end of a shift without any problems."
good,A typical day was calm and goal oriented. The managers would keep everyone motivated and lend a helping hand if anyone needed it. The most enjoyable part of the job would be lunch break and closing. The day would come to a stop and everyone would help each other complete their closing shift tasks to make sure that everything is done correctly and to leave as quickly as possible
good,"For a ""fast food"" job this one was very nice. The people I worked with were fantastic and we always kept a steady and nice rhythm to get our job done."
good,You will work a lot and get there early in the morning to do hard labor to only the minimum wage. You'll learn how to cook and so forth. Workplace culture is great.
good,My first job and was at a recently opened restaurant. I think about half of the new crew quit before the month finished. Not that bad but the manager did show favoritism. Hours sucked
good,The job is a great place to get started in the work field and allows people to develop skills they will need to succeed in the work field. The job prepares the workers for future career options.
good,The company has very high standards that evolve often at the corporate level and get passed down to every store. Be prepared to work hard all of the time to achieve those standards.
good,"This job was demanding because of the location. It required constant and attentive work throughout the day. The tasks were not difficult, but the customers are demanding"
good,"It's a decent job for a minor just getting into the workforce. The workload can be overbearing at time, but it gives me a really great work ethic. Also taught me how to perform great under pressure and gave me incredible time management skills."
good,"Managers care a lot about train their people and most of all make them feel comfortable while they are working."
good,I think chipotle is a good work environment but also is very stressful and hard to get what is deserved from the managers. I also think people are treated unfairly
good,To work at chipotle you must be able to interact with all types of costumers and work at a quick pace!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
good,"Great team, really helpful co-workers. A lot of room for advancement if you work hard and show up on time. Pay was okay but it could be better for the amount of work that is required of you."
good,"Pretty Good. Not Bad. Can't Complain. You know actually, everything was just about the same. Come into work, put on my shoes, cook some food, manage the line."
good,"The Chipotle I got to work at had very fun people, however, the management area was slightly messy. The wrong people were getting promoted and good kitchen managers were not getting the promotion they deserved. Thus it got pretty messy. Clients can sometimes get extremely frustrated which can make you frustrated in the end. It is a good thing that the majority of Chipotle workers are chill and great to get along with."
good,"I enjoyed my time working at Chipotle. It was easy to get behind serving local food, prepared and cooked fresh daily. The pace of the job was tiring but busy and exciting."
good,"It is a great place to work, with some of the highest standards in the industry. There was just so much change in 5 years, and development halted with the new CEO"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,It is a college job that gives you some money in your pocket. Nothing that was too challenging and moving up meant killing yourself and having no life.
good,"The culture has significantly changed over the course of my time at chipotle. The amount of work and pay did not correlate, but the positive was serving the customers and training new individuals who make it their responsibility to cater and provide quality service. "
good,Nice people and great environment. Good if you like a fast-paced job that speeds up time although sometimes you have to deal with occasional irritating customers. Overall pretty fun!
good,"Typical day when closing is prepare food and line for evening dinner rush. Have Mise en place ready for dinner rush, after dinner rush prepare to close and do pre-close while handling customers. Finally close section by putting away food and/or cleaning station. "
good,"THe enviornment is great. However, my most recent manager wasnt the greatest. Chipotle is a nice place to work when you are surrounded with the correct people."
good,You come in and you get yourself cleaned and ready to work. We clean all the necessary foods and then we begin to prepare them as instructed. Everyone person has to be on time with their part of the job in order for others to fully complete their job. That is what makes the team work aspect so awesome there.
good,"In this business, it was easy for you to advance and have great opportunities and meet great people. It was also an amazing resource for learning about business and business management."
good,"A good first job. room to grow if you want to. they offer a plethora of benefits, including paying for school. you also get discounts on the food so cant complain."
good,"It was a fast pace job since it is a fast food chain slightly strict a bit stressful the employees were fun to be around , everyone was able to get along , we were also trained overtime we needed to learn something new."
good,If you are to work at chipotle you would literally have to have no life besides chipotle. This job requires you to take on task you didn’t think would be apart of the job because it’s simply not in the job description. As a cashier you are to wash toilets and scrub floors that literally has nothing to do with cashiering at all.
good,"Needs better management. Overall a fun place and a very great environment to work in. The benefits are great, but they need to focus more on promoting from within the company rather than outside."
good,"Good Benefits and advancement opportunity.  Culture and management has taken a hit since the health scares.  Largely comes down to your bosses and the area where your store is located.  They do pay relatively well and the benefits are good. If you are a hard worker and handle stress well, this may be a good opportunity for you."
good,Good place to work for and gives u opportunity to work in various areas to get promotionand grow with the company and place stock in and invest in grow
good,"Chipotle can be a very fun place to work given the managers care, and are willing to train you to advance. The values that the company has for healthy non antibiotics given food are great and more companies should follow."
good,It was pretty organized when i had my shifts but the lack of management in the morning caused a lot of stress on the PM shift causing us to leave late or do work of others
good,The environment was very fast paced but the people are young hearted and easy too get along with. They follow the standard to a T and ensure that everyone is being treated fairly too include their customers.
good,"Corporate keeps cutting hours making it impossible to work just one job. The managers do what they can but are made to hire excess staff, keeping the best of them at 25 or less a week. I enjoy the environment, I never feel unappreciated or out of place."
good,i am a crew member at chipotle mexican grill . i love working in here as per the salary i guess we are underpaid because the work load is more as compared to the money we earn as an Inernational student.
good,Great environment to work in. A typical work day varies depending on the needs of the shift. Advancement can be worked on at this company. Communication well.
good,"Very fast pace, some locations are more busier than others. Great discounts for working there if you like Chipotle's food. Management was good, co-workers were mainly college students, respect, cool people. I would recommend people to work here."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Overall had a nice experience at Chiptole. The enployees were nice and the job was simple. The hours were flexible as well. However, I do wish the pay was better for the work and time that I put into the job."
good,Chipotle was a great place to have my first job. It taught me a lot of values and prepared me for the kind of pace for the food industry. Would highly recommend as a first job.
good,Its fun tp be able to see regular customers come in and interact with them. I would say the opening shift was the most fun because there is less stress honestly.
good,I liked working at Chipolte but it was a lot of high school drama. Even some of the managers would partake in talking behind another employers back.It was really disrespectful.
good,"fast paced, management needed work, coworkers were fun to work with always nice no drama, We got a new manager and him and I did not get along so it was hard another reason why I left the store."
good,"It was not a bad experience it taught me sense of urgency and learning how to cook, clean, be organized even with paper work. Taught me to work as a team"
good,Chipotle demands a lot but provides opportunities to advance. There are issues with management as 99% are promoted from within and are better dishwashers than leaders.
good,"Managing staff, taking stock, , scheduling, interviewing new employees, manage caterings, promotions outside of the store, making sure the store was ready for both opening and closing"
good,It was a good place to work. They had fairly paid everyone. Everyone is really nice and helps when you have a question or need help doing something. Overall I would recommend this job to people.
good,Very fast pace and that is not my kind of work but personally but makes the shift go by fast. The schedule is one week in advance so that's not the best if you know you have activities coming up but the crew is amazing to work with. Free food always helps too.
good,It is a good place to work at for a learning experience.  They clean every corner in that building and make everything fresh. I can say it is a good place to start for your first job. If you can handle keeping up in a fast pace environment.
good,I had a fantastic overall experience with Chipotle. I was able to move up the ladder with dedication and hard work and the job always left me for room to grow. I miss it!
good,It was a great environment at Chipotle but they lack hours given due to the fact they had a lot of employees . But I had a great working there and I learned a lot .
good,A typical day is long hours doing the same thing repetitively. The most enjoyable part of the job are the customers. Management is decent compared to other places I've worked.
good,"If this is your first job, you'll learn a lot and have a lot of fun at the same time. many opportunities to grow in the company. can be a lot of work for minimum wage pay, however. Hardest part of the job is the closing shift, but the most enjoyable part of the job are the experiences you'll go through and the people you'll meet."
good,Fast paced place you learn to talk to other people and build a relationship . You get good cooking skills out of it and you learn to be a better bigger person
good,"It was a team effort role, management was okay!  Opening store was a bit difficult but nothing one can't handle.  I was a cashier and line member.  I also washed dishes assisted customers maintained bathrooms and dining area."
good,"For a company that makes good enough money, they paying half of their workers $9 or less and we're the ones getting down and dirty, trying to do our best to keep their business running. It's unfair and i say we should all get equal pay no matter if I work in NYC or York, Pa"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Get ready to be constantly moving when you work at Chipotle. It is really fun to learn all of the different recipes but working on the line can be somewhat stressful during lunch and dinner rush.
good,it was a well oiled machine. They pushed me to exceed the limitations I was used to. The managers were really nice and constructive. I would recommend this job to anyone looking for one.
good,Working at Chipotle is fun and challenging everyday. Customers love the place and share that with you. Chipotle puts focus on its food and people culture.
good,"I was on track for promotion, but then it stalled and I was suddenly transferred. Although I had already proven myself to be a capable and willing performer, I had to begin building my rapport with the new managers all over again, which was very frustrating. All together, I could not find space to express my management talents."
good,It was fun and a great learning experience... Fast paced... Comfortable setting..great food.. Room for advancement.. Not very strenuous... Reasonable pay
good,This place does a great job training their staff properly and ensuring they have the tools they need to perform their job properly. Very consistent product.
good,I enjoyed working there. What I didn’t enjoy was the lack of accommodation with scheduling. I’d request certain days of way in advance and be reassured that I wouldn’t have to work those days just to be mandated to work those days anyways...
good,"they do have a person for each position, and you do the same task day and day out, so the job become easy over time. they do offer free lunch and discounted meals for after work"
good,"Recently employed with Chipolte and enjoy it.  The crew is friendly and fun and we work as a team. The managers work along with the crew and lend a helping hand.  I am learning Chipolte's way of preparing food, setting up the line and help in serving the customers."
good,"A typical day would include prepping food for customers, cooking and communicating with employees to provide fast service to customers as well as keeping a clean work environment."
good,"depending on the location of the store, chipotle can be an extremely fast paced working environment. sometimes there are rude customers but that's at every  fast food restaurant"
good,Like the job store always clean fun fast paced environment Charlotte pike location is cool and laid back. Managers are nice everyone work together to make the job easier.
good,"Met nice people but difficult communication with management especially when seeking time off, lots of turnovers so always training new people which makes it hard for others who have been there awhile"
good,"Everyone helps one another, in order for things to go as well as possible it would be best for all to learn every position. The management and team members made it very easy to learn each position with understanding and kindness."
good,At Chipotle I have learned a lot about customer service. A typical day of work is usually very busy and rowdy. The managers are okay but there is a lot more that they could do but they don't. The hardest part of the job is having to work harder one day just because the big bosses are coming in and everything that should have been done has to all be done in one day. The most enjoyable part of working at Chipotle are the crew members.
good,"When I first began working at Chipotle I started in Culver City, California. The store was well managed and had just become a top tier store within its district. I worked at this location for a couple of months before transferring to another Chipotle in Auburn, Alabama. The store didn't have the same the organization as the prior store but I feel that is due to a younger management team.  Though I worked at two different locations they allowed me to transfer back and forth over summer breaks from school."
good,Manager cut hours at will as if your bills do not need to be paid.  Can't wait to find another job.  Supervisor mood dictates your day at work. Well Indeed should not force people to give review.
good,"you get to meet and talk to a lot of people. normal day included some cooking, being on the line serving. you can be a cashier too who gets to handle a cash register."
good,"It was a good job, you do a lot of work but once you get the hang of it is basically second nature. Lots of good memories from working there. Good benefits, good insurance and decent paid time off."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,I have no complaints I really liked working at Chipotle. The only problem that I had was the management they were very childish and not professional at all which made the job stressful for me that's why I left.
good,"Working at chipotle was a very fun experience, the work was hard and stressful at times, but overall the atmosphere and work ethic of everyone made getting through the day much easier."
good,"Chipotle is a way of life not just a job. In 6 months i have learned from many people and continue to learn and better myself. I would never take this work experience back I feel like its helped me better myself as a person as well as my work ethic"
good,great friendly workplace and enjoyed working there. worked well as a team and got the job done which was great. cleanliness could have been a little better
good,"it was a fast paced work place that always had something to work on, there was a certain way to work that made everyone happy and easy to keep busy while still making sure the customers got exactly what they like"
good,"In my older smaller town it was nice and I met some of my best friends there but moving to Milwaukee is what made me quit. They were so overstaffed and nobody was getting hours. On top of that, I was making the least amount of money out of everyone at that store."
good,"Some chipotles are different than others, some may be awesome and others may be horrible. Get the feel for the company and especially the store too before you give it a shot."
good,"Fun job, love my coworkers, but not enough hours were given."
good,"Overall i liked the job. the manger was very strict, though and inconsiderate. The atmosphere was very relaxed but sometimes business would start to speed up so we would have to move really fast especially with the location being at Easton mall"
good,Very fast paced depending on season and location. Kept this job around since it was very fun to work with more than 5+ people during a shift and everyone getting along with each other.
good,"When I started, we had a great crew and great managers. My GM made restaurateur about three months. He got transferred to another store and we somehow ended up with an outside hire who had been at Chipotle for a month. It all went downhill after that. People who worked under our old manager were fired or were given a hard time until it got to a point where we quit for our sanity. The store is a mess right now but the benefits were nice. Kinda sucks that they screwed us over."
good,"i enjoy working in a fast pace place ,i love food always enjoyed working with food so this was a great place to further gain knife skills and working fast but constant."
good,"Very fast past and competitive. Hiring and training a good staff is the key to a successful restaurant. If you can handle change and hard work, then this is the company for you."
good,I enjoyed the overall atmosphere and appreciated the good work ethic brought by each staff member. I learned the basics of cooking ready-to-eat foods as well as basic cooking techniques.
good,Normally a fun high energy environment until peak hours begin and the stress kicks in. Very busy but time goes by fast. Good benefits but not enough hours.
good,I left because the pay was too low. I worked hard for 5 months and kept getting promised promotion that never came. I hated being paid the same as other workers. I got 4 or 5 things done in an hour and got the same pay as someone who only got 1 thing done.
good,"This job is excellent for part time and full time work alike. They offer benefits to part time employees as well. It is a fun work environment, and they are very accepting of all kinds of people."
good,"Many fast food restaurant employees get undermined by the customers. Due to this there was stress associated with the environment but, If you have a focused crew your experience will be worth while."
good,"Working at chipotle is a good starter job for a high school or college student. Very quick paced and days go by relatively quickly. However, it is very repetitive and one can burn out quickly. Start in the afternoon around three prep your station for peak hours, usually 5-7pm. Have hundreds of customers come in and must prepare food in a timely manner to keep the line stocked with food. Can be stressful with all the running around and calls being made. Once closing time nears, one must clean and start pre-closing whatever one can in order to leave in a timely manner. Pretty often one has to stay past the scheduled time though, because of amount of cleaning that has to be done. Pay is not bad if you're in it for a temporary gig, but doesn't lead to much else."
good,I was given the opportunity to learn and grow there. They teach you in a fast paced environment and a very clean/sanitary company that teaches ethics.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Its a great place but the people are rude and sometimes your coworkers are worse. Theres alot of benefits and Ive had great days there but people will absolutely treat you like dirt and youre expected to take it.
good,"Chipotle taught me valuable lessons about hard work and high standards, and they do provide opportunities for advancement. Managers come and go frequently. When you start, they throw you right in the mix."
good,It was just a job while I was taking some classes. I liked working there at times because it was time consuming. The shifts went by fast. I enjoyed the food there as well at it was made fresh.
good,Over all chipotle is an amazing company to work for. The manager at the time wasn’t diligent and didn’t supply the right type of attitude to lead. It was heartbreaking.
good,I worked in Studio City so there was always something going on. From seeing celebrities every now and then to just great and friendly customers. The people are fun & friendly. Always had a great time working.
good,"its a fast pace place, a lot of job to be completed everyday. there is always something new to learn and always something to be done. you will never find yourself bored"
good,Usually when I went in it was around two or three and I wouldn't get off till seven or eight. Sometimes I would stay later until about ten. I went from line worker to online order specialist.
good,its cool. the people i work with are nice and i love serving customers.  The corportation always provides very detialed accurate numbers.  The place is very clean.
good,Excellent training program and materials. Plenty of room for advancement. Know why and when to go over your bosses head the company likes people who challenge status quo
good,"when i started working there, it was great, but as the years went on it kind of just changed into something that i dont see myself working in. Some of the changes were great but overall i wouldn't want to work here again, but thats just a personal thing. Management is great, i mean theres always ways to improve but theyre doing the best they can."
good,fast paced high pressure work environment. team oriented with a strong focus on health and safety awareness. working grill advanced my ability to multi task and manage flat top grill and stove top grill cooking simultaneously.
good,Each day required restocking of food and supplies. Monitored restaurant for any stations that required cleaning. Cooperative work with fellow coworkers in order to provide the best experience for the customers.
good,"You will get used two lifting heavy things, multi tasking, learning most of the jobs etc. The balance of work and life is almost nonexistent. You're constantly striving to be a top performer."
good,"-Very fast paced job during peak hours"
good,"It was fun working at Chipotle. You stand in line and wait for customers to come in and tell you what they want in their burrito,bowl, or tacos. It was good experience to work with people and social skills."
good,Every day is quick pace and fun. The management team can be fun or stressed out depending on the season. the culture was wonderful at first but the dynamics changed as people left. the hardest part of the job was advancing to the next level of management because the employees advanced the co-workers to the next tier. the most enjoyable part was singing and making food in the mornings
good,I loved the company I truly did. But my specific store wasn’t suited up right. Bad team poor management and etc. people didn’t care and managers either quit or were let go.
good,Chipotle was a great place to learn and grow.  I quickly moved up and learned how to run a full service restaurant.  All the tools were given to me to become successful.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"A typical day at work consisted of a mixture of balancing budgets, servicing customers, and handling all the janitorial and store-front duties.  In my time at Chipotle I learned a lot about customer service and physical labor technique to get things done in a detailed yet fast way.  I also learned a lot about budgeting and planning spreadsheets in particular,  The management was alright, depending on their mood they could be either the most insightful people or they could make you hate yourself.  The hardest part of the job was definitely trying to be fast and thorough while still appeasing the odd requests of customers or management.  Also there was a strong lack of communication between corporate and the actual restaurants which created a large and unnecessary amount of stress."
good,"Depending on my shift, I was either helping prep the food or helping clean off the counters. Rush hour was usually either 11am or 5pm. I learned time management is very important, and how to learn to communicate with kitchen and the ones working besides me."
good,"Chipotle was a hard working, fast paced, friendly job with good benefits and good pay. Management wasn’t the best and things weren’t organized well enough."
good,working at chipotle is was a lot learning by yourself and you had to be the one on top of getting you book full to be able to move up but the mangers do not help you with that.
good,"Friendly people,very fast past during mid date and at night.Management is very nice and very sociable.Learn as much as possible in order to keep up hours."
good,If you can handle the stress then it is perfect for you but during the interview process chipotle managers look for certain characteristics in order to see if you're fit enough to work there. Be very prepared be quick at everything you do.
good,Chipotle taught me a great amount of things. The most important thing was the way we treated our customers. Customer service is a must have when working here. So if you have that then go ahead and apply.
good,"The most enjoyable part was the people. Management could improve as they were sometimes unorganized. Overall, it was a great environment to work in. I'd recommend this job to an individual that values working hard but doesn't mind low pay."
good,It is a good started job but it has its lack of organization . Dont like how one employer gets to do most of the work instead of getting it shared amongst employees.
good,"My time at chipotle was short but I worked with great people and learned a lot. It helped me to grow up and have responsibility, I learned how to make guacamole, which was fun. They were spotless all the time which is perfect because I'm a neat freak! All in all I loved working at chipotle, and I miss it very much."
good,"From 6am you are up on your feet and moving constantly. I wouldn't recommend this job for anyone who like to sit, doesn't do well with constant heat or cleaning rapidly, or do well with mixed personalities."
good,"Alternated between high stress and extremely boring time. Shifts were completely dependent on the managers, no stability between days. Not enough pay for what you had to do."
good,I worked there and they gave me my first job and I learned a lot being there. The got better over the 2 years being there. Management would always change and so would standards so it was always adaptable though
good,"I would come in, set up my rice and beans for the night. Make sure the line is full,  and if its not busy I would go do dishes until line calls were made. If the restaurant was dirty I would clean it. If nothing needed to be done then we would clean the restaurant where ever it would need to be done. Managers for the most part would encourage you to work hard, and would lead from the front."
good,"I enjoyed the teamwork attitude that the store had at first but after 2 years there, the managers have totally given up and don't care anymore. There isn't a goal anymore."
good,Honestly working there is a lot of work but the crew members are like a family and you get free food so that's most definitely a bonus. management has gone a little off the walls recently but its slowly getting better.
good,"Busy work environment, great management, I learned that working with a team gets things done rather than working alone, best part of the day was serving customers with friendly smiles."
good,makes a great first job and gives employees many opportunities to move up in the company as long as they are willing to learn and have the desire to move up. would work here again at the same location.
good,"The turnover rate of general managers was a nightmare, in the two years I worked there I saw about 5 GM's. Crew members are seldom encouraged to move up to a management position."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"The store itself was one that was not an enjoyable work place because of the lack of professionalism that came from the managers. They were not nice, and not positive."
good,My experience here with chipotle was excellent. The people who began working with were very friendly and helped show me the ropes while making it seem more fun than just work all day.
good,the pay is not good for all the things we do. most of the time we work off the clock. you get a raise every 6 months but it is hard to become a manager or move up.
good,Working at chipotle is a very fast-paced job. Be prepared to handle many things at once. The benefit of this job is working with awesome people and you are encouraged to move up positions.
good,"Lots to do and must be done quickly, but always others are there to help you. Great environment to work in and generally positive employees to work with."
good,The job was cool. I won't miss working here. The employees I worked with were cool. Some of them weren't trying to help. I would make many of the mistakes over.
good,Applied and had multiple interviews and they said i've earned the job but waited almost a month and said i had to start the whole transition again. So pretty much a bad experience for me.
good,"Chipotle was great to work at but , it was to much . You were required to be happy all of the time regardless of what your personal life had going on."
good,"I loved this job it was fast paced and enjoyable due to the costumers  Free food during your shift, too"
good,"Great place to work, but the atmosphere is very competitive and can be draining after a few years. Teams have slim staffing, but are very connected and work together well."
good,"Starting in 2012 my main responsibilities were facilitating and reinforcing the 13 characteristics that Chipotle looks for in its new hires. Some of those being: ambition, motivation, politeness, intelligence, presentability, and infectious enthusiasm, to name a few. As I began to master each area of the restaurant, taking personal responsibility for other crew members well being and execution of their tasks as well, led to working up to Kitchen Manager whose responsibilities include things like establishing leadership through good example, ensuring safe and delicious food is served, keeping a particular energy and feel of culture within the restaurant itself, as well as being just as involved with the crew members development as I am my own. You were not allowed to progress unless you trained your replacement for the position you were in which encouraged your personal responsibility to the restaurant itself. I'd say the hardest part of the job was also the most rewarding. Long hours and no excuse for mediocrity were a test of character at times but working as a team each night to facilitate success was very rewarding."
good,"Former Employee that worked there for a couple of months. it was a nice experience, most of the customers already recognized me. I would work there again if I had the opportunity."
good,I woekes there for a few years and it was a good enviroment fast paced food service and really good food. The job was worth it and it its a good place to start
good,This was my first job working with food and it was overall a good experience. I truly thought it was going to be hard but making the food and setting up the store waas actully the easy part.
good,"Chipotle was a nice restaurant to work for, I don't have anything to complain about with them. They paid good for the work you do there, especially if you're a hard worker."
good,"I enjoyed working at chipotle, I feel as if the people that work there with you are easy to mesh with and make a great fit for a team that has to work together in order to run a restaurant"
good,This job had good fellow co workers who were very nice and cool. The managers were nice and flexible but some of them could be rather mean and harsh. Also the shifts are a bit long. However the work itself becomes easy once you get used to it.
good,"This job is a very cool place to work, it is also a very fast paced environment to work in but it is a great experience and a good quality that this job can teach you."
good,"It's great to work as a team, however sometimes the leader are not trusted. Customer service is great as well and the pay rate is not to good as you can see."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"My experience working at Chipotle Mexican Grill from September 2012 to June 2014 was great experience I started off working as a cashier to learning how work the line, Grill one and Grill two. I have increased my customer service skills and thiswas a good job for your my first job. Working with a team that Elevated and Empowered me to do better and to set High Standards for my team and training new employees to become a Top Performer. Doing a year of college after working for Chipotle in June 2014 ,I decided that during that year of college that I no longer want to attend college at the time so they accepted me back at Chipotle after my year of college due to my great work ethics, my customer service experience and the working relationship that I had with my team."
good,I went from getting paid 9 an hour to 13.75 in two years!! was great but very stressful towards the end of my time with chipotle. I learned a lot and loved the team experience
good,everyone worked well as a team. i enjoyed having that job and working everyday and providing the customers with good service. i did all of the job duties of a manager.
good,My experience at Chipotle was great but I feel that some of the managers don't treat the employees with the respect they deserve and one mistake at Chipotle it's like a death sentence.
good,"Never had a problem with Chipotle. They hold you to high standards (""top performers only""), but it makes the experience better for everyone, especially the customers."
good,Preparing and serving food everyday typical work day. I learned how to work with a team. Management is fine for the most part you have more then one. Very bust workplace but still fun to work there believe it or not . Not really a hard part to this job in my opinion. Most enjoyable part is being around a group of people around your age group and seeing your friends and meeting new people.
good,"There were times when it felt things were chaotic and uneasy, but overall the experience was good and I am grateful. The management had a lot of turnover and it felt like it was hard to connect to any of them. The workplace culture is really good, everyone is responsible for their own tasks and everyone has a sense of purpose rather than being everywhere at once."
good,"It was very organized, fast paced, lots of team work and plenty of learning and hands on work. Managers were always super nice and extremely helpful. as well with words of encouragement."
good,"I enjoyed my time at this place, I learned a lot about myself and I also polished myself as a professional. I enjoyed helping my customers, making their day, and working with my fellow co workers."
good,"Chipotle has a very corporate environment, youre constantly told to change procedures to things that take way more time but at the same time pressured into being faster. Everything is about saving labour and saving costs."
good,I learned how to handle customers and how to handle money. They tried their very best to make sure that the customer always left with a smile and the right order. My coworkers loved coming into work and always helped the customers.
good,"This was my second job, but shortly after working there I felt overwhelmed by all of the tasks that you are required to do. I was hired as a cashier, but I had a laundry list of tasks to complete in such a short amount of time before, and in between customers. The time limits expected of you to complete a task are not realistic. You are required to prepare a days worth of food in under 2 hours. Although they give you a free meal on the day of your shift, if you are scheduled to have a break during the early morning prep, you will most likely not get the full 30 minutes you are legally allowed to take. Another issue is that corporate felt that we should open an extra 20 minutes early to accommodate customers, this also took away from our break. This job is a good learning experience, and they do allow you to grow in the company, but they expect too much from one person."
good,"A typical day a work is fast pace everybody was moving at the same  time. i learn a lot from working a chipotle, my coworker made the job fun they made me wanna come to work when i first got there i was very slow on the line my manger pull me to the side and show what i was doing wrong and help show me better love him for that."
good,"Chipotle was a unique experience because it challenged me to learn the vision of the company, establish new knowledge and develop a great customer service."
good,Chipotle was always on top of staff and scheduling so I had no troubles with that like I have in the past. They also take great pride in their customer service and take the time to ensure all staff members are happy and working to their full potential.
good,Chipotle was a learning experience for me. It let me work with multiple types of food and different cooking styles. They also taught me more sanatizing procedures.
good,Never a down or dull moment while working here. Always had busy work or something to do. Workers were nice and always willing to help.
good,A typical day of work consisted of counting money for the drawer at the beginning and also the end of the shift. Chipotle was a great work experience.
good,Overall great place to work. Good team in place and very fast paced work. Always able to stay busy with something and always a welcome for growth and improvement from everybody.
good,"Chipotle, is a very good place to work for. Excellent benefits with room for advancement. Also fresh food which teaches crew members culinary skills."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Chipotle was my first job so when i started working there i did not know what to expect. Working there for a few days i made friends and met really cool people. The pay was great and i learned alot about chipotle.
good,"Learned to communicate better with coworkers, learned to adapt well to new challenges at work, challenge myself everyday at work, learn new skills daily for future jobs."
good,"Started everyday by opening the store and counting the safe, creating a deployment chart, and counting inventory of food. Followed by preforming the duties of prep for the day while ensuring everyone is fulfilling their tasks in a timely manner. Prepared everyone to take their break and open the store on time. Ran the shift and ensured food handling and preparation is up to par. When closing, ran the shift the same way and ensured every crew member finished their station cleaning on time. Closed the office: count the safe, count out the cashiers, set up the deposits, count inventory and close up shop. "
good,"Inventories, customers constant complaints and other issues on a daily basis. Food was easy to maintain due to short list of ingredients.  Staff station training, food production, sanitation practices all good stuff to learn in the food business"
good,Training was excellent and everyone was really easy to get along with. It is a little fast paced at time but after a while you get the hang of it. They train you in anything new they give you too do and don't expect you to just figure it out.
good,People weren't really nice there or the employees always rude they make you do the same position over without swictiching
good,"A Good day with working at chipotle was near my first day , well let me clear and say my 2 nd week. I had already made an important achievment which was rolling a burrito well. In fact a lot of employees take a long time to learn because it seem and look easy but rolling a burrito with all the stuff inside that people eat can be quiet difficult but i handled it very well. Smile with the customers and interact with them in a proffessional way , clock in , work , break, work, clock out. And get ready for a new day"
good,"Everything about Chipotle was enjoyable. From the coworkers to the free lunch, there was't a whole lot to complain about. Sometimes the customers can be a bit unrealistic about their expectations, but that's anywhere in my opinion."
good,The hardest part of this job was being able to be fast and satisfy the customers. I really enjoyed that my co-workers helped me out and made me become better at my job.
good,"The company has good practices and there are plenty of opportunities for training and advancement into management. My location, in particular, had some management and scheduling problems. Because of this, the store had a high turnover. We were constantly understaffed and unrealistic expectations were put on the employees. Since then, the management has changed completely, and I've heard that the store has improved a lot."
good,This job was great but awful at the same time. The team is amazing and so full of different people but the management sucked. They did not talk to each other and make a plan for the team.
good,"This was my first real job and it took a lot of getting use to at first but then i became to love it. I relocated once i had moved from where i was originally working at and it seemed like my opinion on the management was the same even with me being in a different location. i feel as if the workers take a lot of the end of the stick when it comes to who the wrong doings fall on and the managers don't help as much as it seems thay should but overall it is a very cool and friendly place to work, also up to beat and fun."
good,It was a decent job that got me thru the time in order to start looking for something better. I only started working there as a temporary job until I could find something better.
good,Chipotle is a wonderful place to work. Co-workers there will treat you like family as soon as they meet you. It's a great environment but the only downfall was the managers. They're not so good at organization and putting people where they need to be when rush hour comes everything needs to be organized so people aren't running back and forth making their job harder than it has to be
good,I have enjoyed this job very much. And have gotten to close to many of my co-workers but now I just feel like it's time for me to part
good,"The company itself has great ideas and is really team orientated.Your entire staff really becomes your family and everyone really joins together to help each other out and teach each other so everyone is on the same page. I'm sure the work/life balance would be better if the stores weren't short staffed and people actually worked what they were scheduled but that happens anywhere so as the GM, i picked up the extra shifts and some days would work from 7am until 12am. The hiring is tough because the company requires you to hire someone with all "" 13 characteristics"" so out of 200 interviews in one month i only got to hire 2 people. If you do your job right and are devoted to the bettering of the store as a whole you can succeed and get promoted within the company to any level. Every GM i knew, myself included started as crew. "
good,exciting and on a daily basis. I was able to learn a lot about food preparation and food management in the process of working there. Management was friendly but at times unfair. The co workers were wonderful and easy to communicate with. Hardest part of the job were unruly costumers. The most enjoyable part was the being able to learn alongside people who were fun to be around.
good,"Staff is fun and easy to work and get along with"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Learned a lot about teamwork and high standard procedures.How to work accordingly to company rules in a fast paced environment.
good,The thing I love about Chipotle is the cleanliness and the promise they keep to their loyal costumers in providing top quality food. Our manager was always on top of us to do our work and gave us space to have fun. Chipotle is a very fast paced job and it is good to rack up on hours if your schedule allows you too.
good,"A day at Chipotle, we start the day off by having a chip talk. Setting goals for the day and knowing what will be our responsibility for the day.  I've learned that a company can be a great success if they have motivated team players. The hardest part of the day is finishing on time and making sure we are 100% prep for the day. The most fun part of the day is when i go on break and enjoy our lunch."
good,Even though it was seasonaI really appreciated the opportunity that I was offered. And i aboslutelylove the food from there its a great place to work at.
good,"Fun and fast paced workplace. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the regular customers that came in. The most challenging part was when we would have a line to the door, and we had to get it out as fast as we can."
good,If you get the opportunity to work for this company you should work here. While there I enjoyed my job and I have no regrets about working there.
good,"A team of individuals who understand the value and importance of teamwork. Very hard workers. As any restaurant it is very demanding of your time. Must be dedicated to work for Chiptole, very strick compnay."
good,Chipotle is a great place to work. Not your average work environment and not for everyone. Chipotle is about empowering those around you to make them better and giving your crew the liberty they need to performe excellent work. We have very high standards but the energy is always upbeat and fun.
good,I would just check out people as the cashier. i made sure they got all their food and everything was correct. it was good environment with great supporting cast.
good,"My typical day at work consists of checking the inventory and the amount of prep that we have available, so that I can determine if the amount is sufficient for that particular shift. I also manage breaks, deployment, and tasks during each shifts to ensure that everything runs smoothly and efficiently. I also log inventory counts, place food and utensil orders. I ensure that all procedures are followed and proper ownership of the equipment is also being executed daily. "
good,I loved the working at Chipolte Mexican Grill the work atmosphere was great.You worked around a lot of different people that spoke different language. The crowd that ate there where young and energetic. This is a great place to work.
good,"Chipotle was a great experience. such as the fast pace , great people and amazing culture . Be Able to study the history on what went in chipotle was great , tasting all the amazing food was even better. "
good,"I loved working for Chipotle. The people were very nice, and they are very compassionate and care for their workers. It was a very fast paced environment."
good,"I absolutely love working for chipotle. I work with and for amazing people, the culture is unlike any other. I really appreciate their commitment to food with integrity. This is a workplace unlike any other, your coworkers care about your success and happiness. This is a FAST paced place to work and although many people believe they understand how Chipotle works, there is a lot more going on than meets the eye. We are constantly prepping to make everything fresh, and keep up with the high demand."
good,"At Chipotle i can be myself, i was welcomed with open arms and trained properly, i really appreciate the attention the manager gives the employees and the cleanliness of the location"
good,"I would come into the establishment, cut up lemons, limes and any thing else I was required to cut, chop or dice. Then I would have to make chips and bag them for the consumers, I would prep the line and store the the fridges below. I would then serve every customer and tend to their every need. I didn't really learn much from working there because I already knew the required knowledge from previous places I have worked. The management was okay, but they tried to much to become our friends than our bosses. My coworkers were good worked good and efficient. The hardest part of the job was picking up for other team members when they were slacking off."
good,A typical day at work went smoothly but tiring if the crew members knew who was managing for the shift. I learned a lot about communication as it was my first job and I had to deal with a lot of customers at a fast pace. I enjoyed the friendships and all the new knowledge I learned from working there.
good,I have learnt to always hold high standards when it comes to customers or our food quality. I learnt great time management and customer service skills as well as how to prep food. I also was promoted to take out specialist where i handled catering orders and making sure all the food was made on time and up to our standard.
good,"New location, great coworkers, very fast paced, free food, always busy, never a dull moment, great product, customers always appreciated"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,You can never expect each day to be the same. Some days were good and some were worse. I learned time management and how to juggle many task at one time. Management was terrible and there was favoritism in the workplace. You could not move up with skills only with popularity. I enjoyed interacting with customers and fellow crew members but I hated the work conditions.
good,Fun evironment  with ample opportunity for advancement.  Wonderful place to work in if you're looking for another route in the fast food industry.
good,"Th job was difficult, but fun. There wasnt much managment, Always running out of food. The co-workers were the best. hardest part of the job was keeping up with the customers. we was filled all day everyday and it was NONSTOP."
good,"This is a service industry job which includes assisting customers, which is the hardest part of your day. Takes a lot of effort to complete daily tasks, but can be very rewarding when completed."
good,"I worked at Chipotle for 2 years and it was the best 1st job I could ever have. The management was amazing and knew how to have a great time with the crew, but stayed professional. They taught me how to handle with all different types of customers and any type of situation. I loved my first job at Chipotle!"
good,"As a GM there are many responsibilities. Each market varies in leadership skill, style, and availability. It can be difficult to find great hires as well as field leadership who do what they say they will do."
good,"Upon arrival, I would fill out the prep sheet to see what needed to be done for the night. I would then look at the schedule to see who was coming in and assign my co-workers to their stations."
good,A typical day at work for me is to go in at 7:30am to help prep food for service at 11am. Everything at chipotle is made fresh so everything had to meet the proper standards while being prepped. I would also uplift my other crew members and train them in areas they were unfamiliar with.
good,"*Preparing salsa's, chips, along with other ingredients for the front line. Handle customer's orders, dealing with customer food allergies."
good,"I worked the grill, stove top, rice cooker, and fryer to prepare large quantities of chicken, steak, pork, rice, and vegetables for the masses. The worst part of the job was the lack of communication from management and the language barrier with my other coworkers."
good,"A typical work day at chipotle is fun, entertaining and very fast paced. I come in the morning around 7 a.m to help put the truck away, then I start my prep tasks to prepare the store to open."
good,Good team work. Food integrity. Multi-Tasking. Quality product in a fast paced work environment.
good,As a cook at Chipotle I was constantly on my feet and never had a second to slow down unless on break. It made the day go by fast but it was very hard work.
good,"Its was a great place, with great food, and excellent working people, our team had strong points like working great during rush, helping one another out but our weak point was the time and everyone wanting to leave at once. I did love the work place and everyone on my team is was great and they will inform you about their company so well and what they bring to the ""fast food"" game"
good,"I love Chipotle my crew was great the customers were annoyed half the time because of how loud it can get but over all it was a great place. Fast paced restaurant, get people in and out as quickly as possible."
good,"Fast paced, needing to know how to multi-task, the coworkers provide a welcoming place to come and work. the most difficult thing at work is learning how to do many things at once and getting everything done on time. the most enjoyable part about the job is coming to work knowing you are part of something bigger than yourself and enjoying working with the people around you. And knowing your providing a service for people and even if it just food its one small thing that makes people happy."
good,A fast pace fun environment. Chipotle has taught me many culinary skills. I have gained great relationships with my co workers and managers.
good,Was only with this company for a short time I got promoted to kitchen manager I enjoyed working here. I chose to leave due to the conflict with my other job at the time.
good,"prepare and serve food, maintain quality customer service, clean dishes, floor, and whole place"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Right when you got there, you'll get ready before everyone will start doing their jobs. Occasionally there will be a few people to eat or that are willingly to help you to get the job done faster."
good,The staff was great at Chipotle and I loved the set schedule and consistency of pay.
good,"Ive Learned Such About Food Safety, Working And Empowering Others, And Chef Skills"
good,"Very easy to manage, as many processes were done for you from the corporate office."
good,Overall good place to work at. Great place to get a lot of food service experience.
good,"Chipotle is a great place to work. You can learn a lot about how to maintain/prepare excellent food and improve your costumer service skills. With a lot of hard work, you can move up to a manager position in a short amount of time."
good,The food smelled great from the beginning of the day to end of the day. I learned a good deal about different mixtures of spices and how to add flavor to the food dishes that were being prepared. The management was fun to work with and informative. Great staff to work along side with. The most enjoyable part of this job was the look and smell of a perfectly prepared dish.
good,"On a typical work day were usual packed handling hundreds of customers. Ive learned how to manage people and calm escalating situations , as well as balance many tasks at work. I have intimate relationships with most my coworkers and enjoy their presence. The hardest part of my job is accepting not everyone is going to enjoy their experience as hard as i try. The most enjoyable part of my job is attempting to make them enjoy it anyhow."
good,Chipotle is a very busy and fun enviornment. A typical day at work is non stop hard work and learning something new everyday. The management and co workers are good. The hardest part of the job is really keeping up with our busy rush of customers. The most enjoyable part of working at chipotle is learning new things and having a fun time with my crew members.
good,"-great co-workers, fun and friendly"
good,"The company as a whole is great. Their concept of ""Food with integrity"" is unmatched by even non-fast food restaurants, which gives you a good feeling as an employee when you serve a customer the food. The business model seems to be set up for motivated individuals to succeed. However, based on my experience in the one store that I worked in, the management was lacking. They were all very young and inexperienced and took criticism very personally. They were quick to make emotional decisions and throw fellow employees under the bus."
good,"Everyday there was something new to see being that the job was located in downtown Kansas City, Mo. there was never a dull moment."
good,I washed dishes and made food while interacting with customers.
good,"Great place to be and learn the ins and outs of the restaurant industry. The company is promote from within so upper management has always been in your shoes. If your a student, schedule can be demanding so be aware of your time needs."
good,"enjoyed working for them and if i could work for them again i would jump on it , also great food."
good,"A typical day is full of an almost perfect combination of fun to work, and of seriousness when it comes down to business."
good,"Chipotle is a very fast paced, fun working environment. Time management is very crucial and important when completing tasks and for serving customers. Working at Chipotle has helped to improve my customer service skills, overall kitchen skills, and team member skills. The management at Chipotle was great, and it was a pleasure to work for the company."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Great place to work."
good,"Working at Chipotle had its ups and downs (like every job). Being a very popular restaurant, sometimes it felt like the dinner rush would NEVER end. But if you're with the right team, with the right chemistry, work days would fly by. "
good,"The job is well known as one of the best fast food restaurants in U.S. because of their famous guacamole. The environment is really fast pace and everything is cooked fresh. Chipotle always talked about how food integrity is important and should be carry out and all our food. The restaurants constantly keep the place looking brand new but for management where I was working failed. They tried to hard to be ghetto and had bad customer service. With bad customer service came angry customers with attitude so everything obviously went down hill. Not only that the pay was decent but the hours sucked, it was like the favorite certain people. Which it shouldn't be like that but other than that do I recommend anybody to work here...hell no its to much nonsense to deal with and its not worth it."
good,"Getting to make people smile and feel better about the choices they make daily is the most accomplished feeling. Learning to work with people and get along as a team is the most challenging. Although, having a certain degree of patience is the hardest part of the job, it is also the most rewarding and enjoyable part."
good,"I love cooking and serving others. Most importantly I'm learning to do it at a high demanding pace such as Chipotle, one of the fastest growing businesses in America. The food is great and so is the atmosphere."
good,"During my time I had the opportunity to explore a number of positions within the restaurant . I was a front of the house server, a cashier, a prep cook, grill, and back of the house cleaner. I worked both opening shifts and closing shifts. Our main goal was to ensure customers were provided with the freshest foods in the lest  amount of time with the best customer service. The best thing i learned with the company is that team work and dedication is the most essential thing in the work place. If you care about your people your people will care about the culture. I worked with some of amazing people who wee eager to learn, but unfortunately management didn't care about its people. Overall it was a great growing experience."
good,Overall great working experience and good sense of urgency
good,"Prepared food while keep work area clean and sanitized."
good,"Learned a lot about working as a team and productivity. A typical day of work consisted of cleaning floors, walls, and dishes as well as prep food and ingredients for restaurant out puts."
good,a lot too learn and fun if you like to work around food. also good place to start off your work life . plus new things to learn and figure out.
good,"chipotle customer and employee have to completely different views on the company. being both the food and service is a con when you cant eat it and deal with grouchy customers, I must say regulars make it so comfortable easy. the environment is usually upbeat and constant but gets a little stressful when there's a lack of prepared food dishware and communication. definitely overworked but no solid complaints. I enjoyed my times there thanks to some lovely co workers and customers."
good,"Employees are great, Food is delicious, Worked in the front line serving and interacting with customers on a daily basis."
good,nice job great work environment but i had to quit because of discrimination
good,Training needs restructuring for new employees and management. Great company but needs to focus more on training
good,Worked there for five months. Loved it at first but then they started cutting my hours and only working for 3 in an half hours some days. It sucked.
good,"Fast passes, great people to work with always learning new things."
good,"Take customer orders , serve food , worked in a team. Clean off tables , sweep floors."
good,fun place to work but compensation isnt enough for expected amount of work
good,"Company believes in promoting from within. Great hours. Very fast paced, having a line to the door is something you'll see often."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"My time at chipotle was overall a good experience. I learned essential grill and knife skills as well as managerial skills during my time there. Word was extremely fast paced and at times very stressful and hectic. We were short staffed a lot and it took its toll on the workers. The team environment was the best part of the job. We were more than coworkers, we were a family and were very close even outside of work. Shifts with your friends made the day go by easier and they helped to keep you calm when chaos ensued. Management was ok, some managers were great, others were horrible, unfair, disrespectful, condescending and showed favoritism to some of their friends. Promotions were both merit based and need based. Some were given opportunities for advancement based on friendships despite an overall inadequacy for the position. A typical day at work entailed serving guests food on the line, cashiering duties, cleaning tasks, food prep, grilling meats, preparing cold and hot foods and administrative duties for the more experienced employees."
good,"Very Fast pace"
good,"Excellent place to work-I learn how to prep different things daily such as how to prep and make a variety of sauces.My mgmt. team is awesome they make sure things are going in the right direction on daily basis.Crew members are very friendly, they look out for each other,every one gets along with oneanother.the hardest part of the job is making sure we don't run out of food, it's a timming decision when cooking.The most enjoyable part of the job is working the grill because customers can see they're getting fresh steak and chicken of the grill."
good,"I loved working for them. I opened just about every morning. They are somewhat flexible with your outside life. They don't take some things into consideration for example, running out of food used to prep. They still expect the same results. Management is quite young so they are quick to lose their temper."
good,"a typical day is very fast paced and there are several managers on duty who yell at you for different reasons. "
good,Daily duties included cash handling and clean up and costumer care.
good,"Every shift is very fast paced. The hardest part of the job is making sure you time manage well, right off the bat. The most enjoyable part would be my coworkers and the customers, everyone has turned out to be really nice and pleasant to work with. We have multiple managers and they are all very efficient and good at their job. "
good,"This job was a very exciting work experience. The job itself was very fast paced and multitasking. The managers didn't always act like management, but overall it is a great work environment.   "
good,"Great place to work for quick money in college, great place to eat. Food prep, learning to cook, all fun. Managers take an active interest in your personal and professional growth in the company. "
good,i worked here for a couple of months it was really fun and nice knowing the management where koo if i had i would work here again love making people happy
good,Working with Chipotle was an interesting experience in itself. The culture behind the food and the overall change in the normal fast food industry that Chipotle started was the reasons I still love eating here.
good,"The most fast paced hectic work place i have ever worked at. The line doesnt stop some days. Customers can be very rude and inconsiderate. Managers only care about promoting from within the restaurant, regardless if the candidate is ready for management or not. Simply due to the fact that when a manager promotes someone they get more $$$$. They do not care about your life outside of work. They expect you to work your scheduled hours regardless of whats going on in your personal life. And they are famous for shoving their ""chipotle culture"" down your throat."
good,"I worked there as a KMIT and it was fun at times but like any other job, it was stressful. yes it was fun because u  work with a lot of people but it wand customers.  many managers are very demanding and it can be on your case for little things like the chips, etc. just saying, its can be fun but stressful too."
good,A typical day at chipotle would be once you came into work we would say hi to everyone. i learn that working here they had  a different view of good healthy fast food. Management was good they toke very good care of us and their customers.  
good,Overall my experience working at Chipotle was fair to okay. Good place to work but bad management and communication.
good,"constant business"
good,as an entry level job into the culinary field its a great starting job great company
good,"Energetic fast pace job. Responsible for providing customers with excellent food quality and professional service.Coordinate food preparation in order to meet customer needs.Provide exceptional front-line customer service.	Communicate effectively with support crew and management.Provide training and mentoring to new staff members. Good Co workers. Easy job."
good,"Id say the most enjoyable part was the customers and the people i worked with, it was very balanced with communication at all times"
good,i feel most of the jobs were great all depends on the people you work with and manager
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"nice friendly place to work and all of your co-workers are friendly, and you learn a lot about food prep. learn to cut foods with chef knives, and interact with customers daily."
good,Provided excellent customer service to all customers
good,open up the store and get ready for my co-workers to come in and get the day startred. I learned about leadership and how to work with others. The hardest part of the job is seeing the people you have worked with go on to move to another level within the company. the meet enjoyable job is that you meet different people all the time. so it's a really fun job.
good,"I enjoyed the company. If you work hard, you will see results."
good,i really liked this job my co-workers were awsome and i loved talking to all the costomers everyday.
good,You have lots to do here this is not like Mickey D's you will work non stop from the moment you clock in to the moment you leave. It gets stressful at times and very very busy always. I learned to prepare some salsas and i learned to cook chips. The management is great BUT could be better. Co-workers are excellent to work with a lot of helpful workers. Hardest part of this job is that you have to be very quick and fast learner you have to keep up with everyone else if not you will be screwed. To work in Chipotle you have to enjoy working in this place you have to love this job with your heart and soul if not they will fire you. You have to be passionate in this job.
good,"Chipotle es un restaurante de comida mexicana pequeño pero con un manejo de clientes constante, aprendí a trabajar directamente con el cliente manejar sus opiniones, criticas e indicaciones."
good,"I've worked at my store location for about 4 months now. In that time, I was converted from a clueless prep person with no kitchen skills to speak of into someone who knows the kitchen on the back of their hand. Even though the hours are hard, the work is rewarding, and my store is full of incredible coworkers. On the downside, my managers refuse to accommodate my college school schedule, and nearly led to my departure from the store. BEWARE. You will get your tush kicked in this job. It is harder than any restaurant job I've ever worked in. If you are on grill, prepare to multitask like a crazed chicken with its head cut off."
good,Fun and Fast paste work place. Very busy but manageable. Learned how to make and prep the foods that they served. Co-workers have fun on the job as required to keep a smile on the faces.
good,"Each day at Chipotle Mexican Grill before opening the restuarant, the team and I prepared and freshly made all the meats, salsas and anything else. I was in charge of the dining area making sure that it was clean, organized and stocked. I would put out the tables and chairs. I was cashier and memoried every item we had on the menu. Before we open, I counted my register and made sure there was enough change for the day. I was in charge of answering the phones, greeting customers and assisting customer needs. I worked with my managers to see in what we could improve and make sure all customers left happy. I really enjoy working as a team and providing a great customer experience"
good,If your looking for great tasting healthy food and great hospitality in fast food Chipotle is your spot.
good,arrive at 7-7:30am begin to open grill by lighting pilots turn on deepfryer make morning bank deposit and take stock and make sure that proper order was recieved or placed. then begin on grill duties which including morning prep like slicing cilantro to preparing food to be cooked all to be completed before open. then work grill during the am shift preparing fresh food every 5-15 minutes from cooking chicken rice black beans steak ect.
good,"Everyone is fairly kind to one another, managers are great! They treat everybody like family, work can be stressful at times but everyone does there part to make each day enjoyable."
good,A lot of work and gotta keep your head calm you could become a manager if you focus in your job and do a great job in your station be reliable.its  a good experience
good,Fast paced. Culture is fine as long as people do thier job. Expect to have your schedule changed. Hours are steady if you have good work ethic and attendance
good,"At the Chipotle I had worked at, my co-workers were very nice and there were never really problems between the employees. Very good communication between everyone."
good,I like working with the customers. I know most of them by name because they are local. The crew on the other hand is immature. The managers higher their friends and put them in higher position no matter if they are good or not.
good,"The best part of this job was working around people that you enjoyed being with. They made time go by fast and enjoyed it. Although this job was very busy, I still loved it."
good,This was my first job that I had ever been at. It’s a good place and has a nice environment. The staff was nice and were helpful when I was confused at first.
good,"This was my first job. It was great, exciting, and fun when I didn’t have responsibilities but I wouldn’t recommend this for someone with greater needs than a teenager. My management was great but they will over work you if you’re too nice. There are growth opportunities but they don’t make it easy to get them"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I’ve worked at Chipotle for a little over a year now and despite the above minimum wage salary, benefits, and quarterly bonuses.. it’s not really worth it at times. Chipotle is one of the few company I have worked at and 100% not been deterred by the cleanliness or preventative measures to keep food safe for preparation and consumption. But the harsh hours and strict rules applied to employees is at times physically and mentally draining, for example I had hip surgery back in August 2019 and despite having a doctors note during peak times I am still not allowed to leave my position to sit down, peak being roughly 2 hours long."
good,If you have a good crew the job is fun and stress free. Very customer friendly and cautious with allergies and cross contamination. Also has room for advancement.
good,"Must be quick and efficient in handling all tasks while keeping in mind of how much time we take to complete a task and keeping the area clean afterwards. Can be stressful at times, but most of the time a simple yet time consuming day."
good,"From the start of your shift up until to the end of your shift, you are consistently on the move. A few difficult parts of the job would be dealing with customers who believe they're right and try to call you out on food portioning, and when the shift runs low on employees due to under staffing or call offs, the shift tends to get more hectic."
good,The employees at Chipotle helped me learn what I needed to become an ace at any position. They were very patient and answered any questions I had. Overall I have had a great time working there.
good,"Working at chipotle gave me a lot of useful skills in the food industry such as knife experience, prepping cooking food and food industry management. However, some of the management was not the best and the tasks did become stale after a while."
good,The workplace was fun and my coworkers were laid back but the closing tasks were strenuous for the amount of money I was getting paid. Sometimes they would make you work a position that you didn't apply for (aka dishwashing)
good,If your area manager doesn’t like you you will be stuck forever. They must sign off on any promotion. So you must play every side of the field at all times to succeed.
good,"Chipotle is very fast paced, you have to be willing to listen to customers orders and stay attentive to their expressions so that they are satisfied with their orders. You also have to make sure you call out from food ahead of time or you will slow down the entire line. Pay for crew members is alright for a fast food restaurant, although I do believe it should be higher for the intensity of the job. Management depends on which restaurant you work at; at my locations management shifted dramatically towards the end, which caused many of my coworkers and I to leave. Also, make sure to wear long sleeve under your uniform if you work on chips, you might get your arms burned with splashing oil, but protecting your arms from scars is worth it despite the heat you'll feel."
good,The The Tipsy good the food was delicious the hours was not good the pay was alright everything else was good to drive back and forth to Rockwall was not good
good,"A typical day at the restaurant was very fast-paced with lots of work to be done. During my workday, I would be in charge of all sanitary precautions and food prep. I learned how to work well under pressure as the store got very busy on the daily. The hardest part of the job was doing line work as it was constantly fast pace but worked out in the end as it helped me improve my multitasking. I enjoyed working with my co-workers the most as they were very hard works and showed up to work with a positive attitude daily."
good,My time at chipotle consisted of a very difficult time doing a moderately difficult job. The managers would consistently do what’s easy over what’s right and admittedly I did the same. Crew members as well as managers did not always take the job as seriously as I would have liked but most of the time when they did it was a very well oiled machine and I felt as though we could’ve done anything with the team we were given.
good,"I love the people and atmosphere but the General managers tend to do what they want and will lie to you about certain policies and rules to make their lives easier. However, the training is easy, straight forward, and because you have paid sick day you don’t have to worry about missing work. It’s a great place for learning all the basics and gaining confidence. Paid sick days are great but be prepared to get called in."
good,"Working at Chipotle is very flexible, I enjoyed having long hours despite having the opportunity to request your own schedule. Many managers and informational guidebooks that provide answers and help to any questions or how-tos."
good,I liked working here a lot but during my football season i just couldn't handle the work load. Learned all positions in store by the time I was done working there
good,"I would start my day by getting the grill ready to cook. I would all my supplies that I need right by my grill. Then I would start preparing the food. I went through a total of three different managers, so I felt the environment wasn't necessarily stable. However, I did enjoy the culture and people I worked with. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning new cooking skills and being able to get it done on a prompt time."
good,"Not a bad place to work at.  Crew members are just a little awkward sometimes and make you feel a little outcasted. but my managers were really friendly and made sure you were getting the job done as smooth as possible. "
good,"Doesn’t pay as well for long-time/experienced workers. Gets stressful at times, but is not that difficult once you know what you’re doing. Always have something to do. Also don’t be cocky and thing you know what you’re doing, they would rather have you ask questions."
good,"Fun job during college where I eventually learned all positions. However, being in a college town made most days stressful and busy, but if you had a hard working team, it was fun."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Work pace was good, I enjoyed it. Management was rough but they got good results. "
good,"The overall work place is good. They hire almost anyone so sometimes certain people can be a little crazy but you also do make an amazing family group. It is a great first job, but no a good career choice  because you do not get paid a lot at all."
good,its a fantastic place to work during high school or right out of high school however it is stressful and the opportunity for advancement is abysmal at best
good,"Loved working for Chipotle for a long time. However I did not feel I was compensated well for the job that I did. After the foos crisis, there was a lack of opportunities available."
good,I loved this job. I only worked like 12 hours a week. They wouldnt work with me with my other job even after explaining the situation. But i enjoyed going in the days i did work.
good,When I started working there I got no training. I started off my first day knowing nothing at all. The newer people get lots of training. Some people don’t know how to manger their job position. Others only learn how to do one thing and don’t know how to do anything else because no one shows them.
good,"Clock in at the front of the house then prepare the food for the day unless the shipping order came in, then you'll stock everything for the week to continue the shop's operations."
good,"would love to work at Chipotle again. great company, great advancement opportunities and fun experience. if I could change one thing about my experience working with Chipotle, I would make the training more extensive."
good,"It is a good part-time job. I really enjoyed the flexibility, especially because I travel a lot. It was never a ""hard"" job. The people I worked with always made the workplace fun to be at."
good,"Working at any fast food restaurant is a pain, but working at Chipotle is worse. Crew members made so little compared to our salary managers and above. The job did not match the pay."
good,It's a nice job for people in school who dont need to make a whole lot. They have pretty good benefits and it's better than working at McDonald's. You get help with schooling as well.
good,Working at Chipotle was fun and I felt that it was a family like environment. I enjoyed working at the Tanasbourne Chipotle. My coworkers were amazing and always made work life enjoyable. I looked forward to work everyday at Chipotle.
good,"Chipotle overall was a good place to work, coworkers was very friendly and did not mine training you. They we always fun to work with. The customer's were great as well."
good,I love the people I work with and love the culture at work. The managers are really great and will always do their best to work with your schedule. I only wish I could move up in position.
good,"Everyday was nearly the same, as you get in the routine you become faster and better at your job and eventually move into another position. Management was rude and inconsiderate, not understanding whatsoever. Management would get angry with you for not doing something they never taught you as well as things that aren't in your control."
good,"It is very quick. Gotta be able to learn/pick up stuff quickly. Gotta be willing to learn new things or different ways to do things. There are many front of house and back of house positions. If you aren't a people person there is dish washer, porter , grill, online order ositions. There are many positions for front of house as well including cash, tortilla, salsa, linebacker etc."
good,chipotle is a great place for individuals who are fresh out of High School and may not have many bills. the environment is very fast pace and loud. great food too
good,Unfortunately at Chipotle the store is all dependent on the capabilities of the GM. Even with a good crew set in place it can all fall apart due to poor leadership from the General Manager of the store.
good,"a typical work day at chipotle is very busy, the restaurant itself gets a lot of customers and if you're not able to keep up with the fast work flow then consider a different job."
good,"Overall I had a great experience at Chipotle and it taught me alot. Pros were the people and the culture and of course the food is great. The cons were work life balance, if any crew called off which is often, the team has to suffer working short staffed and becuase of this customers suffer. Especially if you are a manager they expect you to drop everything to come into work even if it's seven days a week and becsuse of that payment compensation suffers and everyone feels underpaid. When the employees feel overworked and under appreciated they quit, which is why the Turnover ratio is too high and the company should be more focused on employees instead of the  the new marketing aspects. If customers always have a great experience their word of mouth will travel a lot faster than the commercials or new ads because most of the time anyways all the changes  confuses most crew members and they can't keep up with the new promos anyways."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotle is a great workplace, especially if you have bubbly and amazing coworkers. While management can be very bad depending on the store you find yourself in, you can be sure that your loyalty to coworkers will keep you there."
good,"This was my first job, so overall it was not the professional setting I assumed it'd be. Management constantly was changing. Discussed my salary between crew without my consent. The people I worked with were amazing at heart, but lacked work ethic. My training was done by 2 other teenagers that also just got hired a week before me. Then I was asked to train newcomers as well. Everything seemed really unprofessional and unorganized."
good,Did have a great culture before the decision was made to relocate the company headquarters eliminating over 400 positions. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with.
good,great place to work. the store i was at promoted for friendship not work ethic. the manager didn't have control of everything going on in the store. there was a lack of constructive leadership.
good,a typical day at work as to make sure all the team members were prepared for the day. made sure we had all the food prep done and  also always double check that we were not wasting food or time. coach workers through out the day and always made sure the customer was happy
good,"It was a great experienced; however, it gets very stressfull when your manager knows that the store is always packed and we are short staffed........."
good,The work culture for Chipotle is phenomenal and my coworkers have always been fantastic. Even my managers have been supportive and helpful. But upper management is removed and has no idea how the store operates day to day. They are mostly outside hiers and don't know what it's like to work up through the company and demand results.
good,"A typical day at Chipotle means I work line or cash. I would clock-in and get to work restocking and dealing with customers without much supervision from managers. I learned about working at a fast pace, dealing with difficult people, and problem-solving. Everyone is usually friendly. The hardest part of my job is dealing with rude people and smiling all the while. The most enjoyable part of my job is getting to know the customers, crew members, and enjoy the food we make fresh every day."
good,"I wasn’t a fan of the general manager who was present when I left, but for the most part it is an enjoyable experience. Most of the people there are very kind and the environment and expectations are simple."
good,"Chipotle offered me a truly remarkable ground for growth and success. I obtained knowledge from several different aspects in the job. Received great support from Corporate team members, and had an awesome staff!"
good,Working at Chipotle you learn how to communicate with customers and how to work with coworkers in a fast paced environment. Some days can be calm but most of the time they are busy with many things to do. There will always be something to clean or something for you to do if there are no customers in line. This job is perfect as a starter job for any high school or college student as they are flexible with hours and work around your schedule.
good,"- Took care most of the restaurant work"
good,communication is key in chipotle. calling for food on time as well and providing upstanding customer service. I believe the quick job environment translates easily towards other jobs as you get into a groove of doing things quickly and efficiently
good,Overworked at Chipotle. They tell you that there is room for advancement but in reality if you get promoted your almost just a babysitter for young kids who don't want to work at chipotle the rest of their lives and frankly don't care with a small pay bump. With Chipotles change in ingridients their food just isnt' good anymore and I cant be proud of cooking something like what Chipotle put's out for the public.
good,I worked there for 3 years and was paid less than everyone else and did more work than anyone else. I only stayed because I needed the money  but once I had an opportunity to leave i did
good,Working at this company is fun and fast paced! Can be stressful at moments because of lack of management in the store. Have learned a lot from this job would recommend to someone who likes working fast!
good,"This job was fun and a good learning experience. I would clock in and get to work immediately. I enjoyed working there and had a great group of coworkers. However, there were many new people every month and the managers would expect me to train them and pick up for their slack and manage them. I got paid the same amount as them but did more work. Overall, it was a positive experience, but sometimes could get too stressful and emotional between the managers."
good,nice everyday work and communication is tried to be put in to ensure we finish our task in time with out lacking a task. You do get free lunch but they made little rules that you couldn't eat if you didn't work the last few years it was a disaster because people were already used to coming in and getting free food. chipotle loves changing their games for some reason. not just the food but there would be new rules or new changes like scrub the floor every other day but then some managers wouldn't agree and we would clean the floor if  we were are asked to everyday.
good,"Great place to work if you have the right staff and management, otherwise you will be killing yourself and stressing out for just above minimum wage. Good as an entry level job but as you move up, I notice the company starts taking advantage of you. Enjoyed it while I was hourly and then when I started training to be salary, I would notice you have to be at the store just about 24/7 and have to sacrifice some off the clock working. They say you get a break after working 6 hours but you aren't guaranteed one, but if you do get it, it's a paid 30 minute break."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,What i really enjoy about this company. they had a great culture. the people were super friendly and they were all top performers. i learned how to master the grill here and how to be fast and consistent using the knives. they pay sucks tho. 12$ an hour is hard to survive in California.
good,Many left because advancement was only pushed for the people that hung out together. They would blame errors on others and wouldn't report those they couldn't scapegoat.
good,"I loved coming into work and all the whole crew  greeting me all at once, they were like family and we were all close. It made it easier working because our shifts would just go by so fast from all all the laughter we would share, all the teamwork & I feel that that is very important when working in a fast pace restaurant."
good,"Fast paced , enjoyable, teaches you many things about food care and how to cook food cleanly and properly. Your coworkers treat you like family and you feel welcomed"
good,"For the most part I enjoyed working there, but we were often short staffed which upped our workload causing more stress to employees than needed. It was hard to keep people so we were often working with new inexperienced people. They usually worked as hard as they could, but starting a new job always takes some time to get use to. Some of the more experienced employees didn't have the patience for that so they would get annoyed and that would effect their work performance adding even more stress to the environment. I love what Chipotle envisions, but I feel like some of the standards may be set to high for a job that pays just a bit higher than minimum wage. If they offered higher pay rates, people may be more motivated to do a good job. I love the fast pace work, but it isn't for everyone."
good,"My experience at chipotle was unique! It always kept me busy.  Between hiring, training, and mentoring future leaders, there was always something new to do.  It was a pleasant place to work at if you enjoyed a fast pace environment."
good,They would take advantage of the fact that my hours were over and made me stay hours more to do things knowing i was a high school student. i couldn't contact my mom to let her know. The manager before wouldn't help and just very unprofessional.
good,"As my first job, I wouldn't have wanted anything more. It was always a fun time with your coworkers and the days just use to fly by because of the rushes you get throughout the day. I would recommend this job to anyone"
good,Chipotle was a great experience for growing within a people culture. The store always felt like home and i enjoyed working with each and everyone I had a chance to meet.
good,I can be a fun place to work if the manager weren't so young and not have the experience needed to be a manager promoting within is good but people skills can not be thought and that is part of being a manager.
good,"It’s a good place to work at if you are okay with working in a fast pace environment. If you get overwhelmed, just let one of your co-workers know and they’ll help you out. Everyone is family in this establishment."
good,This was basically my first ever job and it was amazing. It was always busy and you're always occupied doing something. But it does depend where and what location you work for... fortunately my store was amazing I had a great understanding manager which she always tried to listen to us and make it a better place to work at. And my coworkers were always willing to help. I felt welcomed since my very first day and that's something I appreciated. Totally recommend friends and family to work for chipotle mexican grill.
good,"Lunch and dinner peak hours are a constant line out the door and we were constantly understaffed because no one wanted to show up. Poorly managed, corporate is totally detached."
good,"My typical day at work was a little more stressful than most. I was a manager at a very busy location. I did learn a lot of my skills I have now from Chipotle and I will always be grateful for that. The hardest part of the job is the long hours and the lack of promotion within the company. The company was great at only promoting within for a long time but since has ventured away from that unfortunately because I feel like the ""outside hires"" do not receive the full experience and also proper training."
good,The daily workload is not as strenuous as other fast food places I have worked. It also had friendlier customers and workplace environment that was not stressful.
good,Good job to start off with. No prior experience is necessary. Be prepared to work hard and be diligent. Some coworkers are not as helpful and diligent as they should be; they're high school kids but nevertheless this is still a job.
good,Chipotle was a great company to work for in the early years.  The recent changes are why I left.  I would love to have stayed but didn't believe in the direction or the new management.
good,"Though I love the concept the company goes for, the particular store I worked for was at best chaotic. I really liked the education help they offer. I liked the company as a whole, but the stress as a kitchen manager sometimes outweighed the benefits of the company. I was fired for ""not helping move the team forward"" after my son died. This was after I offered to step down a month earlier until I could pull myself out of my depression. It could just be that I have a bad taste in my mouth because of this."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Although the environment is fun at times. The business does become stressful during peak times and on busy days. I am able to handle this stress but, I am not happy with the pay. I think that they do not pay me enough for the amount of work that they expect you to do. You are also always on a tight rope always on the verge of being fired for trivial things. The worst part of me personally about chipotle is that I am not advancing my career."
good,Work was very fast paced and team orientated with some great management. The GM was not as team orientated. The best part of the job was closing because the challenge to finish on time.
good,Fast paced environment with people that want to help make you better at your job. Friendly coworkers who are also dedicated to the job with fun personalities. Friendships made between coworkers stem outside of the workplace as well.
good,"You can either get the really bad, or the really good. Chipotle isn't a ""bad"" company, but it has its flaws. You need to be always be critical of yourself, and you need to make sure that you're always ready for changes. Feedback is key, don't take anything personal and grow from your mistakes."
good,A lot of the employees are asked to work more for less than the average pay. You could go to McDonalds and make more than what you'll make here. This company does not care fully about their employees.
good,"The job was a stressful one, to say the least. But the culture was a good idea and it thought me a lot, and pushed me to be better. High pressure isnt for everyone."
good,"This is a restaurant so there will be the obvious problems like petty, lazy co-workers, managers who do not support the team, favoritism etc. But on the other hand Chipotle is a fantastic company. There is a lot of opportunity for growth if you are interested, they have tuition reimbursement, college credits for the skills you learn on the job, and they provide free meals and uniforms. There are many pros to working here. Some teams are better than others."
good,"No complains necessarily, it is a good job to at least try out. Lots of room for advancement; they do most internal hiring for manager and up positions"
good,"Typical days were great! lots of advancement opportunity for low to mid level managers. People were great to work with, the upper management was going through lots of changes. Watching people grow within the company."
good,"You have to have great time management skills, know how to pick up after and learn from your own mistakes. It takes a lot of emotional and physical pain through the day. If you work in a store that is short of hands you can be expected to have plenty of hours. If you are going into this place with the attitude that things are easy, than you are wrong. "
good,Atomsphere was fun until the GM gets mad at you. Fast pace. Big change over. Chipotle has been facing some serious health issues. Hopefully with the new CEO things will change.
good,"As long as you are willing to make little to no questions and follow orders you should be fine. As a dish washer I had to take care of all the dishes in a rapid manner and also help every other employee as needed. Marinating was fun the first couple times, but it gets annoying fast since the meats are super cold and left my hands hurting quite a lot."
good,The managers don't know what they are doing half of the time. The other half they are on their phones. The crew members are the best part about working there.  You do learn a lot of new skills.
good,"This is a job more so for people outside of high school. It is beneficial for those who need full time or want to learn skills to live for their future. Chipotle is a HARD job. It’s very rewarding but it is not a cakewalk. You’re responsible for a lot, and it is very easy to fall off the rails or not work your best and very noticible when you are off. It is like a family, you can learn great things and have great values added on to your own when you work there and the career opportunities are endless IF you’re a hard worker. There’s benefits but you do have to sign up. This job does consume your life a bit especially if you’re a manager. You get a lot of hours if you’re a top performer."
good,Chipotle was my first job and i loved it. I would recommend this fast food job to anyone. For it to be fast food the pay was good. Working here as the youngest team member it was the best we were like a family. Its a fast paced and very packed job but if you have the right team and manger you wont have to worry.
good,"prepping food was the best part of the job. after that, long lives would leave you stressed all day. management was helpful, but once you slightly moved up in the company you were at a halt."
good,"Nothing wrong with the job, just need more structure. I need to not work with young people. I try to make them into hard workers, 75% of them just don't want to do it. Need a serious job,cannot keep babysitting."
good,"Its a good place with a good environment. I learned how to do salsa, chips, also how to do prep marinating. Meeting our time expectation is the hardest thing but it motivates us to work great."
good,"The team are fun to be around, and they are always getting the job that need to be finished done. There is always something to do, nd you learna lot about different things"
good,"Working at Chipotle as an apprentice manager was one of the most rewarding experiences of my life, I learned so much about myself and being a leader. Chipotle is a restaurant which implies the importance of the food culture but Chipotle is also about a great people culture. People come first whether it be guests or fellow crew members. The hardest part of the job was the stress that comes from maintaining constants high standards."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,It was a fun place to work at when i was younger. It was very fast paced and a hardworking job. We got 1 free meal a day when working. It helped me come out of my shell and improve customer service skills.
good,This is a fast paced store. There are many regular customers that come in there on a daily basis. They expect you to know what they order and be already making it. There are many call ahead orders that have to be made all while running the line and the register.
good,very fun except i got injured. the night manager sucked. loved my coworkers. very clean and organized. great food and atmosphere. busy and better version of taco bell
good,"My time working at Chipotle wasn't too awful, but could have been better. Managers often ignored employee concerns and stresses. The work was easy, but managers often wouldn't take the time to train employees correctly, which made things chaotic and unorganized. The hardest part of the job was the location and customers I dealt with, while the most enjoyable was getting to cook and prepare food in a real restaurant setting."
good,Chipotle is filled with a lot of opportunities. If you are motivated and are looking to move up this would be the job for you. This job is very fast paste.
good,"When I started, I didn't know what it was like to work in the food industry. The ""training"" was rough. They basically pair you up with someone who you either make their job easier or harder depending on how fast you learn. However, there isn't much false advertising. As you spend more time there, they put you on different stations (Grill, Cash, Line, Back). A typical day is the morning people come in a do their prep and serve the morning peak customers. The midday people come in to help transition to the evening shift. The evening shift people do the evening prep and serve the dinner rush customers. They also close the restaurant at closing time. Closing is basically cleaning everything and organizing before you leave. The culture is pretty relaxed for the most part. Most of the crew are 16 - 20s. Most managers are 20+. Most gms are 24+. It's tough to get the hang of if you've never done it before, but once you do, the typical fast food restaurant nonsense becomes routine."
good,when I first started working at chipotle everything was just hard because I worked on the grill and it was for me too catch up in one day but when you get used too working there every thing will be easy.
good,A typical day is filled with taking orders quickly while trying to keep the area clean. Chipotle wants its employees to know a little of every job so that you can be in any position they you of you that day.
good,Chipotle has very cool co-workers and some cool managers. Sometimes there was to many managers working at the same time that became confusing when it came to training. Training was very limited and spent most of the time self learning. The hardest part of the job was multi-tasking. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with customers.
good,"Working at Chipotle was one of my better jobs. I really enjoyed working there, but the managment was very rude and so were the other employees. It was kind of like high school all over again... Pay was nice. Free food when working and half off when not."
good,"I loved my crew and my manager to the max, they are great people. However, the work environment was not fair to workers. Managers expected employees to complete too many task in short amounts of time. There were realistic goals set but the time given for the task were unrealistic, and highly stressful when they added more task last minute. The crew was a family, but we did not always help each other because we were too stressed with our work load that they kept adding on."
good,"Chipotle is a great company to work for. Even at the corporate level, the staff cares about each of it's individual crew members. During your shifts you receive a free employee meal, and while you are off duty you receive a 50% discount. Chipotle treats its employees well and they do everything in their power to ensure their crew is well train and hospitable in order to provide their customer with the best possible dining experience."
good,"Chipotle isn't just a job its a culture, in order to work there you need to embrace it and really be a team player.  Every store is just a bit different because all managers run their own store differently, but there is a lot of opportunities to grow with this company if you are willing to put the work in and you must be open minded and kind because customers are number one!"
good,"Chipotle is a great start for anyone looking for their first job. It's a fun place to work, with an awesome workforce and an amazing sustainability culture."
good,It wasn't under the best management but I had fun with the coworkers I had. The food isn't great like it used to be but it was enjoyable. I wouldn't fully recommend
good,there is a lot of stress put on you to finish tasks on time. they do not give you enough time to clean in between tasks or even move at a normal pace. sometimes you need to come in early and work off the clock if you want to get ahead. not worth minimum wage. only reason I stayed was for tuition reimbursement
good,Working in a kitchen was fun and exciting and my coworkers were relaxed but hard working. I appreciated the provided trainer because they were understanding and helpful on other days. What I didnt appreciate was that the manager at the time played favorites and didnt pay different people and positions fairly.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was making conversation with the friendly customers while taking their orders. The hardest part of the job was advancement due to the fact that you can not progress despite your work ethic unless you are given the opportunity to learn other aspects of the job.
good,"I enjoyed my job at Chipotle, it was a very upbeat and fun environment, the advancement processes and things that they stood for were good, the management for the most part was pretty good. It took me quite a while to get used to the fast paced work and the different ways that things had to be done, but it was definitely a good place to be."
good,This was a good place to work. The staff where very helpful as far as team work. The pay was cool considering the job was not that hard. Wouldn't mind going back.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Working at Chipotle has taught me many things including how to use a knife, keep a clean workspace, recipes, and cook times. I also learned how to operate a touchscreen point of sales system. The work environment is quick-paced and demanding. The overall attitude of my coworkers is positive."
good,"I began at Chipotle as a line server working my way to the BOH, and eventually moving up to a service manager. I learned so much from how to Manage the front of  house , back of house and how to motivate  a team to achieve goals ."
good,"The workplace culture is beneficial to the success of the corporation; It is taught and instilled into each employee of Chipotle. Such as the 13 characteristics required for hiring, to the vision and purpose of the business. Chipotle has allowed me an opportunity to acquire the knowledge for operating a business efficiently. The hardest part of the job is the amount of responsibility in return for the compensation. Otherwise, the position offers many opportunities for growth and education. Overall, it was a great learning experience and I look forward to receiving more satisfying opportunities in the future."
good,Good place to work if you are a fast worker. The people are good but the general manager has high expectations of you and expects you to be a pro even if you've been working for like 2-3 weeks
good,"great skills set acquired from working at chipotle, I've been employed there for about a year now and I would love to advance my work experience while in school."
good,Overall Chipotle was a fairly well place to work at for getting your foot in the door. There is room to advance in your career and the employees always have a positive attitude.
good,"It's a fast paced job I learned how to use a grill and handle food safely and multi tasking without making mistakes , you have to be on point with this job because of the continuous food regulations. the job itself isn't hard It's general labor anyone can do it. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was cleaning for some reason I found it fun."
good,"Chipotle always uses the freshest of ingredients, everything is same day prepped for customers. Teamwork is amazing and the experience was excellent !!"
good,"Fun, fast paced job for young 20 somethings or those without higher education that still allows for upward movement. Start as tortilla presser and can work all the way to grillmaster, and after that management. Culture is decent, Chipotle has all these corporate tenets and mottos but no one really cares about them."
good,Place is very organized and has a good sense of balance. Work is done quickly and efficiently. The job itself was not very enjoyable as often you are left alone to tend to jobs that you have not been taught yet. Co-workers were often lazy and management would often have favorites.
good,"they do teach you how to do all the steps correctly but often  critic little things that wouldn't change anything maybe not all but the one i worked at they where picky about everything even the way you would wash dishes too much work for a single person to be doing and they are stingy with the hours i would have to beg them so they would give me more than 4 hours a week and when they would they would tell me 20 min before e the shift started  and if you didn't drop everything to pick up the shift they would go on to say"" you claim you want more hour but when the opportunity arrises you face to show up""."
good,"I liked working in Chipotle because it gave me an idea of working with other people including the employees and the customers. They always assigned me to work with the customers because they see that I'm always patient and smiling. The hardest part was when there is a lot of customers coming all at once and they catch us off guard so we have to be on our A game but on some occasions I love when I get challenged like that and I can not make any mistakes. Chipotle is very strict with the ""customer is always right"" and I have no problem with that."
good,I think chipotle is a great place to work. They train you fast and well to do your job efficiently and correctly. I met a lot of amazing people here and learned a lot.
good,working with a company that let you work your way to the top with lots of opportunity to grow with company was one of the best feeling in the world them promoting me to service manager.
good,The restaurant really makes you want to advance within the restaurant and grow and help others to grow within the company as well. This paired with the coworkers is a great experience. It can get rather fast paced at times but the rush is definitely worth it.
good,"Yes you get free food and you're lucky if you get a great culture, but the pay isn't enough for a crew member and barely enough for a manager to have your own place, and most employees are trying to be on their own, 18 and up. The benefits were not the best as well. I was always worried about losing my job because their ""high standards"" created a hostile work environment filled with fear of failure and termination."
good,"Free meal each shift. Room for advancement. Flexible schedule, and relaxed atmosphere. Tips. Loud Music at times as well as fast paced environment. great company!"
good,"A typical day at work for me involved a lot of time on grill. I've learned a lot of what a good crew should be. Also, having a management team that focused on training new managers I had the opportunity to become a kitchen manager in training which opened a lot of doors for me. Over all Chipotle was a god experience for me!"
good,Management needs to be careful who they hire. They shouldn't just hire anyone. It's harder to work with lazy workers rather then working with a team who works together.
good,"It was a good experience to work at Chipotle overall. Management was a bit unorganized at the location I was in. People were friendly, the work was not too hard."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,The pay is good but they pay you for the amount of work they expect you to do. You can't expect to go in and just sit around you have to earn your money.
good,"easy to learn, and wit good managers and co workers."
good,"It's a very fast paced job, so have to be able to work quickly. There's always customers coming in and there's usually a line so you also have to be really good working under pressure."
good,"HR was not very helpful with issues that would occur in the workplace (even though they had a Respectful Workplace Hotline). It's good to advance in the company, but it is based mostly on favoritism from others."
good,"Within a ear of working for chipotle I moved from being a buss boy to being in charge of the grill. Unfortunately, those above me decided that cuts had to be made. This made our functioning staff for a shift bare bones. Any amount of trouble during a shift would set you back 1-2 hours making every one grumpy and with no way of actually fixing the problem."
good,"Little pay for amount of work needed. there is many opportunities to grow with  the company but starting at even a crew member, a lot is required of you for the little pay."
good,"The culture is the best thing about working for Chipotle. The company puts incredible emphasis on high standards and food quality, so much that it is admirable. They source food from local organic farms which boosts the health of the community as well as stimulates the local economy. As for the training process, it is extensive to ensure each crew member is set up for success and they promote from within to share opportunities. Managers are always pushing employees to be more efficient with tasks which can be challenging. The job itself, is very fast-paced, often times stressful, and physically demanding. A typical customer service job. Out of all the fast food chains, I would recommend Chipotle Mexican Grill as a place of employment to those looking for a challenge."
good,I loved working & meeting new customer & serving customers daily but I wish some things were different. I would still work for other chipotle if I was offered a j
good,"I can work anytime or even stress time as far as the owners of Mexican grill will fairly paid me on my work hours. "
good,"Before new management took over and everybody left, was a place where I looked forward to going to everyday after school. Since new management has taken over, the new workers lack work ethic and the stress of the the place has been placed onto those that stuck around after everyone good left. No one cares about their job anymore."
good,"The people were enjoyable, but management struggled in certain spots. Some managers preferred the sink or swim way and help was difficult to get especially during busy hours."
good,"An entry-level position, a Chipotle crew member job provides the perfect opportunity to test employment seekers looking for work in the fast food industry. Primary duties consist of taking orders, preparing meals, packaging food items, and ringing up customer purchases. Secondary duties for Chipotle crew members include preparing food and ingredients, opening and closing the store, and cleaning. Crew members must keep the kitchen, dining area, and bathrooms in great shape. As a nationally recognized fast food chain, Chipotle offers a varied job atmosphere. Often, the work environment remains busy and often hectic at Chipotle Mexican Grill restaurants. Other times, business may move at a steady pace. Chipotle employees must know how to keep themselves busy during all hours of the day."
good,If you work on the register you have to be on the register while restocking the lobby taking out the trash making sure the restrooms are cleaned and restocked all while washing the trays in the back.. it's crazy.. can't believe one person has to do that.
good,"Chipotle was an awesome work environment with lots of perks to the job, however in order for there to be an opportunity for advancement Chipotle needed to be my whole life. I simply couldn't work there and go to school."
good,"Fast paced, multi-task required job. Cashier had to keep dining clean, help throughout the store, and help others when needed. Hardest part would have to be when the restaurant is busy and having to juggle the cleanliness of the store with helping customers have a fast and friendly experience."
good,"Very comfortable workplace. Everyone there was friendly and helpful toward each other, it literally felt like i had another family at my job at the time."
good,"A typical day at work is pretty routine of being on your own in the morning and getting your work done to prepare for the day. Once the doors open, everyone works together to try and ensure that customers are being pushed through the line in a timely, yet polite manner. Management attempts to motivate workers, as well as workers try to encourage one another, as well. The hardest part of this job is training new hires to be successful, top performers, while still maintaining a effective and efficient work environment."
good,"A typical day consisted of huge lines, sometimes rude customers, and keeping an eye on the supply of food on our line. Despite some mean customers, I made an effort to always be kind and friendly to all patrons, and when they are nice in return, it makes my day. I have learned a lot about time management and cleanliness, as Chipotle prides itself on clean practices. Management was excellent, they were always there to help and teach you how to improve, which in turn, created a positive workplace culture with co-workers who enjoyed each other's company. The hardest part was serving lines and lines of customers non-stop for hours on end while simultaneously trying to remain clean and well-stocked."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Chipotle is a great company to work for... I love the culture the management could be a little better but over all great place to work and make great friends and family
good,"I have work as a crew member for some time there, and they are trainers on the spot to help you with everything you need to learn about the company and how they handle different procedures. Sometimes the store gets pretty hectic and busy, but its very enjoyable to work there and have a great time with your team members in the restaurant."
good,"I loved working at chipotle, my only concern is with the area manger that i was above me. She was very unqualify and didn't understand or care for once quality of life."
good,"I would start off by cleaning around the area where the food was, then I would get my gloves on, get a spot in line and start serving people. Sometimes I would be preparing the food or at the cash register. Everyday was pretty busy so we had a fast paced workplace. "
good,"Meeting new people. "
good,chipotle was a very busy place to work at but if you do your job well you should be fine. although you constantly need to watch you back because people will spread rumors about you to get you fired just because they do not like you. company doesn't care about their workers as much as they do the money they make.
good,"A surprisingly intensive job that taught me a lot about working hard to keep a place clean, communicate well with my fellow employees, communicate well with customers, and learn more about the industry. "
good,"Working at Chipotle means being greeted by your co-workers and being welcomed by the tasks at hand. I learned mostly that having a job like this being far from my house was trouble from the beginning. Having to use public transportation made me more stressful because sometimes the bus does not run accurately to its schedule. My co-workers were pretty nice and hard-working. They would step in and help if needed. The hardest part of working at Chipotle is dealing with customers. Customers are very particular about their food and sometimes will get an attitude if necessary. Also dealing with managers not being on time for work was something that I felt was very unprofessional. The most enjoyable part of the job was having very enjoyable conversations with my fellow co-workers after my shift. When I had a hard day, they made my day much better."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle consisted of diagnosing symptoms in the restaurant and coming up with solutions. Some common symptoms included people showing up late or not showing up at all, preparing a prep sheet and deploying a crew of 6-9 people to tasks in order to effectively manage the store. "
good,"Very fast paced work environment, great co-workers, great managers, amazing daily customers, very fun and interesting place to work"
good,"I learned to do many things such as cook, and dice food. The work environment was good and the coworkers were very friendly, it felt like a team. the most enjoyable part of the job was serving the customers food with gratitude."
good,"it was a good experience. I improved my skills such as communication, customer service, organization of the work under pressure, and to respect the deadlines."
good,Chipotle is a good place to work if you are just looking for a part time. Culture wise it tends to vary but i work with some nice people and it was fun working and even going to work
good,this was a great job I enjoyed the environment and the people. many friendly faces customers very appreciative of good food. the food was always fresh and it was impeccable team work in my location.
good,"Instead of firing slackers, managers would partner them up with hard workers. This way the hard workers ended up doing everything. Some of the managers were great but one just walked around barking orders at people who were already working. Seemed to befriend the slackers. Also they would always make sure you never got overtime."
good,if you can follow the company's values you will succeed if not you will be let go quickly turn over rate is kind of high be prepared to contribute your all most managers don't care about what is going on with you
good,"I entered work looking at what position I would be assigned everyday. I was either Tortilla 1, Tortilla 2, or Salsa. ( Those are different parts for the line.) I'll go to my position and help the next person in line. I learned in order for your company to be great you need to have great customer service. Always make sure your customers are satisfied and will leave and come back with more people to satisfy. The management was great. He was always flexible with schedules, really cool guy, and always made sure we had fun at work and made sure we did our jobs. The hardest part of the job was fundraiser night. When Chipotle host a fundraiser, so many college kids came and it became a rush. The line was going out the door. It was a lot of pressure. The most enjoyable part was everything. We had great customers, and we always worked as a team."
good,"I loved working there, but after the management team got switched around everything changed and went down and everyone started to leave or got fired and got less hours. I feel like if the management team hadn't left I would've still be working there."
good,"When i go to work, my job is to train new hires and lead through empowerment by validating my coworkers on their capabilities in the work space. Since I'm in training to be kitchen manager i have a lot or responsibilities. The hardest part of the job is keeping a smile when you have to deal with multiple personalities and customers. The most enjoyable part would be working with nice easy going people who i get along with very well as well as when we teach each other new things and watch each other grow."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,its so busy and overwhelming. it is very unorganized. my co worker are very nice and hardworking. i learned how to cut food. how to cook food. also learned how to become a leader.
good,"Log orders, Interact with customers, problem solving, high energy environment. Every day was different , catering orders, online orders, charity work, donations all apart of the job."
good,"The Patrick henry mall has the worst management I've ever seen."
good,The job have very little learning opportunities; very to little change in daily activities. Had to make sure all ingredients were ready to be served and are kept clean. Served customers as quickly as possible while providing great customer service. The management was great had a positive atmosphere.
good,I have learned many things in this employment and I am a team player and I enjoy this employment.  Training many employees and learning many other parts of the company.
good,"The co-workers were funny, and upbeat almost every day. The management was not very good, they would leave and not help the employees when busy. They would ignore the employees, and play favorites. The hardest part of the job was when the managers would have a bad day because they would make everyone else angry and the shop wouldn'Frt run smoothly."
good,"Constantly learning, relearning, and expanding. I enjoyed working here a lot; I grew comradery with my co-workers. Starting off on grill was not easy, and a complete challenge. Striving each day for perfect cut sizes, ensuring all food is up to temperature and delicious, constantly maintaining a clean station, and never running out of food.The fast pace environment is not for everyone, but as you go your realize everyones there to help and I also enjoyed coming in everyday and seeing smiling faces! Great times"
good,It is a fun job for those who like to be constantly on the move. I like that everything is fresh and wholesome within the restaurant. The safety standards are the most up kept and detailed that i have ever seen. I am proud to be apart of the company.
good,"I loved working at chipotle, a typical day at work would start around 1300 receiving the shift from the morning crew.  I learned to work at a fast pace in a rush environment. Management was great, everything was smoothly operated. Co-workers really make the job fun. I do't believe there is a hard part to this job, things go wrong but working together with your team can easily solve those problems."
good,"A typical day in Chipotle was basically a lot of left and right running. You are expected to work at a rate and pace unmatched by most.  I learned a lot there most importantly, how to effectively run a business.  The hardest part of the job was the busy hours, the easiest is clearing the line and rejoicing with your team."
good,"Chipotle is a great, fast paced work environment. You will do great if you can keep up. The management team takes the time to talk to the crew both collectively and individually. Co-workers are also encouraged to take the time and get to know the other team members because getting along and knowing how each other works well improves the all around function of the job and makes the job enjoyable."
good,I loved my coworkers but opportunities for advancement were used as a way of competition and not always based on performance and abilities. Management were nice.
good,Fun loving and caring at first until fully welcomed to the team which wasnt a very welcoming experience. Job seems to get worse day by day.
good,"It was a great working environment, the energy in the store was a great and a fun place to work. They care about there employees and do anything they can to help them out."
good,this company was okay for a first job. Its just that it was barely a superviosor checking over work employess did which caused them to lose their contracts with buildings.
good,Chipotle is a great place to work if you are first starting out in the work field. Its a very fun work environment. There is very little time for a personal life because they are always understaffed. If you decide to work at a chipotle go to one that is already staffed.
good,"I loved working for Chipotle. I was able to learn many different things at one time, it was a fast paced environment that demanded many things of you at once. You could move up in advancement pretty fast and the customer to employee ratio was pretty decent if you know how to manage yourself and others in a workspace like Chipotle offers. Good pay, not to sure about this benefits but im sure they have some. My only problem with Chipotle is their chain of command. Management now and days lack a lot of personal responsibility and business accountability which effects the companies overall rating. From food service to cleanliness. You could have great employees that willing to work and be great but if you have a management staff that personally knows nothing about something as simple as the difference between internal and external customers and their importance to the business as a whole, then you could experience high turnover rates, business endangerments, even ""insurance"" problems."
good,The quality of food Chipotle uses and the cleanliness of the place makes it a fun environment to work in.  Managers were friendly and approachable.
good,I love my job with chipotle!  i really have enjoyed making people better than and changing the way people think about and eat fast food.  I encourage anyone who wants to move up quickly into management and anyone who has management experience to apply for the job.  It has helped grow as a person and increased my work ethic.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotle was a great environment. different culture , different people. great energy when it came to the food. seeing the people smile coming in and out was the best feeling for me."
good,"Chipotle is an overall great job that teaches the fundamentals of what it's like to own and run a business. From the second you are trained, you are thought equality, an how everyone is here to achieve a goal instead of endlessly working from shift to shift. On a typical day, you can expect a super fast paced environment from the second you clock in, to the second you clock out. You are thought everything from how to wield a knife, to how to maintain and care for your business. The management team was very weak, and counter-productive. Since we are encourage to challenge others, sometimes orders are challenged an nothing gets done. Your co-workers are there to work with you as hard as they possibly can. Hardest part of the job is catching up when behind. Most enjoyable part is being ahead."
good,"Chipotle is a good company, but is still in the early stages of truly developing a corporate office culture and is beneficial to this level of employees.  Benefits are nice, but pay was on the low end."
good,"This was a very interesting company I have ever worked for not only am I a regular chipotle customer but working here taught me alot of valuable knowledge about the food I was eating and were it came from and why food culture is becoming more important to people all over the world I give Credit to Steve Ells for coming up with such a well structured company that also takes care of its employees, not only are you learn different tasks everyday but you build a sense of knowledge and personal growth. The positions in the job move up to becoming a shift manager within 6 months the most 3 if you are a fast paced hard worker. I enjoyed working with the staff at this location. However this job does have its cons, I started off as a line server and moved up to becoming early morning Prep withing 2 months after mastering those two positions I was then ready for my next challenge. So I thought, I then moved up to Grill Cook and boy was it the hardest job there, I received help until I was told I needed to master it on my own in order to move up to becoming a Kitchen Manager in training. I became very frustrated and started to really feel uncomfortable asking for help. Id work from 8am-5pm with no breaks, and at that moment I knew this job wouldn't be for me the labor was more than the pay and I wasn't given a well deserved raise. I have nothing bad to say about the company except management could use a lot more help when it comes to hiring certain candidates that don't fit this criteria. Ive seen more people walk out on this company more than I see people getting hired, well the right"
good,"It's a fast-paced environment and can be at times stressful to work here, but all in all you learn a lot about a food industry who's passionate about serving the best ingredients possible to its customers."
good,"People like to group up and act like they're in high school. Great company wrong location. Area manager Ashley isn't there to help, the GM John doesn't know how to run the place. Overall crew and KM are great! Just never know if the following day they'll group up to get you fired."
good,Working at chipotle was great!!! got the chance to experience a new culture when it came to the food and people. working with my co workers was a good team worker experience.
good,"It is a tough job at first but the people working there are fantastic. The managers were the best part , always friendly. You will get interviewed by the whole crew one by one giving you the feeling of team work."
good,"i enjoyed working at chipotle. the staff were always a blast to work with and the management was dependable. i think that with chipotle I've learned so much about the effect of fast food in peoples lives. although chipotle was fast casual. i feel I've learned how to better interact with people, how to handle money which resulted in better math skills and over all how to work as a team. the hardest part of my job was nothing at all. the job was easy and fun and i learned a whole lot. The funnest part of the job was during rush hour(s). i love the rushes of people we got and serving the customers. the fast paced environment and the cleaning up afterwards was the best part for me. i was always seeking new challenges and every day one would present itself to me."
good,"Always busy and doing something "
good,"A typical day at work was always busy, whether it was doing prep work, cleaning, or working on the service line.  I learned how to make massive amounts of several kinds of salsas and tortillas.  Management was always helpful, often working with the crew if we got a large amount of people.  My co-workers were amazing, but often replaced or disposed.  Some of them even taught me bits and pieces of Spanish.  The hardest part of the job was keeping up with certain tasks, because of time restraints.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the free burritos, and the knowledge I retained."
good,"Chipotle really pushes their employees to become all that they can be. They were awesome at building others up to become more than they ever thought. The job is hard and you're under paid but i've learned how to also build others up as well as myself. I've also learned how to have fun but still get my work done. And how to make customers feel comfortable, at home, and well taken care of."
good,Great company to work for as long as you have a mature management staff. Chipotle provides multiple opportunities for growth and expansion within the company.
good,I've learned new recipes I enjoyed working together. the team members were very helpful and management was very strictly enforced I've learned how to open up to people if I needed help my most enjoyable part would be working together at a fast pace and providing our customers with great service and communication
good,The training was amazing and i felt like i knew how to do everything. how ever because i couldnt work on sundays and or evenings which i told would be ok upon hiring me.....they fired me. so that ruined to whole experience. because even though i told them i go to church on sundays and i cant work evenings because my childs father works evenings and i have no one to watch my son they still let me go.
good,"A typical day at work was always on the clock and very fast paced. I learned the duties for opening and closing shifts. For morning I immediately prepared all the food items that had to be ready and cooked before opening. Also, for closing I learned how to clean the equipment, to rearrange the equipment, and put it back together. In addition, during my shifts I would learn the companies product, portions, hygiene and cross contamination, inventory arrivals, as well as closing inventory procedures for upcoming shift.. However, as for management I would not be in favor. It was very unprofessional. The managers projected demands that were not to be acceptable in the work place, but yet completely contradict themselves and do just that It was a lot of favoritism going on with longer working employees there. Co-workers were decent. Although, it did quite feel like a high school atmosphere where curtain dislikes for others were portrayed through actions. The hardest part to me was learning how to roll the burritos, but when I did get the hang of it I made them as if it were a normal part of my day.As for the most enjoyable, I love food!"
good,A typical work day at Chipotle can range from a breeze to very stressful. The key to a very stressful work day Chipotle is when the online orders come in. Between serving the customer and making sure you have every order done will have you wanting to quit that night. Working here i have learned so much about the business and the 13 characteristics you need in order to be employed at Chipotle. They also make sure that the vision is stored inside your brain. The coworkers are usually like one big family even the mangers. Also there is no separation between the Spanish and English people they get along very well. Overall working for Chipotle can be the best for you or the worse it all depends on how you handle a fast paced job.
good,There really isn't a typical when you work at Chipotle. Come in not knowing what you may do that day as you're constantly doing something different or being cross-trained. Most times the co-workers are awesome but management is not really to great.
good,"This job really brought me into the world of time management and hard work. This job is more difficult than most expect but the environment i had was good, mostly because of the people i worked next to. The worst part of this job was trying to find a balance between an outside life and work. I always felt that to make it further in the company you had to choose between an outside life or work being your life. Highly recommend for those with a strong work ethic."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"There is always a task to do at Chipotle. We have a deployment chart which shows and lets the crew know what station they have to complete. At work, although we are very busy we always manage to get our jobs done. We are great at elevating our team and spreading the culture to all members."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle would consist of either prep work, working on the line, being cashier or working the grill. I learned about the company and working very close with food; cutting, serving sizes, and grilling. The atmosphere was very living and upbeat and the customers made the day even better. At the location the management wasn't the best and there was no chance for growth within the company. Which made employees often feel stuck in one post. The most enjoyable part of the job was the face to face dealing with the customers."
good,"Working with this company was a good experience, but not a job i enjoyed much. the job consist of way much more then just your job title, alot of favoritism, management was ok."
good,"Work Mon-Fri 7:30-3:30"
good,"Chipotle is a company that prides itself on promoting from with in."
good,It's a great place if you want fast and constant work environment.
good,"An average day at Chipotle started around 8:00am. My opening tasks included, frying chips or preparing salsas for the day. I often worked preparing food directly in front of the customer while interacting with them. I also worked as cashier so handling money was a regular occurrence for me. "
good,"I did catering, provided customer service, working on the line with my crew, operated cash register and cash handling. The hardest part of the job was learning different things like receipe's and how to work the equipment for the stove and fryer. The most enjoyable part was it was fast paced most of the time and kept you moving and my crew was great to work with!"
good,I had fun working there. Things are what you make of them with this company.
good,"Had to be able to a lot of things at one time. Your duties are your number one priority. Expected to be done on time.  Employees are held to high standards, and to be empowered to be top performers."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle would be very busy around lunch time. During my experience working there I learned how to prepare and serve foods. Management was ok, I say this because I believe my boss didn't like me or had something against me. She would arrive at work and speak to everyone but me. It was ackward for me to work for someone who treated me that way. Espescially if I had no other known problems with any other managers or co-workers. Another mananger did say,  I had potential to become a manager but needed slight work after being employed there for a monht. The most enjoyable part of working at Chipotle Mexican Grill was providing the proper customer service to our customers."
good,"I loved the customers and helping people get the great food they wanted. The work place was alright and I liked making food, it's always so yummy. A typical day was coming in standing on the food line making the food and making everything perfect."
good,"A typical work day would consists of me taking orders, cleaning dishes and keeping lobby area clean. "
good,"Great people and customers, easy to advance. Management can be great, not a hard job."
good,"The customers make the job. Being on the front line rolling burritos is good for the pay, but talking to the plethora of people, having your regulars and remembering their names and orders make everything 100x better!"
good,Fast paced work place. Managers are pretty good real laid back. The job is what you make it not hard to do the job just put in the work and thats it. Nice hours and money just can get annoying because of the complaning customers.
good,".cook, prepare food, serve customers, wash dishes, sweep, and mop floors"
good,working at chipotle was an fun experience but one can not live off a job paying 8.00 per hour. the only thing that was good about chipotle was making great food.
good,No room for advancement. You learned to perform all areas and all positions.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Working here is not for an adult with family unless its supplemented income for an adult. I believe everyone work part time unless they are. Kitchen managers or service manger
good,"Chipotle is a nice job for those looking to earn a modest pay for a modest days work. Friendly work environment is the forefront of Chipotle, but it has bad days like any other job."
good,"I enjoyed the part that I’m not alone during the work, my team really support me. So far I work there almost a month, most of the time is short staff."
good,I enjoyed being able to work with the other employees at this company. I had a very good relationship with the assistant manager. This job allowed me to work with customers and ensure they were happy with their orders.
good,They have easy days and really pressuring days. Just always stay ahead if you wanna work here :) You can slack off but don't fall behind. It keeps you busy if you try
good,"Very organized place to work, always with protocols and standards that they need to be done, you get the chance to practice the customer service and be able to fix struggle while the service"
good,"I like how fast paced it can be sometimes, time goes by really fast and you always have something to do. Employees are friendly with each other we all get along very well and the managers are really understanding if you come to them with anything. We’re all like one big family."
good,"Overall i learned a lot during the 5 years i was with the company. They taught me how to confidently manage and develop restaurants full of people, drive sales and create culture. I do wish that being a salary manager was less time consuming and there was a better work-life balance"
good,"The higher ups we’re the ones there weren't flexible with anyone but my immediate bosses were better with people and more human and they made the job better. Along with the great crew of people I had the privilege of working with. The job, yes, was labor  but my coworkers made it ok because we all held each other up"
good,"Excellent way to learn food-preparation, handling, storage and safety. Fantastic staff and management; great guests that you get to know over time. I love working here! Superb opportunities for those who want to get into training and to manage."
good,"Very good company to work for as far as pay, benefits and overall hospitality, the work is very fast pace, especially during peak hours which makes the time go fast"
good,"Rush hours can get pretty hectic, but everyone tries to work together to get through them."
good,"Great job for Per Diem. But would most likely need to seek another employment too. Good job if seeking another part time employment, or if enrolled in school"
good,"I would usually open, and the opening shift, in my opinion, was the easiest. I learned how to handle cash, talk to customers politely and informatively, and learned how to work in a fast pace environment while still keeping my cool. I can't say there's anything hard about this job, because everything was quite easy. The most enjoyable part of my job was definitely coming into work and seeing my coworkers, they made the job easier."
good,"Started working here as a teenager. They said they were fine with my shifts not starting till 4. Suddenly that was not allowed had to get across town to start at 3:30! Other than that great work place. Most employees are kind, you are offered and taught a lot of the positions as you lock down the previous. Tips after every shift. Nothing too hard, just don't burn yourself cleaning tortilla heater"
good,Working prep at Chipotle involves arriving at work at 5:30 am so that all of the vegetables can be cut in time for open. It will require you to use a knife for 3-4 consecutive hours before moving on to other prep tasks.
good,"Chipotle is a very fun, fast paced environment that allows you to grow close to the team and also challenges you. The job can be very difficult at times and can be mentally exhausting-even at home at times, however some of the best people you can meet will be there. They also compensate fairly aggressively knowing that the job can be demanding."
good,I worked at Chipotle for 4.5 years. in that time I had 6 field leaders and 10 GMs. With that much turnover it was impossible to have a consistent experience. When the upper management was competent it was a lot of fun with great pay and benefits. When management was incompetent it was miserable.
good,"I guess my personality doesn't really fit with the chipotle culture, but I personally feel that almost everything is unnecessarily difficult and could be better managed to decrease the amount of stress in the workplace."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,cool job but they promised me $10 an hour starting never got that. but it was an alright job fast paced and but light work at the same time. recommend as a first job
good,Hit or miss with this employer. I loved & hated it at the same time if thats possible. Great place to work over all just needs alot of improvements honestly.
good,"I love my job, but I also have some issues on what my situation is now. My hours have been dramatically cut but nobody seems to care to help me when on my next paycheck I will make around $300 for two weeks when I make over $600 on a regular paycheck. I can't live off of that."
good,It's a job. The day flies by cuz we work extrely hard and very fast. It's very busy and they expect alot out of you. But we don't get paid enough. And we need more employees so we can actually keep the days we request off..
good,"I learned a lot of people skills and patience and how to properly go about customer serivce. Customer were our priority, also learned how to better worl with others as well as help those who need it."
good,"It is a good and very fast paced place to be, under 2 minutes your order will be done if you are just ordering one thing. The responsibilities are not at all difficult, they’re common sense."
good,"Every shift is very routine at Chipotle, based on your specific position. Hours are flexible, ideal for a student looking for part-time work. Decent pay for the workload. Peak hours can be stressful at times. Training is very minimal, you'll find yourself picking it up as you go."
good,"I feel like I got unlucky, we were a completely new store which was could’ve contributed to downfall. I can tell you that mostly everyone that I started with was fire before 6 months was over and the managers quit before the store made a year. The schedule was very flexible and the GM tried to accommodate everyone request off. The regulars are very nice. However, this is very fast paced environment and it can eventually take a toll on your body especially if your working full time. Management had a hard time retaining workers. The atmosphere could be very stressful"
good,"I've worked at Chipotle for almost 5 years now and overall I can say that it's a great company to work for. It's helped me grow as a person, so I can honestly say that I can handle any stressful work situation that I happen to come across. I feel that I've become a more independent worker as well as a very strong team player working for this company."
good,Chipotle may seem hard to work at but once you get the hang of things work becomes very fun. You just have to know when to stop playing around and get serious so you can get through peak hours.
good,I like closing the restaurant cuz is slow and we can get prep done and clean and do all the dishes clean the floors and the vents the drains under the tables to
good,I enjoy working quickly and keeping up with customer demand. The line work was fairly simple while making sure everything was stocked and keeping up with the prep cooking was mildly difficult but enjoyable.
good,"working at chipotle taught me to replenish food when it gets low, how to deal with good customer service, and to deal with co-workers kindly, and appropriately."
good,"If you are wanting to work somewhere in the fast food industry, or even for a first job, Chipotle is a great choice. You get a free employee meal everyday you work, and the skills you will learn with people, cooking, interacting is a great experience. Would not recommend someone wanting to advance drastically for a long term career."
good,"Working there was ok, very great atmosphere among the crew and managers. Very busy so you need to be prepared to work well on your feet and at a fast speed. I enjoyed it."
good,Always had to be quick on your feet and multitasking.  I enjoyed my time learning from everyone there.  It was always nice when the regulars knew me by name and asked for me.  Stressful and fast pace day to day but always try to keep a smile on your face for the other workers and customers.
good,It’s a great job for people who are looking for a part time while going to school as well even full time. But the job isn’t for everyone cause it is very stressful cause of the fast paced environment so remember it’s a job not a career unless you want make into one of course.
good,"Almost always a fun place to work. The volume of the store could easily affect the stress level, but if there were enough team members, it wasn't very difficult."
good,"Though days were sometimes hard and long, with the proper crew it was easy to get through. Our crew was more like a family than anything else and it was truly a pleasure to work with all of them. Management was excellent and very hard working. Would definitely recommend."
good,"Everyone at Chipotle is encouraged to learn about the company and strive to move up with the company. The job was fast paced and exhausting, but always positive and fun."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Whether your job be working the food line, being in the back, or cleaning the front and back of the house. There was always something going on, both good or bad. You learn a lot about accountability and being able to take charge for things your responsible for, among other traits as well."
good,It is a good started job and gives food handling experience however was not as flexible with the hours as i wanted. i might re apply in the future but as of now i am looking for other jobs
good,Good company but with new ceo things are changing dramatically. Hire from within mostly. They believe in food with integrity and eating healthy. Since the ecoli outbreak a lot of changes been made some for the better some for the worst in my opinion
good,It was really beneficial working at Chipotle because you can learn how to work together and quickly in a fast paced environment. The work wasn't extremely difficult and it was always nice to see the regulars come in.
good,Everyone here was very close-knit and open with each other. We all knew each other's skill-set and were always willing to teach each other new stuff. Workplace culture was probably the best thing about working here.
good,Great training program for new employees and management was more than happy to answer questions and help learn new skills.  Coworkers were fairly nice and drama free.
good,"Management is good or bad depending which stores you go to, over all, chipotle is an amazing company that preaches leadership, ownership, and training (varies on management and store). The work is repetitive, you do have chances to learn every station and grow within the company. Benefits are great and opportunities are great as well. Chipotle likes to keep a casual and fun environment where team members are comfortable voicing concerns to upper leaderships. "
good,"Chipotle was fun to work at 3 years ago, everyone got a long, management cared about their crew members. Recently, there has been a lot of changes in terms of managing and just the work culture in general and I do not think it is beneficial to the crew members."
good,"Working at chipotle is a fun and fast paced experience that will sure keep you on your toes no matter what the role, when given time moving upon in the company is encouraged , Overall advancement in the company is possible for those that want it."
good,"Great culture and environment to work in. Usually very busy, but that makes the hours whiz by. So long as the management is good, I see no reason why someone would not work there. Unfortunately I didn’t have the best experience with the management- after i accepted the job offer i was rarely put on the schedule, which severely impacted my income. Addressed the manager about it a few times, ultimately she wasn’t capable to handle the job. Still, a good job for high schoolers or college students"
good,"Not bad. Don't think I'd like to work there again, though. I didn't feel very welcome, I guess. But I enjoyed the work. My manager was a bit cold and intolerant. It was my first job and not enjoyable at all."
good,This was a nice first job to have. The managers were great and understanding to any changes in my schedule. There was plenty of opportunities for more hours on your schedule or less if you needed time off. A lot of teamwork. This job grew my customer service skills as well.
good,"sure coworkers are fun and nice to talk to, but customers are rude and complaining about everything most like we try but everything we make is fresh so like the wait is worth it"
good,"very meticulous food handling and cleanliness. Slow paced environment but always perfect customer service, clean food, and teamwork. Very meticulous work ethic to make sure the establishment looks perfect."
good,"Chipotle promotes from within, has a great culture if followed by management, and you eat free! However, managers work lots of hours and are not paid as they should be! The amount of time spent on things like food prep, training, and implementing the culture is a huge undertaking for management; and with this company's earnings, they should definitely think about pay raises."
good,"Daily chipotle roles included; being a customer service representative, a line server, the cook, preparing food, washing dishes or general cleaning. I learned how to work well as a team in a leadership position. My experience at chipotle was very positive and friendly; the best part is the people. Would recommend."
good,"Very good place to work, good management, very friendly people. Not a stressful place .I defenitely recommend to a friend to work for chipotle mexican grill."
good,"I have a love and hate relationship with this job but it’s more love than hate. I love my coworkers and the people that come in (sometimes). I like my management, they’re not too bad and will correct you if you do something wrong or not good but they will never yell at you."
good,"I love what the company stands for. The team I worked with really became my second family, but I feel like I need to move on and see what else is out there for me."
good,Overall I love working at Chipotle. I was told I would get close to 40 hours but I only get aroung 20 - 25 right now while also trying to pay my rent. I have to ask for peoples shifts often. You can't get over time. Its not possible to live comfortably/independently with this job only.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Working at Chipotle teaches you a lot of lessons. It is good experience for character building, skill building, and working towards a goal. Being able to work with a supportive team, management and crew alike, really makes the difference."
good,"Under proper management I could see this being a great job for young people that want a fast-paced and friendly workplace. The benefits are nice, as they offer health, dental, and vision insurance. They also offer tuition reimbursement or help directly pay for select online colleges after a year with the company. The free employee meal can help a person save a lot of money, and they offer a 50% discount on one entreé that can be used daily. My main complaints about the job were their tendency to make you take your lunch break very early into your shift, and that they seem to put most of the work off onto a select few individuals. Most of my issues with the job had to do with poor management because Chipotle decided to replace our GM's who had worked their way up with outside hires that had no notion of how things work in the company. Overall though, it was a decent enough place to work for minimum wage."
good,Chipotle was well organized and I became good at multi-tasking. I had friends at work and I always felt welcome. The hardest part was keeping up with the crowds and encountering rude customers.
good,"I had the pleasure to work with awesome co workers. Management wasn't that awesome, but the culture is what got me through the hard days. Always an uplifting team. I got min wage with whatever benefits. Its a good first job."
good,"I've worked for Chipotle for some time now, and what I have found is that as long as you show initiative to learn you have the opportunity to move up and make a respectable amount of money. The job requires no prior job history which makes it a great chioce for a first job. However, I will say with honesty that this job is HIGHLY demanding. It is very fast pace and there is always something that needs to be done. I would say that after I have aquired a few pay raises at Chipotle, I feel a little bit more comfortable with the amount of work I do on a nightly basis. Even though this company hires people in at $9.50, if you move to prep and grill, you will DEFINITELY deserve more. -THAT'S JUST HOW IT IS- "
good,"Work on the grill typically started around 8 in the morning and ended at 4 in the afternoon. I was responsible for making everything hot on the line. The managers were usually understanding of my problems but were not always the fastest at responding to them. It was such a busy location, and breaks were staggered by the managers, so crew members did not have a whole lot of time to get to know one another. The hardest part of the job would have to be the opening process and making sure you had all of the food ready in time. The most enjoyable part of the job was preparing the food and getting the evening shift people ready for a productive day at work."
good,"Great learning and growth opportunities.  Teaches basic culinary skills and proper care for ingredients.  Fast paced, high energy environment with happy crew members."
good,"I worked at Chipotle mainly as a food prep. My job consisted of preparing mostly produce for the morning and night shift. I became so good at making guacamole, my manager would brag to the other branch managers that he had the best prep guy."
good,"Began this job may 2018 my senior year. It was actually pretty nice for a first job in Highschool. The staff I started off with was actually okay not the best. management was much better at the time. Eventually we got a new manager so i honestly feel like the place has fallen apart. As you get to know everyone and everyone is comfortable with the new person, you begin to notice there’s drama and literally everyone talks about everyone. The general manager is also pretty drama infactuated and I feel as if they also show a lot of favoritism. Management seems like they’re afraid of employees which is sad, and some employees even refuse to do certain things so they’d tell someone else to do it. As time passes you also notice everyone does what they want and times are hardly followed here and there. The manager literally hires ever and anyone, and the new hires do no no shows, call off A LOT, everyone is really personal about their lives from normal to sexual and need I mention all of management are in their LATE 20’s so honestly the place is for kids (exaggerating). They don’t care what you do just serve the customers and clear the store."
good,"Chipotle, in and of itself; is a great job because the employee usually has something to do. However, it takes a certain type of person to manage people under the stress of an 80 person dinner rush. Above average pay and incredibly valuable life experience."
good,Chipotle has treated me well in the fact that I was able to become a manager at my own pace. Fast development and experience with right management. a vision to follow and standards to be achieved within the company and flexible scheduling.
good,Chipotle is a fast paced work environment that both advances your work ethic and customer service skills. The company prides itself on its customer service and expects nothing less than exceptional performance.
good,"Working at chipotle taught me a couple things. It taught me a lot of Patience. A typical day at work was pretty busy normally, but the stuff that was working with me made the days manageable. The most enjoyable part on the job was the the teamwork and cooperation that everybody had with each other and the hardest part on the job was when rush hour would hit and the store would become pretty hectic at times. But all in all working at Chipotle was a pretty good experience."
good,"Stressful, fast paced. Great relationships with co workers. Always short staffed so every shift was very hectic and stressful. Team work was a must. Customer service must be great"
good,"Chipotle as a whole company was a fantastic experience, I learned a lot and was provided a great opportunity. They could have had more direction and been less political. But overall my experience was well worth it."
good,"Started as a crew member washing dishes and worked my way up to apprentice general manager in less than six months from first promotion. Pay is decent considering the work but dependent on location. Work is hard. It's physically and mentally demanding and exhausting, especially for management. Teamwork is paramount. Often volunteered own time to ensure restaurant success but was also ""required"" (read: expected) to work days off and overtime, often without pay. Free food was nice, actually lost weight working there."
good,Able to train and motivate employees to reach higer levels of sucess. Had a chance to help start up a new market as a training manager of 7 stores and help in the growth.
good,"Fast paced environment with multiple things to keep track off. Always on your feet, word day feels fast and quick. With the perfect team everything gets knocked down with 100% efficiency."
good,"Good work experience  , i saved money to get a car the job is great just bad management and bad communication, thekr restaurant is clean just bad management and communication"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"i loved working for chipotle. Every person there was nice and friendly, i quite working for them after i got a new job, management was nice enough to hire me back. i was not getting enough our at current job so i worked 2 jobs for at least 3 months."
good,This is a good place to work with a lot of good team players. Fgjkkm bc lmvsx. L gday stikdsvkll. Jk da sbjm. Jjjcgmn. Jhvnm. Jjlc jhfchj.  Mjghjlj hh
good,"As the Service Manager, my responsibilities included making sure the guests had a great experience by maintaining the restaurant at a high capacity. This included maintaining the store by repairing or replacing any parts that needed. Also, I would make sure the store's money was counted and all in order for weekly operations. Another aspect of my title is employee life. I would hire and train future candidates. I took care of payroll and schedules. As well as managing the staff on their daily tasks. My final duty was to promote my store and get sales. This included canvassing around the city, create and handle all promotions, and finally offering to participate in community events in order to spread the word. In doing so, my stores ranking nationally was number 9 overall out of 2200."
good,"Poor Management leads to every problem the Livermore location has. This makes it hard for everyone on the team to operate efficiently and effectively. When things run smooth, they are quite enjoyable"
good,It’s a very fun and friendly place to work you get to meet a lot of nice people. My only trouble I had with working at chipotle is that it’s to much work for the hours and amount you get paid.
good,"A typical day at work is I prepare food that will be needed at the front for the line. We usually prepare this food early in the day when we open, so throughout the day we can be occupied or needed somewhere else. For example, cleaning the lobby, cashier, preparing entree for customers, taking out trash and cleaning dishes. What I learned is always be polite to customers no matter how they approach themselves to you."
good,The job is a good job but it does not allow overtime and the hours are not enough for a decent paycheck to take care of me and my daughter and pay my rent
good,"Chipotle was my favorite job, it shaped my work ethic immensely. I was a child just out of high school when I worked here. They helped train me to start into their management program, and I was also, along with the team in charge of hiring, firing, and promoting. Very structured workplace!"
good,Educational and fast paced. The work was a lot to do but could be learned to do quickly with practice. However managers were similar in young age and did not much know what they were doing.
good,"As a first job, I think this was the right choice. I learned more skills in the ""working community"" than I would anywhere else. I learned the importance of hospitality and gained more communication skills. I learned how to work better with others as a team and gave constructive criticism. The most enjoyable part of chipotle was the customer experience, being able to communicate with customers and fulfill their needs. The workplace was positive, supportive and helpful throughout the day. The management team could use some altercations but other than that it is a great working experience for those looking for a first job."
good,"Although it wasnt my type of job but i wanted to try as it was my first job usa."
good,"Friendly staff and management "
good,"Usually, mornings are busy. One must keep everything restocked and cleaned for the following customer who walks in. It is expected for workers to clean right after a customer leaves the area. They are focused about the customer service. We are thought how to receive a customer with a smile and how to make sure they leave satisfied with how they were treated on the short amount of time they spent at the restaurant. Management is constantly coming up with new ideas on how to better themselves and their teams."
good,"Working at chipotle was actually my first job. I learned a lot they teach u a lot of skills . But this job is not for you if you don’t like to work fast paced. Chipotle cooks everything fresh as well as prepared daily ,vegetables and  meat are prepared all day and everything is basically in a time schedule . You either catch on or u don’t. I worked there little over a year and I will say chipotle had a very nice culture and I was willing to move up into management there and something that I really loved about chipotle is that they promote from within there store. But even tho I was highly qualified for a hire position I got passsed over twice because management choose thier friends ."
good,"A typical day at work is stressful at times during the day. You have many people around you not putting in as much work, slacking which puts you in the position to finish or do what needs to still be done."
good,I loved working for Chipotle but I didn't see myself having a career with them. We all treated each other like family. There was never a dull moment and even when there was problems we all stuck up for each other.
good,"I really liked working here some of the time but definitely didn’t at some points. during busy hours when 15 people were in line it  easily got very stressful (but still manageable)."
good,"Chipotle is fun to work at and I got lucky enough to have co-workers that made busy nights fun."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Not much to say pay is mediocre, leadership is from within so can be knowledgeable, district managers however are pretty arrogant and not intertwined with the culture with their stores."
good,"I came in not knowing anything but eager to learn everything. Moving between all stations which include Grill, Prep , Line , and cashier . Management was okay wish they would of cared more about in house promotion."
good,Relaxed yet fast paced. Management was kind and informative on how to manage all job duties in the restaurant. Pay rate for the type of work was also fair. I would recommend this as a good job to have while going to school/ persuing other goals.
good,I love my chipotle family but sometimes the job can get so difficult and stressful. with all the stress it’s very hard to balance out my home life and my work life
good,It was good when you have a good crew that works together to get things done. Great food  and great tips. The people were nice and I had a great crew.
good,The people I worked with at Chipotle were all kind and welcoming. This made it easy to communicate and get the job done together at an efficient pace.
good,"Good job for quick cash and can move up easily if you desire and work hard, the rules have been constantly changing since the year ive been there, and tbey will fire you for very minor offenses."
good,"Pros: The atmosphere of the workplace is really nice. They push you to succeed."
good,Chipotle was a good company to work for.  They are in a huge transition now moving from Denver to California.  I would expect them to take a year or two to get their support structure good again.
good,"Chipotle at the ground level is  a great job. You learn how to work in a kitchen, knife skills, food safety, etc. The company has a weird cult like following which i often find myself getting into because the food is really truly the best fast food out there. The higher ups can often be too nit picky but in a store its honestly a great place to work."
good,"Used to be really fun to work here before management went downhill. The best part of the job is the people, and the hardest part of the job is dealing with customers (what job doesn't have this though?)"
good,"As a Facilities Specialist you will be assigned 30 to 40 stores which you are required to maintain all aspects of. You will learn troubleshooting and maintenance on electrical, plumbing, HVAC, and restraunt equipment."
good,Good place to work while I was pregnant and then again when returning to work. Learned a lot and stayed busy. I was able to make relationships with co-workers and loyal customers. Good overall experience.
good,"Was a great place to work if you love high volume food service.  Discounts on lunch, fresh ingredients prepped daily and unusually a good mix of personalities from customers and employees"
good,"It is a very stressful job with rude customers, and it will really test your patience."
good,"I liked working at Chipotle, but I don't think it's a place I would return to unless I really had to. I liked my coworkers a lot, but the work was hard, tedious, and frustrating. It requires a lot of patience, teamwork, and late hours."
good,"I did lots of work there , they helped me out and understood me , but sometimes workplace was unfair . They wouldn’t really take in consideration towards when you wanted to work and to when you couldn’t"
good,I love how culture differences were embrace. No judgement zone and I love that! I loved learning new things and keeping up with another language. I met so many awesome friends.
good,"Fast paste work, have to be able to multi task to be a successful crew member. The job is stressful at times because the lack of good management and responsible employees."
good,"Chipotle had many rush hours that were  very fast paced, but then there would be a few hours when it would be very slow. You always were provided with a free meal on shift, which is definitely a greta benefit."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Chipotle in Cranston was good until a change in manager and this made things more difficult because the manager who took over was not prepared to be one. In general great place to work.
good,The hours were long. But the fast pace of the job with the awesome people I worked besides made work not just bearable but fun. The work was hard but always felt rewarding.
good,It was always a good time being in there despite the busy hours. The managers really put down a cool culture for all the workers where they could enjoy working there but at the same time be focused on the daily goal.
good,"My location was very busy so working here was a little crazy. Seasoned employees and managers and employees who actually want to work help boost the morale and make it work. I wouldn’t choose a slow, boring job over this type of job anyday."
good,I really liked the people I worked with and my managers were laid back. I loved he food and the environment was modern and young. Can't go wrong with their food either.
good,"Chipotle is a hard work environment, you have to be willing to do multiple tasks and work hard every day, they also pay a good amount. This was my first job and it was great. You can get promoted all the way up into General Manager and make a career."
good,it's an awesome experience working at chipotle. the staff are very welcoming and very helpful. you develop strong bonds with co-works and new friendships.
good,"Chipotle is a good job to have especially being a college student, but the management is terrible. It's usually a younger person so it is biased and unfair. The manager chooses when to follow Chipotle's corporation rules. The overall experience isn't complicated at all, it's management that makes the work place difficult to get used to."
good,"Chipotle ia a good place to work for when you don""t have kids.and you have no social life.They have very high expectation .and take there culture very seriously."
good,"Chipotle was an extremely busy restaurant and was quick paced. The money was good especially as a high schooler at the time. It was a good first job, paid well, and was good about time off as long as you turned it in at least two weeks prior to."
good,I learned the importance of time management and how to get things done in a timely manner. The management was so so she could have been way more organized and better engage with her employees instead of picking out favorites. The culture was great I liked all the people that I had worked with. The hardest part of the job was getting all my work done in a timely manner and helping customers out at the same time.
good,"Working at Chipotle is an experience, if there long enough you eventually receive benefits, get a raise, and can slowly move up the corporate ladder to becoming a GM. You get a 15 minute paid break and although it can be stressful is well worth the money you can make."
good,"The job was great, I learned a lot about working as a team. They really concentrate on everyone communicating the entire shift. it was the cleanest place I have ever worked. They strive to push everyone to learn all they can and move up while employed. Almost all of the managers were great people and enjoyed working with them. The hours weren't enough to keep up with bills and they pay wasn't the best."
good,"it will always be a crazy day, and there will always be a challenge to meet. i learn to cook and manage a team of 12 or more people per shift. Management was good at my first location."
good,"I enjoyed working there for such a long time. It is a great work environment to learn not only about others, but yourself too. The management does seem to play favorites at every store I have worked at, and that does get in the way of being able to move up within the company at times."
good,It was easy after a while its fast paced which is good for the customers and a very good environment. It was very good to work there because everyone is understanding.
good,"Overall enjoyable place to work. Everyone is friends, and the time goes by quick. Can be very busy during lunch and dinner hours. Would recommend to people looking to pick up extra shifts."
good,fast paced job with high expectations from their eployees but its a very good and accepting job the have a great vision and culture and strive to be the best at what they do
good,"I had a problem  which caused me to be not happy to come to work, but I have to tough it out because I need the money. Customers are always awesome and make the day easier since there's a lot of regulars that come there"
good,Chipotle can be a cool place to work as long as the crew members are fun to be around. If you are a dude count on being in the back washing dishes. There are opportunities to advance as long as you ask to learn every position and get pretty good at it. Scheduling is also very flexible.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Working at chipotle has been quite the experience, I've been there 3 years now, it can be difficult to advance into management unless you are liked by the current managers, the overall culture though makes you not want to leave because you form close bonds with coworkers in and outside of work"
good,Chipotle once took a chance on me and trained me to become a good manager. Now they are firing me for no reason. Good promotions though. Good atmosphere at the right store.
good,"As my first job, I would say working at Chipotle was fairly easy. The managers where I worked at were all caring and tried to push us to become a restaurateur store. Sometimes they would pull each of us aside individually and ask us questions about the restaurant and how we can improve on it. The coworkers I had were very fun to work with and always made working there fun and easy for me. However, working the nightshift was probably the worst just because of the cleaning afterwards. I was in charge of cleaning the cash register/ bathrooms the nights I worked, and those bathrooms can get brutal. I tell my friends every time that the worst part at working in Chipotle was cleaning the bathroom stalls. Other than that, it was a pretty easy job. I was always on my feet, lines rarely ended, I had to make sure the lobby was clean at all times and stocked with utensils and straws, and also make sure I give the exact change back to the customers. As a line cook, I made sure I portioned correctly (4 oz.) and made sure the line was always clean."
good,"i enjoyed the time i worked there and the culture, also has a lot off advancement opportunities if you apply yourself but the management while i was there was less than professional."
good,Food prep is a working position that requires you good time management skills. Due to the fast-paced environment you pretty much become a supporter class.
good,"Es un lugar alegre,acojedor salario bastante bueno"
good,Typical work day--you are assigned your task for the day and are expected to execute in a timely matter. Management is pretty good the work culture is even better.
good,"A typical day at work involved coming in and relieving my cashier, taking care of floor duties (sweeping, cleaning tables, stocking the refreshments and condiments) then proceeding to man the register until near closing time where during breaks with customers, closing cleaning would occur."
good,I was hired on as a kitchen manager until a new store was  built in the area I lived. The plan was for me to become GM of new location. The store finish date kept pushed back so much that I had to find job closer to me. Chipotle was a great and fun place to work. All-the staff and management enjoyed their jobs and made for a great work culture.
good,I absolutely loved my job until they decided to switch managers and brought a new GM and assistant who were completely unprepared for their roles. The storw went downhill very quickly. Bad management will destroy a team of exceptional employees very quickly.
good,"I emjoyed My time at chipotle. My crew was very fun and we all had a close bond, especially my boss. I would Love to do it again. Most definitely a memorable experience"
good,"It was a great experience , I just feel like I need to do something different in my life . I’ve learned so much skills, not only with cooking and handling a knife, but deposits, inventories, food orders, invoices, food safety etc."
good,Good until I was being harassed by the GM and his sister who were both in places of power. They hired their friends and family and they ganged up on me for I am a loner.
good,I would arrive at work at 630 am. I would then start by looking at my reports so I know how the business did. From 8am to 1015 we would prep all the food for the day. Then 1045am to 10pm we would be open. While we are open I taught and developed my managers. I learned how to run  a business and maintained a great training culture. I over saw 4 managers. The workplace culture was respectful and fun place to be at. The hardest part of the job was teaching people how to truly care for the business as I do and hire great people.
good,"Chipotle is a solid first job . My hours are always promised , the management is great, and the crew members make work amazing . The work environment is so amazing . The only thing that makes me want to leave is because I need a better job for my living situation. I only make so much at chipotle and I feel like they aren't willing to give me opportunities to grow . Overall I feel like it's holding me back so I'm very interested in something new . I've been working at chipotle for 4years now and I feel like it's a been a great long run , but I'm ready to move on so I can better myself ."
good,My managers were some of the most frustrating aspects of my job all the way from crew up to GM. I have learned more about myself than I thought possible from working here and being challenged in a positive (and sometimes not so positive) way.
good,It is a lot if work fun but stressful but it all comes fown to management because they dont plan out how many people we need for the day correctly and that easily ruins a shift.
good,"Overall, working at Chipotle is a good starting job for people looking to start in the food service industry. They are very strict about food safety and the managers are very hands on in helping if there are any problems or if people are behind due to being busy. Most of the managers are promoted from within, but it is a very long process to get to management because there are limited spots. If you are sick you are given 3 paid sick days, and there is an option to enroll in their healthcare plan."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle means signing in and washing your hands as soon as you get there, then starting your duties immediately. Working is fast paced and it's a necessity to have good hearing because the atmosphere is very loud and busy. The management has changed drastically with new managers, GM's, and employees. The person in charge of scheduling has changed frequently, and my hours went from a steady, reliable schedule of about 25 hours/week, to less than 10/week. The hardest part of the job is being efficient and quick about the work. The best part of the job is the bond coworkers make with each other and the regular customers."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"A typical day at Chipotle started with getting the restaurant ready for guests, wiping and sanitizing all surfaces, food prep work, cleaning floors, stocking and getting everything in its place that we may need during the peak hours of the day such as lunch or dinner. From there the position was customer service based with cash handling and ensuring food standards."
good,"Worked there for just shy of two years. Looking back, there are a lot of fond memories working there, also you develop impressive cooking skills even though you may start with zero kitchen experience. A lot of your enjoyment depends on who you're working with, typically enjoyed my managers but my fellow crew members felt like they would rather be somewhere else and put in zero effort or easily get annoyed."
good,"The work day was fast paced, and the environment is very clean. Our number one priority was an ultimate guest experience! The co workers and managers were very flexible with scheduling and were very understanding about issues that may occur."
good,Chipotle is a great job opportunity. Chipotle is a very busy environment they are awesome they have good 'plain' ingredients that make up some delicious meals.
good,I loved Chipotle and their goal to change the way people see and eat fast food. The management wasn't always the best and the pay could have been a little more fair. I would consider working for this company again.
good,"I love the standards the company has and how great everybody worked with each other. As is the case with any company, whether good employees stay or leave all depends on management. I've had strict managers and it worked out amazing!"
good,"I loved that we can easily talk to our managers about anything that's going on. We have a question about anything that we are working that can easily explain on to why we do it and why it benefit us in any way,"
good,"A typical day at work varied in stress level depending on the time. Closer to our busiest hours were stressful, but other times were pleasant. The managers hired when I began working were amazing. After some time, they got moved to different restaurants or changed jobs, and got replaced by some managers that were not as good to work with."
good,Well Chipotle was one of my first manger jobs they give a very intensive training that help me to advance my career in the F&B field. Lots of growth opportunities if you have the desire and work hard this a good place to start your career
good,A typical day at work would require cleaning and keeping the restaurant clean and ready for service. Training new comers and providing excellent costumer service
good,"Most wonderful restaurant experience when everything is working correctly and managers actually care. But when the people aren’t putting in their best it can feel like your drowning. High standards, great career advancement, and awesome benefits, but I wasn’t being paid enough to run the restaurant to the standards put in place."
good,"Chipotle is a very quick-paced enviroment. Our job was to prepare the food, greet and handle the customers as they came in and out of the store. I learned how to count money correctly and how to move quickly."
good,Nothing against the company. Just a lot of hard work for so little money. Insane hours and the managers try their best to better fit all the busy situations.
good,All in all I loved my team and all the friendships that came with my job at chipotle. It was very fast paced and there was ALWAYS something to do. The 50+ hours just became too much for me in the end.
good,Always busy at work from 6:00am to 12:00am. There was never a dull moment. Having the right management though will make a difference in how the day will run.
good,fun and fast paced place to work. Each day always had a new challenge and a new opportunity for growth.  I truly enjoyed working here and would reccommend it to a friend
good,The work isn't too hard unless you're working the grill. The only bad thing I would say about the job is the people on the line serving the food make the same amount as the people cooking and prepping the food. If you don't care about moving up as a cook and just want to get paid. Work the line.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a job especially if it's there first job. It's very relaxing and has a chill vibe to it. All the employees are friendly.
good,You only move up and love working here if you are willing to put in hard work.Every day is something different but i love it and thrive under pressure.
good,"Chipotle can be a very fun work environment, with wonderful coworkers. However, it is also a challenging and stressful job that rarely has enough people needed to smoothly run a shift."
good,"Everything was great, most people working with you made the environment fun and friendly. Some managers are only there to tell you what to do and do it, chipotle had to be your life outside of work. Some places had you work while sick"
good,"A typical day at work is very fast paced. Theres almost always a line of people and you can really get to know the people that come into the restaurant. While working there i learned a lot, considering it was my first job. I learned all about how a regular work environment work and functions. The management was really the only downfall of this company sadly. They never responded to really any other form of communication rather than talking to them in person. Really the hardest part of working there was keeping up with everything, but after a while it got a lot easier, then it was more hard to not have fun and get to know the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job, as i have mentioned previously is really just getting to know everyone on the work force and talking with the customers and getting to have light fun conversations."
good,the way chipotle visions their company is amazing. they set their goals high. love the company but not management .its always fast paced good environment. they always care about your well being. very helpful with hours.
good,Chipotle is an amazing company to work for as long as you are not in management. the management role is demanding and they except you to make your work life more important then you family. When restaurants are out of food you are expected to stay longer then your shift to retrieve the food with out pay.
good,"I worked for Chipotle for 3 years. When I left, I had seniority which was nice because I felt valued. However, after I left, I realized just how underpaid I was considering everything I did. You do learn a lot, like different kitchen skills. While I enjoyed my time there, I surely would not go back. Good benefits, especially if you're a student, you get tuition reimbursement!"
good,Working here you can tell how much the supervisors care for the crew members as well with the customer. Everyone is always so easy going and very encouraging.
good,hard to make enough to actually live off of. hard to actually get promoted and clearly a place where it is a popularity contest just to advance with the company.
good,Chipotle was the perfect college job. They worked very well with my school schedule and they were very lenient with giving people the days off they requested. The environment was very laid back.
good,Great experience in preparing fresh food for each day and doing things the right way. This is a clean and fast paced work environment and is a great model for the fast food industry.
good,I liked working here when it first opened but as time when on the stress levels became to much for me. I had small kids to take care of it wasn't flexible enough to allow me to take care of them or appointments. There was a very high turn over rate. Management was fair most days it depends on who was there that day.The job however is good for students and people that want a part-time job.
good,Relying on other people is a small part of working in chipotle in the PM hours. Everyone had to be done to be able to clock out. Could never leave a co-worker behind which is a good thing.
good,There are many positions at Chipotle and they all require a certain degree of skill which can be attained through training. Acquiring such skills open up many opportunities within or outside of the business.
good,"Always working and having fun."
good,"Working here was definitely a great experience. Only issue I had was I was always there because we constantly fired and hired, people quit as well very often. The managers are dictators they just give you task that they wouldnt do themselves."
good,"Chipotle was a really nice place,  The reason why I love chipotle is because I don't like working in fast food restaurant, but overall Chipotle is a really good place."
good,The typical day was very stressful a lot of chaos but we always seemed to get the job done. We had a very clean enviroment which helped a lot everything was neat and organized.
good,Love the food and the pay isn't great. They want you to do too much work for the pay. The treat the trainees like slaves. Overall depends on the team.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"i learned how to train other crew members  and learn a lot abut a clean work environment and team building skills. time expectancy "
good,"the job is very hard on your body, a good place for a person in high school or in college to work to pay rent and other things. Could be good for a first job."
good,Good for your first job for customer service experience. It was good food and great team atmosphere while working. All i would change is how the company spread hours amongst employees and re-evaluated management often.
good,Chipotle is a fast paced environment with a strong core team mentality. Chipotle as a company holds values employees are expected to practice on a daily basis. The job most of the time isn't too physically demanding but can tend to be consuming with further advancement opportunities. Expected to be a career not a job.
good,"When you visit the Nationally known Mexican Grill one thing that you can instant see is the Culture. It's the great food, amazing experience, awesome people and opportunity to advance. However there are certain locations where the lines are blurred and instead of empowering people management tends to suppress and push people against each other to a tiring point. It's hard to get pass this but if you can play there game then it is a place you can flourish and don't get me wrong there are incredible people and most exceptions to Service Managers and General Managers, I've worked at two locations giving me the knowledge to give an opinion from seeing a great place on the right track then going to a place that's hanging on by a thread where your General Manager rather targets you and people who think like you instead of pull everyone together and empower them to achieve and uphold the high standards that make Chipotle a great place to work and fantastic place to eat."
good,Chipotle was a great place to work and the management did a great job of creating that type of environment. The customers were easy to get along with and the tasks weren't difficult at all.
good,"The company in and of its self is great, they have a great vision, just the managers don't always have your best interest at heart. Very two faced and secretive"
good,"Différents types d’horaires sont proposés , l'ouverture du magasins et la fermeture, toujours être très méticuleux sur l'hygiène et sur l’accueil clients ,règles très stricte mais ambiance agréables."
good,Lots of good people across the organization.  Ability to work on your interests and strengths as there is plenty of work to go around.  Chips and guac delivered every Thursday!
good,"Good job with fair pay, but was laid off unexpectedly. It is a very quick-paced environment but everything was very clean and organized but they hired too many people so they laid me off without any notice."
good,Long days at work. You learn a lot about how to make the food. Culture is not sustainable at all. Harder art is that no matter how much you do for them they don't see that. The most enjoyable part is the customers.
good,very easy to move up in the company. they give you the right tools and the right training when starting. My co workers were the high light of me working there.
good,"I had a great time working for this company. I left to begin working primarily at CVS Health. The job was great, and my co-workers were amazing. I didn't fully agree with some management decisions, however."
good,"Somewhat fun, very busy at times though. Some of the workers are kind and cooperative. Management is very on top of things and organized. It is a pretty positive environment."
good,"Usually during lunch and dinner rushes, there's plenty of things that you need to keep track of to stay on top of those rushes. Gotta stay on top of them."
good,"I really enjoyed working at chipotle, it was fast pace but everyone in the workplace are so kind and loving and make you feel welcomed from the moment you're hired. Time always goes by fast."
good,"This is a nice place to work, the atmosphere was always pleasant. I will work over the summer there anytime. Management was always helpful, and there when you need them. Working here exposed me to different ethnic groups and the food was awesome."
good,"A day working Chipotle was good and very fast pace which I could handle, but management was terrible. I learned how to keep up and have confidence with myself. The management was very terrible, accused of false things and was talked to rudely at times. The culture there was good and felt just like they described it. The hardest part of the job would be cleaning up and sanitizing afterwards because you had such a limited amount of time. The enjoyable part of the job was greeting the customers and meeting new people."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Very good job all around. Pay was great, and the other team memembers were great. Had frequent verbal confrontations with a BLM supporter manager who would frequently verbally brerate me in front of me and behind my back because my father was a cop. Left after upper management refused to do anything."
good,"it is a good job when the restaurant is not busy, but the management would send you home if there are not a lot of customers expected. they make sure to get the most out of you. really have to work hard to get promoted."
good,"I absolutely love Chipotle because of the people I work with as well as the customer base. It is fast paced and flexible, and the management team are very understanding. Everybody works together, helping each other to get the job done. Chipotle is made up of a group of top performers empowered to achieve high standards.Because of the awesome management and training team I can honestly say that the hardest part of my job was learning were to find every thing."
good,"it was an experience and i learned a lot from it but it is a lot of work. its easy but hard, its fun but things can get seriously busy."
good,"a great place to work if you really love fast pace working, everyone loves chipotle, so you have to move fast and constantly prep, and clean, but for lunch you can have one item on the menu for free."
good,"This job has taught me a lot about time management, and working under pressure. It has taught me to be a leader, and how to better communicate with people."
good,"Typical workday is a rush sometimes overwhelming, but I capable of handling multiple task. This job has taught me how to handle multiple projects at once. The management could be better. Co-workers are a little different each day you never know. Hardest part is trying to keep everyone together when it's a rush. Most enjoyable is that the people were a family."
good,Chipotle gave me my first experience in the work force. I learned and developed many skills to Customer Service and serving food. I have made many good relationships with my co-workers and managers and I have learned so much from them!
good,I worked at a few different locations. They were all almost exactly the same. Pay rate was great. Employees horrible customers horrible and very rude. Management was horrible at all the locations I worked at.
good,"Working for chipotle is more than just a job they except a lot out of you, but it is a very rewarding restaurant to work in its a great first job because they teach you everything you need to know. You will do a lot and you will learn a lot its not the easiest job in the world but it has a great culture and they help pay for your tuition and schooling as long as you maintain a decent GPA."
good,"It was a good place to work at first. I liked the people, the hours are fairly flexible, and I really enjoyed the environment of do excellent work and help others get better. Chipotle did inspire me to truly care about what I do and made me want to help others get better. Managers made an effort to connect with you and help you develop always. "
good,"This was a interesting job. I've never did a job to where I was actually making the food. I didn't care about cooking so much until I started here. Chipotle believes in being yourself. Bringing your own individuality to the table and excelling at your highest. I can dig that. The only issue about working here was management. It was very ill managed. We didn't have much of an understanding because she was kind of rude and unapproachable. I didn't get a lot of training but I am a quick learner so that didn't bother me too bad. The work environment in itself was cool, but the manager in some ways was unprofessional. I felt uncomfortable, and I felt this job wasn't showing my full potential. Overall, this was a good job experience. It taught me speed, efficiency, and tested my pressure level. It showed me that I could be a manager and I can handle pressure! The fastest I've ever had to move was working at Chipotle"
good,"i love chipotle.  it made me the hard worker i am today, great culture, rewarding work, lots of life skills will be learned"
good,Great place to work for opportunites toa dvance. fun and constantly challenging. Hard to balance work and home life. Co workers are rgouips of people you want to work with.
good,"First and foremost , this job is very demanding . Most likely you'll have a lot to do and it all needs to be done now . If you don't work well under pressure this isn't for you. If there's anything that will make you hate your job it's the customers. They can be ... difficult, to say the least. And ""the customer is always right"" , which can get really annoying because majority of the time they are wrong lol. Otherwise, I really enjoyed working at Chipotle. You got this family vibe (families have their ups and downs) and everyone was pretty cool. Scheduling was very flexible; they worked with you . Plus free meals , everyone loves free food . On the bad side , the way I was let go was shocking and pretty shady in my opinion. Usually when someone gets terminated, there was some sort of discussion or warning beforehand right ? Yea well for me it seems like they woke up on the "" I wanna fire somebody today"" side of the bed."
good,"I liked working here but the only thing was there wasn't really any flexible hours "
good,It's was ok working at chipotle in the beginning but as time went on they started to cut hours. It's a fun fast paced workplace.
good,"Sharp learning curve, vey fast paced, multi-tasking needed to advance, mostly helpful management staff, learned kitchen skills, management skills, customer service."
good,It was a honor working there. I met great people and really took pride in my work and making customers happy. Also I enjoyed the one free meal a day. Also there was always something to do. You were never not busy.
good,Typical day at Chipotle can be fun to some hectic for others. Always busy on your feet and serving delicious safe food to customers. Learned a lot about creating a special people culture and performing excellent business results.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"This job is very fast-paced, so one must make sure they can multitask before committing themselves to a team full of people dedicated to make the restaurant the best it can be! I love working with a team of teenagers as well as young managers. My bosses and coworkers are all very kind and friendly. It is a challenging job, respecting that it is full of people the entire time we are open every single day, but that doesn't stop me from trying because I am dedicated to elevating my team."
good,My experience working at Chipotle was overall a great working experience. My fellow employees were very friendly and the customers were usually friendly as well. The food is amazing and the pay was not bad either. I loved working at Chipotle!
good,"Working at Chipotle was extremely fast-paced but enjoyable at the same time. You never got stuck doing just one thing and the managers as well as the team members recognize your potential and based on the effort you put in, they choose the area in which they feel you'd be the strongest."
good,Before peak the pre shift with the team was fun. We performed a few exercises for energy some days.There is always a great rush of customers every shift. Action packed practice opportunities with your team.
good,"A heavy amount of work is given to you on a daily basis. The smallest things are pointed out, yet not much positive feedback is given from your team. The team and managers are friendly, but chose favorites. The only way to move up quickly is be a personal favorite. I worked at many places, but they expect so much out of you for so little pay."
good,I would come one and fry chips and set up my station and take everyones order who came in and i would pass them on to my salsa person as i was on tortilla.
good,Management needs some work but the flow of it all is great. I love the people that I get to work with everyday and all the new people I meet. I definitely will take a lot of skills from this job to future jobs.
good,Chipotle has a way of making the employees really care about their jobs. Opportunities for advancement are always there and customer care is their specialty.
good,Every station works hand and hand with each other. If one station does well we all do well. I like the scene of team spirit.
good,"Overall, I love the company--great mission, ideals, management, training. My co-workers made me eager to go to work every day! I loved being part of a team and helping improve my store with workers that became a second family to me. My only problem, like many of my co-workers, was being over-worked. As a full-time student I was incapable of working the 30-45 hour weeks I was regularly scheduled for. It's a very quick paced, high stress environment when busy (which is most of the time!) and was too much to handle. Though I left, I miss the company and still support their mission and my team. I'm proud of all that I have learned as an employee with the help of Chipotle!"
good,"The people and co- workers are good. The mangers have their moments, but try their best in their ability to meet high standards."
good,"Working at Chipotle has its pros and cons, as with any other job. I can say that I loved each and every person that I worked with. Although I enjoyed working there, management was lazy and a bit disorganized. My location actually got rid of the GM I worked with, and had to bring new managers in. I can't speak for all of the other locations!!! Despite the management, I learned so much from working here! I learned how to use a Point of Sales System, provide great customer service, and handle food safely. I found my time there both an enjoyable and valuable experience. The most enjoyable part of the job was my interaction with my co-workers and customers. The hardest part of the job was getting used to the way things were run. It can be a bit overwhelming, but I think this job is great for just about anyone that is in need of customer service experience and a fast paced work environment."
good,I enjoyed providing good customer service to customers for their satisfaction. Scheduled hours were not satisfactory due to poor labor. Co-workers were great to work with as we worked as a team.
good,I wasn't a big fan but I did appreciate the experience and knowledge I gained. It wasn't enough to support my self. It just seemed that everyone came and go.
good,"A day involved a morning of food preparation, serving and providing an exceptional, clean and friendly restaurant experience."
good,"Co workers were wonderful, however management needed improvement. More competence in scheduling. A lot of favoritism."
good,"Chipotle taught me patience and the ability to do five things at once, whether i have to take a order and answer the phone, or to smile and keep food coming down the line, the customers needs always need to be met in a timely fashion"
good,Everything is great working with chipotle great environment great culture positive goals great for growth and opportunities
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Great growing along side with my colleagues and develop while learning new skills.
good,Great opportunity for growth. Committed to changing the way people think about and eat fast food. Must be passionate about the company in order to excel.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I have been working for Chipotle for over two years and it help me out through tough spots in my life. The co-workers are fantastic; especially, when we encounter difficult situation in the work environment. This is a good part time job for someone who is in college or who came out of high school and needs to pay for books, and rent. It can be for who are serious who are working here in long-term who want to become of a manager for their own store. That provided dedication to the craft, completing each positions of the job, and have your crew members trust and support you into become a manager."
good,I have spent the last six years in the food industry. I started my position at Chipotle Mexican Grill as a crew member and during the six years have worked my way up to the General Manager position. I have worked with a multitude of different people and personalities. I have sharpened my customer service skills by sticking to the motto that the customer is always right.
good,"Chipotle is a good place to work when wanting to learn culinary skills. But as a long term career it is not worth it. They pay minimum wage and offer no benefits, yet expect you to work at a feverish pace for the scraps they give you."
good,"It was a good work environment for a while. Some of the managers were great to get along with. The other managers and head boss give favoritism to certain people and promote them knowing some employees work their hardest to try to get notice. The communication was seriously lacking and they would fire people without the proper reason why they would say you are a low performer knowing fully well that you work your hardest cover other peoples shifts, stay later than your scheduled shift to help them out. "
good,"Loved the people, the vision, but the company is all about growing within the company not growth within your individual self. Good for college students trying to go into the world of franchising. This is not a franchise but you could definitely learn a new way of ""Being a Boss"" from this work experience!"
good,A typical day at work consist of preppeing our ingredients fresh everyday. Making sure everything is ready for the customer rush when we open. My co workers are very cool frindly and uppbeat. There is no hard part to this job its verry fun and flexible.
good,"Teaching the younger crowd is awesome. Warm-ups would sometimes be up to them to pick the songs and help lead with me. Then from there we would go into which ever routine that we were working on whether it be Jazz, Hip Hop (1 of my favorites), Contemporary, or even military for the isolations and control. We would run it and in between have breaks depending on how long the class is will determine the length and frequency. At the end of the class we may do some groups or a freestyle session at the end of class just to remind them that having fun along with working hard is what will get them the best result. I've managed people before and throughout this process that was challenging for me at first, I've learned to notice how others learn and react to situations and the best part about teaching dance is seeing them succeed as if they were having the hardest time at first and seeing them blossom with all those personalities in the end. That's what makes it worth it and to give them a foundation."
good,"I worked prep most of the time so my day consisted of preparing all the food except for the meat and rice that would be used as the day moved along. Being the new guy I spent a lot of time doing dishes, the more time you put in each week at Chipotle really decides what job you get stuck with. Because I went to school full time I never really got out of dish work by working 3-4 days a week. I would usually work opening shift and I would often arrive on time but still have to wait 10 minuets before the manager would finally arrive and unlock the doors so I could get in and work. It would then be a mad dash to make up time before the lunch rush as getting the restaurant started takes a lot of time. The work always felt very rushed unless you worked closing shift. I was fortunate to work with a very supportive and very skilled group of people who could pick up slack when needed and support anyone new to the job. Which is good because there was a constant stream of new hires and fires or people just quitting. There were a good ten people who have been there for years (including managers) but there were always another 5 new people that would alternate shifts and seemingly pop in and out of existence. Chipotle isn't really a job for someone who wants to go to school and work, they will work their scedual around your study but if you put school first you'll feel left behind when it comes to promotions. I worked there for a good six months and have seen new hires become managers in half the time I worked there while I was still stuck doing dishes. If you want to do something other than"
good,I loved the company but the management team needed to learn how to work together. they did things off of feeling instead of proffesional. i helped out and trained people. my co workers got a lone for the most part no strong management no strong team.
good,Chipolte is all about creating and extraordinary experience for the customers as well as the crew members that work their.  Its a fast paced job full of fun and hard work.
good,really fun place to work at. fast paced. owner is an amazing guy with a great attitude. always willing to help not only at work but gets to know and care for his employees in a personal level without crossing the employee employer barrier. co-workers get along. it really is a great environment to work at.
good,"you rare always on the go, moving around at all times. Taking care of the people who come and go. you learn how to cook and serve food."
good,"as an employee, I enjoyed my experience working at chipotle. my job was secured and promises were always kept. Management did what was recommended  best for the work place. I loved my coworkers. It's like we all knew what each other needed. Chipotle wasn't really that hard of a job, the tasks were more time consuming but everything had to be done within a timely fashion."
good,"Hands on learning, free meals,  Co-workers are friendly, Management team sort of ""IFY"" at times, a lot of gossip. Productive and fast paced work environment."
good,"Working at Chipotle was a great experience! I learned lots from my management team as well as the team member's! While I worked there I was head cashier. I handled all cash transactions, credit cards, checks and cash."
good,"Up beast and fast paced environment, Work together as a team, Great customer service skills learned, along with manager skills, and leadership roles."
good,Loved coming into work and being able to impact people's lives. A great company to start with and had a wonderful learning experience.
good,"Working at Chipotle is a hectic job, but always a good experience. Constantly being hands-on and working with others make it fun."
good,it was a great job. the hours were great. the management was skewed in the district had more control because she was having relations with him.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"The day starts at 7am and 8am. Before all the craziness or lunch rush happens there is a lot of prepping for the whole day. Salsas were made, meats cooking, beans and tea brewing on the grill. In all that time everyone is doing everything, no one ever said ""That's not my job."" There was approximately 8-10 people on a shift. Our managers would walk around shouting encouraging things to keep us all motivated. They would also help with the things they thought were falling behind. The workplace was always a fun place to be, I looked forward to going to work every day."
good,This is a cool restaurant to work for if you dont mind lines out the door. Pay is decent and you get free food everytime you work and 50% off of anything you want to take home.
good,"Chipotle was a nice place, with good benefits, but the management was not great, they wanted me to work when I had strep throat or they made me find my own replacement when I did not know anyone."
good,"A typical day at work is very busy, high-volumes of customers, productive work flow and team work equally to insure progression and standards needed to be met from the company name."
good,"management is very helpful and coworkers can be very friendly"
good,"If you enjoy having the same tasks on a daily basis, interacting with customers, wearing a uniform, and following standard protocols, then this is the job for you. "
good,"Working at chipotle was a good experience for me ,ive learned that costumer service was the the most important thing to have ,which is very exciting .everyday i would go in to chipotle to check what we have like our prep. to see what i would have to make to make sure everything was ready for the night shift. i would clean as i go after a rush i would clean up to make sure my line was clean.and at the end of the day i would have to clean the lobby wipe down tables sweap mop,clean window,as well as clean up the drink station,at chioptle their was nothing hard about working their ,best experience."
good,"It is a friendly, fast paced and energetic environment. Typically all the workers, and managers get along, and can have a conversation if  time permits. I enjoyed the culture that Chipotle has, they want a fast-food experience but a 5-star restaurant one also. They hold high standards for workers and customers and treat everyone equally. "
good,Chipotle is not your average fast food work environment but once you learn the culture of the company it provides you with a new and positive work ethic and changes the way you view and eat fast food. My co-workers are the best and are always willing to help whenever needed. A day at work can be very high volume but that is also what makes the job enjoyable. Everyone is always working at all times. There is always something to do.
good,a typical day at work is one where I make the food and then serve it to customers. I have learned many new fun ways to cook and how to handle all different kinds of situations. Management was very kind and my co workers were all fun. The hardest part of the job is when there were so many customers and the demand for food was so high. the best part of the job was when we all had fun and acted like a family.
good,"Chipotle was a great place to be and I looked forward to making it my career.  I started as crew and within a year, i was an apprentice (asst. store manager) and acting GM within a year and a half."
good,"When I first started working there, I loved it. Great people, great vision and lots of opportunities to learn and advance in the company. However, do to various circumstances I switched locations and was unable to move forward from my position or get the hours I needed. "
good,great place to work. You work really hard but can grow. Always busy
good,Very busy and fast paced environment. I loved the food of course. Management and coworkers were good. Hardest part of the job was keeping up with inventory / merchandise orders because of high demands but most enjoyable was the culture that they have.
good,"Chipotle offers great opportunities for advancement, however other employees constantly use this to try and teach you how to do your job. It becomes interesting when two colleagues give you conflicting tasks or methods of doing something"
good,Worked as a general employee then was trained to be the kitchen manager. It was great experience in managing a crew and providing my skills to improve the condition of our restaurant.
good,The job itself is good and the benefits too but as far as management goes not the greatest.
good,"Good place, good people. Really enjoyed my experience but there was no room for growth within the company so I left."
good,"I typically worked 10 hour shifts and the work was especially draining. However, I enjoy customer service and respected that the restaurant was selling a delicious product."
good,Working in the restaurant business is a very demanding schedule. It is very fast paced and involves constant up keep.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Friendly people is working there. Is such a good experience working for Chipotle because I've never had a job in a kitchen enviroment.
good,"Their food is also top notch,fresh and tasty. The restaurant environment is outstanding. They even have their own musin/cable channel..Cool"
good,"The management and the hours can be a little grooling, but if you like fast paced this job will be perfect for you. The time flies but you will be tiered and dirty by the end. You do get tips sometimes and free lunches so it is also good if you love eating there. There company philosophy of eating clean and local is something I can definitely stand behind. For more information check out their website. -I did before I got hired and found out a lot of things I didn't know that surprised me in a good way about them."
good,A typical day at Chipotle was busy and hectic. It is very fast paced and you were always provided with something to do.
good,There is a lot to learn in the business and the team has a lot to do with being there to let you know how to handle many situations.  Communication is key so when there are barriers then it could really put a hold on improvement. I learned to keep customers happy as they were the driving force of my day.  If it wasn't for the wonderful support of customers I would not have been able to be so happy throughout the shifts.  They were absolutely wonderful.
good,Overall the company stands for great things which could make a real impact on the current food industry. In order to stand above other food industry companies Chipotle focuses on the quality and freshness of the ingredients in their food. Becuase of this Chipotle has VERY high standards when it comes to each restaurant.
good,"A typical day working at Chipotle would be busy. A lot of high energy and snap decisions. Honestly, this job is very time consuming and is not recommended for applicants that are not dedicated. The hardest part about this job is being along the front line serving the customers. The most enjoyable part of the job is the smiles from the customers and knowing that they will enjoy their food, hopefully to return the next day."
good,"The ratings say it all.  Good place, good culture.  Mediocre pay."
good,"A typical day working at Chipotle is hard work but a rewarding experience. They taught me everything I know about working in a restaurant. Managers there are friendly and understanding, as well as coworkers. There is a great sense of teamwork from coworkers and everyone shares their knowledge. The hardest part about working at Chipotle is the pace at which the restaurant operates. The most enjoyable part is the people I get to work with."
good,"Learned about leadership and how to manage a restaurant"
good,"Chipotle gave me the experiences to manage other people; to be the leader and lead with example. I learned that people don't always come to Chipotle for food alone but our culture we built inside once the customer walk in the door. This company gave me the experience to see in a greater way to accomplish my goals. One thing I found interesting and challenging is allocating my crew members in the right place for them to be highly effective and efficient. But I found this exciting as I learned more about who they are. I discovered that when you solve other people problems, you have solve your own."
good,Chipotle was a very fast act job. Also a job with many responsibilities and hardship. Co workers are nice and actually help eachother learnt he routines and material of restaurant culture
good,Good company overall. Your experience can change drastically depending on what location you work at.
good,"Chipotle is a fun, fast paced environment where only the elite of the elite are accepted in order to provide a restaurateur environment to guests."
good,"When I started working for Chipotle it was a professionally run business. They had a great management training program. Then, upper management changed over and it went down hill. There was no support from above.  The company itself is good, but, if you are under someone who has slipped through the cracks it can kill your career with them.  It's luck of the draw."
good,This company demands more from you emotionall and mentally than worth if you have a family.
good,Chipotle was a great place to work. This job help enhance my already established leadershipskills.
good,Great company with good benefits and a good work culture. Expects quality results from high performers. Accounting Center is a good place to work for anyone in the accounting or finance business.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Managers didn't respect workers beneath them. But crew members were hard workers
good,"For the most part, I really enjoyed my time at Chipotle. I was let go, by a disgruntled boss, who in turn was fired the week after he fired me. If your life is mostly drama-free, and you really want to move up in the corporate chain, Chipotle will facilitate you, and really do everything to move you up as soon as possible. While I did enjoy my time there, I can say that the turnover rate is crazy. Chipotle moves through people like nothing. But I guess it's overall for the better. It weeds out the underlings."
good,"Its all made fresh daily so expect work, the management will fire you if you are not perfect."
good,Fast pace during lunch time and evening hours between 2-5pm were the slowest times and during those time we clean and restock everything that we needed too.
good,There are four positions that I work:
good,"Great company to be a part of. However, alot of stress as well as a terrible approach from upper management.."
good,"Laid-back staff/managers, flexible scheduling, music while working, good food (free employee meal each shift), helpful managers when asking a job or personal question"
good,Much room for growth in the company if you are looking for a management position. If you want to move around in the company there are usually many opportunities to travel to other stores.
good,"I had a great work experience here , everyone was nice and helpful. The managers were very understanding. They have great pay and opportunities to move up in work."
good,I had the opportunity to learn different stations in the kitchen to improve my knowledge and skills in the Food Service Industry. The atmosphere was energetic and a fun place to work in.
good,"Everyone makes mistakes, but this environment makes you scared to do so in a sense.  I enjoyed my time there and the people, but their work ideals seem very strict and sometimes uncomfortable.  I feel that some management and up pay more attention to their social life's security that they overlook those of the lower employees when it comes to scheduling.  I do like that they stress the importance of being a united and responsible team member because ""a chain is only as weak as it's weakest link"", but a little lax and understanding would go a long way."
good,I experienced a Lot from this Job and definitely worked my hardest here. I made sure to try and always have a positive attitude and bright smile for my customers.
good,Fun and nice people who actually include you and help if there is an issue. Really only ran into problems i created with my own bad habits. Made pretty good tips for the amount of customers on the regular.
good,"working here was really fun, you have to work in a fast paced environment and everyone is very polite. would definitely work here again if I could, or wanted to."
good,"Chipotle was a good place to start for a kid fresh out of high school/in high school. When I was hired i felt completely at home, my coworkers were friendly and the manager was the nicest person I had the honor to work with. Now with that being said, not everything was sunshine and rainbows. The costumers were some of the rudest people i've ever met, and think they should be treated like the royalty. To those few that greeted me with the same smile that i gave them, keep on doing what you're doing. You people made my work life at Chipotle so much better."
good,At chipotle I have accomplished more work ethic and I learned so much about the company. How serious it is about our health and how we work as a team even on the busiest days possible. From the crew members to managers everyone was encouraging no matter how bad it got.
good,"I love the people that I work with. However, when there is a change in management there are some growing pains. The only thing that is enjoyable is the people you work with."
good,"Working here was amazing but a manager needs to be better at his job."
good,"Chipotle is a company that requires your total, undivided attention for every moment you are on shift. You need to show up with your game face   and a heart set on making your paycheck."
good,Moved back to be with my family. Overall I had a good experience working here. If the right people are hired the work is fun and stress level is low. If not the work becomes tedious as you have to pick up the slack and the stress level becomes high.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Chipotle is a great starting job for younger people looking for a nice job with decent pay. They are very flexible with working hours and managers and employees are super nice.
good,"Every worker I met at chipotle we’re my friends. Coming into work knowing that I’m working with people I like to be around, makes the job fun and enjoyable."
good,I gained a lot of the knowledge that I use in my everyday life at this job. I learned how to work at a fast pace and developed patience for difficult customers through working at chipotle. I would recommend for a young adult in need of a first job and experience while going to college.
good,It was nice not somewhere i wanted to be long term if I’m being completely honest about it. But it’s a nice place the people are nice and the customer it was a fun experience
good,"The work can be anywhere from downright easy to sanity-testingly difficult. However, if approached appropriately, it can be a rewarding experience. You can witness as your sales and customer satisfaction go up, and you can watch your team develop and grow."
good,"It's an enjoyable environment, fun and upbeat. The food is great and there's a good system in placed. It requires you to be active for the rush hours."
good,"Great entry level to teach you how to handle food and to treat customers. cash handling experience, team work,  food handling, sense of urgency. GM positions in my opinion not worth it unless under the right Team Leaders, you will have a terrible work life balance."
good,Im not sure if it was just my store but it was a rough experience after I transferred the first time. The managers were constantly changing and they seemed to get worse every time. Once we had a good one everything else seemed to fall into place and we got better overall.
good,I was a field leader worked bottom up. I mean in the beginning it was great but then the shining wore off. But that’s like any corporate position. Chipotle taught me a lot about management which I appreciate. I mean I wouldn’t be seen as such an asset as I do know if it wasn’t for the leadership. You need to have thick skin to advance and you need to understand there is more to it then performance.  Plan on long work days and depending on the market area you could be pulling double shifts but that’s work so just do it.
good,"Overall working here has been really great socially, I connect with my coworkers really well and it feels like family. Policies are very straight forward and learning on the job is quick but if you have questions they always have answers. Helpful management. However, under paid workers and it is difficult for anyone to ask for a raise."
good,"I would definitely work there again. I fell in love with the guest that would come in. After getting the hang of everything, it was easy working. Didnt like working with the lazy workers"
good,"Turn on equipment, see sales and see what will be needed for the day and see what we will need to prep for the following day. Designate your team to their best positions to execute throughput which is a nice fluid line helping each guest with their specific needs. After executing the line at the end of the shift count drawers speak to the team for places they can improve but also acknowledge their best efforts they have put in."
good,Learn good worth ethic at a fast past environment. As well as many skills for there are many roles you can do at chipotle. Cool managers and nice people.
good,"Chipotle is not a bad place to work, if you're young its a good place to gain experience, how ever if you're older with experience, it doesn't pay enough in today's market."
good,Chipotle was a pretty laidback workplace. I helped assisted customers and learned a lot about where my food comes from and became more healthy while working here.
good,"When i first started working there it was okay, even though i did not get the desired position that i had applied for, after a while of not receiving my original position i quit, also because the managers there most of the time do not listen to their employees even though they call themselves family"
good,it was a good place to work at i enjoyed working with everyone that i did.  while you wokred you got a free meal so that was always a plus.  they had pretty good benefits.
good,Management was decent. Co-workers were good. Decent pay and opportunity for advancement. Often had to work over the scheduled time. employees split tips
good,It was a good place to work. I worked the 6 to 2 shift. It was generally very busy during the lunch period because if the location being close to campus.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,A very fast pace work environment that helps you learn alot and all your coworkers are kind and management helps you work through alot if training. This is a great job fir any teen in highschool!
good,"I enjoyed working at chipotle, I grew my working skills from them. It was my first job and I did enjoy most of it. It was a great working experience and I hope that in the future I’ll hopefully learn more."
good,a typical day at work would be me working into work and seeing what I needed to do for the day. say hello to everyone in the crew and start my work. my location was a very busy store so it was very fast-paced when the lunch and dinner rush came in. everyone was on high alert when the time came but we would all help each other when the time came to move the line along to make sure the guests were happy. the hardest part of the job was just the great influx of guests who came in on mass volume. the most enjoyable part of the job was to work with the people I was with.
good,"It was clean at all times, the restrooms were also always cleaned. Most days we were really busy especially at peak time. There's been days that were quite slow but overall it was a good job."
good,"I’m Aiming To Find A Comfortable Job That I Enjoy Down The Road Chipotle Is Fine But I Don’t Really Enjoy Cooking That Much As Well As It Is Physically Draining Only For 9.50 An Hour In My Eyes."
good,I loved working at chipotle and was sad to leave because of school. Working with food wasn’t my favorite thing to do but the work environment and energy there kept me wanting to come back to work.
good,"Not a bad place to work, but geared to entry level food service. Experienced cooks will find it lacking in prep time which will require a pace that is not usual in the industry."
good,The hardest part of the job was its fast paced environment. At times in became very stressful but with a good team we got our job done in no time. Overall it was a good experience.
good,"Typically we are very busy. I learned many things by working at Chipotle. I learned problem solving skills, a sense of urgency, a typical point of sales system, and many more tasks. Management is typically good. I really like the managers that I work with, but call offs happened often. The hardest part of the job would have to be the amount of people we serve. It is very stress inducing. The most enjoyable would be the people you work with, and the ability to move up in your position."
good,It’s a nice place to work. Good pay. Nice people. I think that it is a nice place to work and more people should work here. It’s cool and nice. It’s nice and cool.
good,Great experience learned to work on a grill.co-workers and managers are very helpful they are there when u need help. Fast pace evorment all ways something to do
good,"No matter what shift you get you will experience a rush of hungry customers. It can be stressful but it pays well. Plus it has a bunch of benefits, including COLLEGE TUTION money. Since it is stressful the turnover rate is a little high, including manager positions. Not a bad paying job."
good,A lot of finger pointing and inexperienced super staff. Had a great crew and there were other issues outside of the company that affected us all. Alot of great employees were let go
good,Chipotle is an excellent company to work for with fast paced environment and the team is awesome.   It is a company that focus on customer service and family
good,"No world to describe in this job but recommended.  I work here for long Time as a manager was nice very professional all time last of hours to work. "
good,"Friendly people employers care about employees needs and comfort "
good,I had the chance to reapply after I got fired because it waSnt really anything on my end that ended with me being fired. However I felt that the management was a little unaffective.
good,"They give you opportunity to learn outside of job positions if you are willing to put in the hours. It is a lot of work for not a lot of pay, but it is fun if you get along with your coworkers."
good,Had a lot of fun working there. Loved getting a free meal with every shift. The customers were rude a lot of the time arguing over portion sizes and what not. But I had to leave because of the lack of hours I was getting. Wasnt giving me enough when I was working full time while they were giving part time workers more hours. Ultimately found a job one night and quit the very next day
good,"Days are quite enjoyable, with only one major rush hour. Learned how to work correctly and diligently with a cashier system, how to communicate clearly and efficiently with customers. Management was diligent,they set standards that were easy enough to reach."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Typically i get there start cooking right away all day is just constant cooking. There’s at least one other person with you in the kitchen so you're not alone. great place to learn hows to multitask, hardest part of the job is keeping up with the rush."
good,Working at Chipotle was good. This job had its ups and downs but if you were good at what you do then you pretty much had your job secured. Management wasn’t bad just needed a little bit more help.
good,Definitely challenged me but also taught me a lot. Showed me what it was like to be empowered at work.  Standards and quality is very high. Don’t expect to be able to do the bare minimum or skip/cut corners. Management was definitely there to support/teach and encourages you to advance. Going through stages to management is big so if you don’t have any interest in advancing or moving up then don’t bother. They don’t tolerate those that become complacent. I did notice a HUGE difference between chipotles in Colorado and those in NY. What I’ve seen just as a customer in NY would NEVER fly or be accepted at the chipotle I worked at in colorado. Seems to be a big discrepancy between different locations.
good,"I enjoy working at Chipotle, and made me feel more confident in my leadership skills. Times can be stressful, but it is all a learning opportunity to understand how you react during peak hours."
good,I had a good time working for chipotle. There was alot of miscommunication from management which would lead to a difficult day. Other than that it was a good job.
good,I loved working for chipotle! After a few years the company lost sight of the care they had for their people and started focusing on how the public viewed them. Lost a lot of great managers due to one sickness policy with no exceptions
good,"My time at chipotle although brief was fun, fast paced and exciting. As a company Chioptle is great and would recommend working their to most of my friends."
good,The environment at Chipotle was a very friendly and encouraging one. Most people were cooperative and willing to lend a hand. Management had its issues but had good intentions and really tried to have the best workplace balance. My main issues are the heat and constant burning of fingers and arms due to all of the hot equipment but overlooking that it was fairly enjoyable. You do have to work hard to keep up and it can be frustrating at times but it can be a very rewarding experience especially for people new to the food industry.
good,Working at Chipotle was a life changing experience. There will never be a job that has helped to change my perspective of myself and my belief in the direction I was headed.
good,"at the store, I work at we are very busy and always moving so I hardly have time to do anything else. when I get there depending on who is there I have different things to do and even when I have the things I have to do I usually have to do extra things or someone else's job."
good,Great people all around with also the benefit of having great food. Great experience to have very exciting and fast pasted. Employees are very warm and welcoming to new hires.
good,"While working in this profession I handle customer service, store maintenance, food preparation, and register service such as online and in store purchases. Work environment made the job a great experience"
good,Chipotle was overall a very sustaining place to work. I enjoyed my daily responsibilities as a manager and as an employee. The environment was fast paced and constantly in motion so the days moved seamlessly.
good,"I have worked at Chipotle now for almost 3 years and it has helped me pay for my education at college due to tuition reimbursement; however, I have remained at the position I started at almost 3 years later due to the fact that any ""promotions"" that I can do to a new position at the restaurant doesn't equate to me receiving any monetary benefit unless I would consider becoming a manager and even then for me to be a manager I would have to be working at least 30 hours a week and my top priority is school and with those hours I would be putting school on the back burner. "
good,"I enjoyed my time at Chipotle and loved my managers. I was able to advance in my job quickly to management and the further you get, the more benefits are available to you. They do offer tuition assistance as well for those interested and it was just a great, face paced working environment."
good,"The environment of the workplace was very safe. The store that i was located at was surrounded by other restaurants. Working on the line by myself occurred numerous times before new employees were hired. Other than that, the staff and general manager were alright."
good,"Chipotle is a fun, high stress and high pressure job, obviously depending on what position you are in. I was with Chipotle for for about a year. I had worked every position, opened, closed, covered shifts, stayed late, showed up on time, and rarely missed a  day, (I was sick a hand full of times) and never got a raise or promotion. The raises/promotions are reliant on the regional manager. If he/she does not like your store, you will never get your ""quarterly"" raise. Your yearly bonuses rely on the cashier and how many surveys are filled out by customers. If your cashier is incompetent, you will not receive it. Overall, each position is very easy to learn and easy to work. The other employees are usually pretty interesting. Free food is really nice too."
good,Very easy job all you have to do is do your part and everything will flow. This is also one of the most packed chipotles out there so it’s very very stressful when busy at times.
good,"I had so much fun working here! Depending on who you work with, it’s a blast. The rush is worth it when you get to work with such amazing people. I recommend."
good,"Great company allows people to grow within the company fairly quickly, has great training tools to develop staff and teaches about the culture that chipotle has. Its focus is fast pace"
good,"The turnover is high so that means employees had to work a little extra hours. You work with a lot of younger people, still in high school. The customers can be rude at times."
good,"Most Enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people. Interacting with Customers and Other Employees was most of the time enjoyable. Getting to know Customers who were known as ""Regulars"" was pretty cool."
good,"As soon as you clock in, you're expected to begin to work, and be on your toes as soon as a customer comes in. Fast is what we're good at, fast and correct when completing an order. Hardest part of the job is beginning a new position. Always ask if you're unsure about something, we want to help you, and make sure it's being done correctly and in the safest way possible."
good,Working here was amazing. It was my first job and it was so much fun. If you like to work with food and snack on the job.. this place is perfect. The people you work with can be so helpful.
good,Chipolte was fun working with many new faces and making new friends while learing how to work in a kitchen. Management was usually pretty fair with everything.
good,"The job is very quick paced and can sometimes be stressful, but it is also fun and you learn a lot about yourself and others. You truly learn how to handle problematic customers."
good,"I had no restaurant experience what so ever and chipotle gave me the opportunity to learn basic prep and cooking procedures, knife skills, and team work. The job is demanding but rewarding. I created many friendships while working there and have used a lot of what i learned there in my future job."
good,"Your experience will all depend on your team and manager, but Chitpotle can be a really enjoyable job if your location isn't always slammed. It is a lot of work for pretty average pay but the paid breaks and free food are a huge plus."
good,you need to have a lot of dedication and patience to work in this place.Teaches you how to cook and how to balance a crazy work environment. Does help you advance quickly.
good,"Great opportunity to learn a lot of new skills. It is pretty fast paced and stressful environment during peak times. Great, friendly coworkers. Good with giving requested time off and sick days, as well as working with student schedule availability."
good,Chipotle was a great place to work. The hours were flexible. There were plenty of opportunities for growth in the company. Free meals daily was also a big bonus.
good,A very fast paced environment that is rooted in teamwork. Understaffed at the location I worked out. Doesn't offer overtime even though the store exceeded daily sales.
good,"I work at a relatively slow store so all the workers are fairly friendly with each other, but a lot of rules change on the fly so it can be hard to adjust to all the things they want you to do differently on a day to day basis. In my experience managers will show up and decide to change something for no reason even though there's no problem there or it doesn't really make something better, more often than not it makes working more difficult"
good,I definitely enjoyed my stay until the end. Management was poor. There’s little room to move up in the company but it’s possible. If anything you definitely will get a raise.
good,"I washed the dishes, prepared the and stocked the meats, cleaned the back of the house. Management was very strong though young. The food was excellent and of excellent quality."
good,"I did not receive a ton of benefits from working at Chipotle because I was sixteen when I was working there. As a minor working part-time, there was not a whole lot I could receive. I do know that coworkers of mine had received a  lot of benefits. "
good,"Throughout the years through Chipotle I've learned many things with local and federal guidelines concerning food safety. It's a good job if you love being in a fast paced environment and care where your food is sourced from. Not every store is ran by the book depending on the location you're at. But if you do find that one good store and ran by a GM that really cares for their employees, then I would highly recommend staying with the company. You can learn a lot of things within Chipotle and you will feel self gratification and self worth."
good,"this is a place that is fun and awesome to work at for young people in high school or college. as someone that does not attend school currently, I need a job that provides more hours and more pay."
good,"The job was sample but fast paced, also it was a lot of changes happening every other month. But once you knew where you wanted to be at work, you’d be the most comfortable."
good,"It was basically my first real job, and I had a really good experience. It is easy to move up, I became a kitchen manager after working part-time for two years. They care about their employees and I had great managers that worked well with their crew members. You get a free meal every time you work and then half off when you don't, so for a college student this was amazing. Working here really makes you appreciate the time and effort put into what they make, they are one of the few fast-food companies that serve great quality food. The only downside I would say would be that since my store is so close to a University, only students would apply so finding anyone that was full time or willing to cover shifts were few and far between. I can't complain much, I'm a student too but I cared about my job so I would try to cover any shifts I could. Also, when you work in the back of house be ready to marinate meats and work with uncooked food, eating it will never be the same."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Chipotle provides opportunity for growth and progression in the kitchen as well as a career. The job provides excellent balance between work and life as well for a college student.
good,Chipotle is a great place to work if you enjoy being busy and surrounded by awesome people who genuinely love what they do. Management is friendly and very accommodating with scheduling your shifts around school or other jobs. The culture is very laid back and youthful. Chipotle gets really busy so it is a work hard and time management type of environment.
good,The days are move fast-paced when there is a lunch or dinner rush. The work environment is fun and there are plenty of opportunities to move up. Management is usually pretty helpful and willing to provide tools for success.
good,"They fire for unnecessary reasons, but overall was fun due to the people I previously worked with. They provided free lunches which was good, but were strict for no reason."
good,This job is not for everyone I’ve been working here for 2 years and I’ve seen people come and go. It’s a ver fast paced environment and very stressful you have to be constantly moving and you’re always multitasking. Management kinda sucked we had many managers quit or relocate and everyone always had a different way to manage no one was really on the same page and that’s why the shifts would not run smooth.
good,"Management was not acceptable, coworkers absolutely the most enjoyable part of the job. Glad to have the experience of learning to multitask, work under pressure , and follow directions quickly."
good,It is a fun job but the chipotle that I work at the manager cut all the hours of the minors that work there but other than that it is a fun place to work with amazing people and great food.
good,They help me and showed me what it takes to be a leader and how things never life should be taken seriously and be the best you can and to always push yourself to be better
good,Chipotle does pay fairly good for part-timers or fresh out of high school students but can be a tough learning curve for what they need. Certain tasks are hard to do but you can be accustomed to overtime. Always busy and rarely downtimes unless in the early shift.
good,"A typical day after Clocking in would be doing wellness checks on all the employees, then calculating the amount of food we will use for the day based on sales to reduce waste. We always try to keep positive attitudes no matter how busy / stressful it got."
good,"Working at Chipotle was a great experience for me. I learned many valuable skills there moving my way up from crew to Assistant General Manager. They taught me many things about operating a restaurant, managing, developing my crew, and providing a clean and great work environment."
good,"I love the community in the Chipotle in which I've worked. Everyone was very encouraging."
good,"It was a very fast paced and busy job. The managers were helpful and caring. The coworkers were a great team, and it's definitely all a team effort. Scheduling was very flexible."
good,"Chipotle is good place for learn and they help you with flexible schedule. Everybody can learn in the different stations and also different skills. Doesn’t matter who you are, everybody needs to know every station in Chipotle."
good,"A great and fun place to work. Keeps busy and also lots of communication with customers and staff. The most enjoyable is the lunch rushes, although it could get busy it keeps you very well busy and times go by fast with lots of interaction."
good,"A typical day at work is usually super fast pace, something you'd have to get used to. The management is absolutely amazing! My managers try their hardest to make sure the crew members are always comfortable at our workplace and usually check up on us regularly to see how we are doing in the workplace,and if there is anything they could change to make the workplace better for us, or even for the customers. The hardest part about working for Chipotle for me, is the fast pace!!! It can be a little frustrating at first, but once you get used to it, you'll be a natural!"
good,It’s a respected place where everyone gets along and are friends inside and outside of the work place. Great staff and great work Provided from those who worked there. Have to be able to keep up with busy rushes and always be prepared to cook for a good 2 or 3 hours straight during really busy rushes but the environment you work around keeps you at a cool collective level. From washing dishes to prepping the food everybody work has got a job to do and should be able to get done right.
good,"I personally would recommend working at chipotle. It's a good place to work if you are comfortable with a face paced environment , pays well, it helps you develope communication skills as well as cooking skills depending on your work position."
good,Chipotle is the perfect long term job. Lots of opportunities to  promote from within. This job teaches employees extraordinary customer services. Would recommend.
good,Chipotle was an amazing company to work for if you are dedicated to your duties and give 110%. Many employees are just looking for steady work or reliable schedules and fail miserably. It is very demanding and if you do not buy into the culture you will NOT succeed. Strict expectations and high turnover is extremely common.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Certain managers suck and the one I work at is super super busy but other than that it’s an okay place to work. As long as you stay to yourself and don’t entertain the drama
good,It was fun and good to work there. It was great energy. people came to work happy with a smile on there faces. The food was mad properly and nicelt cleaned
good,"Chipotle was a great job for me as my store was one of the busiest in the region I live. That being said, the pay was well above average for a chipotle. Free meal every shift, tips and paid sick days. Cant really beat it for a uneducated job"
good,"The multiple jobs in the restaurant I did include prep and serving. Prep involves getting the food ready for cooks as well as cleaning dishes and the back of the house. serving involved making the actual food on the line for customers, which was more fun than prep."
good,"it was a good place and the employees were fun to be around, we all had interchangable jobs so any given day you might be doing something different. It could get really hectic aroun lunch time especially if someone was falling behind or late/missing."
good,"Duties: "
good,"It was a great place to work. Manager was very lenient. Unfortunately, I was born with a disease called Pyloric Stenosis and the Adoba used to cook the meat really effected my stomach. I threw up a late because of it, and Chipotle has a strict health code since the Ebola outbreak back in 2012."
good,"Being my first job, I’ve learned a lot of patience and endurance while working at Chipotle. Managers would motivate crew to work hard and helped to teach us effiency and good time management. The raises every 6 months was a good touch, and crew was very fun yet hard working. Overall, the workplace culture was great and I learned a lot working at Chipotle."
good,"Chipotle is a very easy, laid back, fun job. I have nothing bad to say about it at all I will recommend to work there. But they don't give enough hours for me"
good,"Started as a crew member and developed into a General Manager in two and a half years. "
good,"Learned kitchen/cooking skills."
good,"Chipotle was a great environment to work at for a very long time. The hours were not bad since they open at 11am and close at 10pm. The crew works hard and I loved working with them. Being upper management, I loved trying to make the crew better and listen to their needs. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all of the customers and working in the small restaurant. Kent was a high revenue restaurant for that area and needed a larger place."
good,"At Chipotle, the managers rely on the crew members to do their job to the best of their abilities but also the fastest that you can. They expect you to roll burritos and serve customers under 60 seconds. That's the hardest part of the job, the speed. The easiest part is speaking to the customer and delivering good customer service."
good,Chipotle has been an amazing place to work but it do not recommend it if you have a family. definetly great when i was single because i didn't care how long i was there but you get sucked into it all.
good,"It’s a great work environment and very well managed. The pay rate was okay could’ve been better . A good perk was the discounts that you recurved such as jewelry, travel and cellular company discounts."
good,"Nice, fast-paced job, due to high volume of costumers. However, the job is not too high stress, and the crew is very friendly. Management, however is hard to communicate with, and it's not very employee based."
good,the workplace at chipotle is extremely productive. The morning shift usually starts by pre paring fresh chip bags for the customers. Set tables up. Make sure that each customer is greeted in a friendly manner.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"If you work hard you can go far very quickly, if not you'll be left behind. It is a fast paced fun and friendly place to work! They love to promote from within!"
good,"Chipotle is a great place to start out for a first job, the company teaches you a lot of things, and you tend to move up a lot depending on what you want."
good,"As fun as any restaurant to work in. A typical day consists of managing breaks, preparation for service, and cleaning and preparing for shift change or for the next day."
good,"Worked for Chipotle for 2 years and a month. The experience was bitter sweet. I loved all my coworkers theres but management went down hill after my previous General Manager quit. The new G.M. was super lazy and the team basically ran the shifts. I basically ran 3-4 different stations per day as a Take-out Specialist. I had to make online orders, do a lobby check, break cash, and wash dishes. I basically got fired because I called out my G.M. for being a hypocrite and being lazy."
good,"Overwork people who want to just work 40 hours. Hard to get days off. Really depends who is the GM of the store, they set the pace for everything, and they have an easy opportunity to be corrupt."
good,"Can be fun but it’s like taking another class from college with culture things one had to learn. Depending on management it can become a real drag to work, coworkers make it all worth going to."
good,"i had a wonderful time working at chipotle. our top manager was horrible always hostile and would clock in just to leave and buy ""toilet paper"" didnt show up for hours at a time"
good,"Strong company undergoing changes. Great food, great people and the culture is  focused on advancing the company's position in the fast casual market place."
good,"Chipotle is a great job, but it tends to be very repetitive, monotonous and boring if you need mental stimulation while working. "
good,The Chipotle I worked at expects a little too much from a single person. Basically everyone there is expected to do the jobs of 2 people. It only truly works when 2 people decide they need to work together
good,"From the moment you walk in the door its go go go. If you stop for a moment to get a drink the line clogs up and customers start complaining. The management can't get the schedule correct for the life of them. The team entire team however where really supportive, worked like a well oiled machine, and when you work here you learn a lot fast. Overall its a pretty good job, just not for one who gets stressed in fast paced environments."
good,"It’s hard but it’s a job, you cook and clean. Follow rules, that’s it. The people who you work with varies so I can’t tell you that all of them are lovely. It’s a job"
good,"Chipotle Mexican Grill is a pretty great place to work. The pay is competitive, the people are focused and there is a lot of availability for career advancement. However, beware the few extremely negative members that slip through the vetting process. These may result in a negative experience."
good,Always busy from the moment you clock in. There are always hours to work. Benefits are minimal and expensive. Free lunch item during 6 hour + shift. Good energy
good,it was great working there for a little while but then it got real understaffed and managers kept being switched and switching how things were done each time so it got annoying
good,"It took me a while to get used to the absolute insanity of how fast the job is as a cashier, but once you get used to it, you exceed the expectations without a second thought. The job isn't necessarily hard, but there's a lot to pay attention to, so there's consistent pace throughout the day. I love the work culture! The people there are amazing, and management has been fantastic since the General Manager changed. Food is free, too!"
good,"It was nice for a few years, until different managers kept coming and leaving in and out like a revolving door. The company kept changing rules and policies also."
good,the pay is ok chipotle was a great first job they gave you the opportunity to move up in the company also gave you tuition money back  if you were in school
good,a typical day at work would be either working the assembly line where you put together peoples order or i would be on the register cashing people out or sometimes i do both
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I work at a fairly slow, small location, so max six employees working at once - excluding events. Tasks are shared and everyone helps keep the place running. Communicating the day-to-day problems with each other has built a positive work environment. My workplace culture is very friendly, and our location's General Manager does a great job maintaining it. "
good,Was my favorite job but because of the way I left with out the two week notice they won’t re hire me sadly. I will always recommend this job to friends and family it’s is up beat and fun environment who cares for my 13 special characteristics I love chipotle!
good,great food experience. Have the right idea on how to get food out quick and keep it rather healthy and cruelty free. But room for advanement is often small.
good,"The job is fun, but it can be stressful, especially when you are closing. Everything has to be perfect and set to the standards of the general manager."
good,"Managers dont work hard enough."
good,"Enjoyed my coworkers some of the costumer's the food. The pay was pretty good, the management wasn't the best, brake time wasn't set up officiantly. Over all it was a cool place to work."
good,"Sometimes could be a little slow, but when college kids show up you have to be prepared. Plus doing online orders at the same time is something to get use to. Hours were pretty good."
good,"Overall I really felt Chipotle IT was a great place to start my career. I saw lots of changes as the company grew, but the culture consistently maintained a center focus for every department."
good,Chipotle has the outline of a fantastic company to work for.  They offer decent benefits and a fair shot at advancement.  Understaffing and lack of regional resources tend to hold back local go-getters.
good,Work is fast paced an can be stressful. Managers do a good job training and making sure everybody adheres to safety codes. Workers are very friendly and encouraging to new employees.
good,"Amazing start off/first job for someone without any experience. Great opportunities to learn and grow, and move-up in the company and to gain more experience."
good,"The youthful students make the work environment entertaining and fun. Rush hour tends to come in waves, busy for about half an hour then slow, then fast etc etc."
good,"Chipotle is a very hard job. It is very fast paced, and hard to catch on quickly. The environment is awesome when you build relationships. the customers are always amazing. Also the managers are a blast to work with!"
good,"Working at Chipotle is like working at most food places, demanding and fast-paced sometimes. The hardest part of the job isn't too hard, it's simply making sure the restaurant is in the best condition possible."
good,A typical day includes prepping and cooking food. Cleaning and maintaining a safe work environment. Working as a team to provide excellent customer service.
good,"Being only my second job ever after being let go from my first short lived food service job, I still was adapting to the speed. I am known to be a diligent worker and was asked to improve my speed, so I did, but where I saw myself personally improving, my management still saw that I was not fast enough. In their defense though, the management and the team were incredibly friendly and patient people, and I would have loved to have the chance to stick around and feel like a part of that team."
good,"Management always rewarded the hard workers, I enjoyed being apart of that because that really pushed us to do a great job, thus Management was excellent."
good,quick and fast place. the staff is always friendly and helpful.affordable price with good healthy food. amazing modern exterior and interior design very unique.
good,"If you like to be rushed and like constructive criticism Chipotle is ok. They expect you to go unbearablely fast yet not make a mess. They expect you to plaster on a fake smile when when you are upset. If you are a fast worker and always smiling, Chipotle is great for you. Most Chipotles have s super chill friendly environment so that’s a plus."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"there was a stable structure within the work environment, each employee on duty knew their responsibilities. The leadership actively collaborated to improve the restaurant, they were committed to every aspect of the workplace. Being a manager I was able to give input on how to better the work place. improve it as a unit and improve the comfort level for experienced employees and new employees."
good,"The company's views have changed, it used to be empowering and people were willing to grow with the company.  Now, it's difficult.  Management lacked communication and did not hold themselves to the same standards."
good,it was fun working with my costumers. My customers very polite. I take my job very seriously. I learn how to prep the food. The part was having patients with the customers.
good,"overall a great company. does well with personnel management and building a culture for their employees to enjoy. however, low pay and poor insurance makes it nothing more than a transitional job, unless you dedicate the time and effort to make it to a GM position"
good,"When I first started working here, I enjoyed every single second of it. I loved giving customers an excellent guest experience. My manager at the time was an amazing leader and he was able to motivate me, guide me, and teach me a lot of things regarding my work ethic. Unfortunately, he transferred to a different store and the company Chipotle gave us a new manager. That's when everything went downhill. The store was doing so well and we would have daily compliments, but now with the new management team I just don't feel like I am appreciated at the store anymore. I also feel like I am not able to use my skills to help improve the company as a whole. That is the reason why I am looking for another job."
good,"You can count yourself learning how to multi task, so be prepared to call for food,  while rolling a burrito and also asking the next person what they’ll like on their entree, ALL AT THE SAME TIME ! Great way to put yourself in a great position!"
good,This is a job that requires a lot of hard work at a fast pace because jobs that could reasonably be done by more than one person are expected to be done by one person with enough time to move on to the next task. Depending on your store you will be trained but the training is the bare minimum before they expect you to work as fast as people who've been there for six months.
good,"The job was for a fact stressful since it seems like their is always a line out the door. The crew is great which makes it a fun work environment, that is when you can catch a breather."
good,They do to much and it was just a lot There’s not much to say so o don’t know what to right working there was just very stressful .................................................................
good,"Chipotle has its ups and downs. It can be very fast paced most of the time. Depending on the feel and flow of your crew members can  make a huge difference. As a apprentice you are in charge of counting the cash in the store, checking and replying to emails, running shifts, and a few other various things."
good,"I worked for CMG for nearly 5 years, and it was by far one of the best corporation-owned restaurants I have ever worked for.  While I have heard some horror stories,  I think I got pretty lucky, as my managers have nearly all been very easy to work with.  They helped me learn and grow within the company, as long as I let it be known that is what I wanted."
good,Everyday I would get to Chipotle it was a very happy and positive vibe. We all worked so hard and worked well together. Everyday before our shift start we would all gather around and talk about the business.
good,"I love the benefits of working here. You can get one free meal per shift and 50% off your orders if you buy chipotle from the store you work at. The hours are pretty flexible and the pay is fair. Shifts can last from 4-8 hours long. The managers weren't strict or unfair, although there will be a few exceptions."
good,Chipotle can be a fun and amazing place to work if you are a favorite and if everyone on the team has the same level of care that you have. If you aren't a popular person there is no room for advancement. You can be told multiple times that you will be getting promoted next and each time you will be let down.
good,"Management needs a little help but the job isn't too much to handle, days move pretty quickly and the customers are pretty down to earth. Overall the job was alright."
good,"Chipotle is a fun place to work. Plus it teaches you so many skills. I still personally use the skills they taught me. Overall it was a pleasure working there, and they try to teach you everything in the store. Sometimes it would slow down, but everyday definitely kept you on your toes. The people were great, definitely diverse. It was just a great group of people making food."
good,Everyone there is very lively and fun but don’t ever count on leaving on time; they expect you to work longer than you should. But overall it’s really really a great place to work if you don’t mind snappy customers.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Great working environment. Learned a lot about worker to customer relation and how to provide friendly service. Coworkers were easy to get along with.
good,Une équipe dynamique et la volonté de toujours vouloir améliorer le service clientèle. Les produits sont frais et c'est agréable de retrouver une vraie cuisine dans un fast food
good,"Chipotle has nice tasty non GMO options. Animals that are not inhumanely treated, and to me personally has better tasting food than qdoba will ever have. It isn't authentic as I'd like but it most certainly does the job."
good,"The workplace culture is dependent on very many aspects such as sales, store's grade level and management. If you believe that you take pride in food safety and experience then this place is definitely an area to proceed in."
good,I loved working at Chipotle. Its an amazing conpany however the store I worked at was poorly managed. Even when brought up to his boss it was never handled.
good,"Days breezed by as there was always a customer to serve, co-workers were incredibly friendly, management was kind and helpful. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people--customers and coworkers alike."
good,"It is a great starting job. They start out  at $9/hr and it is a challenging job but they give you paid breaks and a free meal for any shift. It's fairly easy to move up if you put in the effort.They have awesome benefits like affordable health insurance, and they pay for school if you stay with them for a year or more."
good,"Always fun to work, fast-paced and time goes by fast. Managers are great and friendly,  everyone tries to help each other out. I would recommend this place for any one who wants customer service."
good,"Working at chipotle mexican grill is a place of team work but there are always a tough, stressful day at chipotle specially the place i worked for and there's always rude customers everyday."
good,Fun place but sometimes very fast paced. A lot of cleaning and sometimes can be stressful. Everything has to be perfect. pretty much the cleaning part make it hard. chipotle cleans the store from head to toe.
good,"Very good company to work for. Compensation is fantastic as a crew member, but does not scale well to management. Pay for management is low, relative to the responsibilities and expectations. I say this in comparison to the pay offered at other companies for similar work, which is typically $2-4 more. People culture used to be absolutely amazing on a corporate level, but this has changed in the last few years. That isn't to say there's NO people culture, it just isn't as encompassing as it used to be. On a store level, my coworkers were my second family. Very tight-knit and reliable crew. But there are definitely a few stores that don't have the same manager-crew relationships that we had. Overall, if I had to work here again, I would not be disappointed. It was a great place to work while pursuing my BS (tuition reimbursement is offered, and schedule was relatively flexible). Benefits were great."
good,I’ve learned how to move quickly and efficiently. I’ve learned how to effectively communicate with customers and I cross trained. Chipotle is demanded so it’s very fast paced for about an hour then very relax at other times. There are times we have lines to the door but with the training I’ve recieved we’re able to get people out very quickly.
good,"Every job is different, but it's not always the job itself that gives us reason to get out of bed every morning and go about our days. Chipotle was a very typical fast food job in New York City. Anyone that works in New York City knows that the title given to NYC cooking culture is aptly named. However, the best part about Chipotle is the companies vision towards team culture. There was never a day where I felt unwelcomed for being the person I am or the way that I act. I was properly guided and given every chance to succeed and given enough determination and work ethic, there is much room for growth in the company. The work can be a bit physically strenuous, but overall there is not a lot of heavy lifting (some for garbage and the big 5 gallon soda syrups), and you are mostly on your feet moving at a fast pace all day long. There is time alloted for break if you are fast enough to complete your task on time and finishing your task on time was heavily enforced. Overall, only work here if you have a can-do attitude, the physical capability, or if you feel as though you may not fit in at places you have been."
good,Very few times did you have nothing to do.  It was a really good experience and i do not regret working for chipotle but I could not balance hours with my schedule very well and it became more stressful than it should've been and I decided it wasn't good for me.
good,Its a great job to start out at. Teaches a lot of skills inside and outside of job. Great people and customers. Great benefits are offered. Theres fun to have while learning amongst others. Also great place to learn common food practices if intersetd in food.
good,While you were required to work an obscene amount of hours you are paid really well and are surrounded by people who genuinely care about serving the best possible food you can.
good,Chipotle definitely can be an awesome and fun place to work compared to many other similar concepts. There are lots of opportunities for advancement within the company and the experience you have working there is dependent on your management team both at the store and regionally. Great benefits for managers and compensation isn't bad either. But shifts can be long for managers and it gets very stressful when store are understaffed. There is a great people culture within the company and awesome events are put on each year and there are many collaborations with other big companies and sports teams. The food is awesome of course and completely real and fresh unlike every other fast food concept.
good,"Cutting stuff and playing music "
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"It can be sometimes stressful and sometimes fun to work at . "
good,My experience at Chipotle was a very good one. The workplace culture was amazing as I got along and made a lot of good friends at Chipotle. The work itself is quite physically demanding but also rewarding. My multi-tasking and time management skills improved a lot thanks to Chipotle.
good,"This is a good place to work to gain experience in the hospitality industry as well as gain management experience.  Beyond that, I think there are far better options."
good,Chipotle provides a fast paced work environment that requires no previous experience in the Kitchen. Crew members teach eachother the skills they need to be successful. Free meal for every shift worked.
good,"Chipotle is one of the most beneficial jobs I had, due to the learning process. When I first started I was very nervous because, they had so many standards and procedures. Honestly felt like I took a short culinary class. Chipotle taught me a lot about knife skills, and emergency procedures."
good,"Chipotle looks for 13 specific characteristics in a potential employee and that has created a company with like-minded people who are also unique themselves. Overall, it was a rewarding work experience where I made a lot of friends and learned some skills that will stay with me. However, the job is very demanding and becomes more demanding the higher you move up."
good,It was almost always busy during my shift. Advancement is easy to achieve and was offered a few times. Learned every station possible and i enjoyed working because there was always something to do. The hardest part was to be able to multi task during busy hours. Once you can achieve that it actually became fun. There was a lot of competitiveness with co workers but always remained friendly. The best part was being in a team of top performers. People who always wanted to do better and kept a smile on your face. They made time go by fast.
good,"Chipotle was a great experience for me to learn my way around a kitchen. They taught me how to use my skills with quality control, empowering others around me and how to maintain a high level of work ethic."
good,"Chipotle created a culture among their team that encouraged leadership, team work, and problem solving. In a fast paced environment, customers were served quickly with a genuine smile while workers collaborated to maintain work place safety and sanitation."
good,"When I started working at Chipotle Wellington on May 20th, 2014 I only wanted a summer job to help pay for college. I immediately fell in love with the vision, and culture and decided to try and make it a career. I went from crew to assistant general manager in less than a year. The work is extremely fast paced, but enjoyable. I've worked at three different locations and the crew/management has always been exceptional. The pay is good and there are a lot of benefits. I would recommend to anyone as long as they are willing to work hard, work fast, and possess the ability to take and follow directions."
good,The most enjoyable part of working at Chipotle would have to be developing my crew to managers. I started at Chipotle as a regular crew member and the best part of my employment was being able to promote crew that once started off with me as crew because I got to give opportunities to those who deserved it.
good,"Good experience working at Chipotle, good environment. Free lunch and paid breaks were a plus. Although, they hire too many people and provide little hours.  Over-all good place for a first job."
good,Working at chipotle teaches you a lots of help full skills great challenges every that that helps you feel accomplished. The only thing about chipotle its stressful inviorment where every one is relentless on accomplishing  the goal even if you need to work over 12 hours per day 7 days a week working as a salary manager your responsible to work the extra hours needed to stay on budget of labor
good,"Its a very busy environment but fun to work at.  Its not an easy job, it requires you to work very hard and have a sense of urgency but it can be very tiring at times because of all the work you have to do."
good,"Long, but fun hours. Very routine, which got very boring personally. I learned how to really just put your nose to the grindstone and get things done fast. I had a good time, the only down sides were that I ended up having to stay extra hours after already long shifts--and this was apparently the culture at this location as many of my co-workers ended up staying overtime almost everyday. But this was more so the fault that we were short-staffed."
good,It was great! I enjoyed my time at Chipotle and the people that I worked with. It was just time for me to move on and better myself with a more successful opportunity.
good,"I loved working for the company. There was just a few things I didn't like, like the empty promises that don't get filled, and if they do it's really late. They say be a team and/or family but only worried about themselves. It's a contradiction for some people, also they believe in ""family"" and keeping a balance between the two. Haha yeah right! What I have learned is you have to make better for your family, that sometimes are blinded by working mothers and what that does to us. The workplace was very friendly and upbeat and always full of life. My most enjoyable part of the job was meeting so many different people throughout the years, what I could have done without is missing so much of my childs life."
good,loved working at chipotle at peek hours and morning prep. Management changed and it became a bad environment to work in. Had to start training new people who didn't listen or cared about costumer or having a good relationship between crew members.
good,"A typical day at work included serving many meals, ringing up customers, and cleaning."
good,I feel that Chipotle was a great place to work for. The only thing is that it is very stressful due to the amount of recipes and tasks you have to do.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"good work environment, and proper work life balance. minimal management and poor scheduling. underpaid for the amount of work required on a day to day basis."
good,"Each and every day was completely different.  It all depended on location.  Depending on where you are what you will receive.  Managers go by how they feel about you.  Costumers aren't really the best, they feel very overprivileged.  It is a great place."
good,Be prepared for a fast paced workday.  Being able to communicate with others is a must.  The hardest part about a workday is sometimes meeting the thru put.
good,"It is a great job with plenty of benefits. Help with college, and many others. The grill can be hot and difficult, however, if you work with a great crew and have the proper training it is a great job."
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced, but can be tedious. You are on your feet the whole time and morning openers rarely get a break. At night, you get a 30 minute paid break. You get free food when you work and half off when you don't. I learned a lot about the restaurant business, but it is hard to advance because there are 4-5 managers. Unless one of them leaves, you are stuck in the same spot.The culture is fun and laid back and the people are generally fun and happy. The hardest part of the job can sometimes be dealing with the public, but sometimes it is also the best part of the job. The most enjoyable part is spending time with your friends, eating free food, and making others happy."
good,Love the jo. Good training. Nothing bad to say about the job or the manager. I would tell anyone to apply. I learned how to cook in a different culture. And it allows you to meet new people.
good,"Overall, pretty decent company. Wonderful skills taught that you can carry onto other jobs. Time managment and precision are taught so that no one falls behind."
good,"Working at Chipotle was very rewarding. Learning new skills and cross training was a learn at your own pace sort of deal. It allowed managers to see who were the go getters and who was content with staying put. Information such as the store's daily profit were shared openly with all employees, regardless of seniority. As long as you can keep up with the fast environment, you can thrive here."
good,"The job is extremely fast paced. From the moment you clock in to the moment you clock out, there is ALWAYS something to do- always a customer to tend to, or dishes to wash, or food to start cooking. But the team of workers are typically playful and always become extremely close knit. If you enjoy always having something to do and working with a family, then this is the right place. The job is exhausting, but everyone works together and everyone is constantly looking for ways to help each other improve and move up in the company. Take it from someone who worked there for 3 years."
good,Working at Chipotle has taught me much about teamwork and overcoming adversity in the workplace. Chipotle is fast paced and the crew must all work in a perfect synchronization to uphold its standards and quality of operations. There is empowerment throughout the crew to uplift and enable others to do the same. There has been some search to find a stable General Manager for our store and this has caused a lot of confusion in direction and operations from time to time however we still seem to maintain a working balance within the restaurant. The most enjoyable part of my job is going in and working with all the great people I have come to love.
good,As soon as I arrived at Chipotle I was put to work in the front and take people's orders. I was taught how to do the job in less than 15 minutes the very first day. It seemed like the line would never end at times but I grew accustomed to the fast-paced work environment very quickly. I was usually the person in charge of cleaning that same area when the store would close. I learned to do my job fast but well. Management was good and the workplace culture was incredible. I made many acquaintances there. The hardest part was growing accustomed to how fast I had to do my job but I enjoyed it because I was eventually given a nickname that translated to the fastest person there.
good,"As a manager my duty was to ensure the shift and the restaurant were operating at maximum capacity, meaning the flow of customers, safety and quality of the food, and the marketing for more customers. I handled communications with guests, corporate, and neighboring Chipotles. I'm responsible for breaks, cash handling, guest relations, food safety, team morale, and the implementation of new and improved procedures."
good,Chipotle is a great environment with great people. It is an excellent place to start your first management position. I had never been given an opportunity to move into management until working here. It really helped me to build my leadership skills as well as customer service skills. It is a very fast paced job that requires constant work with little downtime and can be very demanding at times. I do believe that the upper management needs to be more supportive of subordinate managers. Overall Chipotle is a fun and energetic place to work with the possibility of a career.
good,"Chipotle is like a school for preps, cooks and front of house crews! It can be a challenging job, there is so much to learn, but it can be fun and exciting. Chipotle helps you develop a sense of urgency and learn to work at a fast pace."
good,"As a Chipotle employee, all positions are fast paced, but also fun.  As long as everyone is working as a team, production can be quite beneficial to both the employee and the consumer."
good,"it challenges you and makes you grow as a worker and an individual. as a manager you start early in the morning and sometimes won't leave until late at night. it takes a lot of sacrifice to work there because you spend so much time there your personal life may suffer at times. if you have s great team, it can make even the most stressful of situations tolerable."
good,"*Great people working there"
good,"Very good place to learn has worked in team, a very nice experience with managers of qualities, a good working environment, A mixture of culture and respect for others"
good,Chipotle was very stressful but I learn a lot there. I learned how to constantly handle a busy store and how to effectively communicate to customers. Other than that it was terrible. I constantly had to worry about being fired for the stupidest things. If I opened my mouth   I thought I would be fired.
good,Try to keep the environment clean. Cleaning tables and by the soda area. Cook food and make sure food doesnt run out when it gets busy. Its a little stressful when you have everyone telling you to do more than one thing at a time.
good,Working at chipotle is a great experience. They have helped mold me into the woman I am today. They have helped me have a better control over my attitude and how to solve problems without getting upset
good,"overall great place to work, gets really busy at Sandy location be ready for that. Easy to learn how the setup works and everyone is very caring and fun!"
good,"The days were long, and stressful, but the environment with the guests and workers was fun and fast paced. There was always something to do and I loved it."
good,chipotle provided a foundation as to which i can build off of. i have acquired skills and knowledge above cutting chicken and serving food that can and will take me farther in life.
good,"In Chipotle there is a culture of not being just coworkers but friends with each other, making the workplace chemistry that much better. The work environment is very friendly and welcoming to new staff members as well."
good,"This job was so much fun, but honestly a lot of hard work. They work great with your school schedule, Chipotle would pay for some of your school if you had met their hours and other things. Everyone was awesome."
good,"Can be a great place to work under the right GM. Busy, fast paced but you learn that because the guest get the food fast its not cooked fast all fresh not frozen. hardest part not letting the stress show on the line. I love making the guest smile and seeing and knowing the regulars by name."
good,Chipotle is a great place to work for those who love the interaction with guests and crew. Very positive place to work but also hard work and it is difficult to move up to higher management because it depends on the managers above you.
good,"You're employment at chipotle can offer you a multitude of opportunities from promotion in crew to management. Though the overall satisfaction and ""feeling"" of your store is based on the hard work of your management."
good,"I was able to move up the ladder quickly and was trained properly. employees are kept at around 38 hours, very limited overtime available. the location and my co-workers were good."
good,"Overall a good experience for learning the ropes behind running a business. Chipotle entrusts you with running a portion of their billion dollar company, which is an incredible feeling to have. There is a ton of opportunity for internal promotion if you're willing to step up and work for it. Don't come in expecting it to be handed to you, because Chipotle only promotes its best people."
good,learned grill I and 2 which deals with grilling of the meats and cooking of the other meals. Learned to cut chicken and steak in a professional way. The job is very enjoyable
good,"A normal day at chipotle was simple, and repetitive. But over all easy, everyone worked as a team and had simple task to do before, after and when closing. I've learned to manage people better, order trucks, and handle inventory."
good,This is one of the most enjoyable places I have ever worked. I love the people that I work with and I feel like I am truly valued as a person at this company.
good,Working here was fun because of the people I got to work with. I believe chipotle is a great company they just do a poor job and picking and choosing good examples/leaders/managers/etc. I left this job due to poor management skill and the unfairness I saw day to day. Additionally favoritism was clearly visible and they wouldn't work with my school schedule.
good,"While working at chipotle, I learned a lot of things, one of those things was working as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet different people from all around the world. The hardest part of the job was learning all the recipes."
good,"While working at Chipotle, I learned a lot about their culture. I took orders and prepared meals for customers. I also maintained a clean work environment at all times."
good,Free lunch everyday. Very friendly workplace. The environment is empowering - after just a few weeks you feel confident enough to help other employees with their work.
good,"i learned how they make their food and how they work on the inside. it was very interesting. a lot more than people think goes into making this food, and its all worth it to learn because you can take this info outside of the work place."
good,Time management was a large piece of the job description. Thorough cleaning and standards were demanded and developed. Great team work to bring the best service to customers and positive energy to the job.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Didn't have the best experiences working for this company, but it gave me a really great work ethic. Also taught me how to perform great under pressure and gave me incredible time management skills."
good,I only had issues with management. It seemed as though they weren't willing to change or work with the team to improve the store. As crew I felt disconnected from them. We also didn't get our breaks everyday and some weeks you wouldn't get it for 2 or 3 days straight.
good,"It was a great place to work. Amazing employees, customers, but the management wasn't great. Many scheduling errors and just not ran well at my first chipotle but I love the company and what it stands for and would go back."
good,I liked the company alot when i started working there but as it progressed the company seemed to not advance the managers. They would promise promotions and then it would take three times as long to obtain. You had to go find the answers for yourself and not rely on other for training.
good,"A family-like atmosphere with co-workers. Medium to high physical demand, I left every shift covered in sweat. Requires long periods of standing and lots of interaction with customers. Opportunity to advance your career. If you like a fast-paced, competitive environment, this job is perfect for you."
good,Chipotle is a good job to start with because of the high pace and environment. There is ways to advance in the company or stay way you are. The pace of the job is something that is beneficial for future jobs and to be able to work faster for closer deadlines.
good,"I've been working here for about three years. Started off as a crew member and moved up to my current position service manager. I've worked in 4 different stores one in NJ, two in FL and my current position in PA. Very challenging nevertheless extremely rewarding."
good,"Managers are great and willing to work with their employees. Feels like a family. It is not easy job and requires a lot of dedication to learn, to help and to support one another."
good,"loved my co workers"
good,"Chipotle taught me how to get through an extremely fast paced rush with a smile on my face. A normal day at Chiptole as a crew member usually consists of reporting to your station and completing your task in a clean and efficient manner. "
good,"I would work about 14 hours part time due to my school schedule"
good,"As I love to work at different work areas, Chipotle has created me to be in a fast paced area and to work hard and non stop to make my area as clean and neat as possible as well as costumer satisfaction 24/7. Great place to be at"
good,"I am excited to say that as a Kitchen manager in train I was able to gain many great knive skills, along with working amongst a very happy entergetic staff that strives forthw highest standards possible in the restaurant industry."
good,"Really learned to work as a team, as well as learning how to be a team leader. The company has a great system in allowing people to easily rise up and make good money, while successfully training their employees to do their best."
good,Everything is fast paced and precise. There are definitely advancement opportunities but it is also very competitive. People who work here have high energy and provide a friendly environment.
good,Working at Chipotle was an unforgettable experience whereas I have built relationships with customers to the point they've become my regulars. They know me by my name and I know their names.
good,"Job is okay for young adults looking to grow or make a extra buck, HOWEVER company management is very manipulative and hours rage from 10-26 which was horrible especially on a biweekly pay."
good,Great place to work if youre looking for part-time work. This job has work whenever work comes available. You work at many different stores. and if you want to travel you have the option to.
good,"The culture here was all about serving the best food possible to customers with respect for the animals, farmers, and the land. These people were my family and we worked hard to always give a great customer experience."
good,"coworkers are friendly, we all help each other out when someone is having trouble, I learned that anything is possible. The hardest part was time management."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Management works hard to have hard working people in place in order to run a productive and efficient business. A person learns every aspect of the business and feels like part of the team from the beginning. The managers care about the personal lives of their employees.
good,"- Good communication with the team"
good,"Chipotle is a fun, fast paced work place. Very organized and clean. The culture is a little too much for my taste but everything else is good. Friendly coworkers and lots of opportunity to move up. The food is fresh and seasoned with perfection."
good,"Prepared tortillas, tortilla chips, assorted vegetables and toppings for serving line  "
good,"I enjoyed working here and the people i worked with. Thorough training with a very simple system for advancement in place. Customers tend to be a little pickier because Chipotle is known to be top notch and very healthy, but very much worth the time I spent there."
good,was a really nice first job loved the environment coworkers were friendly management was excellent trained very good the most enjoyable part was making food especially folding the biggest burritos lol
good,"Great job, great facilities, great opportunity to develop customer service skills."
good,Lots of prepping for crew members and management will give you a set time to complete a certain task. The management is decent but I have learned a lot of things by working there. They do teach you ways of cutting and prepping food. The most enjoyable part about the job is the people who you are working with.
good,Poor management. Great customers and awesome crew members. Need to train managers more effectively. There need to be an assessment test before becoming a manager.
good,I enjoyed my time there but after a while I realized I couldn't trust my crew. On a typical day I am moving non stop in the kitchen making sure our food is safe and serviceable and make sure everyone is doing what they need to do.
good,On any given day you know what to look forward to. You know its going to be busy and all work is pre-assigned.  The management team is very easy to work with. Always showing and training constantly to ensure customer service.  Co-workers are prodded to help one another cross train.
good,Such a great place to work! The company is devoted to its employees and making sure that everyone has a chance of advancement. It's a promoted from within company so all your had work doesn't go unnoticed! I love the culture and the people.
good,"This Chipotle was the busiest in the area, but my coworkers and managers made it easier and more enjoyable to get through."
good,"Hard work but rewarding at times"
good,"A typical day a work , was preparing the guacamole, I had like an hour to make 7 big pans, then I was a cashier. The management needed to communicate more with the employees. But everyone worked as a team. My co workers worked good as a team we always helped each other out, the hardest part of the job was when in the line their was only two of us. I loved taking my break and having my burrito."
good,"99% of the time our day run smooth, very busy but wee work hard as a team. "
good,"Chipotle is a very  excellent place to work at for a starter job. You meet wonderful people and you're surrounded by a pretty warm environment. However a typical work day is quite busy, there is very little time to sit don, there's always a task to be completed. Being in this environment I have learned that you must work quickly and diligently. I also understood what it is like to be on the other side of customer service. While also learning what it takes to provide good customer service. I wish my managers were a bit more organized and showed more leadership.The hardest part o my job was actually during my training learning the do's and dont's. At times I felt ill-prepared and I was taught better."
good,"A fun place to work. If interested in the food industry, than Chipotle is probably an ideal place for somebody to work. Allows you to really get in-depth with the food industry and gives you a real feel on if you want to pursue it any further."
good,"Enjoyed working here. It was always busy which is something I find important for me at a job. I learned how to take criticism and how to work well with others. I did not get along with all my co workers but i learned how to work with them despite the issues. I enjoyed my job because I always felt like i accomplished something when difficulties came, which was everyday."
good,"The crew of Chipotle has been the best crew of co-workers I have ever met. They are overly kind, cheerful, fun, responsible, and extremely organized."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Working at chipotle was an amazing learning experience, it was all about the customer and making there day and ours. I loved that it was all about team work & helping to improve one another."
good,"Not a bad job to be honest just more for school kids unless your in management .There are some good people as well as employees at chipotle.This is a company and business that's great for a high school kid or college level student because its really a laid back cool eatery and hangout for students, which makes it a easy place to work."
good,"A typical day involved a massive a mount of prep, working through the rush, and then remaking all of the prep. My favorite position was definitely grill. I loved the fast pace, and the environment. Everyone got along, and the shifts went smooth. My GM taught me so many valuable lessons I still utilize to this day. She taught me: a sense of urgency, time management, interpersonal skills, Point of sales skills skills, knife skills, some management skills, clean as you go, First in first out, and so many more skills. I definitely realized my love for food here. The hardest part was getting through the rush, we got pretty busy. We always pulled though with flying colors due to our teamwork."
good,I enjoyed coming in to work on a daily because I knew I was coming into a happy environment everyday. I've learned to pick up a quick paste when your working in a restaurant. The management was very well mannered and treated everyone with the same respect. my co-workers worked very hard to keep the store clean an made sure our customers had a wonderful experience at our restaurant.The hardest part was really trying to keep up with everyone when I first started but I got the hang of it when I started getting used to it.
good,"A typical day would include:"
good,"I worked there for 3 years. I became a manager easily, it's not that hard. I got lots of help to be promoted, great career concepts and encouraging environment. The initial pay is below cost of living standard but moving up is often achieved, so the careers are self paced. Hard working environment with great benefit packages and paid breaks with free employee meals for every one. But there is no real job security. The blame game is common between stores and management and even GM get fired at random. You should probably have a backup in case. Very professional and clean environment. Very high standards."
good,"Great staff and many valued customers. Management want and needs are very inconsistent. Constantly busy and usually short staffed. However, the staff that there is are very fun and enjoyable to work with."
good,"Chipotle is full of ups and downs. On one hand, it can be very stressful and high speed. Management can be harsh and pushing. On the other hand it can be full of laughter. I have learned a lot at Chipotle, how to cook great food, clean properly and respect your crew."
good,"It was fun to work at this chipotle, the people were great, and so were the managers except for their management skills. The general Manager was not a good manager and i wouldn't recommend this job to many people"
good,"Was interesting to say the least. High clean standards was a requirement. And great customer service was also needed. Patience was made stronger, and multi tasking was perfected. Management tho needs a lot of work. While willing to help out when questions arise, would sometimes be incompetent, and almost unresponsive to constructive criticism. Difficult part of the job was mostly the customers. At times had impossible demands but were manageable. But pay was decent and ate for free every work day. Plus, hours and benefits were really good."
good,"Preparing and cooking food, working cash register, cleaning resteraunt and bathrooms, filling ice bucket, washing dishes. Managent was very manipulative and would overwork younger employee. Easy to gain raises."
good,"Satisfy customers, maintain healthy, safe, and delicious food for customers. Need the ability to plan ahead and work in a fast pace environment. Management is good with workers who are compassionate about their, and others work."
good,"The culture at the restaurant was amazing. Everyone was friendly and excited about the work. Unfortunately, the hours could get long, especially on closing shifts. Work hours were sometimes inconsistent for workers not in a management role. Hours could be extremely long for those in a management role."
good,"Great culture and great values, just needed great managers to back those standards up. Structure is required fir good management,."
good,"When I first began working at chipotle things were great, it was high energy, and everyone cared about what they were doing. After the e. coli outbreak it became a lot more stressful. Management is not the best, things are done slowly, we run out of food, and we get our schedule the day before the week starts. I believe chipotle can bounce back and it will be as fun as it once was but for now its a very stressful environment."
good,"Working for Chipotle is very hard at first until you learn how to do almost everything. I learned a lot from this company, how to mange my time and work alone and as a team. The hardest part of this job is having to be quiet when a customer is very mad, as you start working there you learn to respect each individual and as them how their day was. The most enjoyable part of working for this company is everyone that works there cares about each other and you start to love and respect each other as a family."
good,"Chipotle is a fun place to work, and although it can be very busy it is still fun. You make so many friends, and get a good workout in overtime you work. The room for advancement is huge. I went from a crew member to a manager in less than a year!"
good,Working at a fast pace and helping out customers on a daily basis. Worked side by side with other employees. A good environment to work at.
good,"Although there were many challenges on a daily basis this was a pretty fun job. Assisting the customers, meeting new people, and bumping into regular customers was always nice. I learned how to manage the cash register more, approach customers effectively, and I also was starting to learn different areas of work in the store."
good,"Every day brought itself new challenges, but not everything runs smooth in a restaurant.  The biggest thing is being open to accept and deliver honest feedback that can help to motivate and encourage the team to strive to create an extraordinary experience to our customers.  All food was prepared fresh according to the high standards that the company strictly adheres to by utilizing daily audits to ensure food quality.  The one thing that was difficult was the work to life balance, but the overall experience was definitely positive."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"An overall fun, productive, and very fast paced workplace. You can make yourself at home while working there, just don't forget where you are. The people are extremely nice and they take initiative."
good,"The workplace was fun, busy and fast pace. They wanted a team full of top performers and wanted those top performers as management and to train the new staff. Working with the customers and providing a great customer experience was the most fun part of the job. Being able to learn new things and work at a fast pace was also enjoyable."
good,"As a kitchen manager, I was in charge of all employees working back of the house, which included grill and prep employees. I had to check everything they were doing was done correctly and also in charge of doing their journals in order to validate them. I had about 10 or more people working those positions, and some which did not work during my shifts, which made it difficult for me to keep up with their progress."
good,"the management is a bit lazy, but always has your best interest. The work is hard but well worth it. There are plenty of opportunities for advancement"
good,"I started at Chipotle in March, when staff was very slim. Hours were long and hard, and there wasn't much room to move up since there was no one under me. However, this has since changed. With new hires comes new opportunities to learn, but management can't make up their minds."
good,"I learn a lot of new way to cut and ways to pre-p, handling with knife  everyday and grill was different. The management was trying their best to make it better. my co-workers were great i miss them. The hardest thing in my job was to cut the cilantro, but i was able to accomplish and was the easy at the end. The best part was meeting new people and making them happy by making great food and fresh as a grill person that a big responsibility."
good,working at Chipotle Mexican Grill kept me on my feet most of the time my coworkers were nice mostly. Management was a bit impatient but generally helpful. and free food while i worked was definitely a plus!
good,"Working at Chipotle was fun, every day was a new experience. I learned to do a lot of things on the fly and had a lot of skills taught to me in my brief time there."
good,Organic healthy enviroment for staff and customers. Manage clean safe and fun workplace. Hardest part of job was lack of management. Most enjoyable learning different techniques how prepping food.
good,Begin by preparing all the items served. We make them fresh daily. Very important to have dependable employees. If one is missing it creates a negative ripple effect.
good,"Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. It wasn't much of a bad experience. had to quit for personal reasons, some complications with the managers had happened but it's good overall"
good,"Fast-paced environment but with fun coworkers. Management is good at running place, but not so supportive. Expected to know what to do without being asked."
good,Giving great customer service while making high quality food. I learned how to stay calm in a very high paced environment. The management was good and expected high quality at all times. Co-workers were motivated most of the time. The hardest part of the job was staying on pace at rush hours of the day. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people.
good,"I learned my customer service skills from working here providing friendly, quality customer service to each Chipotle customer I worked on the line and as a cashier. I also lovd being around my coworkers and my managers working toward"
good,"a typical day at chipotle would be opening up the store preparing the food an getting things in order before opening. I learned a lot of new skills like how to use a grill an a fryer how to put in large orders for the store an I learned how to always empower your teammates.My co-workers were awesome . There wasn't any hard parts of the job, an the most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with people who actually cared about my future"
good,Chipotle is an awesome place to work if you like people.  The atmosphere is upbeat and exciting daily.  My interaction with the customers is Stellar.  I try my best to make their visit a pleasant and memorable one.
good,"Constantly always making more money, I've learned how to work in a face paced environment , my co workers are very friendly and easy to work with. Dealing with difficult customers and management the most enjoyable time is working with my co workers who hae become my friends."
good,Constant customers come in and love the energy they give. The managers are there when they need you the most. The only bad thing is about the tips getting situated.
good,the atmosphere is fun and working your way up to a manager position can be acquired in a short time depending on your dedication.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,is a great company to work for and great clothes. Hours can be long and days as well. great group of employees. would want to be paid a little more for efforts or experience.
good,"A typical day at work consists of coming in at least thirty minutes early to get my shift organized. I am in charge of getting prep done, sending breaks, inventory counts, cash audits, end of the night deposits and paperwork, training, and on the service line work as well. The higher management really cares about the employees, which is a huge bonus. I really enjoy my general manager because she challenges me in a good way. I love all my employees like family, Their are some personal challenges I have with one co-worker that I have tried to fix but it doesn't seem to be working."
good,Chipotle provides a lot of great opportunities for advancement and I have grown and developed so much with this company. I support everything that this company stands for and enjoy even the busiest day at Chipotle! Promoting from the bottom up empowers everyone to work harder.
good,"Enjoy my time working there in the ""Chipotle""culture. Learned to be more time conscience. The atmosphere at times was heavy, other than everything else was kosher."
good,"I would start off the day by completing the already known tasks to do before opening. Throughout my shift I did a lot. Including taking care of the cash handling & customers, I restocked, cleaned & maintained the lobby & bathrooms. Also I would work the phones & complete online orders. Chipotle has very high standards in cleanliness. I personally really love that so I kept things very clean & very organized. Management was very kind here & always willing to show you extra tips to help you out. The hardest part was probably having so many managers just because sometimes you'd have multiple people telling different ways on how to do one thing."
good,"*Every day at Chipotle was very systematic. We new exactly what to do every day."
good,A great entry-level job that provides a well rounded experience. This company gives different experience in different areas .
good,"awsome place to work we kept are costumers very happy by moving quickly and staying positive. we made sure the store stayed cleaned and nice for costumers! my main job was frontline, and back of house preping or doing inventory and taking out the trash and seeing everyones needs, worked at this chipotle off 42 and cedar for 8 months proud i worked there its the number one chipotle in minnesota!"
good,"opening the store, food prep, cleaning. The management was always up in the air when I was there.I enjoyed the quality of the food. My co workers were supportive. I learned to really work as a team."
good,"I had lots of problems in the beginning but it started to get a little better. i tried really hard to move up but they gave every one from new hires to every one else a chance to move up when i was busting my chops,and giving the best service in their store but all together i would say only certain kind of people belong their.if you an work while they give your ceidt away and fault you for others mistakes even if that person admits it then chipotle is for you."
good,"Chipotle's job culture highly depends on the kind of employees it has. Everday has potential to be fun, productive and quick. Naturally, crisis management is vital to how the manager sees you. Management can be a bit scatter-brained, but ultimately shows care for its workers."
good,"Chipotle taught me so much about the food industry along with a lot about myself. the longer you're employed there the more stressful things seem to get, or at least at my location. The people become like you're family at chipotle the atmosphere is wonderful and positive. The managers are really good at teaching you to reach your full potential and shaping the crew into a team of top performers. At my specific location we were vastly understaffed so it has become very difficult and stressful. there doesn't seem to be much time to have a life outside of work. the prep is time consuming and difficult to master the time limit they give on most tasks (such as guacamole, and morning prep for salsas etc..) "
good,"Chipotle is a very fun place to work where you enjoy coming back to work each day. One of the most rewarding jobs you can ever ask for with a lot of opportunity to move up. There is no downtime which is a big positive for many people, but that is probably the hardest part of the job."
good,"Provide friendly and responsive customer service."
good,"Working here is really crazy, you never have a normal day. There are days were you really want to leave because of how rude and crazy the customers are, but there are days were I actually love being there. Management is awesome, I get along with all of them. Half of them were crew when I started there so I became really close with them. Everyone there are my big family. But its hard because there really strict on everything, especially if you want to move up."
good,"It was an interesting job but quite stressful for a decent pay. I wasn't sure if I could work there any longer due to schedule kept changing randomly, general management need to be refined, couldn't stand watch how they cook the foods while our customers believe that it is very healthy and such like that. It bothers me greatly because I am personally a chef, currently studying at Culinary school"
good,"working at chipotle taught me a lot about organic food and how important it is to keep fresh and cooked to perfection also how it helps other carry a healthy eating life style. I would typically run the kitchen alone after making sure all the delivered foods are properly stored in the walk in using the FIFO method (first in first out) properly labeling and dating each product stocked. After that task is done i would attach gas valves and lighting pilots for the stove, grill, and fryer. After making sure all equipment was properly turned on i would spend time prepping finely cut cilantro using my intermediate cutting skills, peppers and onions for fajitas and cooking big batches of rice to store in a hot box held at a proper hot holding temperatures. multitasking was a must at this job because i would be cooking  at least six things at a time and cutting meat into 1/4 of an inch squares to keep the portions controlled on time when the line needed the food to assemble on the line. i would serve way over 400 people during a time span of maybe 4 hours and the best part about my work day was always seeing satisfied customers who truly enjoyed the food that i made."
good,Chipotle was a job where there was little to no down time. The rush from customers always kept me on my feet and working consistently. I learned how to work with others as a team and how to also as an individual make sure I'm doing my part and completing my own task. Hardest part was being able to multitask multiple responsibilities while also attending to customers and helping coworkers.
good,"A typical day at that work place was always busy, but it felt good. Having great customer service and patience is definitely a plus, and always keeping the past steady but fast. The management was good, best I've seen since my first job as a junior in high school. They make sure that everything is where it should be and everyone is doing what they're assigned to do, unless they're told differently. In all honesty, everything about that job was easy. All you had to do was keep it moving and do what you're suppose to do. The most enjoyable part about that job was that, we were able to get laughs out and yet keep it professional still. Also the fact that they had a goal as a whole team to always strive for more."
good,"People are easy to work with while the job responsibilities can be a little challenging at times.  It would be nice change of pace if there were a male manager on the team.  Learned about timeliness with responsibilities, maintaining a healthy work environment, and how to provide excellent costumer service."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"My day at work consisted of prepping fresh foods for the front line, then immediately transferring to the dish washing area for the remainder of my shift. I learned to use a kitchen knife properly in this field. My manager was excellent. Very professional, yet also friendly. My co-workers were friendly, although I wasn't fluent in Spanish. The hardest part of that job was keeping caught up on the massive quantities of dishes produced. The most enjoyable part of that job was spending time in a different atmosphere, with a diverse group of people."
good,"Typical day at work would be clocking in and the going to your assigned station of either cashier, or burrito/bowl maker, dishes, grill, or fax. Every time a customer walks in you welcome them and ask what they would like to eat and then what would they like in their burrito or bowl. Pretty simple until customers complain that they ""didn't get enough meant in their bowl or burrito"". The management is good but communication sometimes gets lost between other managers. The hardest part of the job is portioning enough food to the eye but the right amount that chipotle gives and the most enjoyable part is keeping the customers happy and having quick small talk with them."
good,"nice and work hard ,,i learned a lot how to work with customer ,cash and sale."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be come in, prep food, wash dishes and talk somewhat to co-workers. I learned alot from Chipotle especially for it being my first job. I learned time management, some costomer service skills and great team work skills. The management was superp at Chipotle because they were very friendly supportive, and liked to play around, but when it came down to business they really got there stuff done. My co-workers were fun reliable and helped me every step of the way to thrive in Chipotle. There were two things that were hard about that job and they were not being  able to keep up with their very fast paced time schedule and not being able to see my family as much as I wanted because working all the way to 11:00 pm or 12:00 am would make me sleep all day till 4:00 pm which was the time I had to go to work. The Most enjoyable part of that job were my co-workers for the fact that even though the working enviroment was stressfull, they always made it fun and enjoyable."
good,A typical work day for me is to come in prep and make the guacamole.  Look on the schedule to see what station im gonna be working at.  Go to my station after wrapping up and day dotting the guacamole.  While at my station I make sure my area is clean and stocked and my pans are presentable full and neat.  If a customer arrives give him/her the best possible customer service and take their order. The hardest part of the job is getting yelled at by the management and having to be critisized about the smallest mistakes.  The most enjoyable part of the day is knowing you made someone's day a little more enjoyable with great customer service.
good,"I worked at this company for a brief time, but while I was there I have never seen such a driven group in all the jobs that I have had. There were always goals that were set that needed to be met or beaten. There was a time and place for everything and everyone in the company. There was a large room for growth within the company. Many people while I was there moved their way up in management very quickly."
good,"One Of The Most Fun Places to Work, Get Along With The Co Workers, Fast Pace Movement, Really Learned And Gain Experience, Managers Work With You And HelpYou With Your Needs."
good,Overall it was a good experiance and I enjoyed my time there but it requires a lot of hard work. Personal development may be slow depending on management. 
good,"I learned how to make different recipes for sides and main entrees.  Co-workers were good made some friends, management needed some redoing."
good,Great stepping stone for me. Learned a lot in customer service and cash handling.
good,The enjoyable part of this job is my staff and my cooking. I love me staff and i love how my regular customers loves it when im the manager on duty they know the food would be perfect.
good,"Learned great management skills, customer service abilities and how to work in an extremely fast paced environment while being very detail oriented."
good,making and preparing food
good,"A typical day of work at Chipotle included cleaning equipment and food preparation. While working at Chipotle I learned about how important it is to examine the operations of a business. Chipotle really pushed for efficient operations within each of its retail locations, which has completely altered the way I handle obligations both in my personal life and in the workplace. The hardest part of working at Chipotle was that most of the work is tedious, routine jobs that can become boring. The most enjoyable part of coming into work everyday was the diverse culture that Chipotle provides to its employees; I learned a lot about Hispanic culture and how to better communicate with people of different ethnicity."
good,"My typical day was from 7am - 4pm on weekdays and 4pm - close on weekends. It was almost always busy throughout the day, but the were sometimes when business slowed down a bit. I didn't work at Chipotle for long but in the time i was there I learned a lot about proper food care, preparation, and management skills. During my training and throughout my employment with them all the managers were extremely helpful with teaching me everything i needed to know. My co-workers were the greatest, everyone was always smiling and in a very cheerful mood. The hardest part of my job was having to keeping up with the customers for hours at a time. The most enjoyable part for me was being able to interact with customers and co-workers."
good,"A typical day involved getting there early for prep and any extra clean up before the lunch rush comes. Its incredibly busy and hectic, but with a good team everything goes smoothly. I leaned how to work better with a team and alone with management. The hardest part of the job is managing multiple tasks simultaneously. I loved being able to get together with others for a common goal."
good,A typical day at Chipotle is chaotic and fast.Its fun at the same time as well as learning.There are a lot of different ethnic groups that work there so you get to know people from all walks of life. The management is okay wouldnt say the best but its a enjoyable job if you make it. The hardest part about the job is working on the line at a fast pace serving customers in a assembly line.
good,"I came in everyday and made sure that everything was prepped and everyone was ready before we open the door. Once doors were open we started off slow for the first 45 min. After that thelunch rush came in. We did anywhere from 150 to 200 people and hour with a avg. lunch hour of 1,500. once the rush was over we began prepping for the night shift where the same thing happened again."
good,"A typical day at work, first we had to prep all of the food for the morning rush. Second, we had to greet the customers and make them feel comfortable. During the day sometimes, we would have to leave the line and prep more food. I've learned a lot just being there a couple of months. Everybody that I worked with was just so friendly and welcoming to a new person coming in. The hardest part of the job was the lunch rush when they line never stopped. The most enjoyable part of the job was seeing new faces come through those doors everyday,"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"This kitchen is very strict and not many people in the kitchen are happy, unlike most kitchen jobs."
good,This was a great job at first. I loved the atmosphere and the pay was (and still is) great! Now I am completely burned out! If you make the manager mad expect less hours the next week or possibility another job.
good,"Great work place, great hours, chances for overtime, the pay can be better but if you love to cook this is a great place to start because advancement opportunities are great."
good,"How they make their food, their superior hygienic standers, and the atmosphere makes chipotle a wonderful place to work at. Because of their high standers for food and the cleanness of their restaurant, it also makes it a very labor intensive job."
good,line backer
good,"Working with Chipotle was excellent for on the job training. Most locations were very effective with this, not only for crew positions but for developing managers from with in. Must have attention to detail, border line OCD."
good,Not always a good sense of direction from the top created a lot of confusion and rework at the bottom.
good,love it. the enviroment was good. they always hiring good friendly people
good,"Primary duties consist of taking orders, preparing meals, packaging food items, and ringing up customer purchases. Secondary duties for Chipotle crew members include preparing food and ingredients, opening and closing the store, and cleaning."
good,"It’s really a great job, I regret quitting, they really don’t give a lot of hours throughout the week which is really annoying because you aren’t making any Mooney but overall it’s a really good"
good,I had an alright experience working at Chipotle Mexican Grill. Although when I initially started working there the general manager was not very communicative. Later I got a different manager who was much more willing to work with me.
good,"Food prep has to be my favorite thing to do so far, everything is simple and the tasks include booklets in case we have questions and even then the managers are very helpful."
good,"Great benefit program including tuition reimbursement, but the job is physically demanding and since most employees are young there is sometimes a lack of responsibility"
good,Great company to work for and has plenty of opportunities. They promote from within. They also have educational assistance for all employees from hourly to salary.
good,I love working at chipotle with all my heart and it’s mostly because of the people. I wouldn’t trade the people I work with for anything in the world.
good,"Would recommend as a starting job, not much opportunity for advancement unless there for a long period of time.  Good for developing a multitude of skills."
good,Chipotle is great if you enjoy working with food for a good pay. Can be demanding if you close. If you struggle there is help that you can receive. You must really care about your work because the food is held to a high standard.
good,A typical day at work involved in the am coming in opening my station before open then working non stop from open to the time I had to leave between 3 and 4. Nights involved coming in at 3 or 4 and working until close and closing tht station I worked line cash and prep. Cash I worked the most and is the most natural. Chipotle it is a very fast pace job showing me how to work fast and efficient while also having good hospitality and a smile on my face the whole time
good,"I enjoyed working there everyone was extremely nice, it was always fun if you were willing to put forth the effort to help contribute to the team.i highly reccommend"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Working there can be very overwhelming when it comes to customers and always keeping up, but you usually will have help. The management is kind of hit or miss you either love or hate your managers there isn’t really and inberween."
good,"I learned how to prep meals, cook, have better organization. I wanted to learn how to manage a restaurant, but management did not want to teach me because they felt like they had enough management."
good,"It’s really fun and organized but not evey chipotle is alike so chose which you work at carefully. The managers are great at this location, they make sure everyone is trained properly and take care of everyone."
good,"If you are a hard worker, there is a tremendous opportunity for growth and advancement. The company also offers great benefits. "
good,Hiring new people need to be taught to have a good work ethic. It’s a team based job. You have to work together with everyone doing there tasks. When everyone gets their job done the day goes by smooth.
good,"I have such a love hate relationship with Chipotle. Obviously, the best part is the free food. The worst part for me is work drama and running out of items due to poor management. Otherwise, the job is pretty good. As long as the costumers get what they want they’re happy. I’d recommend the job to someone who doesn’t have a negative/lazy mindset and can stay calm during occasions of high stress."
good,Always have smiling co-workers and very energetic managers. Team oriented and very detailed oriented. Good customer service is a great skill to ensure all customers are leaving happy.
good,"This is a good place to work, management was always understanding and gave good tips to beginners. Job roles can change any minute so you had to be prepared to adopt a new role."
good,"I enjoyed working at chipotle, the people you work with are the best and it is easy to make new friends at work because it is such a group effort type of job."
good,"Each station is different and comes with different challenges to the day, As a cashier, the day is pretty fast paced and energizing. Sometimes it can be difficult to deal with certain customers, but at the end of the day, it's a great position. You get to manager your time yourself and are always on your toes, cleaning and keeping customers happy."
good,"I've learned how to balance my work, and also multitask very well. It was very busy most of the time but they were very helpful. The hardest part about Chipotle was the rude customers. Sometimes it was very overwhelming but i got through it."
good,Awesome company to work for. Great pay and benefits. But u have to be willing to move from store to store to help out if you are considered a strong employee/ manager. Upper management is very underhanded if you aren’t willing to switch stores when they want you to.
good,The management was disorganized but other than that I enjoyed my time there. My coworkers were kind and everything went pretty smoothly. A typical day at work was working at the cash register and cleaning up after customers.
good,Need more money its nice good environment.. Wake up make everything salsa wise then work cash. Spent most day working as hard as possible. Everything about this place is okay
good,Chipotle offers a lot of management opportunities and open up new locations every 2 days. There are approximately 2500 management opportunities every year.
good,Working at Chipotle was always a busy day but the people I worked with made it feel like nothing. I learned how to be efficient and neat at the same time as well as showing good customer service. The management was good there they were VERY flexible with my college class schedule. The culture there was very fun! Everyone got along well which made work fun and quick. The hardest part of the job was working from 4-12 with no break. However the most enjoyable part would be closing we would all be in our own zone or talking and just get the cleaning done at the end of the night.
good,"Working at chipotle, or any fast food restaurant is an experience that I feel many kids should have. The work environment is very friendly and supportive. My co-workers and I started getting along while I was still in training so I really helped me feel like I belonged."
good,I can say that the Chipotle crew definitely became like a family to me. We always lent out a helping hand and even a shoulder to cry on when the days were busy and overwhelming. Maybe about 3/5 managers genuinely cared about their crew.
good,Friendly environment. Learned how to prepare and serve food. Management can sometimes be slightly frustrating. Typical day at work consists of following a routine to get everything prepared before the store is open.
good,"Everything was great until I took a survey asking where I’d envisioned myself in the future. I was in school working there part time and a great employee, but I wasn’t a great fit anymore because I had bigger dreams than becoming a manager at Chipotle.. hence I was let go ."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"You get free meals every time you work, you have to try your food before serving it to customers! Everyone in the team helps each other! You learn as you go."
good,"Chipotle is a great place to work, especially as a first job. Great guidelines and guides to help with almsot everything. Free food and paid breaks also makes this a worth it kinda job. Lately have heard and witnessed poor managment plays. I learned a lot of new skills in this job such as preparing,cooking, and cutting techniques."
good,"It was a fun job with co-workers. Everyone is chill and laid back, but you had to be hardworking and driven to complete everything. You had to know how to time manage everything."
good,Working there you need patience at all timing. Being quick and choosing your actions is mainly important. Customer service to be recognize every moment of the day.
good,Working in the kitchen at Chipotle can be tiring but its always fun to learn and experience new things and how to handle food wisely. Workers at Chipotle are very friendly and understanding and this is where i learn most of my restaurant skills.
good,The job isn’t hard itself. Everyday during dinner time you have to be in your assigned spot for one hour while the little rush comes through. There’s room to grow.
good,"Chipotle is a great place to work if you are looking for a part time job while in school. They offer flexible schedules for students, and they all want to see you succeed"
good,I enjoyed my time here overall but it was time to move on. Chipotle hired me leading with the fact that they didn’t judge people based on their back ground but that was the same reason they didn’t allow me to advance in the company. I just felt like it was time for some thing different.
good,Customers can be difficult it's like that with anything the overall experience is very good. My coworkers and I got along very well everyone was very encouraging and friendly.
good,I loved the people i worked with i am friends with many to this day. It was a great learning experience and there are many things learned i will always carry with me.
good,"Being in Hoboken means the store is usually busy. As long as you're attentive and willing to learn new things at all the times, the job is only stressful at some points. Management is great and is always trying to work with you. Alot of management opportunities and all around one of the better Chipotles in the area."
good,"Great management but poor compensation. It's busy consistently and the workplace culture is amazing. The hardest part of it was when it'd get super busy and I had to move around and be fast in cooking when I'd be cooking and making sure the foods never ran out. Overall, it was a good experience and so much things I've learnt from."
good,"Chipotle Mexican Grill is a great place to work at. Fast paced environment. Never a dull moment, whether your son the grill, salsa, dishwashing or even cashier. Even when there’s no guest in the restaurant, there’s something to do."
good,I learned how to cut vegetables in large amounts as well the importance of  washing your hands after every task to eliminate cross contamination i also learned how to make customers feel welcomed by greeting them when i was in charge of lobby duty.
good,Regardless of the management all chipotle have the type of crew where it's easy to converse with them and make a connection which makes your time working there that much easier because everyone is committed to the same goal.
good,"Chipotle is an extremely faced paced work environment, but they train very well and teamwork is very important. You get to learn many tricks and they promote from within."
good,"It was decent, each store is different so it can be hard to say what is good or bad because it all depends on the team that you work with such as the GM, managers, and crew"
good,"Great place to learn work ethic and build on customer service skills. Opportunity for advancement but depends largely on the current management in the restaurant as well as the needs of the company at that time. Always something to learn and keep you busy. Great place to practice culinary techniques such as knife skills, food safety procedures, and high volume food preparation under pressure."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Fun place to work with the right people, can get very hectic very quickly. Fast paced, with food preparation for the day and good managers who do their jobs right."
good,I worked at chipotle for a year and a half it was a great time. Mangers feel like friends than bosses building friendships is a most. Fast passed work.
good,It’s a very fast paced job. U always have to be ready an have a great attitude. Even though sum of the customer can be very mean u have to keep ur cool
good,"The job itself is extremely easy, people are fun to work with assuming they showed up for their shift (which hardly happened), the company cares about their employees. The shifts are not crazy long, food is discounted or free, and it's very easy to move up in the company if that is your goal. The starting pay for me was well above minimum wage and can be increased quarterly, or again, if you're looking to move up in the company."
good,"Chipotle was a fun place to work at over all. Very quick paced, and it was great free food. Down sides were very young staff didnt take job seriously."
good,"At work I was given many task such as cooking, cleaning, and labeling food to keep inventory. It was enjoyable being part of a team that cares for you outside of work. Management was great made sure everyone was always on task."
good,I have worked for chipotle for 5 years and has been an experience. Chipotles culture revolves around training and promoting from the inside. It has been a great experience.
good,"It is fairly easy to become acquainted with policies and procedures, management is great. They work with you when it comes to scheduling. During morning shift and lunch the store will stay very busy. Only slowing down around 1:30-2 pm"
good,The job itself is alright I don’t mind it I’m used to it and all. And the environment isn’t bad at all either I actually enjoy it. There’s diversity and it gets very business. Just a little hectic. But overall it’s pretty cool.
good,"Hoping to seek for newer opportunities. 19 years young and hungry to work. I do everything from serving on the line, doing prep, dealing with the register, and working on grill. I’ve been dedicated to chipotle’s standards and regulations for the past 3 years."
good,"When I started working at Chipotle, I started off on the line position meaning I was in the front of the house. Usually when I started my shift, the opening shifts have already set the line up so my job was to just help the customers down the line. My managers were great but they didn't really teach new positions which the pro in that was, you'd get better on the position you're assigned. The con is that sometimes people do call off and they don't have enough trained people to cover a certain position. This has happened a lot at this particular store. That's how I learned 2 extra positions. The benefits are great if you're looking for this to be a long term job. It's a great place for entry level work. You gain a lot of skills that'll help you in the future."
good,If a good company with a lot of benefited and opportunities if you start from crew. But at the moment you become a general manger is not much opportunities to keep growing.
good,"I worked at Chipotle for 10 months and I had a great time working there. Some may attribute that to the fact that I am a man as I hear that harassment was a rampant issue among the young (18-20 y/o) girls I worked with. I really enjoyed the work and the food here and, if I could have, I would have kept working here for even longer."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle was usually packed with stressful customers and struggling to prepare all of the food on time for said customers. I learned that you have to be on top of all of your work before things get out of hand and, when things do eventually get out of hand, you're far enough ahead to stay ahead. The management of the store that I worked at was helpful and supportive. The culture of the workplace was stale, dry and repetitive. So much so that I dreaded going there to work my shifts. By far the hardest part of the job was having to deal with the hustle and bustle that came with being in charge of the food. The most enjoyable part of the job were the coworkers that I worked with, we all joked and had fun."
good,Chipotle offers a chance to make a carrier if you like restaurants Business  and grow up in the industry. You can prepare and become  a expert on food standards and customer service.
good,"the management overall was good but can change frequently depending on the store. Staff was very friendly and got along well for the most part. A typical day at work consists of arriving an hour or 2 prior to open to prepare salsa, chips, fajitas, etc. for distribution and then all hands on deck to serve customers efficiently through peak. the hardest part of the job would be the prep if you do not have good time management skills. The most enjoyable part of the job is the inclusive environment and free food. As well as the majority of manger positions ar efilled within the company so the possibility for advancement is good."
good,"There is something that always changes the day.  There are a lot of constants.  Always prepping fresh food and providing world class hospitality."
good,"Has very friendly and fun people to work with. "
good,"My typical shift at Chipotle begins at 3:15 pm. I am usually working as a cashier, which includes the upkeep of the dining room, a restocking of bottled drinks and takeout bags, and handling any cash transactions while on the clock. So far, I have learned the importance of vanity in business and friendliness amongst coworkers. The management at this establishment is very responsible and collaborative with everyone on staff. The hardest part of the job is probably closing everything down after close. We have to make sure that every part of the restaurant is ready for the opening shift the next day. The most enjoyable part of my job is surprising and delighting our customers. It makes me genuinely happy to create a positive experience for everyone around me."
good,"Chipotle is a fun, yet sometimes stressful work environment, especially when busy. One must be able to keep an attention to detail when preparing food. Entry level positions cant often lead to higher up positions."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I’ve been working at chipotle Mexican grill for almost two years now and I’ve been giving the company the best I got. I’ve recently gotten a new manager and since then my store has gone threw tremendous torcher. We constantly run out of food, fail multiple food inspections and the managers put us all against each other while picking favorites and finding excuses to fire others. If I was to ever work here again I would recommend making sure that I have a supportive staff that actually cares of what’s going on in the store."
good,"The expectations of the job were very reasonable, and most coworkers wanted to have positive relationships. There was a new general management in place and there seemed to be a growing resentment for her which made the work environment slightly more hostile. Hardest part of the job was closing in the time-frame the company wanted. Most enjoyable part of the job was working with customers, especially regulars."
good,"i would rate my work experience here a 4/5, not every place you work at is going to be perfect but the experience was amazing. i really do recommend this job for anyone looking for a decent job."
good,"Management isn't the best there and the pay isnt enough. The employees are very nice, but corporate not so much. You've some nice daily customers, then you have customers who treat us like we're nobody"
good,Great job with amazing coworkers and fun atmosphere. I got along with most of my coworkers and management team. I was given good hours with nice benefits.
good,"I am confident in saying that working at Chipotle as a first job is a wonderful way to start one's journey into the working world, especially the restaurant business. I learned how to work in a fast-paced environment, and how to communicate with other crew members efficiently."
good,Chipotle was my firs job. It was a good environment. It was fast paced during rush hour but there were still times where you could take a quick break. They give you one free meal every time you work  which is very convenient.
good,Can be busy all the time but the staff try their best to be nice and understanding. Proper training and cross training is taught here. If you can handle high pressure and enjoy the food it's for you.
good,Chipotle is a good starter job if you can move fast and proficiently. You have to have a positive attitude towards guest even if they are being rude to you.
good,Enjoyed my time working here. The hours were decent and I learned quite a bit. I’d never worked in the fast food industry and I liked that although this was fast-food there is the made fresh standard that each team member has the opportunity to be part of.
good,"It was a great, fast paced work environment that anyone could thrive on! Good culture and everyone was very friendly and hard working. They pride themselves on fresh quality ingredients."
good,"Obviously there is good and bad stores to be at but for the most part if you can get into a store in decent shape it’s a good place to work. Always something to do, lots of people to talk to and meet. Lots of team members and other managers to rely on. At the slow stores there’s a minimum of 5-6 people per shift and at the busy stores up to 14 people on one shift. Usually flexible schedule because there are usually a lot of managers 4-6"
good,Working at the top 5th chipotle in manhattan was a very busy experience. The line can go from one person ordering to 30 walking in at once at any time of day. Can get very busy but the team was very laid back and everyone got a long. We all helped out and when we were all doing our best those long lines felt like nothing. But management was being split it up and felt the pressure from management at times. But the coworkers got a long and had each others back.
good,"The best parts about Chipotle are definitely the crew, management, and the great customers. The job offers tons of opportunities and growth through every position."
good,had fun and learned alot..i was a crew memeber and was a team player helping and learning along ythe way..i would reccommend to anyone who likes food to apply
good,"The Job is ok but the pay is low, there is free food and that's why I like it. It's going to be stressful depending on the manager you have; Sometimes the customers are crazy."
good,I enjoyed working with my crew and managers. The job isn't too difficult to do but being in a fast paced environment really pushes you do work better.
good,"It was a great experience for my first job, very fast paced but great people. During my time working there we had like 4 managers, and lot of people getting fired like very quickly. Other than that great experience"
good,"Gets very busy at random hours "
good,Awsome but at the same time need more help on teaching they're employees the right way to treat all people equally.with no racism or anything to make employees or customers unwelcome.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Check you pay stubs! I never got my overtime pay after my first check. They always somehow got out of adding it. I think they were altering the timesheets even though we used clock in cards.
good,"Chipotle has awesome employees, you make friends with the employees and customers. Very fast passed and the manager doesn't think about switching you from stations. I was always in the grill and it was very stressful."
good,Every day was prepping and doing the same workflow of serving customers and keeping the restaurant clean.  The hardest part was keeping up with any hiccups that would occur.
good,"Company is great for people starting off in the culinary field, A lot of opportunities to get promoted and work your way up. You learn a lot about working in a kitchen, food handling procedures."
good,"Nothing beats getting free meals at Chipotle. Coworkers were friendly and the workplace is adaptable. Uses Aloha, which is super compatible when switching jobs."
good,"I liked working for Chipotle because it was easy to schedule work shifts in between classes and to get shifts covered if needed. Workers were allowed one free meal per shift, which was very convenient and made it so I never had to worry about working while hungry. At Chipotle, I was able to grow and improve as an employee and I saw myself becoming better at my job each day."
good,"Its a good company to work for. There is room for advancement if you really want it. Chipotle has amazing benefits. "
good,"As a highschooler, I worked four or five times a week, 6 hours a day. It was honestly quite a lot for me to handle but my team made it super fun and enjoyable. Rolling burritos were the worse."
good,"I would like to firstly note that I wasn’t properly trained technically. Talking to other ex-coworkers now I realize no one really was. But despite that some of the nicest and most helpful people work there. If you have a shift with helpful cooperative workers the shift can be even just a little easier. There was definitely very stressful and fast “peaks” that would kill my energy, especially if we were understaffed, which was often. I left because 1) the turnover rate made it so difficult for quality work, everyone quitting and getting fired left and right meant bad quality workers that would leave right after they found out the ways of the job 2) even if you had a conflict written and texted and emailed to the managers they’d still occasionally schedule you and the pressure to find someone to cover or get fired was harsh 3) managers changing often meant different strategies that were hard to keep up with and it just made it messy"
good,I liked working at Chipotle because it was a fast paced team environment. Everyone showed great team work and helped one another. My team taught me many things. I learned how to make chips and prepare meals. I learned  how to work under pressure and interact with customers. My coworkers taught me organization is really important and to keep a positive attitude.
good,"I learned a lot when it comes to food safety and handling, as well as keeping your work areas clean and preventing cross contamination, there are a lot of little things that can lead to food borne illnesses and chipotle taught me about them."
good,"Good company to start working. They provide good training, and there is a path do grow and achieve management. You can learn about time management, cooking safety, orders, customer service and how to work as a team."
good,It is a high paced job. You never stop going but you get paid a small amount compared to the amount of work that one does. Overall it is a good company but just a tiring job.
good,Pretty easy job if you ask me.  being a cook was super relaxed at my location because they were slow mostly.  The guy who trained me left and i was the only night shift cook.  it was chill
good,Great place to work with a productive and influential leadership team. Great advancement opportunities with personal training from on site managers. Developmental packages to track your progress as you learn and advance.
good,"Working at Chipotle definitely helped me stay healthy because of all the free food. I truly enjoyed the culture there. I learned that you don't always have to keep your personal life personal. I was always able to talk to my manager very openly about life. I was only 18/19 when I was working here and he would treat me like a son at times which he could see I needed it. This place has the ability to form like a family if you let it. The hardest part of the job is definitely staying healthy. If you work open a lot, you'll end up doing a lot of lifting or cutting which can take a huge toll on your wrists. When I got moved to prep/grill my wrists would hurt really bad from all the cutting even when I had a manger help me with my form. As BOH workers, you also carry the 40lb cases of chicken which could take a toll on your back as well."
good,"Managers are very nice, Food was very good but very stingy with the rice portions and double meat isn’t really doubled i would like the amount that i am paying for especially with the raised prices now."
good,I learned some nice cooking skills and got great cardio running around.The managers are a bit upsetting because they do not try to level with you if you are in a tight situation.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Absolutely loved it. I got good at what I did which was behind the grill and we all flowed incredibly well as a team providing excellent food and service. Fun time.
good,"Two shifts, one morning and one evening. Front of house always has essentially the same job, morning back will prep for the day while back does more cleaning tasks for closing. Learned many valuable kitchen skills and management is fair. You must work quickly and efficiently to survive here. The hardest part is keeping up with the inflow of customers while the most enjoyable is the people you work with."
good,"Great and kind store manager! Is flexible to your schedule. The night shift kind of stinks the way night shifts do, but as long as you have a decent manager working that night it's not the worst. Day is definitely better. The main manager makes the place great but the lower managers are just ok. Overall not a terrible place, good benefits, flexible, and yearly bonuses for people working over a year. Workers are either super young (16-22) or full on adults (35-45).  Some heavy lifting. Some super gross stuff. You will be physically exhausted at the end. But overall not bad."
good,Cool concept nice people great food all people helping and management doing what is need by properly doing their evaluations on time for the most part and getting the job done right.
good,I had to get food out fast and get dishes done fast its fast paced but you get alot done in a small amount of time. I had to FIFO which is first in first out in the walking I had to sweep and mop the walk in fridge.
good,"Offered an above minimum wage pay, and encouraged tips. Only downside is the hours can be long, co-workers can be flaky, and during rushes it’s stressful."
good,The people who work at chipotle are usually very social and fun working partners. It is usually a fun environment and is relaxed most of the time with the only exceptions being weekends and during lunch and dinner peaks.
good,"Other than the pay and hour distribution, chipotle is a very well maintained. The managers are all very engaging and really wanted to know the crew. Very solid."
good,At times did not feel like I had the support of my Team Leader. Always felt like I was going to lose my job just because of one simple thing or was not able to make mistakes to learn from.
good,"Working here is nice and fun, but after being accused of having relation with a manager, it was not the same. The crew members are fun and awesome to work with, except the one girl that accused me. One of the manager was hard on me, I felt like she would pick on me. I still respected the manager, and did what i was told to do. One thing this location could work on while I worked there is hiring more crew members. When I would on brake I would still have to help out, i didn't mind, but going on brake means you get to eat and relax for the 30 minutes. The main reason I left Chipotle was due to being falsely accused."
good,Face pace food industry to work in. Must move quick with your hands and have good memory. Taught me how to multitask and handle customers when problems occur.
good,"Many people find it an easy job, it is definitely a challenge. It requires a lot of standing on your feet for various periods of time as well as working at a quick pace."
good,The culture can be good but the company has very poor management. The service managers take advantage of employees by making them work more than they should when trying to save hours for the restaurant.
good,"Chipotle is a fast-paced, fun place to work. It is a great place for a college student to have a job. Great for working with others and improving interpersonal and customer service skills. A drawback is receiving your work schedule on a weekly basis."
good,"A typical day at work was very different but very alike all at the same time. i learned how to cook.I did inventory everyday.I learned how to close the store. I learned how to stock ,clean how to serve and talk to costumers.the work place was filled with many different people but i got along with everyone and still do. The hardest part was first learning something because you have to be fast and efficient. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting greeted every morning from everybody in the workplace. Everyone always had a good attitude."
good,My leaders at chipotle made a huge difference in my life and helped me change the way I see the world. I will never forget the standards they taught me to uphold both as a master chef and in life. I'm so thankful to have experienced working with the company.
good,"FOOD"
good,I'ts the only culture that provides high standard in restaurant.There's a chance of growth depending on  the management. It's a busy restaurant and it needs a lot of energy.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"A typical workday is busy, but you see new faces and get to interact with customers. The hardest part of the job is making sure tasks get done on time"
good,Working here has made it worth the stay. I would recommend this job to anyone who has been looking for a job to stay at for a long time. My stay here has come to end although I would definitely go back for a part time position if needed.
good,"management ruined it for me. it is fun, company has a good environment and cares about customers and crew as well. i enjoyed the fresh ingredients and being involved in almost every step of the prep process for almost all the food we serve there."
good,The free burritos every shift are a nice compensation for the stressful work environment. The line will be out the door when you clock in and will still be when you clock out. If you have good coworkers the job can be a lot of fun.
good,The employees are amazing it really has a feeling of being in a family but if its not managed correctly it becomes chaotic its always busy so it keeps you  on your toes all the time it not an easy job but it is rewarding
good,"It is a very fast paced environment, and every thing is done in a timely manner. It does get very stressful at times but that is the part that makes it more fun."
good,"I feel Chipotle encourages the growth and advancement of their crew, training for multiple positions is made available to those that show a desire to grow with the company."
good,"Chipotle is a fast food kind of environment where a ""sense of urgency"" is expected. Because you work handling food the standards for perfection are high, but the management is truly caring towards the employees (you get 100% cotton work shirts, employee meals, insurance, management is graded on employee happiness, etc). I was fired because the store manager and I didn't get along, but other than that I would've continued to work at Chipotle for a year."
good,"Even tho we do the same thing everyday, no day is the same to the next or previous day. Chipotle is a really fun place to work in. You just need amazing training and know your role."
good,Working grill is fun and tough. It is a little challenging at first keeping up with the pace but after a while things start to form a habit and it get easier as you go.
good,"Great working environment, and great crew experience. Rude customers and unfair crew treatment by management. Grew co workers and team. Pay could be better."
good,It’s horrible and to demanding. The 10 minute break isn’t enough for all of the work you have to do. All of the coworkers are either friendly or rude.
good,I really enjoyed working in the food industry. It was different from Lifeguarding but in a new and exciting way. It still had the customer service element so I was familiar with that aspect.
good,"It was alright, in college, living with parents, it's faced paced, but we get free food, thats great. The food is good. The tips are divided equally among everyone."
good,Used to be a great place to work. But company culture has changed. Very strict food safety procedures. zero tolerance policy on working while sick and giving wellness checks.
good,"I had a great time learning cooking techniques and making new friends, but the amount of stress they heap onto their low-level management was not worth the pay."
good,"A typical day at work during the mornings I was in charge of prepping food and making sure things were ready for people during the PM shift. Secondly, i was in charge of opening and making sure things were in top shape for use during the AM shift"
good,I didn't get along with one manager he threatened my job the first day i met him and later on i was fired while other praised me for my hard work and commitment. The job culture was amazing and i loved working there but in my honest opinion he ruined it for me.
good,got me through school and a small amount of savings.  it was not far from my house and i liked the food discount as i am a foody to the tenth degree. yay
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotle values integrity and precision, in a high functioning restaurant the lettuce is green and the rice is to die for. Excellent teamwork from co-workers helped me climb the ladder to success from day one. Would not recommend this job to anyone who knows they're a slacker. Would recommend to someone that doesn't mind doing a lot of work for minimum wage."
good,"It was great working at chipotle, there were a lot of benefits, employees got a free bowl daily and a 50% discount for meals. I had some good managers."
good,It was overall a great working experience but it wasn't in the field of my career and I felt like I was stuck in one position and was not moving forward to anything else. Great sense of aura and great customer service for our guests.
good,"Usually I would clock-in in the morning and start working on prepping food.  Before 11 I would be finished with my prep, then I would goto break before the rush.  During Rush, everyone would stay in their positions and no prep work would be done.  When the rush was over we would start prepping for the next shift and clean up as well.  "
good,"The management isn’t really put together. I work part-time because I’m in high school and they’re always messing up my schedule and expects me to find replacement for my days, even though I send a personal availability scedule a MONTH is advance because my life is so packed. I’d like better management."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle is very busy. With no downtime, expect to be moving for your whole shift. There are always opportunities to pick up more hours, and the company is expanding faster than it can staff for. Always hiring, fairly high turnover rate, as some people don't understand what high standards actually means."
good,"enjoyed working with mass amount of people from all over, fairness with employees, great time, no butting heads with people, positive atmosphere!!!!!!!!"
good,The co workers were fun to be around. But it was always very busy and we normally didn’t get any down time. I really didn’t get any breaks but they paid really good
good,"There’s been a lot of times that the work place has been fun and exciting to be with. Especially working hard with people that are willing to work hard with you. It can be pretty hard and stressful sometimes if it’s not managed correctly, or if it’s really busy and there’s not enough people. Over all you get free meals everytime you work so you can’t complain about that!"
good,"A typical day at work consisted of providing excellent customer service and stocking the food for the day. I learned how to have positive work relationships and food safety. The management was poor and involved themselves too much in their employees personal lives. The workplace culture was amazing, it truly felt like a family experience. The hardest part of the job was the scheduling and dealing with management. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to work with fun coworkers."
good,This is a great part time job while you are going to school and need the extra cash on the side. Most people working there are young and also go to school.
good,Chipotle is a company that encourages you to take on more and more responsibility the longer you are there even if you are not in a management position. They do like to encourage everyone to aim for management but the possibility of EVERYONE becoming managers is unlikely. You get a review every six months that will depend on how much of a raise you can get but it is unlikely that it will ever be over 50 cents at a time.
good,"Chipotle has a lot of safety rules in place that create some slightly annoying procedures to follow during the job- but they also can't afford another food safety mishap, so it's understandable. nothing they ask for is difficult or hard- it's just procedural. There are a few issues with finding and keeping good employees and managers but being at a new location might be the heart of that problem, so this may not apply to all locations. There will be cuts and scratches, and times you may just want to scream- but having good staff helps with that."
good,"Overall chipotle was a great place to work, I learned a lot of valuable skills, I have a great assortment of kitchen skills including meat prep, grill work, and knife skills. The crew is usually really good and hard working, everybody pitches in to help each other, and the main goal is serving the best food we can in the cleanest restaurant possible."
good,chipotle makes everything fresh everyday. mornings were early but went quickly once opened. lunch and dinner rushes will have lines past the doors so moving quickly on the line is a must. the people you work with have good intentions and are always there for you.
good,"I learned a lot about food safety and excellent customer service. Chipotle was one of the best places i have worked in terms of how they treat employees. I was never expected to work sick, and had many benefits."
good,"Needs  more work on management. The job is good, just wasn't pad enough for the stuff I had to deal with. The best part of the job is the free food ..."
good,This was a fun place to work. It takes a lot out of you. If you work there in the future its going to take a lot of effort to work. The place is always busy.
good,"This was one of my very first job, so i enjoyed it very much. Working at Chipotle taught me patience as well, it gave me my first real-world experience."
good,"Very fun workplace and think it would be a great job for a high school or college student. the starting pay is above minimum wage but be prepared to work if you are employed at a busy store, and night hours tend to run later than expected."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Fast-paced environment, sometimes stressful, yet easily adaptable. Fun environment and fun people to work with; team environment; room for advancement within"
good,get all tasks done before opening time and before you leave your shift. I learned more customer experience and hot handle different tools. the hardest part about the job was getting stuff done in time due to short staff
good,Overall chipotle was a great company to work for. I enjoyed every minute of it and i learned a little of the business side and how to get a long with others.
good,I honestly had the most fun at a job I've ever had when working for Chipotle. Management was stern but had a relaxed approach in the best kind of way.
good,I enjoyed the people the atmosphere my team was my family. It got a bit personal when they let me go and that is my main reason for the score. The hours were being shortened and I believe my audits are the reason for the departure but that wasn’t said directly. The hardest part of working there was the position if multiple people are doing the same position chances are your hours will be cut. My heart was too big to charge people extra for chicken anyway 🤷🏾‍♀️
good,"I was a part time worker in high school during the time and during my time here, I only worked 4 hour shifts, sometimes not even that if the restaurant was slow, I was always the one sent home early. I loved my co workers, my managers, everyone was lovely, but I only managed to work 2-4 days a week which meant only working a maximum of 16 hours in a week, When I asked for more hours I was denied. Overall I loved working there, the hours were the only frustrating thing."
good,"the hardest part was just keeping up with the traffic in the restaurant but  because of how fast we worked and how well we all worked together time went by so fast and made the job that much more enjoyable. Working at chipotle is all about working as a team, it taught me how to work well with others. overall very upbeat workplace and the people there were always nice."
good,"While working in chipotle, I have learned and gain team experience and work experience as well. Although management could be rough at times it is still very manageable and very flexible."
good,The job is great if you are working your way through school or you have just graduated college and need a starter with possible advancement. Outside of that I would not recommend if you are trying to make a living.
good,The employees of Chipotle were serious about their jobs and they id their best at keeping each other in line. There were no weak links in the crew and the food was delicious
good,Typical day for a GM at chipotle was coming in to see how the restaurant was running financially and customer service wise. Talking with your team and see how they are feeling. You would get your team prepared for the rush service which was always slammed and face pace but was fun working side by side with your team to give those customers a unique experience.
good,"Chipotle is a great company to be a part of. When working for Chipotle, it is more than just a job or a paycheck. Working for Chipotle is like being part of a huge family that all have the same goal of having drive to deliver excellent service to customers, in many different ways."
good,"This company went from great to good, stressing on all the wrong things, and they went from a company where you can challenge others on things you thought were wrong to a company that was ""do what I say because I can't explain why we do things like this""."
good,"Very quick working environment, everything has a time and place when it must get done, and dishes stack up quickly for prep people if they don't have good time management which is a necessity there."
good,I loved.                              working at chipotle but my last Gm was horrible. Besides that it’s a really good first job and job for a Career.
good,"Really fun, exciting place to work. Never had any isues with anyone, all in all the best place to work in my point of view. Just gotta manage a little better to its full potential."
good,Learned how to have great costumer service. Managers seemed to not be able to focus on their crew members. Working with co workers here are really fun to work with.
good,good place to work if you are college student and in need of work experience. the environment is great but for someone with a degree and being there for a while the pay isn't worth it anymore.
good,"Working at Chipotle is very fast-paced. There is a lot of prep to be done, all while executing food safety and creating an excellent guest experience. Being a manager, I lead shifts and created a daily deployment chart, letting crew members know what they are prepping and what position they are deployed for the day. The hardest part of the job is the throughput of the long line of customers, while staying on top of prep tasks. I enjoy working with crew members and meeting goals and having fun everyday."
good,Do your job don't get fired. chipotle is as easy as it comes if working is what you do best. they offer a lot of benefits. job advancement. and free employee meals.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Being my first job, overall it was a great experience but it had its downs. The original crew that hired me has taught me the original culture of Chipotle. This dwindled when the original crew slowly left me. The shifts were stressful as we were a busy store. The hardest part of the job was the intense shifts when it got busy, but it was also enjoyable. Overall it had its perks but also had its cons"
good,"stressful job, with lots of learning. free meal a day while working. good experience to start off. they make you learn everything, which is good. opportunity to grow within the company as well."
good,"The culture at Chipotle is definitely unique. It was easy to bond with other co-workers which made working a lot of fun. However, the workload was quite heavy especially when lunch/dinner rushes begin. The benefits are pretty good. There are paid breaks (usually 15-20 minutes) and one free employee meal each shift. What I learned from working here was to work in a fast-paced environment and working in a highly efficient manner."
good,"A typical day as a cashier was to ring up customers, clean and restock the dining area. The management was fair and it was quick-paced. The hardest part of the job I would say was refilling the ice machine; you had to fill it up one bucket at a time."
good,"I enjoyed the culture that we were supposed to create, but I hated working under people who made constant bad decisions. I left because there was no going around that and my happiness is worth much more to me than a weak salary."
good,Not a bad place to work but the location was very hostile customer wise. Management varies and constantly changes. Also people are always coming and going
good,"Chipotle's Company is one of the greater place to work. It is very fun, energetic and powerful team work. Chipotle always followed the policies and manage a great customer service."
good,"I worked here in High School and it was a fun and fast paced environment! I loved the people I worked with and the company was by the book and true to their employees. All of the managers were very helpful and there never seemed to be any problems in the work place. The hours were long, but in high school that was exactly what I was looking for. Though, they were very flexible with my schedule and desired hours."
good,"I learn more English. They teach me new techniques for how cut vegetables. The manager was really nice, she was worry of us being ok and ready to work."
good,They are very detailed when showing you what they would like you to do. The Management is very friendly  Hardest part is standing in the same spot for hrs on end.
good,"So,when it comes to Chipotle expect many stoners and a great work environment. The people are fun, the work is fast paced, and most of the time management is ok. My experience is unfortunately a little biased, with my having only worked in one store, and there my first manager was less than savory. Otherwise I loved working there and if you get the chance take it. You may get more than you bargained for, in a good way."
good,"I enjoyed the team part of the job. Really being collaborative and helping each other with our flaws. Overall, had a blast with having bilingual peers and enjoying music in the after hours."
good,Our General Manager was always very hands-on and supportive and helpful toward any problems we had. He knew his job and knew how to get other people to do their best.
good,"A typical day at work would be very stressful because of throughput; however, my co-workers made it fun. Morning shift was the most complicated shift because we made most of our food from scratch, and we had a specific time to be finished in your station."
good,"A lot of my coworkers were quitting because they were not corresponding with their availability. I did not like that they could not work around our schedules.  A lot of us were college students who had classes/exams, or had to leave campus for break and they didn't care about that."
good,"-Busy work place"
good,"This job had great benifets, hours everything. It really sucks to relocated after meeting such amazing people. Chipotle family is very welcoming of new comers"
good,"Chipotle offers a great experience with the correct leadership.  They tend to promote from within the company, so you can start out as a crew member and move all the way up to an area manager.  Very detail-focused company which is important to great success."
good,"Very high standards-focused, big expectations, the people are fantastic, fast-paced, very close-knit group of people, knowledge you can take home and use in the kitchen, great opportunity for advancement, great pay, tend to feel a little overworked, somewhat stressful."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"work was fun, fast paced and the management was awesome when I first started working the workplace culture was very positive and my favorite part of the job I was genuinely happy to go to work. it was my first job and I was very happy with it. work hours were long and closing would go until 1 or 2 in the morning which was in acceptable for my schedule but I made it work. chipotle was amazing and I wouldn't have picked another job to get my foot in the door. but management changed and an outside hire became the general manager of chipotle in Williamsburg. this general manager fired the apprentice kitchen manager and many other long time hard working employees resulting in having only 2 cashiers. myself being one of the only cashiers I was working almost every single day. still being in high school at the time I could no longer keep up with school and work so I eventually had to quit. I was very sad about quitting and later when I tried to reapply I couldn't."
good,"Chipotle was a very fast-paced environment to work in, if you apply to work here you must be a hard worker and willing to put in physical labor as well as keep up with others around you."
good,"the job is very demanding, the pay is mediocre but with the right crew and manager that didn’t matter much. advancement opportunities are very high at chipotle. they hire many of their manager within their restaurants."
good,"I knew most positions, its important to work with a sense of urgency and still follow the food safety standards. I love the people I work with, sometimes the job gets tiring depending on which position you work."
good,"A very good job for a first job to teach you about the workplace, besides that they take it way too hardcore for what we are actually doing. We are rolling burritos now saving lives."
good,i loved it it is now time for me to start my carer it was a job to carry me through school. i have learned all that was there for me to learn. i want to to put my school training to work.
good,"Chipotle was just about everything id like a work place to emulate. We had organized shifts, great team effort, and we loved our job. Chipotle was one of the only jobs that i have felt like i wasn't at work."
good,"You are constantly busy and sometimes on edge and stressed. The pay was fair , and the crew was great ! The management at the store was a little backwards but overall I loved it"
good,Great and fun place to have worked. The people on the team were great in every aspect. There was plenty of room to excel and move forward. The pros and cons or are one of those in which it is to each their own.
good,The most inspiring and fast paced environment I've ever worked in. The level of skill i learned has only sharpened my talents in the kitchen. Also the best thing is when you get really invovled the things we do for the community is gratifying
good,"I worked very hard every morning and felt unappricated. I was the only grill cook who would get her tasks done on time every morning without fail, but I was still told I had to improve somehow. No one was pushed as hard as I was. I loved being pushed, but it was blatantly unfair seeing as no one was doing as well as I was."
good,"Very fast paced and demanding"
good,"Fun fast paced place to work with amazing coworkers. Although manager offered advancement opportunities, even promised, they never came into fruition. Lack of staffing became an issue, causing overtime, hours past scheduled time, and stressful situations."
good,very high paced work environment. Main thing to focus on is building confidence in your abilities and being able to improvise in tough situations. Overall this job has taught me a lot in regards to working fast and efficient and always upholding the high standards chipotle has
good,"I loved working there and the customers loved coming in to see me. Management was too favorable over the promoting of people their own race. Only Hispanic people got promoted while I was there, and there were plenty of other more than worthy people that got left out of the running for promotions because they weren't Hispanic. Which is just wrong!"
good,Chipotle was a good place to work at but it have some bad qualities there. Some employers would do things they weren't  supposed to do. Trainers need to be patient and understanding.
good,"mostly liked working here.  good culture, almost cultist-like.  most employees not super enthusiastic about working there.  good place to work if you want to start in the food industry."
good,"Great company to work for. They offer benefits for college students, such as tuition reimbursement and college courses for credits. Very fast-paced environment. Wouldn't recommend this job to people who aren't the most sociable. As a Chipotle employee, you engage with customers almost all of the time so you must be friendly and able to keep a smile regardless of how your day is going. You must be able to work well under pressure as the store gets very busy during certain hours of the day. Overall, best job I've had since I started working in college!"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,I liked working at Chipolte I just had to work for the school year to provide for lunch and save up for a car now that I have a car I have to get another job for gas and to support my car.
good,The food is great! The integrity behind the food is amazing. It all depends on your crew your management team and the standards you guys possess. Chipotle is trying to make a come back and I admire that about them
good,i have made some of my bestfriends working at Chipotle i love my team to death they are my second family. although it was tough and stressful not all crew memebers get paid the same i have been there 2 years and get paid less than some of the new hires but i love them and the company and all the food is safe and delicious they put so much time and effort into what they do daily i really do appreciate and respect the hard work we all put into every single morning to make sure that everything tastwe great for our customers.
good,"I liked working there. Interacting with customers, not staying in one spot, and moving in different areas kept me on my toes. It was a challenge and each day I was looking forward to learning something new!"
good,Chipotle was an extremely fun work place with great benefits. Staff was lively and fun to be around. Manager was constantly passive aggressive and I always felt put down.
good,Chipotle obviously has a great concept and culture. Way different than any other experience I have had. The food is great. opportunities to be had. I think they expanded to fast.
good,Chipotle is a great place to work while you're in school. It has a great work culture and everyone like to have fun while they work. The benefits are great and there is lots of opportunities for you to grow throughout the company.
good,"Chipotle is a company focused on creating a team of highly motivated top-performers. My crew was packed full of top-performers, in the beginning. As time went on new hires became less possessive of chipotle's 13 characteristics. This left 2 year crew members such as myself with little room to help the crew become better. Management also was corrupt, full of favoritism , and constantly dolling out empty promises of promotion to keep crew members around for longer.  I did however enjoy my crew, for the most part. The people I met because of chipotle is the only thing I am grateful for."
good,"This was a fun job. You learn a lot, though the company has changed since I left. Now they are focusing on other things, but when I was there, it was much about growing the culture."
good,"Working at Chipotle Mexican Grill was a great expirience. I learned how to cook, make transactions, and clean thoroughly. They have a great system for setting up employees for success."
good,"Great place to work with the ability to learn a lot of new skills. The company is very team oriented, and coworkers consistently help each other out throughout the day. The managers work hard to promote employees from within, creating a strong sense of responsibility and loyalty to the company."
good,"Chipotle is a high energy workplace. You have to be on point with everything. From something simple as labeling the food items to dishing out foods, you have to make sure that all of that is done properly. It was fun while it lasted."
good,Chipotle was a job that I really enjoyed doing. The lines were full of customers  and the workplace culture was always positive. There was no easy part on the job and there was no hard part on the job.  In the end it was a job that all the employees really enjoyed. Whether it be preparing food for the grillers or grilling the food for the front to serve; everyone there enjoyed learning new things.
good,"Chipotle is a good company to work for however with a company where the few have a lot of power and dont listen to the many, things get way messed up. Yes you have had success with the company in the past but things are forever changing and Chipotle tries its best to adapt to those changes. Just needs to have more discipline to those at the top when they mess things up."
good,"Chipotle really is a great place to work for those that like a fast and fun work environment. A typical day would be busy from the moment you get in until the time you leave. You learn something new almost everyday whether it be about the business, your people, or even yourself. The culture of the store is one where people are there to help each other grow and advance. The hardest part of my job is that direct contributions and work ethic are not truly the reason for advancement, but more so the result of the entire team."
good,"A typical day at work for me would be just changing into my uniform, putting on my apron, washing my hands, and standing behind the line making people's orders for 4 hours."
good,"Essentially, I see my time at Chipotle as my gateway into adult responsibilities. I never really cared much for my tasks at hand until I worked on that line with a queue to the door. "
good,"Despite the fast pace, and nonstop working, I met a lot of great people and was treated like family. This was an amazing first time job experience for me, I learned so much and continue to strive for more after the confidence I gained at this work place. Management did choose favorites unfortunately, but it was still a nice environment to come into and not feel tired after a couple hours of work."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle would be slow through the hours of 2-5, and on those hours, you would have to prepare for rush hour, which is at 6pm. If you work in the morning, rush hour would be at 12, which the crew would have to be prepping the food at 10 or 11 am."
good,"Chipotle can get very busy and stressful at times, but overall there is a strong system. This system  ensures a good finish at the end of each day at every closing."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,I hated the hours. It conflicted too much with my school work. I was working 7 hour shifts on school days as a High school student and it was awful. I would get home from school at about 3pm then would have to get ready for work and be there by 4 and wouldn't get home till 11pm. I had no time to do homework and it was awful. I ended up quitting. Other than the hours everything was good and fun environment!
good,It was a very fun workplace environment but the management team wasn't very strong. The communication wasn't and it sometimes felt like high school. I loved the relationship I had with some of the customers and crew but overall I was ready to leave.
good,"Tons of ways to advance, empowering management, open conversations, and allow the whole crew to be heard. high energy and fasted paced but rewarding!!"
good,A little unfair to different cultures if your not Spanish you will feel the pressure of being discriminated but overall great place to make money  And to build management skills
good,Learning the food industry can be difficult if your're not comfortable handling another persons meal. However Chipotle was very patient with their employees about how ready they felt with their training. Being the cashier you needed to keep in mind were you not only in charge of ringing up the order total but also the one in charge of keeping the dining area clean and organized. Greeting the customers was a job everyone shared. The management was very helpful when it came to any concerns you had about your job. They didn't hesitate to make sure you were helped with honing your skills in any area of the workplace. The hardest part of the job was multitasking but you eventually get used to it and it becomes second nature to tend to more than one customers need. It helped keep you on your toes and made the shift go by rather quick. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was getting to eat the food and seeing customers enjoy the food you prepared for them as well.
good,"I enjoyed my time at chipotle, great co-workers who helped me to understand how things were run.I learned a lot about how thw restaurant business is run"
good,"A typical day would consist of first opening the store. Making all the salsas fresh and ready for the day. I learned how to manage my time accordingly with how much I had to get done. The hardest part of the job is being patient with people, customers and employees. Most enjoyable is getting to know people and making the customers happy."
good,Amazing atmosphere to work in. They make sure you are the right fit for everyone so be prepared for multiple interviews. They welcome employees like family.
good,"A typical day at Chipotle would start with putting up the truck order and completing inventory. The prep sheep when then be completed in order for the incoming employees to be aware of what their tasks were for the day. I learned how to cut, slice, and dice. Steeling a knife, taking proper inventory, how to open and close a drawer, how to manage a shift and also how to pull reports. The most enjoyable part of the job was both my co workers and the customer interaction."
good,Great employees and customers. Management was very bad and many people quit because of them. I learned a lot when it came to customer service and food prep.
good,Chipotle is a good place to be if you like working with a team and helping guests. Also a great place to be if you are looking into moving up in the business.
good,"I worked at Chipotle for almost a year. The job itself is very simple the task is simply in doing it. At the location I worked for the Grill cook was responsible for cooking both rice and the meats. Also responsible for washing dishes. For most people this is a lot of work however as with many things with practice it can almost become second nature. The company promotes growth, most managers are crew members who have been selected by their peers to undergo training for the next level."
good,I give it a 3/4 rating because management isn't where it should be. They worry too much about themselves and not giving employees the comfort they need when they feel like they are getting token advantage of.
good,"It's always busy, you always have to be on your feet doing something from cleaning restrooms, cleaning tales, changing food to fresh food off the grill"
good,"The company is good to work for, they provide benefits and tuition reimbursement, but the people culture they used to focus on doesn't exist anymore so it is all about numbers now,"
good,Fast paced environment throughout the day. Most enjoyable part of the job is making the customer satisfied with their food. I learned how to practice food with integrity and its safety.
good,"Been working here for a while now. Was about to move up to manager spot but was withdrawn because I told them I'm going to a culinary school in another city. They realized that they were losing someone good so now they've been giving me the cold shoulder and less hours. Otherwise, the company is great and the food is good as well. Definitely room to grow here if you're on the managements good side."
good,"Chipotle is a great job for someone who is just starting off. They typically like to hire people with no job experience. It is not an easy job but people learn  a lot of things while working there, such as multi-tasking and being productive. At Chipotle it is always about what someone does wrong, there is never really any appreciation from management. The hardest part of the day is getting tasks done while it is very busy, although it is busy there is no help from anyone, especially the managers."
good,Every crew member is a fun and friendly individual. We always look for ways to improve the store. A typical day consists of empowering one another to be/do better in our position. One of the main things I learned from working at Chipotle is really being team-oriented. Working together when difficult circumstances appeared and overcoming challenges. Our culture is enthusiastic and friendly.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"The manager I had was pretty terrible, had a short temper and was moderately prejudiced against woman and people of color. Last I heard he was let go for a harassment lawsuit from a former employee. Besides that, the work was really rewarding and I loved getting food from there. It was definitely the most difficult job I had but I would recommend it to most people."
good,"I worked at Chipotle in between jobs for a few months. I absolutely loved it. The crew felt like family and our manager cared about our goals and the environment. If they had paid enough for a single person to live alone, I would have stayed instead of working there temporarily."
good,"food is very good and is for the most part healthy. if you don't mind the long lines, stop by. the stores don't do a lot of real charity work though.."
good,"The job itself isn't too bad and is actually pretty rewarding with the things you learn while working there. However, as you'll find anywhere else that deals with people, there are annoying people that come in sometimes, really busy days, closing usually isn't fun, etc. The best thing about it is definitely the people that work there though. Everyone's a human being so they make mistakes but they're all in all usually pretty decent people that are easy to talk to and therefore make the work day go by much quicker. You usually won't see potential movement in the company until after working there for a year though."
good,"Company that provides opportunity and shows you your worth, to make you be the best that you can be. Leaders keep constant support and direction and your given many tools to succeed."
good,A typical day at work consists of working while also trying to have fun. Everyday you go in to work and have fun as well...............................
good,"Working with the company taught me a lot about the work environment, also about myself. The experience I gained has helped me in life, as well as in the working environment."
good,"I loved this job because i learned a lot about running a business and a sense of urgency, i learned management skills as far as hosting/greeting and cashiering and cooking."
good,"Chipotle Is A Place Where No experience Is All The Experience You Need, Because They Will See To It That Your Training Is So Thorough That You Are Bound To Learn Something New That You Will Be Able To Take With Forever."
good,"I didn't mind working on the line, and making the specifics for the customers, it was going into the kitchen that was hard. There was prepping food, and cooking food, putting food back in the cooler. All in all though, this was one of my most favorite jobs because there is always constantly something to do."
good,Chipotle provided a great environment to learn and grow into a manager. They have very high expectations and require a lot of work earn your promotion.
good,"My crew was wonderful and friendly to work with, fast paced environment, great manager, nice and friendly customers, healthy food options, great benefits, but diddnt allow much balance of pesonal life or education."
good,Work place culture is very up to date and really fast paced.Time management is hard to  to at first. After a few months you get used to everything. SO GOOD LUCK
good,"As a manager, the role can be a tiny bit stressful depending on the rest of your management group but overall, I have worked there for years and it taught me so much."
good,While working for chipotle ir was fun and i.learned alot. The managers that took the time to train you were great! The people above them are rude though and don't understand the struggle
good,I really enjoy working at work. The environment is amazing. I get along with my coworkers. We are family. I love how everything is fast pace. I would actually recommend people to try to work here
good,"A typical day at chipotle consists of heavy flow daily and try to satisfy our customers to the best of our ability. Chipotle was a very fast paced and busy enviorment  and I enjoyed it very much but the hardest part was when it was too busy, I was sometimes left alone and didn't receive the help I needed. crew members were to call off and I would be left alone to take on the responsiblity of what should be an effort of two. The most enjoyable part of my job was learning culinary skills such as recipes,  proper food temperatures, proper cut sizes. Management was great but personally I felt like sometimes they need improvement in their leadership skills and motivation towards others."
good,"Chipotle is great company to work for it offers a lot of benefits such as tuition reimbursement compensations, etc. I work for one of the busiest stores so its constant working but it is fun."
good,"A typical day at work was cleaning dishes before I moved to working the food line. Once I was on the line, I had to be focus, friendly and fast at the same time. This was my first job, while I was in highschool."
good,"Good first job, especially for hard working teens, looking to fill in those after-school hours. Flexible hours, good benefits."
good,It was a very great learning experience for my first job. It tough me the value of team work and the important of management. I also learned a great amount of cooking skills.
good,"A day being employed at Chipotle is a pretty hectic depending on the environment or location the store is. Its always busy and fast paced. Managers and other coworkers tend to grow on you, making it seem like a family business lol."
good,A typical day at work involves me putting on my work clothes then washing my hands before I start bagging the chips. Once I'm done bagging the chips I go to the cash register and begin my work there which involves taking the customer's order and making the transaction. The Chipotle I worked at always had a long line because it was near a school so I had to do the transactions quickly while keeping the customer satisfied.
good,This job requires you to put your full effort. They provide you with a mission and have great leadership to accomplish it. Your leader or general manager would require you to communicate your feedback. You get to feel like family.
good,always busy from the moment you walk in which was perfect for me because I get easily bored. the staff was great really a team effort on the daily. I would return for sure
good,"At Chipotle, workdays were fun and challenging especially at the dinner rush hours. From 6-8, there was a never ending line from the door to the counter and being on the assembly line was challenging. I had to keep a positive attitude through the entire evening and motivate myself to not give in to the monotony. I developed my work ethic at Chipotle and I feel that I can apply what I learned there to stressful situations at future jobs."
good,"Management can get in the way but overall its fun and it can help you grow. It's very people culture and diversity. Typical day, everyone has their own station, either on the line cash or back of the house, Depending which one you are you have tasks that needs to be done."
good,its a fun environment. they really make it seem like its  big family but they always keep it professional.learned what a top performer is and that team work is crucial
good,A great place to work if you do not want a life outside of your position.  Excellent upper management.  Information flow exceeds many companies.  Training is superb.
good,Best place to work if you want to make something of your life. If you put the effort you will be rewarded. The people culture is awesome you really gain a family.
good,its ok the job environment was good but its like a job you have to meet quota everyday. its like a factory job inside a restaurant everything is very precised and you have to be too as and employee. but in tern with  you being in a fast food job and always having to meet a quota you can sometimes feel like just a cog in the machine if you don t have a desire to stay and work for them forever and become a resturanture then the company will not really care about you and might not want you to work for them for just your temporary benefit.
good,"I enjoyed working at Chipotle because my coworkers and managers were always friendly, amicable, outgoing, and helpful. It was easy to be productive in an environment like that and Chipotle offers great benefits to their employees including money towards education if  you work there more than a year."
good,"Depending on which Chipotle you work at, it can be super busy and therefore too much stress for $10/hour. If you are twice as lucky, you'll get bad management and a busy store. Overall, the store I worked at got hit hard with the health scare of 2015 and all the workers stopped caring about their job. Before that, though, the ""people culture"" that Chipotle employed provided for a good work environment."
good,"constantly working on elevating staff"
good,"Awesome high school job, reasonable schedule. Wish you got paid for what you worked for though. Work hard, the managers will notice."
good,"Very fun environment, meet a lot of cool and different people, fast work environment. Management for the most part is really good. You get to build a relationship with your managers, instead of them just telling you what they need you to do."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"this place is fast paced,u have to stay busy n pay attention 24/7"
good,Advancement is always a plus with the company and the environment is very empowering.. a great place to learn and a great company to excel with.
good,"It was pretty solid. The work environment was good, good leadership, hard working employees. Just wish the pay was weekly and was a bit more than what we already receive."
good,Chipotle is a fun place to work and they treat you like family. They encourage growth within the business and embrace everyone's abilities and short comings.
good,It is very nice the opportunity u get if u want to become part of the management team!! It is fast and worthy for i dividuAls whose desire is to grow in a company in that aspect.
good,There are many pros and cons when working at Chipotle. Crew members recieves free shift meal and tips at the end of the day. Customers are great and fun to help with. I left because of family issues.
good,Chipotle is very friendly like work place. I've meet so many great people when it comes to co-workers to our regulars customers. The enjoyable part about the job is seeing all new faces and familiar faces. The hardest part about the job would be dealing with a customer that isn't have a good day and trying my best to make it the best I can and still fail.
good,The company itself was great. You learned new things and lessons everyday. You can move up in the company fast and was able to balance your life. The company gave good benefits and classes.
good,"Working at Chipotle is very different than most other fast food places due to the big focus on culture. They push the people culture, food culture, and business culture. They really do strive for the quality of their food to be high and food safety is kept up with very well. Management is easy to get into if you want to put the work in, but the best part about this place is that the crew gets to choose the next manager, so you know that if you get chosen to continue up the ladder, you have the support of the team around"
good,"working at chipotle was long hours and lots of customers. i have learned many things like knife skill and the knowledge to run a successful restaurant. i was surrounded with great co-workers but management was mediocre, the hardest part of working at chipotle was maintaining high standards and the best part about chipotle was that i was able to elevate others every day."
good,It is a cool place to work at. Great vibes from everyone you meet from other locations and in general a great atmosphere full of energetic and incredible people.
good,First official job. It was a great experience. Great people to work with. Everyone works as a team. Everyone have each other's back. I was a working student. My managers were pretty understanding.
good,"I have experienced so much growth from working at Chipotle. I have learned how to become a true and effective leader, through honest conversations and challenging others. I believe in the 13 characteristics of a top performer and know that I display all 13. I now know that empowerment begins within yourself and once you find it, you can empower anybody."
good,i enjoy working for chipotle. the people are nice and i get free chipotle while working and half off when im not working. a normal day of work for me involves washing dishes and prepping the food to be cooked
good,A typical day is cooking great food making the customers feel at home and comfortable good people skills with your fellow employees and customers the hardest part of the job was leaving
good,everything was great from the employees to the customers. my only problem was that my general manager didn't respect my school schedule and had me working really crazy hours. I was able to learn everything fairly quickly and opportunities are always available for advancement.
good,The philosophy of Top Performance is good for the employees cos always everybody is looking forward find out the best way to do the task.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"You clock in and greet your crew members and management and the best part of being there is learning new ways to improve and become quicker at your job, at times stressful however can be rewarding"
good,"Chipotle mexican grill is a great place to be employed. they strive on team work in a fast paced environment. From learning to used professional kitchen knives, dicing and cutting vegetables and various meats, to cooking delicious food and serving customers, chipotle is an awsome place to work."
good,"Taking orders, serving food, cleaning the dining area and other work stations and ensuring the total cleanliness of the workplace. Implement all the standard operational procedures of the company and make sure that every customer receives the best customer service possible. Make sure that the food that’s being served is always fresh and has undergone the proper food handling procedure."
good,"I loved working at Chipotle. At the location I worked at, the GM was fired and make it an interesting experience, but I still found a way to enjoy my time there. I made lots of friends, learned many things about the work force as this was my first job. The pay was decent for my first job and I got 40+ hours, which was a lot at the time (being a high school sophomore). Work here if you have enough time on your hands to work every day. Good paychecks!"
good,Working here you get to meet new people all the time. As long as you are willing to work in an upbeat environment then working at this  job should not  be a problem. The staff was always nice to be around.
good,"Working at Chipotle has been great. The hours are consistent and reliable but once you get understaffed you never leave the store. Ever. The balance between life and work as much more on the work side most of the time. Dealing with general problems at home from problems at work isnt my ideal way to work but i do what it necessary to get the job done. The people are amazing and the support staff is right at par, cant complain."
good,Great vision in the company very high energy and high standards as long as you are staffed and have the right workers. Not very good benefits such as no paid maternity leave unless you're salary
good,"Overall, I loved my time at Chipotle. Fun environment with lots of room to grow if you are willing to put in the time and energy. Very rewarding job but extremely high turnover which made it tough at times. Constantly hiring and training."
good,"On a normal day at work I meet at least 300 different people who come in. I love everyone I work with even when times are tough. People are your only obstetrical in any job. I love the food we make and what we stand for, especially here in the Denver community."
good,"Everyday you come into chipotle its usually always busy. When its busy work is fun, it goes by fast. The high energy of all of the staff rubs off on everyone there which then creates an extraordinary experience for those in the restaurant. Everything you do will have a purpose. You will learn a lot very fast but at the same the job itself is not hard but if you don't like speaking with a lot of people all the time it can be overwhelming and even stressful."
good,"I worked at a brand new chipotle store for its 1st 3 months of opening. Chipotle all in all is a good place to work. It is easy to move up in the ranks if that is what you are looking for and you can apply for a 401K and dental/health insurance if you wanted. "
good,"A typical day depended on when you were scheduled to work. If you opened, you could plan on spending around three hours prepping food for the day. Once completed, you were given a short lunch break before the restaurant opened. During your shift, you were assigned a certain position along the food line, and you were required to serve that position during peak hours. Positions could include: cashier, main-room cleaner, ""tortilla 1,"" and a few other to which I do not remember the exact names. Working at Chipotle was certainly an interesting experience. It taught me how to make the most efficient use of my time. In terms of management and co-workers, my restaurant was amazing. Even after only a few days of working, I had already begun to feel like family, and they truly acted like a family. This social interaction was the most enjoyable part. The hardest part of the position was remembering all of the tasks that needed to be completed at once. With practice, it got much better, but it always remained a truly challenging task."
good,"Chipotle Mexican Grill has been the best workplace that I have had the opportunity to encounter.  Do not get me wrong, it is hard work, but it is rewarding and you have the opportunity to join a culture that is hard to come by anywhere else.  Everyday is different. You have the main task that you have to do, positions you have to work and paperwork that needs to be completed but it really is more that just a job.  Everyday is a step towards a vision and a culture that will be devoted to your development if you are willing to but in the hard work.  You really fall in love with the work environment when you have the right people in the management positions.  People will want you to improve and grow.  They will go out of their way to teach you how to become better at everything, minuscule or career changing.  Being in an environment that challenges you to grow with a wonderful support system has been more than I can ask for in a workplace.  You develop bonds with the managers and crew that makes you want to do all you can to be the best you can be.  Every store is different but every store has a vision.  And that Journey to the vision is an experience that I am fortunate to have had."
good,I enjoy working here. I work really hard and I find a lot of my coworkers do as well. It's a lot of work and expectations for little pay
good,"This job taught me about the restaurant environment. It was a lot of fun, coworkers made the experience enjoyable. Was usually busy but had enough time to take a short break when needed."
good,The management wasn't very accommodating to introverted workers. Emphasis on maintaining an upbeat attitude by any means necessary
good,"Everybody in management there is very accepting and willing to work with you. The hardest part is the customers and keeping up with busy days. Otherwise, enjoyable!"
good,"A typical day at Chipotle was busy and hectic. There was never time to stand or sit around, there was always something that could be done (such as sweeping or dishes or wiping down tables, etc). Throughout my months working here, I learned how to be a diligent and hard worker as well as learning how to deal with difficult situations and unsatisfied customers. The managers at Chipotle were excellent. They care so much about Chipotle and its crew, they did anything and everything to help their employees in and outside of work. This also goes for my coworkers. They were there for me inside and outside of work whenever I needed them."
good,"You can tell that the management staff and members in the company truly care about their employees. They teach basic culinary skills and proper knife techniques. A very advanced ""fast food"" company."
good,Chipotle has a unique management style that really focuses on building team work which translates into a very close and happy staff.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"The model laid forth is one that encourages growth and advancement, however some in leadership did not maintain that environment."
good,"I loved this job and the employees, I love the high passed environment. The mangers were friendly and understandable. Everyday I looked forward to going to work because the job got done. The hardest part of the job was improving on fax orders, and sometimes keeping up with the customer specific orders."
good,"During my morning shift, id arrive before the store opens. Then we began prepping the foods that will be used later in the day like, cilantro, lettuces, tomato. Learned how to appropriately cook foods, and prepare them. The hardest part was sometimes the miscommunication between management."
good,"Chipotle was a really great place to work. Great food, great environment, great people, but not so great management. In my experience the management for Chipotle was always lackluster, with good managers not lasting very long, and ""alright"" managers always advancing to the head of the pack."
good,When I first started at Chipotle I fell in love with the company. Over time I was inspired by the vision and was surrounded by a staff that was exactly what Chipotle wanted. To Change the way people eat and think about fast food by building a team of Top Performers who are empowered to reach High Standards. The culture in that time was like no other place I worked and was executed well. After a change in management it wasn't quite the same. Love what the company stands for but it is time to do what is best for me.
good,I worked on the food line or as a cashier. I would help make peoples food and provide excellent customer service. Team members were great as long as they were there to work hard and serve others.
good,Its a good place to work at. Sometimes its frustrating but great experience. Becoming management is fairly easy. Everyone loves to work with each other.
good,I love most of the people until I had a rough encounter at a party after work one day. I don't feel I can tell my GM so I am not going to I'm just going to quit. There are too many politics going on in the store.
good,"Restauranteur that is the goal of a entry-level position at Chipotle. The dynamics of this company, most people would not understand: development, culture, team, fun. That's what your ideal Chipotle should be."
good,"Everyone was welcoming. The crew was like a family. Whenever someone needed help with something all you had to do was ask. A typical day at work consisted of working, getting to know new people/ customers, being friendly but still able to work at a fast accurate pace. The hardest part of the job is when ti would get really busy and we run out of things in the lobby or restroom. The most enjoyable part is just being able to talk to each other and keep each other's day going smooth."
good,"Free food on your lunch break, any additional food is half off of the original cost and it is only once a day. Management is very caring about how well you work and they want you to succeed. A great team environment."
good,"it was a great place to work at, Everyone usually got along there was a bit of conflict but we would work it out all the time. The managers were great and pushed you to be better"
good,"Very fun place to work, a great learning experience for whoever works there. A supportive management team that helps you personally grow."
good,Day to day operations were mostly smooth and routine. Learned many techniques in cooking Mexican style foods. Management were responsible for motivating upbeat and happy operations. Co workers were pleasant and friendly  for the most part. The hardest part was maintaining pleasant and friendly through lunch rushes that could last hours nonstop. The most enjoyable part was completing a lunch rush knowing that everyone did their part.
good,It was a great experience to work in a place with cultures similar to mine.I learned how to work faster and cook Mexican food.
good,"Fun and positive coworkers, but I believe they could have  better management skills. Loved how fast paced and upbeat Chipotles is. I also enjoyed the quality of the food."
good,"I left the company in 2008 only because I moved to an area with no Chipotle locations within a reasonable travel distance. I loved spreading the ""food with integrity"" motto to customers and loved getting to know my customers. For them it wasn't just a quick place for a meal- they loved us and we loved them! I loved the challenges and competitions that awarded our location money for parties and other perks. Chipotle has been my favorite work experience. My location was unique from other locations as we sourced some meat locally and I loved getting to work with the head chef of Chipotle. I got to meet the core people in the company and my crew was the* absolute best*. (They threw me THREE parties while I was there and celebrated my birthday! I wasn't their just their supervisor and they weren't just my crew- we were FAMILY!) Management was hit or miss. I got blamed for stuff that was not allowed regionally but my own general manager did. I believe I did a job above my pay grade and I trained other general managers who came to work at our location however I was two promotions below. There seemed to be fishy relationships. The general manager I had when the store opened made the work environment really stressful and then I saw several managers come and go while I stayed at the same level because no one stayed long enough to be able to promote anyone. Overtime was amazing; health insurance was dumb. There were some very late hours but I enjoyed my crew working with me to make our location great! Since my time working there, I have told a few friends about working there and how awesome"
good,"The job could get stressful, but it was overall fun and a family setting is created with your co workers. The management team works very closely with the staff. the pay is reasonable and people are promoted quickly"
good,"I myself find chipotle to be a great place to work for, but the work is hard and fast paced and may be too much for some people The culture is great and so are the people who share the 13 characteristics."
good,I learned how to attend towards hungry customers. The work environment did get crazy here and there but overall challenging and fast paced.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I worked all positions at Chipotle, I mostly worked as a cook, I made all the food fresh upon request. I have learned to manage my time with all the different products we were serving. Management was very communicative, if we needed to know something they would always inform us of it. They were very helpful during busy hours. My co-workers are the fuel for the store, they work quickly getting customers in and out. The hardest part of that job was learning and remembering all the ingredients that go into the products. The most enjoyable part of that job was all my co-workers were very enthusiastic about their work."
good,"It was a great place to work for, they was great at keeping the paper work just once the assignment was over they did not call to set you up with another job once one was ending."
good,"Start my shift at 4pm.  Clean all the dirty dishes from the lunch.  Prep all the food for the cooks. Chopped onions, peppers, tomatoes, prepare the guacamole, etc.   Also sweep and mop the floors in the kitchen area.  "
good,"In the morning I would arrive to work and begin prep work for the day. I would dice tomatoes, shred cheese, cut avocados and make guacamole, refill the ice in the coda machine. Next I would either be the cashier or one of those who work on the line. I have learned how to communicate my opinions to fellow co-workers and customers what I like and recommend that's on the menu. The management is a little disorganized, from having transfers come in and out. Co-workers are friendly but tend to mix work with their personal life. The most difficult part of the job for me was learning how to split checks, but thanks to my co-workers, I was able to resolve the issue. The most enjoyable part of the job in my opinion, was clocking out and getting a meal after a shift."
good,"great place to work but have to conform to a certain culture.  Not like any other place, cult like.  great benefits and plenty of training"
good,A typical day at work a be me and the co-workers goofing around making each other laugh telling stories about our life and goals. I learned more about my co-workers by each day because they were so friendly and outgoing. The hardest part about work is when u having a bad day outside of work and you have to take your focus away from that because when the customers come order they should leave satisfied and happy.
good,"I had worked in a fast pace environment Food Service before but working for Chipotle was a challenge I welcomed. The crew was helpful my first few weeks. I started as Kitchen  Prep and helped on the grill a couple hours every shift. This is where the challenge came in, but the staff and crew pulled together encouraging me until I perfected my skill on the grill."
good,Everyone just thought it was rolling burritos but everything had to be prepared by scratch every day. If you didn't do it in time there weren't consequences but it was looked down upon.. If you couldn't do it in time after awhile they just moved on to someone who could. I learned the faster the better and your job must be done right in that short amount of time. The most enjoyable part of my job was seeing my coworkers. It was like a little family. Sure there were little cliques but mostly everyone got along.
good,"a fun place but you must keep moving and it gets stressful sometimes, overall its a good job"
good,"Loved my job at Chipotle, great culture and fun atmosphere. Offer great benefits and lots of room to grow. It all depends on which restaurant you work for, some are better than others and with that some have better management than others. Lots of hours but be sure to speak up and don't be afraid to address issues with management or being in touch with those higher up."
good,"A typical day at work would be training my crew. Making them better and leading them in the proper direction for success. Im still learning, but as of this day I have learned how to manage my staff, how to make schedules, how to train, how to communicate well with my crew as well as others above me, and with my customers. The hardest part of my job is leaving the store when my shirt is over. What i enjoy about my job is being able to connect with my crew. as a manager they aren't afraid to be close to there management. We are all able to eat together without feeling awkward. Its great that everyone has an equal opportunity to promote up no matter how long or shot amour of time you have been with the company."
good,"Great culture with very high standards."
good,"What I enjoyed the most about working for Chipotle was the people culture and being able to train those around me."
good,"We start our day at 7AM to prepare our foods and ingredients for our daily customers. We make all our own salsa, cut our own vegetables and herbs. We cook only naturally raised free range meats with no hormones or additives of any kind. The management team are great they support each employee and empower them to make a difference. The co-workers support one another as well. The hardest part of the job is getting everyone to work together to accomplish a common goal due to age and experience differences."
good,"Although you are physically doing the same thing over and over again, everyday was a new adventure at chipotle. My managers were great, they are very patient and always ready to motivate everyone."
good,Overall great place to work with awesome people. Fast paced damaging job. With opportunity to learn about different station as well as chipotles vision and culture.
good,"I would come into work clock in, give other crew members their breaks, think of the game plan for the day and mostly do the prep work that needed to be done for the rest of the night since I worked closing shifts. I have learned how to be a top performer which if giving it your best to the company and the store not just helping yourself but others around you. I also learned how to be empowered to do better in the store and for myself in the workplace. I also learned to have high standards in the things I did, like picking the best produce for the prep and always being concerned if anything was wrong with a product because we only serve the best food for the people. The hardest part of the job is being overwhelmed with many customers at one time, and being understaffed. Most enjoyable part of the job is working with wonderful people and creating a family in the workplace."
good,I opened the restaurant made deployment chart for employees ad prepared food for afternoon rush. learned how to organize and lead people. I managed the store inventory and food order as well as cash handling and ordering money from Dunbar. Most of my co workers enjoyed the working environment. The hardest part of job was to find a balance between managerial work and actual food preparation. The most enjoyable part of the job was taking care of the customers and making sure the food was up to standards.
good,"Great advancement opportunities, Lots of hours, Great management teams in Omaha"
good,"A typical day at work is usually always busy especially during our peak hours which is 12pm - 1pm and 6pm - 7pm. What i usually do is be a busser, work on tortilla (I am the first person to greet our customers and ask what they would like to order and start to make it), work on salsa (salsa person asks what kind of salsa and condiments they would like on their burrito, bowl, salad etc. after they have dealt with the tortilla person), or be on expo (expo person is the one to tell the cashier what the customer ordered and if ask if the customer would like chips or a drink and would also bag their orders). My co-workers are like no other co-workers i have worked with. They are all fun and outgoing and are willing to help each other in every situation either busy or slow. The management is great. They treat their employees respectfully and kindly and help us in anyway. The hardest part of the job i would say is when we lack communication because we don't know whats going on or going to happen and the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to work with the customers, be myself, and make them smile."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"•	Greeted the patrons that approached the cash register"
good,I enjoyed working for chipotle Mexican grill. It was a good learning experience and it helped with customer satisfaction and also teamwork.
good,"A typical day at work for me at Chipotle, I was ALWAYS busy! I worked non stop from the time I clocked in till the time I clocked out. A few of the managers showed favoritism towards the employees that were already there. Out of the eight employees that were hired, I was one of the three that they didn't fire! They would go through a cycle of hiring people then let off people that they felt didn't meet their standards. I gave outstanding customer service and greeted all customers with a smile and helped my co-workers when I finished my assign tasks! I always helped when needed, never had to be asked to do anything! If I saw anything out of place or wrong, I'd be the first to jump on it and fix the problem! That is part of being a Top Performer and shows empowerment! A few of the qualifications of being a crew member as Chipotle!"
good,"Learned management materials, everyone is like family there. It offers room for growth. The hardest part is making sure you life up to their expectations. Wonderful work experience and management believes in you and encourages you."
good,"i would typically work on the line, asking customers what they wanted and make their order as i go. It would be very busy throughout the day so everyone had to work quickly. The workers were very polite to the customers. The hardest part of the day would be at closing time."
good,"I would say Chipotle was is my first job here since I came to Canada I didn't have any Canadian experience but they believed in me and gave me the chance to give the best of me."
good,Chipotle is a great place to work and I have amazing co workers. A typical day at chipotle is busy and full of new experenices.
good,"If you don't like to deal with food, this place will change that. I have a new found love for cooking and preparing foods. The job is really not that hard to do at all, the pace is very fast. I have acquired skills for preparing veggies and other products that we serve on the line that I use at home and that is something that I have learned. Management is very supportive and keeps the store running smoothly without to many hiccups."
good,"theres lots of stuff to like about chipotle, working as a team we can get anything done. but one attribute that can knock everything down is having a good manager, and chipotles management is hit and miss. chipotle for the most part only has managers who started out as a crew member. training can be applied to anyone, but sometimes its given to workers who might not be good for the position and it creates problems."
good,"Chipotle provides a unique approach to fast food. Despite popular belief, Chipotle is not owned by McDonalds and has been publicly owned and traded since 2006. It may be fast food, but you will be motivated to do your absolute best. Empowerment, top performers, and high standards are the lifeblood of the company. Like any fast food job, there are people there for a paycheck and that's it. There are, however, plenty of other people in my restaurant who want to develop a career with the company. It is nice to work with people who will take a job seriously, no matter what it is. The challenges faced include adjusting to the pace of the work, especially on the service line."
good,I enjoyed the job but my manager was never fair to me with the amount of hours she gave me. I did learn a lot though.
good,I would have never quit my job if I was able to receive more hours a week.
good,"A typical day at work is arriving at 8:00 am and opening the kitchen. There are many tasks that need to be completed before 11:00 am. It can be somewhat overwhelming at times because you have to multi-task and stay up to speed. In my time with Chipotle I have learned many kitchen skills, organization and time management skills, and food preparation. The management is great. They really care about the employees, and are always willing to make accommodations for personal endeavors. The co workers are outgoing, and always willing to work as a team to help each other out. The hardest part of this job is staying up to speed and keeping up with the fast paced environment. The most enjoyable part of the job is the positive attitudes the employees have."
good,"Most hired are energetic and helpful. They make working there enjoyable. Learned how to work at high speeds under much pressure, how to be an empowered employee, and how to push myself beyond what is expected. Management is hardworking  and strict yet easy to get along with and helpful. Hardest part is learning all of the side duties that you're assigned to when you first start. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with the customers and seeing them laugh. Giving them a good experience is rewarding."
good,"On a normal work shift, expect to do a lot of walking, standing, talking, smiling, and sweating. Constantly being aware of your surrounding. You learn skills that can be applied to future work, and teaches you how to manage your time better. The management is great! Easy to get along with, very direct and clear when teaching/coaching, and just always ready and willing to answer questions/help. The co-workers are probably one of the most enjoyable parts of the job, outside of the customers. The hardest part of the job is keeping the since of urgency even when we are not that busy. Always have to expect a rush of customers."
good,A typical day is ensuring the restaurant is running like a well oiled machine. our staff comes first because a happy staff makes happy repeat customers which increases profit. The hardest part of my job was all the long hours needed to put in due to restrictions put on by my hire ups with labor and no overtime yet very high expectations of achieving things almost impossible to do with in the labor hours allowed for such a busy restaurant that was located across from the college. I loved the people I worked with. I could not have asked for a better group of people to be surrounded by in my time with Chipotle. 
good,Mostly helping clients and keep the positive work flow going..
good,"On a typical day working at Chipotle, I, a grill cook, has to turn all equipment on which involves the flattop grill, the steamers, and the hot boxes.  Following that procedure, I brew tea and cook white and whole grain rice which usually takes a combined 60 minutes.  The main prep task for a grill cook is to chop cilantro which is very important due to the fact that it is in an ingredient in most of the recipes at chipotle.  The managers are very reliable and supportive as they push their employers at their best.  For the most part, time management is a vital component when working Chipotle because everything is fast paced.  The downside about working at Chipotle I would say is that you can give it your all but sometimes its still not enough.  Therefore, it can be very repetitive and somewhat endless knowing that you can do great but its not perfect. "
good,"The fast food industry is notorious for high turnover, long hours, grueling work, and low pay. Fortunately Chipotle is an above average fast food restaurant. The hours are still long and the work still difficult and monotonous yet the pay is competitive (vs other fast food restaurants). There are clear opportunities to advance through hard work and education. Employees have one free meal per day plus a discount on any other food. There are (admittedly bare bones but still) health care and stock plans. If you are stuck in the industry Chipotle would be a good place to wind up."
good,everyone is on top of their duty when you clock in and we all work in a team help each other. great communication skills with coworkers and manager. the hardest part of the job is wheen we have a lunch rush and we have to work fast paste and try not to make any mistakes during the process. they most enjoyable part is when everything is done and closing we all do cleaning areas and blast the music also the last shift splits the tips of the the day. Buy the way the food is excellent love it would never get tired of it.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I loved what I did for Chipotle. I loved my team, and the company itself. It is a very laid back company and they're great to work for. They're very hard to please, and are picky about who they take on full time."
good,It a fast-pace environment
good,"I love working here, and is a great start to anyone looking for a career."
good,"The typical day at work is full of learning and new experiences at a quick but manageable pace. I learned about the 4 points of Good Customers Service, how to increase through put, new ways of organization, food safety, food preparation, and sanitation. My co-workers uphold the highest standards of cleanliness and food service. Every person is willing to teach and learn. The hardest part of the job is the rushes throughout the day if we are short of crew members. The most enjoyable part of my Chipotle experience is seeing new smiles, meeting and interacting with customers, and seeing people come back to eat at Chipotle again."
good,The culture at Chipotle is very laid back as long as you get your job done.
good,"I really enjoyed working for Chipotle, I got to meet all kinds of people and make lot folks happy for their lunch break ect showing people that they can come in and have a really fast but super awesome lunch or come hang out for as long as they would like for dinner the atmosphere is accommodating either way as well :)"
good,"Fun Environment, Worked good hours and made a lot of friends, management could be better, I learned a lot of things from this job such as how to use a knife and be a fast worker."
good,Chipotle is like a second family to me. We have a great time while working but the flip flopping schedule and poor pay/benefits makes for a rough time.
good,I would come in and be on the cash register ringing customers up in a timely and fashionable manner. I learned that I am very good at multitasking from cleaning back to helping on the line. My management was really into turning everyone into managers someday. The co-workers were extremely nice and i actually learned a lot of spanish which was helpful at this type of job. The hardest part of this job would have to be the hours. I would work til 11:30 at night til sometimes 1 a.m to keep the workplace clean.
good,I love my job and the fact that I get alongwith my co-workers is a big pluss.
good,Most enjoyable part was the teamwork the employees has with each other
good,"a typical day at work would be try to sell phones and accesories for them, give great customer service in order to open new acounts . everyone its really nice to work with . i believe that the hardest part of the job would be late hours at night."
good,"I typically worked as cashier,i would count my drawer with my service manager,after i would ring up orders,help in line if they needed it,keep dinning room clean,stocked and empty garbage out,cleaned the bathrooms and when closing i would usually be done by 10 pm and on busy days it would be 10:30 pm.i earned 8.80 an hour"
good,Set up and maintained stock of food perparation line
good,"I loved working at Chipotle. The pay wasn't too great, but the experience was amazing. Everyone was friends there. I actually looked forward to going into work. That is until we got a new store manager, and he ruined the moral of the whole store. A week after being there he started down sizing, me being the first one to go."
good,Never should have left. Management was nice. Lots of work to do. Fun coworkers.
good,"Clocks In, Busses Tables, Changes Trash Makes Sure Silverware is in stock. Co-workers & management are friendly. The hardest part of the job is to smile when im not talking to anyone."
good,"It was a fun place to work at. I enjoyed coming to work and working with my co-workers and managers. A typical day consisted of prep, opening the tortilla station, and working for our guest. I think I enjoyed everything about the job"
good,I like working there the people and environment is great! The hardest part of the job is cut sizes and closing the store.
good,Fast paced job ive learned alot of things shown by my coworkers the management need it a little bit of more experience the hardest part of my job was keeping everything on track when it was really busy and the most enjoyable thing about my job was interacting with customers
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"This is a great restaurant to work at. We provide great food to great customers in a clean work environment. Everyday is unpredictable at chipotle, but we try to make it fun as possible. I've learned different techniques when creating food with integrity. The management team is awesome! We make sure the customers are very happy as well as our employees. The hardest part of the job is getting every single thing in the restaurant to perfection, but the most enjoyable part is getting that great feeling from your customers to brighten your day."
good,Great computer software to help make inventory management easy. Crew development programs to advance from within. Quality food made fresh daily. Loyal customer base that is easy to build on with proper maintenance of food and service standards. Bonus based on performance is a nice benefit for Restauranteurs/Managers. One of the best jobs I have ever had.
good,"Good place to work, if you can handle presure and long hours of work,"
good,"Here they only promote from within so your higher up has done the same job as you. From this, managers understand your work load and are able to correct situations in a helpful manner. Atmosphere is very friendly."
good,"Necessary because it was a very commercial setting for food. With Chipotle, Our aim as a team and company is good fast food and service. Principals any food chain needs to succeed. This was a very comfortable fast paced setting. It's some of the best and easy training I've ever experienced. I dealt with many customers in a short period of time."
good,"The good is that your coworkers are very friendly but sometimes it is hard to deal with the customers that come in on the daily with attitdues and problems of their own. in this case just take a deep breath and continue to help the customer, do not let them get under you skin."
good,"As a first job this is a great start. You get to learn about having a sense of urgency, organization skills and become an independent employee. Very friendly enviroment."
good,"Great place to work, fun outgoing culture, feels like family,"
good,Dealing in fast food taught me time management and patience. Having a manager who understood everyone and their talents was a plus. I leaned a lot working here
good,"During my time working here it wasn’t all bad. Rush hour usually was bad, but once you got used to it it’d be a breeze afterwards. I worked as cashier starting off. I moved to prep where things got a little more difficult for me. It was my first time ever working in the back of a kitchen prepping, but with the help of very patient managers. I got the hang of it."
good,Great company I like working there for the most part. Is definitely a great start and they were it would be on your school schedule. However the pay is not the best
good,"I would mostly open at my store. and some days put away the food orders. The job was difficult as a opening manager making sure everything was ready to go to open. I moved up fairly easy, because I worked hard and my GM recognized it. She made the store run smoothly, and she also made it fun. She encouraged me to be a better manager."
good,Working at Chipotle is quite the experience with it's unique way of preparing food and type of service you offer in the store. There are many rules and standards that come with working here but they are what make Chipotle what it is. It is a bit tougher to work at a Chipotle than it is at other fast food resturaunts but the integrity that you are associated with is a lot higher.
good,"Very fast paced place. Can be intimidating at first but it becomes fun once you get the hang of it. Lots of growth opportunities within the company. Can be a fun place to work. Great benefits available, especially tuition reimbursement."
good,Working at Chipotle has given me many things like new friends and experience in the food industry. It’s a job that is very doable and very easy to learn.
good,Chipotle is a good place to work.Its a good start off job for people who trying to get experience in the work force. You have to work hard and at a fast past.
good,It was a good job. They were fair and paid ok. They were understanding when i got pregnant and tried to work with me until i got put on bed rest. They were respectful of my needs as a pregnant woman.
good,"This job taught me a lot through customer service and working with the public on a daily basis. I believe this position helped me not only grow as an individual but allowed me to make strong advancements in communications, marketing, time management, and training new hires as they came into the store."
good,It was very easy to learn the work culture and expectation. The work came easy and the culture was layed back. Although we still got our work done it was easy to enjoy yourself. It also taught me to deal with high customer expectations.
good,I have work at many jobs since i left chipotle and honestly  i was at chipotle for almost two years and i will say its a very clean food place in all honesty. The co workers here are cool you will develop friends even outside of work as long as your a hard worker you get along with everyone. It just the fact of helping each other out because there is a peak where its super busy. The managers care about you genuinely when you get to know them. I will forever remember my time at chipotle its a great job for a student and it pays well if your wanting to be in food i started at 11.00 and there is room for a rise every 6 months if you do your job
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I worked at the restaurant while I was in high school  so it was a big step for me. High school, working, sport, It taught me to balance my life a little better."
good,"Fast paced job but fun at the same time when you have good time management. I was able to enhance my people skills as well as time management, and culinary skills."
good,"Fun place to work tends to be busy most days, if you love chipotle you dont mind working even when its busy had a great time working as I was working with the Best team at the Best Store."
good,Your team should always be there to back you up. If you have any questions your team/management should always have an answer. There are also reference guides all over the restaurant as well
good,Most enjoyable part about working there is that you get to meet new people. We get regulars daily so you start to kind of memorize what they order and it’s pretty fun. The coworkers are very helpful when struggling. All in all it’s a good place to work. No one lets you fail.
good,This job allows you to grow inside of your workplace to advance into new and better position but lack sympathy and support of most employees. Favoritism is among them.
good,"Working at Chipotle consisted of working hard in order to maintain customer satisfaction. I learned how to multitask and adapt to the different types of management styles and procedures. There is never nothing to do while at work, there are always things to be done in order to maintain the greatest food quality and the happiness of the customers."
good,"Chipotle is a very nice place to work, however if you have a manager that knows what they are doing. Very flexible hours, good pay, great benefits, free meals"
good,Good experience for entry working level. The staff and managers were very good and supportive most of time. Learned many new things there and was very excited to do so.
good,Working for chipotle was an okay job I worked really hard their but the manger she was so unprofessional because she dated one of the employees and if he said two words to you she made you work harder
good,"Though there are good co workers, the amount of work that chipotle requires their employees to do for a certain position, does not match how much we make an hour. It is very flexible with employees who go to school."
good,Chipolte was a comfortable workplace with the hours I needed as a highschooler. I loved my management and my coworkers. Everyone has a part to play in this job and most chipotles are very well staffed and trained well too.
good,"Greeted with new faces everyday , I was able to provide customers with quality food at an efficient pace. My favorite part of the day is when a customer whose had a bad day and just a few minutes of conversation and providing them with quality food would change their whole demeanor ."
good,"Working here is fine and I love the staff but the turnover rate is extremely high and causes very short staffed shifts which can be a very stressful experience considering that this store makes 15,000 a day"
good,My time there was brief but it was good experience. They had a good crew there and the management was really nice. They had a strict health policy there which was fine.
good,"On a normal day our team handles over 300 customers with a warm and welcoming smile. We ensure that our customers feel at home when ordering any of our appetizing menu items. The staff enjoys my humour and  uplifting personality. As a Service Manager, I ensure that my staff feels most comfortable when working by keeping a positive mind set throughout our shift."
good,Its a position that requires tenacity and dedication. But it is achievable and rewarding. Not for the faint-hearted. Hours are almost always guaranteed for this position.
good,Chipotle helped me through my professional development and taught me great management skills as well as leadership skills. Chipotle is a great job for college students and those people that would like a career in management.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"The people at Chipotle are always very nice to each other and you can tell that they're enjoying their time there. Even when people complain about things like the restaurant being busy, everyone is having a great time."
good,This is a good job. It does get buys and hectic yet comunicating with coworkers will make it run as smooth as possible. I enjoyed working here. Great environment
good,"Free meal every time worked was the best part of the job."
good,"Chipotle is a very well known food restaurant, so you will experience many busy, long nights. You have to know what you are doing because you will have to repeat that process constantly all throughout your shift."
good,"Showed up everyday early for entire year and did not get promoted, others got promoted but were of lighter race skin tone. Overall enjoyed working there."
good,"This was my first job in high school, and I really enjoyed working there. While I was there, there were good opportunities for advancements and raises."
good,not a great place to work but it was fun working with the other coworkers. The management was really bad and never gave me a day off when i asked two weeks ahead.
good,"Chipotle I personally, cant recommend or not recommend chipotle to another person, It's for that person to decide wether they enjoy their job or not.."
good,"Chipotle fun, respectful, environment with flexible hours. wonderful benefits for students who want to further their education also benefits or healthcare."
good,"Our mission at Chipotle is to change the way people think about Fast food, as well as serving Food with integrity which is finding the best and  "
good,"I loved working at Chipotle. I loved my coworkers and could leave work smiling. It was my first job and I was challenged and learned a lot. The pay wasnt great, but they offered tuition reimbursement. The only reason I left was because of the new General Manager they assigned to our store who created a completely opposite work experience for me."
good,A lot of room for advancement. I personally loved this job because I respected the companies mission and integrity. Free meals while I worked and half off food off the clock.
good,"I had a lot of good experiences working in this location, i learned a lot about fast paced work environments, time management, organization and especially cleanliness."
good,It was a fun place to work at just the manager was not that good with her schedule ideas went it came to schedule the crew.
good,"A typical day at work starts at 7 am in the morning prepping all of the food for the day, turning on all of the equipment, and making sure everything is in good working shape. I learned how to deal with multiple different types of people. As I get ready to move into management, I learn different ways to keep myself as well as crew accountable. Also, ensuring we are serving safe food and making our customers happy. Hardest part of the job would be the fast-paced environment. The most enjoyable part would just be building relationships with my coworkers as well as customers."
good,I overall liked this job and I would say they were pretty flexible when it came to scheduling. I did not receive benefits through this job so I am unsure of how these are through them.
good,Gives good great hours and efficient training. Everyone is willing to help with any questions or concerns that trainees had. Chipotle is the right place to build character.
good,"There was never a dull moment during shifts. Employees are able to build relationships with repeat customers.Shifts can definitely turn hectic, especially when co-workers call out unexpectedly. The whole crew works together really well and is usually able to make up for the lost worker."
good,"My boss was wonderful and my other higher ups were equally so, they hire good people and treat you with respect. I would recommend this job to anyone who wishes to know how to operate a clean kitchen and learn the workings of a properly organized restaurant."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Since you're working with food here, there's always tasks to keep the restaurant clean and sanitary. Time passes quickly and it is a very relaxed environment with good coworkers. Chipotle is probably the best place to work with food."
good,"a typical day a chipotle requires a fast pace. lots of hungry people wanting food in a demanded tume, also preparing and cooking the food well. ive learned to be on time with my duties. the most enjoyable part was eating the food."
good,Chipotle was cool it was my fisrt job. I learned alot about the work force in general and the people there helped me out. I started at the fornt of the line heating tortillas and gradually moved up to chashier.
good,They treat their customers right and make sure theyre always clean and the food is cooked properly. They also treat their workers good and push their workers to do good.
good,"The chipotle I worked at was very friendly and welcoming, however it was very fast paced and I could not keep up. however the main reason I ahd left chipotle was because I simply felt it wasn't for me as well as I did not have time to pray at my times of prayer as well as I needed to pray outside since there was nowhere inside. Great job, but I wasn't meant for it."
good,"Working at chipotle has taught me valuable work skills, and many life skills. The amount of work that is required is a lot, but it makes time go by fast."
good,"Working at chipotle will definitely help anyone work on their time management skills as well as learning how to deal with customer service skills. It is a very fun workplace, you will get super close with your co workers because you are always working together."
good,"For a fast food job you get paid a few dollars more per hour than the minimum wage as well as getting free food and discounts. However, the management is just ok and it's great for new teens finding their first job, but I wouldn't want to do it later on in life as the environment is not the well managed in my opinion."
good,"Good people's , flexible schedule, free meals, fun environments but a lot the time really hard job, definitely they need more crew members for all this job."
good,"If your management team is decent, it can be a great job. I'd tell any college student to go in, work hard, and take advantage of the tuition reimbursement. Just stand up for yourself and it's not too bad."
good,"The atmosphere of the place was good. The manager, and everyone working there was great, and were open to helping me out if I had any questions. It was hard work, but the atmosphere and people there made it a good time."
good,"It’s coo but the. Labor deserves higher pay "
good,I enjoyed chipotle very much and it was fun working there manager was awesome. Would go back in a heart beat. I think they should raise there hourly pay to $10
good,Chipotle Mexican Grill is a great place to work at. The employees are friendly. You get tips every night. Paid decent. It is a fast paced job so I wouldn’t recommend if you can’t work at a fast pace.
good,One of my favorite jobs. Chipotle was more than a paycheck for me. I made close friends and felt comfortable with the company. I was actually sad to leave this company but I will always look fondly at the time spent with them.
good,"It was a good job, pretty hectic on some days but overall great. The benefits and getting a pay raise every 6 months are amazing to have at a job. I would most definitely recommend this job to others."
good,"Every day is paced and busy. Don't expect to have moment to lay back and chill. You must be able to converse well with your co-workers, and be a positive, outgoing individual who enjoys working with others and keeping your body moving. And of course, one who enjoys Chipotle."
good,"Chipotle was a good first job for me, gave me a lot of restaurant experience, i got along with most of my co-workers and the management was pretty lenient. Hardest part of the job was rolling burritos!"
good,"Like any job, it does get boring doing the same thing every day but the team at the chipotle on Gosford made it so enjoyable and fun working there. I learned a lot and continue to learn about food safety guidelines and how important it is to meet those standards especially for customers."
good,I really enjoyed working with all the people and learning how to work in a very fast paced environment. The tasks were relatively simple. Overall fun and great place to work.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,You get good hours and the pay is average. It’s a pretty decent job to have if you’re a college student or don’t have much job experience. They crew is very united
good,as a service manager I was able to experience and enjoy the gratitude that comes with providing the customer with great service. i made longtime friends and a work ethic thay has shaped my view towards work.
good,As of now working here it has help me discover my abilities in many different way. This job could sometimes be challenging do to the fact we have goals to reach every day we have to all work as a team with one person that slacks or moves from their position it messes up our throughput. The challenges I face here every day it helped me use my time wisely and also be passionate about what you do or else it’ll never work out. Other then that I totally recommend this job for people with fast working skills and very friendly.
good,had to prep and get the food ready put everything out and coo the meat on the grill. do truck put things away in the walk in freezer . then help make burritos and roll them make chips and other things.
good,"Enjoyed working here was fun an productive fast paced. We were always doing something from changing pans on the line to make food look presentable ,to sweeping the floor and wiping down  the line.We always made sure the customer's come first in between our duties was the most important part."
good,"Very uniform. The tasks were repetitive daily. Not stressful at all. Staff is hardworking and kind. They were good at working with my schedule outside of work. Good food, exceptional pay."
good,The chipotle family was very welcoming to me as I worked there I felt safe and it was a very friendly environment. working there made me more mature and more responsible.
good,"I honestly miss working here. My coworkers and I saw each other as family for the most part and it was a laid back environment in the workplace. The only reason i left, is because the GM would disregard how I would tell him that i couldn't work certain days and usually put me on the schedule when he wanted to. He also would always have me on the schedule for prep which was the most tedious job. Involved mostly food preparations for the next day, cleaning, and assisting in the front. It was stressful."
good,Great place to work. Fun people to work with. learn to work as a team. stressful every day but challenge. if you can stand long periods time you would like working there. Hardest part of the job is the customer. Dealing with rude ignorant and disrespectful customers.
good,"Chipotle is definitely a place to start with for individuals that want to get their heads into the food service business. Even though you might not have experience in certain aspects of working on a restaurant, you will be trained on them, get paid for them, and have the opportunity to work different positions. So you are not stagnant in one position."
good,My experience has been quite great. The workers are very friendly and helpful. The customers are very nice. They know what they want. And don’t make things complicated
good,"Peak hours can get pretty stressful considering you have to stay in the same position as long as there is a line. There will always be something to do, so you don't get much down time. The only time you really get to rest is during your break. The coworkers get along pretty well as long as they have the same motivation/mentality. I started working here because of all the benefits the company offers."
good,A typical day at Chipotle is a very fast moving pace and what I learned working there is that you have to have thick skin and a lot of patience. Dealing with management is pretty easy they respect you and they will work around your different schedules especially if you are in school. The workplace culture there is very respectable and nobody is treated differently. The hardest part of the job is that when we run out of certain popular item during peak and for the most enjoyable part of the job is when we can right any problem for a customer if he or she have one.
good,I had a great experience with this company it was a friendly environment where everyone had to work together to get the store to flow. A typical day at work was always busy and the hardest part would be trying to get guests in and out at a good time during rush hour.
good,They overwork you but pay well at the same time. I think they need to hire better. They take sanitation very seriously now as well. Most difficult part is having aquadate co-workers
good,"fun, fast paced, and availability to move up and make really good money. only down fall is, although it takes alot to be a GM at a location, some of the ones that get the offer are more of a ""BOSS"" then a ""LEADER"" (power trip)"
good,"As my first job, I enjoyed being around such energetic people, always willing to help and provide highly quality food as well as customer service. There is place to advance and they give you 30 min break only if you work more than 6 hours."
good,great place good food and work environment. went to this company when moving too a new state and loved my time there. will recommend to those looking for experience
good,It's a great place for a first time job but after a good year I think that it's time to move on. Chipolt eyes great health insurance but the dental insurance sucks. Great place to learn basic skills for other jobs.
good,Good team but upper management outside the store is not the best. The pay and benefits given to you within three months are definitely worth especially as a college student.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"face paced, but people ruined it quick. it was fun in the beginning, but some people made it not so fun after a while. it is food service, so there is a quick turnover rate"
good,this company assures they hire the best crew members to provide the best guest services to each customer that walks in. hiring process is more to get to know you as an employee with a few personality traits
good,"Working for chipotle is fun and you can learn a lot of things from it. Their food standards is really high so you got to meet their expectations from you. It will help you grow not only as a worker, but also as a person. You get to challenge yourself to be better every time you work. Only downside to this is, you won't have much energy left after working a shift because of the workload."
good,"Typical day at work includes coming in and cleaning the whole kitchen and food area, preparing food and then serving throughout the day. Cooking food and changing out the stations."
good,"I enjoy Chipotles food and Establishment very much! Though the people I work with are all nice, I can not communicate well with them do to our language barrier. I am often the only primarily English speaking person on a morning shift."
good,"I thoroughly enjoy working at chipotle. We're like a little family. Although the job itself is fairly stressful, the fact that everyone there works together to make a shift flow well is great."
good,"Most of my negative opinions about this place have to do with the fact that I'm a student. So overall, I loved most of my coworkers, the food was very good, and it wasn't a hard job; however, it was always very busy and most nights there would be a line to the door, which was unavoidable. I also got paid a decent wage for my first job, but as time went on an I became one of the more experienced of the young crew members, they kept promising me a raise and never gave it to me. Even new hires got paid a significant amount more than me, and it was their first job too! Even after I had worked there for awhile! I also had to stay pretty late on school nights, which isn't bad if that's not a problem for you. Some managers listen better than others. I still liked the job though!"
good,Loved my bosses and co workers friendly environment and work was fast paced and well staffed and on point best job I have had! I would love to work there again no complaints
good,"If you’re a college student or you have kids, Chipotle is super chill and will absolutely work with your schedule. All around good place to work. I’d recommend it"
good,"chipotle was a good balance from home and work. the compensations and benefits are good i do believe theres good advancement "
good,I loved working at chipotle. The schedule was always flexible the pay wasn’t bad for a fast food store and the management was great. This is a great job especially for teenagers!!
good,Chipotle is not for people who want to have a relaxing job. It is a very fast paced and sometimes stressful environment. The management is good but it could be better. Your associates that you work with can be fun.
good,For me I learned about Chipotle and learning their cycle of every shift that it got exhausting and for minimum wage I knew i can do better. Chipotle is a competitive job towards other companies and rules be changed every week but the food is as always very delicious and fresh to eat as well.
good,you comein knowing what you need to do by the end of the day and you just do it. interactions with customers are usually a positive one and staff members are all very friendly and  caring of each other .
good,A typical day at chipotle is fast-paced and there is always something to do. I've learned how to run a shift and more about communicating. The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the team to ensure a smooth and positive environment through any stressful moments that may arise.
good,"I loved the job, the training was great, they will help you with anything you confused on. Customers were somewhat great too. Hours you worked were great"
good,"Most things are easy to learn, but take time to do. You have to be able to deal with the rush of customers that comes in, and have to be able to manage your time Well especially if you close."
good,A typical day at Chipotle would be your ongoing preparation and never ending lines. Smoothly running shifts and having everyone on their toes so that nothing goes wrong during shifts. Management is very understandable and concerned for well being. Learning how to speak to everyone in a different way because of different personalities was something that had to be learned. The hardest part of the job was when we were short on staff. Enjoyable part was your daily regulars coming in and saying hi making days brighter. As well as working with the great people I encountered on my journey with Chipotle.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,I worked at chipotle for over four years. Ended on a bad note but I appreciated my time there. Lots of room to grow and move up in the company if you're interested.
good,"Working at Chipotle is a great to have if you want it to be your first job. It have good management, discount on meals, and benefits. It has some bad days, but what job doesn't"
good,"The job is fun nice people and amazing workers "
good,"Easy fast paced work, good team, good management. If the need to call out occured, the management was supportive and never pressured you to come in sick."
good,Great opportunity in advancing in the company. Management and staff train with patience. They teach you all the skills you need to advance in their company.
good,it was busy restaurant and a good experience. I learned a lot working with Chipotle. I had an opportunity to become a kitchen manager but decided to move out of state.
good,If you enjoy people and food look no further! Chipotle offers a safe and enjoyable work environment. Training is vey understandable. Employees share common work and life goals. Which often brings a team feeling.
good,"Love the food, co-workers and managers in the joplin Missouri location. Great team work and great experience. Recommend them. Training was great, also paid. Plus tips"
good,Overall chipotle is a very good working enviorment but staffing could be better to help with productivity. It is a very routine job and everyone works as a team to complete one goal
good,"A typical day at work consisted of preparing food for the customers. In doing so, I learned how to be efficient with my time, practice cleanliness and organization, all while upholding the high standards of the company. The management team was fantastic and were always willing to help when the restaurant began to fill up. The hardest part about the job was not having others work as hard as me."
good,"Loved Working Here , Great music . Great people . I got paid well , and I loved doing my job . Got free food , discounts , learned a lot about food , great service"
good,"Morning Shift- stock up bags, sauces, napkins, straws, counted my draw and began my shift. i cleaned the dining area and ring up orders. i also made sure the bathroom were clean and smelt good as well"
good,"Great part-time work. Fast paced. Flexible hours, great for college students. A lot of teamwork.  You cook and prepare the food. Typical kitchen protocols."
good,"I would recommend this job to any college student. The schedules are flexible, if given enough warning. The job itself is very stressful, but I love the people I work with."
good,"I did morning opens. I prepped the line and made things like the salsa, corn quac, and others. But it was really family friendly and the people were working there are amazing."
good,It was a pretty nice place to work and something to help you get on your feet. You have to be fast when the customers give you their order. I loved my customers they would always make my day.
good,"I usually worked short shifts in the morning time and it was always pretty busy. When I first started working there the pace was a little hard to keep up especially since I had received very little training upfront but after a while, you learn to keep up."
good,"Chipotle's culture was more like a startup than a company for 2500 locations.  With all new executive leadership, there was lots of change.  Including moving from Denver to Newport Beach."
good,the company is the perfect for someone trying to do culinary arts. it makes it possible to survive and not to do some much to do it. The company goods
good,"A typical day at work was enjoyable with a lot of awesome people but also some awful ones."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I made friends that I still have from chipotle.  Although this job is not an ideal job for a long term thing, it was a great starting point to get used to the atmosphere of working."
good,"My first job experience with Chipotle was... not bad. Obviously, I had a blast with certain people and silent treatments with others- especially closing (which make sense). I did however enjoy learning something new, like making buritos, how to cook Chipotle's food and so on."
good,"fun place.they had good vibes."
good,"Pros:"
good,"loved the environment, poor management. Learned a lot cooking and recipes wise, still use the recipes till this day.  workplace culture was positive on most days"
good,"I learned a lot working at chipotle.  They do not hire outside managers so I had to start as a crew member.  I was not happy about this at first but after I went through the training process it made me respect the job and company.  "
good,"Go in clock in, wash your hands, put your apron on. I prefer to stock the line then get on the line and start. I learned team work and several chiptole recipes. Mangers are flexible and understanding. Never leaving on time. The environment is my favorite part of the job."
good,great place to work if you like chicken and burritos u feel apart of a tam and not alone they help with confidence and public speaking overall loved working there
good,"i would recommend this job because the manager was amazing very understanding and got things done. there benifits are great. had a lot of hours, and países pretty well for being i’m high school and working part time."
good,My specific location was amazing at training. Very thorough in terms of teaching how to prep and cook. Customers were always very nice and regular eaters.
good,Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc is a great place to work at if you are in high school or college. It is very fast paced and you must be able to multi task. It is stressful environment during busy days such as the holiday season and the summer or when you are understaffed. On a typical day you will perform the duties of your assigned station(s) and help bring a great customer experience. At Chipotle you receive many great benefits however some are only available after working there for a year. You can potentially build some great friendships and connections but at end of day you must be a hardworking individual to be successful. They are a little flexible with availability. They are growth opportunities but the further you grow Chipotle expects you to quit school and dedicate your life to that store.
good,"I really liked working at Chipotle. As a cashier, you have to make sure that the dining room is clean all the time, check that restrooms are always clean, etc. You have to work at a quick pace all the time and of course, always have a big smile when greeting customers."
good,I liked working here just not enough hours or big enough paycheck. I really liked everybody that worked there specially the manager I thought he was very understanding and laid back and had a cool personality.
good,"Chipotle is the best job I've had. It's fast paced, you get free food when you're working, and keeps you on your toes. This is a good first job if you can learn quickly."
good,"The only downside to this job was the inconsistency of stable management. Other than that, the environment, people, and benefits far exceeded my expectations and provided a well-rounded place to work."
good,"i enjoyed working at chipole. the only issues with this company is when you go on maternity leave they take you out of the system and have to re apply for your job and there is no guaranteed  that you will get your job back, other than that trying to take a break was a little hard to. since i worked such long hours and i needed to get off my feet and eat. sometimes i didn't get a break for a VERY long shift."
good,"Working here has been a great learning experience. I met lots of new people and gained great experience in the foodservice industry. Through cross training, I had the opportunity to learn various parts of the business that I found to very educational and helpful in gaining transferrable skills for future endeavors."
good,"A typical day at chipotle was a bit stressful. It was always fast-paced and you had to be alert at all times. What I learned is that I can't be taking my time with my tasks, I have to do them right away. The management was not bad, I wish he would be a bit more flexible with calling out because we do have lives and things happen too! The workplace and culture was fun, and upbeat. Always active too. The hardest part of the job was to deal with the annoying and rude customers that would hold up a long line. The most enjoyable part of the job would be being able to see content faces and provide excellent customer service with a great outcome."
good,a typical day at work is fast paced. you work as a team. the workplace culture is busy.the hardest part is the lifting and cleaning.the most enjoyable part is free lunch
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Great for a first time job. You gain a lot of experience in the restaurant industry and great customer service."
good,"There are many benefits. The work hours are flexible. It does get very busy, so be ready for a fast paced environment. There is also the opportunity to advance to management."
good,working at chipotle was fast paced. there is alot of preparation. its a safe place to work cue to the rules and regulations for the staff and the customers. the staff treat each other other like family. its one of those jobs you have t work up and advance.
good,Great place to atmosphere was laid back management was amazing and helpful. Very fast paced they promote from within giving many opportunities to employees.
good,"Great company to work for overall. Each location is different, but very respectable food and treatment toward employees. Breaks were distributed correctly and all staff were respected."
good,I appreciated Chipotles effort to unsure all food that it serves is as natural and fresh as possible given each stores location. Coupled with the intent of purchasing produce and meat locally to support community business
good,This was my first job I had. I was able to keep this job for over a year because it was such a good work environment. It was simple work that you were able to complete. I was going to get promoted to kitchen manager but I was not able. This was due to the face that I moved from Colorado to California.
good,Chipotle is moving forward with advancing in the industry in a positive way and change is required in order to grow. Chipotle is trying out new initiatives.
good,I loved working at Chipotle and feel like I learned a lot however my main manager at the time was very strict and made me feel like I was only there to make her look good. Some rules made at our location made other locations laugh and ask us how we function. I also would be schedule to work a set amount of hours and then during my shift she would tell me I would have to stay longer. Not even asking or offering me the extra hours. Meaning I would be there for ten hours or after the store closed be there two hours after close.
good,I truly enjoyed working at chipotle. It's fast paced and a bit stressful at times but the environment overall was great and I got along with everyone right away.
good,"Chipotle has great benefits, great company for young adults just getting out of high school, great opportunities for entering college, flexible schedules"
good,It was nice to work there. They gave good hours and good pay but at the end me and another manager just did see eye to eye as i was on the way to also becoming a manager so it did not work out.
good,Chipotle allowed you to relax with music that is played while you work.  They tried to raise through the ranks in management. They work around your needs to help you.
good,It was hard to get the hang of at first but once I did it was a fun environment with great coworkers. The management was nice and very helpful but struggled with scheduling hours appropriately. I also can’t complain about the free food and paid breaks.
good,This is an awesome place to work. It is a nurturing environment where there are chances to move up to management. I recommend working here for anyone who loves customer service!
good,"Working at Chipotle is intense. Everything proceeds at breakneck pace throughout the shift, with almost no downtime. There is no sitting down, no standing around, and absolutely no goofing off while on the clock. The store is to be kept tidy, and must be completely spotless at the end of the night. However, the company respects its employees, and makes an effort to promote good company culture. You are provided a free meal with every shift, and a paid break during which to eat it. Overall, a good, if stressful, place to work."
good,Had a fun time working there meeting new people & showing new co workers the way to do things correctly . Working there I was able use a knife at a fast pase like a chefs off of the movies.  Most importantly learning to work with people and learning people skills
good,"Chipotle has definitely had a huge influence in my life. It's taught me a large amount of skills, such as time management, organization, leadership, problem solving and working as a team. It is super fast paced and it is not a job for everyone. As a manager you really have to rely on everyone in your team. I love working as a team with great individuals, but there's many call outs and the company is changing fast and drastically."
good,"At Chipotle, every day is full of stress, and speed. It is a great experience to learn how to deal with sensitive customers, and learn to check for details. The management was great, any request for the schedule was made if given enough time for the managers to act. Although, since the low amount of crew closing was exhausting to the point in which is common to clock out 15 to 30 minutes later than scheduled. Nevertheless, Interacting with a great variety of customers and co-workers from various and different backgrounds is one of the most amazing things related to this job."
good,"For a fast food  restaurant,Chipotle is an ok place to work. Working with the crew is one of the better parts. The work is not too difficult with enough practice."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Fat working place good benefits just need more hours overall a good working job for students that need a little extra cash on the side to make a living off of you have to work extremely hard
good,Good job .. good people ... good atmosphere! Good team .
good,its a fun place to work. It is a quick paced place to work.  everyone is nice and respectful. its a very hygienic place to work and is full of excitement.
good,"Great work environment. Great people. Very understanding people. Much room for advancement. Would recommend this job to anyone, who is looking for a job or if it is their first job."

good,"Good company, provides really good customer sefvices, ensuring the customer always leave happy . Great opportunity to move up on the company. Good benefits."
good,"I liked this job a lot, although sometimes it was a little stressful and the manager was a little complicated, the benefits offered by the company are pretty good!"
good,"While working in Chipotle has an incredible benefit of getting that free food, and tuition reimbursement, management can be kinda bad sometimes, as they sometimes prioritize promoting or giving hours to those who suck up to them or people who they consider friends."
good,I neeeded a part time job during high school. It was a stepping stone for me to work clothing retail afterward at Garage. Garage was a fast pace enviornment unlike Chipotle.
good,"Its a great company, cares about their people and development, I start as a cashier and made it all the way to general Manager, so the preach what they say of growing in the company."
good,"Thought this was an excellent place to work at, my coworkers and managers at my site were really cool, we got along for the most part. "
good,"A typical day was get your morning errands done, set up, and be prepared for customers, working line, you share of dish duty, it was an equal community to work in. You all had a common goal, you knew each other well enough that you could exchange numbers to switch shifts. Hardest part was being fast paced when the customers were slow. Best was free food and getting paid awesome."
good,"i learned about having a sense or urgency,gained leadership skills due to my promotion, learned how to run a shift of 5-8 crew members, learned proper meat temperatures that are safe to be consumed."
good,"Chipotle is my favorite job I've ever had. I loved the food, the customers, the company, but unfortunately I had poor management that got fired shortly before I quit. I would recommend working here, and there is ample room for advancement from within."
good,It was very fast pace work environment. You were constantly on your feet  and moving. Even when it closed you were constantly cleaning and making sure that everything was up to standers.
good,"Chipotle work is face paced and stressful. Its also fun and helpful with the right people around you. Management there are usually just as cool as the crew members because they understand the job at hand and want to succeed at it. The hardest part of the job was standing over the grill cooking and not being able to stop the sweat from forming under my shirt. I enjoyed the rest of the crew member i worked there with, they made the experience and learning processes go by easy."
good,At Chipotle the sense of urgency was always there even during downtime. There was no space for slacking. The management always made it a point that the bar was set very high as far as customer service. The easiest part of the job was knowing how the food needed to be cooked but the hardest part of the job was working with a very demanding management team for a job that didn't compensate well.
good,"I would start cooking the meats and getting ready for the rush. I would just cook a lot of foods and made sure that the line didn't run out of anything. They taught me how to make a really good steak, also taught me how to cut meats properly. The management was fine. It was an awesome work experience. The hardest part was trying to keep up with the food when the rush was going on."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,It was a positive and great place to work within a team. The company provided the staff with all the resources to be successful. Food quality and cleanliness of the facility were our main focuses.
good,One thing I didn't like when I used to work on the kitchen prepping food I was by myself but on the line it will be like 10 emploees preparing customer orders. I would have had no assistant to help me so that was one thing and make me want to leave the job I was not getting no help too much pressure
good,"Each day depending on where you worked that day you would help prep the food, prep the line, handle the assemble of the food, cash out customers, and clean the building.I learned a lot about team work and more to my customer service skills. Most management was fun and approachable, s couple were just not qualified and not good at leading. The culture there was just work hard and please the customer as much as possible. The hardest part of the job was the rushes with lunch and dinner and the most enjoyable was working with my co workers and interacting with the customers."
good,Friendly people with a helpful environment. No over time so hours are scarce. Management is nice and interested in your advancement in the company. Overall good place to work.
good,you will learn and gain lots skills to grow from. its an amazing place to work for since you work as a team and help each other out when working. you will gain lots of experience
good,I enjoyed working here and still miss it. The food was delicious and I got it for free whenever I worked. The team was very close and worked well together
good,maintaining positive attitude while helping with food preparations providing top tier customer service to all customers  opening and closing processing truck orders and inventory count
good,Chipotle is a great company to start in. If you put the effort you can move up in positions. You get great hours. Is very fast passed but it's great. Chipotle has taught me different skills
good,"As long as you are willing to, there are many opportunities to advance. Typically you will be dealing with over one hundred customers a day. Management is wonderful when good, terrible when bad. All depends on the location of your store."
good,"- Fast paced and focused work"
good,Good place to work for in general nice people lots of customer service experience and team work together give u chance to grow with the business and learn
good,"Helped me make some extra cash before college. It was quick-paced and a long workday, but I enjoyed working there and interacting with the people that work there"
good,A typical day is busy during certain hours and fast pace. Customer service is a must. I have learned how to better manage time and how to work with customers even when the hour gets stressful. The management at work is professional. The work place culture is centered around team work. The hardest part of the job was not “not breaking a big burrito”. The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting different customers and building positive rapports with co-workers.
good,"It's a fast pace environment. The people were great to work with. It was a good job, and I did enjoy it very much. I just have a change in living arrangements."
good,"It was a fun work place, I loved it for the time being, the other managers were cool, you tend to get along with a lot of people who work for the company"
good,"I learned a lot working there. Met a lot of good people, but don't intend on returning. It was a great place to work, for good pay and great benefits."
good,I liked working there i got along with the other workers everyone was nice and caring. They helped a lot if i need help. They always made me laugh but we still got the work done. And working there made me feel at home.
good,Fun environment always something to do while working there. Interaction with customers. Ability to grow within the company and demonstrate your leadership skills.
good,"A typical day of work consisted of a rush here and there, cleaning each night. I learned a lot about food safety and I learned a variety of people skills and useful service skills for future jobs. Management can be very poor, managers have favoritism and are somewhat childish and unprofessional. Hardest part of the job was juggling all requirements and tasks throughout shift, and also meeting deadline times before closing time.  The most enjoyable part of the job was always learning new things, the culture is amazing and the workers that work there typically aren't lazy and it's always better to work with people that know how to do their job."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"typical days at Chipotle during school sessions were busy and nonstop durinng summer and winter breaks slowed down due to people going back home for vacation"
good,I work for a short period of time so i dont know exacltly to much about this comoany but i know for personal.experience that you can grow quick in this company for me it was kind of hard because it was  my second job
good,They pay well and they give good hours. Being in high school and working there was hard because id do an 8 hour shift after school and wouldn't get home late making it hard to manage both
good,"The enviorment was good, i liked the work and the people i worked were great, the company was really good i felt that i got paid enough. My favorite part though is the food i loved it."
good,"The workers there are great people! Everyone cool, the only that sucks are sometimes the costumers. People somehow forget we aren’t perfect and are going to mess some things up, but you can’t change that."
good,Chipotle is a fun but stressful place to work. I loved it there until management changed. I can still say I love my job just not the managers. It’s a great way to start a career.
good,A typical day there consisted of a lot of hands on work as far as dicing produce and cutting meat and produce to the standards of the company. Checking applications and running great shifts so guest feel like they are happy to come and enjoy their meals. I enjoyed everything cause I take much pride in everything I do and making sure the guest are happy.
good,"Great hours and okay pay. Easy to move up and make a career out of it. Fast pace environment and fun to work, time seems to fly. Great way to learn new recipes and get better at cooking"
good,"Chipotle Mexican Grill offers fair pay provided you are willing to keep up with the rigorous work ethic and pace set by the managers. As a first time job, I would not recommend it."
good,"At chipotle you have to be ready to work at a fast pace. I learned how to use an electronic cash register, how to count draws and do refunds while taking online orders and answering the phone. The hardest part of the job is when you are asked to do more than one thing like bag chips make drinks stock the refrigerator and still be on the cash register at the same. The most enjoyable part was being able to get rid of the customers really fast and your able to get a quick drink and sit down for a few"
good,"A typical day at Chipotle involves taking in fresh produce from trucks, preparing and cooking said produce, and serving food to customers while maintaining high sanitary conditions. Very busy at times but was good in preparing workers for such stress."
good,"Overall, the company cares about their people and its culture. You strive to improve yourself everyday when working there. Cleanliness, was by far the most stressed thing there."
good,Easy work typically. Usually do the same routines every shift. Only problem is just breaks could be a little longer. Easy to learn everything. All very simple and just becomes muscle memory.
good,"Chipotle is a great for people who are fresh straight out of high school or is still currently in school. I wouldn't say Chipotle is a career, its more of a job just to keep money in your pocket"
good,"great place to work, got lots of experience, gained skills that can be transferable into other work environments. The staff and management was very kind and respectful"
good,"The typical day for working on the Line included serving customers, keeping the line clean, and stocking everything for your station when your shift ends. Throughout my time there I have learned how to work in a fast-paced environment and multitask. Many Chipotles are not very busy (barring peak time, of course), but I work in one that is very busy on a daily basis. The General Manager right now is nice, but terrible at scheduling. I personally have had problems where I'd have to stay an extra 1 or 2 hours because no one was scheduled to replace me for that time. The hardest part of the job would be keeping up with the line that amasses during peak times, and the most enjoyable part is that the work culture is very fun (at least when everything is calm)."
good,"It was a cool fast paced job, the environment was comfortable and professional.  Great place for family and friends, and offers great benefits for its workers"
good,Diversity in the workplace made Chipotle a fun place to work. The company provides you with a free meal everyday and it was something to look forward to when going to work.
good,It’s alright but the pay is what is bad and should be better for the amount of work and expectancy from higher ups. I loved working here just feel no place to grow.
good,I worked temporary for Chipotle. I did enjoy my time working as a crew member for the company. I've liked working in a fast and moving environment.  I was promoted to begin training as a chef the third day after I was hired.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Working at Chipotle provides an individual with a great amount of experience especially if it is their first job. While the experience and compensation were pretty decent, being that I worked at a brand new store, the store manager was extremely new to the job and was unable to keep up with the pace of the store. However, many of the service managers who transferred to the store were able to facilitate and maintain the restaurant to the best of their abilities."
good,"It's a pretty fast-paced, stressful working environment depending on how busy the store is. Sometimes it was so busy I didn't have time to wash my hands. The salary is pretty good as a first job. It's a good option for experience with customer service or meal preparation. The store has good benefits such as free lunches each shift and tuition reimbursement. Crew member training has improved greatly."
good,"I began at Chipotle in 2013 as a crew member in Columbia, MD. Within a year and a half I climbed the management ladder from crew to Kitchen Manager, Service Manager and Apprentice (GM in training). The focus of the company was to grow the culture in stores and help their employees achieve their own goal. As crew we were expected to properly prepare, cook and serve safe and delicious food. As managers we focused on training our crew and empower them to see and treat the store as their own. This culture built a family within the stores I worked in and inspired me to grow everyday. I finally left the company as an Apprentice as I worked in the 3rd busiest store in the US at the time. I was scheduled to work 50 hours (salaried) but because of the volume of sales in store ended up working 70+ hours. I am extremely grateful for the experience and would highly recommend it to anyone who likes fast paced work. I learned things ranging from communication skills, cash handling, cost of sales, food preparation and cooking, etc."
good,"Working at Chipotle was an great experience. Chipotle taught me skills such as responsibility, effective teamwork, and perseverance. These skills can help further my experience is the workplace entirely. The management sometimes show a lack of emotional awareness about their employees, but the employees persist positive attitude made an welcoming atmosphere. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting customers and helping them with their orders."
good,"Always go go go at chipotle, There is always something to do through out the day. I learned management skills through chipotle. The culture is diverse and energetic. Hardest part of the job is the potential to be non stop busy with little time to take a breather. The most enjoyable part was the team and management."
good,I loved working at chipotle everyone was so friendly . Everyone was hands on for rush hour  training was so relaxed and understanding and the food is just amazing !!
good,"I had a great experience at CMG. The people and culture are great, and the pay was fair.  The location of the offices is good for most. Management as far as I could tell, cares about their people and takes care of them."
good,"a typical day at work is very fast paced everyone works hard. It is a great place to work , the team pushes each other to work hard and motivate each other to be the best we can be and provide a great guest experience."
good,Chipotle has a very quick-paced customer service and gets very busy during the day. Working here made me learn how to pick up on things quick without forgetting little details.
good,"Overall pretty good place to work if you don't have a degree. Great benefits, like paid vacations, paid sick days, college reimbursement, ect. Opportunity to move up with the company quickly if willing to put in the work."
good,"It is a fast paced work place that always had something to work on, there was a certain way to work that made everyone happy and easy to keep busy while still making sure the customers got exactly what they like."
good,"great place to work. The management is very nice, we get free meals on our working days. It is not easy though, to adjust the quickly changing schedule. You had to call in which was a hassle."
good,"I worked on the line, preparing and serving meals to the highest quality. It was a fast-pasted environment which made the time go by fast. My coworkers and management were very fun to work with and I enjoyed the experience."
good,Not high paying and not really a place you want to get stuck at but it is fun at times and for a younger person you are going to be working with a lot of young adults as well.
good,"We would prepare the food at the beginning of each and would do our best to keep a positive environment for the day. Completed our tasks as a team, especially when it became very busy. The management would help the workers and would put in as much effort as we did each and everyday."
good,"Worked there for three years. Experience completely depends on the managers. Had horrible managers who would not train people, refuse to give breaks, and leave two people to work the entire store while they sat at the Panera next door having ""meetings"" with other clocked in managers (almost every day). When I moved stores I had better managers except I would get my break for my 10 hour shift at the beginning of my shift. Wasn't allowed to eat while we closed or take food home so I basically had to starve from 2-midnight most shifts. It was fun sometimes though, just very busy and like I said completely dependent on the managers and how much they actually cared about their team members."
good,"Management is for the most part very good, training takes a while but once it is done, the job gets easier. The food is quality, too, so it's nice to feel proud of the food you serve."
good,Chipotle is. great place to work especially for a first job. they give good hours with competitive pay rates and it there are great fun people working with you.
good,It was a family place and great place to work for. The people i worked for was family and always had your back with everything when it came to work or family they was always there to talk to if you need to talk to. fun place to work
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,On a typical day I prepare food and set up stations to get the store ready for the day. Communication is very important to do this well. Once we open I interact with each customer and insure they their experience is excellent and they will be a repeat customer.
good,"I had a great experience working for chipotle. They taught me communication is key, how to stay calm under stressed situations, and how to cook different foods at safe temperatures."
good,"Chipotle is very quick-paced, but for the most part I had fun working there. The majority of the employees there were very friendly. Management at Chipotle is very organized, they keep you on your toes, and they make sure you are having fun. Training for first time employees is well constructed, they make sure you know what you're doing before you serve a customer."
good,"Having to work at chipotle guaranteed anyone the skills and probability to handle anything with care, even a situation that could be overwhelmed. Chipotle teaches you and help you understand the importance of keeping a work environment clean."
good,"Very fast paced job. Everything they stood for is very inspiring. I was supposed to be full time and just bought my first car so I had car payments to make now. I wasn't good at what they kept putting me on so they kept cutting my hours. I was getting 12 hours a week. There was also a manager there that was incredibly mean to me for no reason. I was new so I had a lot of questions. That's overall why I left. The hours and how I was treated."
good,"Working there was nice. I was the line cook most of the time there. Its nice a peaceful during the day but its starts to get busy around 6:30. Other then that, its a nice place to work."
good,"Basically, most field leaders are shady and it isn't rare to find a racist field leader either. It's easy to get promoted if you want it, you just need to push yourself for it. Everything I know about leadership came from Chipotle, so I do appreciate that--you can take the skills anywhere with you. Not everybody is on the same page as you though, and there are a lot of people who are stuck in a high school mentality and need drama to survive. Just watch out for yourself, know who to trust, and get what you want out of it."
good,It depends on the day to tell you if it will be quick-paced or not. I learn many tricks like rolling a burrito and learning a little spanish . Management is okay.
good,"When I clocked in, I would normally go to grill 2 or head for the line, depending on what the job list designated. I learned how to cook/prepare all the food. The workplace culture was calm, and I bettered my Spanish in the process. The hardest part of the job was the food always being in high demand, but it was nothing you couldn't handle. The most enjoyable part of my job was my coworkers."
good,"The typical day is pretty relaxing until it gets busy. I've learned a lot including cutting skills, time management,quick pace etc etc. The management is okay. The workplace culture is pretty okay as well. The hardest part of the job is the pressure. The most enjoyable part is the people."
good,"Chipotle was a great family atmosphere ,learned a lot on how to make people smile just by smiling I made a lot of people happy coming in and out of the store. it was a great lesson on making people happy and I will forever appreciate the opportunity ."
good,"un ambiente agradable; buena comida, clientes sastifechos"
good,Chipotle is a fast-paced job where you are always on your feet.  Good communication skills are required as most of the day consists of communicating with customers and coworkers.
good,"Great way to start learning to deal with food if school is too expensive. I do not regret the experience i have gained from Chipotle."
good,Working for chipotle is fun in the morning you have your music and you get talk joke around with your coworkers.THE manger that I have is very compassionate with everyone. Likes to sing along. At 10:45 we open and it's all about the customer.we greed them and make sure and everything that they want is to their satisfaction.we also get to eat for free.
good,I worked with nice people and the managers were very understanding. I also enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant itself. I was always busy and communicating effectively with my workers.
good,"When the store went down I was threw into the most complicated position with no training and basically had to learn myself. When I did get comfortable with it , I was already at the point where I was tired of the job"
good,"Great company to work, the main issue is the disengagement of upper management with the store level management which sometimes feel we have not support"
good,quick pace work place but al well positive staff. Everyone is there to help each other to complete goal and task. management is very help with training and building a great pipeline.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"A pleasant work experience at Chipotle Mexican Grill. I would recommend Chipotle Mexican Grill to a friend.  Fast-paced, clean environment.  Fair compensation."
good,"Who said work couldn't be fun? When you have team who knows how each other work and have good communication, you are bound to have some fun. The team at Chipotle always praised each others success outside of work and inside."
good,"First thing id always do was wash my hands, I would go on the line and make sure all food was full and fresh. Daily duties were serving customers and preparing food. The hardest part of my job was when we would get really busy and we would often hold on food in which people had to wait."
good,This job is a great job for the people that are barely starting to work. Managers are usually really nice and help you when you need it. It can be stressful once rush hour hits.
good,"Fresh cut vegetables, clean and well organized, fast and proficient workers. The amount of people that came in and out of the restaurant in such a short amount of time was amazing. Chipotle has some of the fastest workers iv ever seen"
good,"While Chipotle was certainly an awesome company with an awesome vision and culture, over the past two years I think it is going slightly downhill. The vision has changed multiple times, and the previous CEO's have stepped down, more than likely because of the stress of managing all these restaurants that take advantage of the little guy aka their lowest employees"
good,A typical day at work depending on the shift it'll go pretty good just because it a good day and the great your able to work with not that shift. The hardest part is having to work super fast and under pressure
good,"Working at chipotle is incredibly amazing. It is fast paced and you always have something to do. However, management is the only downfall to this place."
good,Loved working there the people are great and enjoyed working in that atmosphere. Enjoyed the schedule and the great food. Overtime available. Great working with schedule
good,"Great place to work. People were very nice and fun to work with day after day. Sadly, shipping errors happened often and we ran out of essentials far too often."
good,I really enjoyed working for chipotle & I’d recommend anyone whose really excited to work to apply for the company. The management did their absolute best to train me and get me where I needed to be be in order to do my job correctly.
good,Chipotle is a fun and friendly work environment outside the food rushes. They have great opportunities for advancement and were always pushing to move people up in the company. They rarely hire anyone for upper level positions and almost always promote from within.
good,"typical day of work at chipotle is fast paced. Great teamwork here and can always ask for help if needed. Management and staff is great, helpful, and respectful ."
good,"I've grown with the company the past two and a half years. It has gone through many changes some for the better, some otherwise. I'd say they need to work on managing the time of workers, focus on raises and cross-training. And also, maintain the hours and schedules each week instead of changing it up. But the managers were aring and understanding. They're hard-workers. Chipotle gets very busy at times and we need to focus on delivering the best service."
good,If you like a fast paced environment this can be a job for you it is super fast paced and can be stressful. My experience was not so good because our store was barley opening up and the management was not so great. The attitude that is implemented is great though you will build relationships with workers and have fun working
good,Chipotle is a place where there is a lot going on at one time. It can be a chaotic environment but it is fast-paced and can be a fun atmosphere to work in.
good,"I really enjoyed the employees I worked with, everyone had a fantastic attitude, wasn't afraid to give each other help or advice. The guests left feeling great about themselves for choosing chipotle to have a meal."
good,it was fun jut always usually busy fast paced long hours staff called out a lot workers used to always get angry and take it out on each other mangers used to teach only a few times
good,There’s is nothing I would change but I want another job due to financial reasons and experience I’ve been needing two jobs for a while now. Chipotle is a great  environment.
good,"This workplace is a good place to start and to learn a lot about the food industry, especially coming from such a place where they are ahead in the game."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"When I was being interviewed for the job, they told me to prepare for how fast and hectic it becomes, but I seriously underestimated how hectic and chaotic it got. I worked at the busiest Chipotle in my town, so when we would reach peak hour, it truly became a race to serve as much guests as we can within that one hour window. And that's truly where my lack of experience became evident. My only problem with Chipotle is that you are asked to do so much with very little training. As soon as I got the hang of one job, i.e prepping lettuce, I was pushed into another, i.e cashier. They trained us through training videos, that we only got to watch one time, and don't get me wrong, they helped, but I'm a very hands on person. "
good,"Excellent place for a first job during high school or supplemental income. I personally had a terrific time under the employ of Chipotle. However, when moving back to school I was unable to make it back  within the 90 days to keep my position and was terminated."
good,"I had a great time during the period I had worked at Chipotle.  The team I had was great, pay was good, and can't beat free Chipotle.  When we would get slammed was as worse as it got.  Messing up an order meant mayhem if there was a long line!  You have to be on your toes when serving at times, as customers enjoy to be nitpicky sometimes with how they like their food prepared or done.  Lack of communication on this end has to lead to I or others messing up a whole order because something had not been clarified.  So good listening skills are important."
good,"Chipotle is a great place to work. Starting as a crew member and working my way up to management, I had a good idea of what I wanted to get out of it. Management was difficult because some of my fellow managers dragged us down. The company had many strict guidelines which made it far less enjoyable to work for. I found that they were far more worried about paperwork and computer work than customer service."
good,"It was a lot of pressure."
good,"Chipotle was my first employer. A typical day as a cashier is regularly stocking your station in preparation for guests, cleaning, and more cleaning. Your manager will stress the importance of handwashing as well as maintaining the Front of House and guest service areas. I learned that I can handle a lot more pressure than I thought! My team and I were continuously able to keep lines going even if the line was close to snaking out of the restaurant. I also learned that speed is everything with Chipotle, and you have to constantly be ready to adapt to workplace changes within your store. The management at the store I was employed at was great, but I do wish they had listened to the employees a bit more. Despite that, your team members become like your second family. There's no animosity because you all share a common bond, and you're likely to meet someone exactly like you. Keep in mind that expectations of you and the team always rise higher, so be prepared to meet and exceed them to the best of your ability. There are also high rates of new hires, so watch out for that! Interacting with the guests as a cashier and giving them great service was my greatest joy, as well as being a part of a supportive team. It's a great job if you're up for the challenge."
good,"A day in Chipotle was always challenging and kept you on your toes, but I enjoyed it. Amazing environment and co-workers. Although, under weak management, still strived for success. All food was made to perfection and meeting high standards. I enjoyed the  rush and it felt good to never run out of food and stay strong the whole time."
good,"working at a fast food restaurant you will find yourself always doing something. but the environment was fun thanks to my other coworkers. but since it is so fast paced, time goes by quicker."
good,"We got several produce trucks during the week and made our pico de gallo fresh every morning. Plenty of training that is required for all employees.We established a great ,fun, and safe working environment.I loved going to work everyday,even in the stressful times where I had to make a hard decision I knew I could count on my crew to back me up on whatever that decision might of been."
good,"Great company to work for, unfortunately due to current situation I can no longer see myself advancing here.................... ...   ................"
good,It was a great start for me and helped me develop my personal and professional skills. The whole process system was genuine and well integrated. The staff are welcoming and motivational at every stage.
good,It was a good job not for the long term but for a part time job. i had wonderful cowrokers and they felt like a part of my family as well as my managers they were very understanding and caring.
good,"Chipotle helped me build on my social skills and confident in myself. Also, a sense of dependents and team work because at chipotle every-bodies role is important. It's very friendly environment, clean, and fast paced."
good,"Great management relaxed work environment. Great culture clean store"
good,Same as always its fast paced amazing work environment it has great co workers and management. Overall a great place to work at starting off as a high school student.
good,i enjoy working as the cashier. scottsdale is a really nice part of town in Arizona. the time went by fast too because i was constantly busy. i loved it
good,At chipotle they are all about the advancement of their team members. The job culture is so strong which is why they have a 3 interview process just to make sure that candidates are positive that they are ready to come join a family.
good,Great environment to work with people. Can be a bit intense during our busy hours but nothing you can't handle.  Theres good management that are more than willing to help you out.
good,The workplace culture that is implemented is very beneficial to the overall productivity of the crew members. They create a focus on the importance of personal empowerment.
good,A typical day at work is wonderful. I learned how to prep food and i also learned how to cook food on line. It was a wonderful work place culture i enjoyed working there. In my opinion i don't think there was any hard parts about working at Chipotle its a easy paced job.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Overall, it was a nice atmosphere. The company is absolutely a great company, they treat you as if you are family. When it comes to the service of food, you should always keep a clean atmosphere. My favorite part of this job was interacting with so many people."
good,Start early in the morning for food prep and then take a 30 minutes break before what store open.. for a free meal. After eating store opened and began to serve customers.
good,"I enjoyed working with my co workers, they were friendly and it felt like a family buisness. A typical day would be a rush of tourist around lunch hour and a slow paced evening. The hardest part of the job for me was when didntt do as good as i have before, good performance for me is always important when on the job. Management felt like a bit of blurred lines, they were your friend after the shift is over but your boss on the clock."
good,The crew members at chipotle are very helpful and working there is fun even with all the responsibilities. You get to experience mexican american culture too
good,"The first Chipotle I worked at was very ideal, and I worked there for almost two years. I was treated fairly, the co-workers were cool, and the managers were genuine. Sure, some of the customers made work a little tiring, but that's life. The atmosphere of the restaurant was pleasant, and we didn't have to worry too much about being robbed or anything like that."
good,the environment is great with a lot to learn and easy to navigate         hardest part is memorizing recipes and staying oriented..                            the most enjoyable aspect was the people and the culture of the environment.
good,"I enjoyed working with managers and co-workers, but the job itself sucked. It was very fast paced, hectic, and a lot of stress for such low pay. The best thing about that place was the workplace culture and motivation the managers teach you. There are way better options for a job. This is a job for high schoolers."
good,"i loved my team and i loved the way chipotle took care of their customers and employees. i fell in love with my regulars and my team mates. we were a family,"
good,Chipotle is a really fun place to work at because it has a culture that no other company have. But someday it can be really stressful because of the fast pace line and the never ending line.
good,This job is fast paste job. Its a great job to help you learn knife skills and many other skills. The culture at Chipotle is very okay but it can defiantly be better. Management isn't bad. Most enjoyable part of my job would have to that I'm always learning something new.
good,"I think Chipotle has been the best place I've worked at by far. It is not a hard job if you're someone who likes to be constantly working. We had fair pay for the amount of effort and flexibility we had for our positions. I think they have a good idea of what kinds of people to employ based on personality and leadership. All my coworkers are drama free and are respectful, it is an ideal work atmosphere. Unfortunately, the amount of hours I was very minimal and often times run the risk of even less hours/flexibility on slower weeks."
good,"The typical day at my work would be coming in during a shift change and oversee tasks that need to be fulfilled within the next hours. Until the store closes, my responsibility was to ensure food was being served at a high quality and fast pace."
good,"taking notes learning the kitchen ,how to prep what to use when preping and greeting coworkers getting your schedule then keeping up and learning the pace was fun the hard part was when they would have a rush because theres never enough speed when it keeps coming"
good,great work environment. get to meet new people everyday customer service. cashier services required to be good with numbers and give correct change.  f
good,"I had gotten very close with coworkers, they made the job fun."
good,Chipotle is a job where everyone who works there cares about thier job. Fast pace and fun. I learned how to manage my time efficiently. As  general manager I was in charge of the development of the crew members and other managers. I coached the team on the right way to approach customers to provide an excellent guest experience.
good,Difficult job with many tasks to complete daily. Takes time to get used to but eventually starts to get easier. With so much going on it can be hard to focus and there is a risk of injury if not careful.  Overall it takes time to master but is a very good work experience.
good,Working at a fast paced place such a this it makes the time go by very quickly and gives you an overall feeling of accomplishment at the end of each day
good,"Chipotle is fun and fast paced work place. There are four main positions for crew members which are Line, Prep, Cash, and Grill. Those are the leadership positions that are competitive to get into and require you to work a minimum of 7 hours."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Working at here i was very flexible. They always help each other. I learned to always have patience, because it very important. The place is very popular!"
good,The people and environment is like none other but we work in border line sweatshop conditions and asap manager I believe that me and my crew is under paid
good,"Very fun place to work, fast paced with great benefits. They are very flexible as far as schooling goes and work around your schedule. Also you get free food."
good,"I liked working at Chipotle because it is very bright, energetic, positive, fast-paced, and encouraging to be a part of a passionate team devoted to providing the best customer experience possible."
good,Working at Chipotle is a very physically and mentally exhausting job. it is very rewarding at the end and you can make your way up in Chipotle if you are passionate and want too. you also get good benefits at Chipotle as well.
good,"Chipotle was a fun place to work out, our busy  times where more during lunch to 3pm. But also they expect to have your full on availability, asking for days off for personal reasons was okay but for them it would be difficult and make sure you do it ahead of time and keep reminding your manager"
good,"Nice place to work, culture, limited over time. Pay is okay, Very fast paced. Involves a lot of customer service, requires patience. Great learning experience."
good,"It was definitely a quick paced job. Everyone at work was friendly, if you needed help, your co workers would come help you, depending on what it was you needed help on."
good,"A typical day at work would begin with stress of other coworkers either showing up late or not showing up at all to work. This then would alter a set plan created by the manger of the shift and would essentially put the entire team behind for the day. I learned that team work, participation and communication is very important when there is any kind of team goal or team work activity. Management was usually horrible. It seemed as though managers where incapable of constant success. For example, the team for the morning shift would do great but the idea of understanding and repeating the steps needed for success of the next day seemed disconnected. The hardest part of the job I believe, would be working along coworkers when there are no type of communication in place. Everything seems to be unorganized and the tasks of employees were interpreted instead of stated clearly.  The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to get things accomplished as a team. When everyone is on the same page and being treated fairly we tend to have a great time at work laughing and enjoying each others company."
good,"The place is really hit-or-miss, as it is fast-food in a team-centric environment. Depending on who happens to be working at the time, the lunch and dinner rushes can move in an efficient system with little interruption, or they can back up giving certain line-workers little to do but twiddle their thumbs, as they cannot leave their positions during these times."
good,its a fast working pace restaurant . a lot of people come in to eat and carry out I liked working there. the staff was really helpful and helped me a lot when I first started.
good,All work for me is easy no matter what the job is I get things done. Here I was able to take charge and run a good front line and help my peers turn customers into our guest with an great customer service.
good,Very friendly staff and also very competitive yet relaxed at the same time. Its a great place to meet all kinds of new people from all over the world.
good,I would come in to my shift clock in and manage a team of 10+ members in a shift. Perform excellent work day in and day out lead my team though empowerment.
good,"Kitchen staff."
good,"It was a good job because it gave me a lot of hours, I liked the people there, however sometimes the manager would try to give me extra hours knowing I could not do overtime at the age I was working there. P"
good,"It was my first job and I learned so much about customer service from dealing with customers to serving food efficiently. Also, I became more responsible and quick."
good,"I learned how to do every position at chipotle so I was able to move around and wasn't stuck doing same thing everyday. the management was good it was clean and organized all the time. the most enjoyable part of the job was the people, there at chipotle they hire really great people."
good,"Chipotle is always busy, especially at certain locations. I learned a lot about cash handling and how to deal with fraud and depositing money in safes and filling out cash sheets."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,I like some of the benefits that come with this job. I have free food along with earning some college credits. You're not sitting around very much. You're usually doing something.
good,A typical day at chipotle can go good but can also go stressful. If everyone works like a team and have a positive attitude the day and vibe will be great. If it the opposite then the day becomes long a stressful. The best part for me was peak hour when things would go fast and time would go by fast. I like moving and not standing still.
good,Great place to grow. The people and managers are very helpful. They care about each other sucess over there own. I have learned alot and grown because of this job.
good,I appreciate all they taught me but it isnt a job i would recommend to others only because i woildnt want to put others through the same things i went through
good,The pay every two weeks was ok. Was always short handed which mean more work for eve hi how did not make the crew very happy. The was ok other then that.
good,Chipotle was a great experience for me as I was directly introduced to the HR position and worked with management hands on.  The culture was laid back even in the corporate offices where I was but they were serious in providing for their employees and cutting down the turn over.
good,Are they going to do what can I Chappelle labor is a very quick pace but yet comfortable environment to working out the employees that I worked with in the past was very social but stay focus more on the job at hand them talking two other employees.
good,I liked working at chipotle. It was a good learning experience. I got paid fairly and i adapted quickly. Everyone was respectful and helpful. I enjoyed my time there.
good,"It was a very fun job, just very stressful opening a new restaurant when no one knows how to run it correctly. The managers were stressed a lot, or crying but i'm glad they finally got things under control. I loved the hands on experience and learning how to prep food and serve people in a proper and timely manner."
good,Work crew cultivated a great sense of community as well as accountability. Management put a great sense of effort into upbringing the team into its best potential to output the best service for customers.
good,"the only reason I stayed at chipotle for as long as I did, was because of the team. They were all great people and folks that you could chat to, about anything.  The pay is awful for the amount of work and my manager was spineless to say the least.  Too many times he wouldn't fire workers who wouldn't show up to work, or would give him backlash in an unnecessary way.  He was too lax at times but too upset at other times. Never in between. Also my manager never trained me on anything except tortilla and line, even when I asked 5000 times so I took it upon myself to learn everything about the kitchen and before I knew it, I was working grill, prep and doing catering orders without ""proper"" training.  Chipotle managers should listen to their crew more often when they feel ready to move up.  Chipotle needs to live up to their ""promote from within"" motto."
good,"Chipotle the company is great. They really teach you to be a leader and empower you to empower others. You'll learn to cook, prep and clean everything in detail."
good,this was my first job. it was enjoyable and i learned a lot . i was trained to work in a very fast paced environment without getting overwhelmed.i loved working here
good,it was a great experience. they are very flexible with work hours and fair with every employee. I worked when I was in school and they understood and made it a point to have that a main priority.
good,"I loved the people, the environment, and the work place itself. Everyone the worked at this establishment was happy and friendly, and open to help if needed."
good,"great place to work as a starter job, not really a good job for people looking to work there long term.  day goes by pretty fast and work is pretty easy if everyone does there particular task."
good,"All In all, chipotle Mexican grill is a very neat, clean workplace. They are very good at what they especially the cooks. It takes a lot to get past the rush sometimes but at the end of the day, it's worth it."
good,"it was fast paced (how I like it) and it kept me busy, I don't like getting paid for nothing...so the job fit me. I only left because I wanted to extend my education."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"a typical day consisted of making burritos and customers smile "
good,"Busy work environment, great management, I learned that working with a team gets things done rather than working alone, best part of the day was serving customers with friendly smiles."
good,"It is a very nice place to work, the company is creating great teams so the working environment is always a happy one. "
good,I enjoyed working with a lively and friendly crew. Management was considerate and helped empower the whole team. I learned a great deal about food preparation and time management.
good,The people at Chipotle know how to inspire and build friendships. Chipotle is one of the most fun placed I've worked. The hardest part was ironing out a schedule with only two shifts a day.
good,"Working at chipotle takes time management to a new level. Everything needs to be done at a specific time and in a specific location. If you enjoy a constant fast paced environment in food, this job is for you."
good,Very fast paced work as a crew member. lines are frequently out the door which can be stressful and overwhelming at first. Friendly workplace. Free food!
good,Chipotle is clean and food is great just that some of the co workers are really rude they don't make you feel like you are part of a time and are constantly treating me badly
good,"I loved working there! It was always busy so I was always occupied. On top of that working there really helped me with my kitchen skills. Lastly, the employees were well taken care of break & lunch wise"
good,"Great place to work, good people and good hours. Great place to learn new things. Very clean and well organized. The pay is good but the work can be hard"
good,"Great place to work with great benefits (tuition reimbursement, raises,paid vacation/sick days). But if you are a very good hearted person who cares about the store you might find yourself getting called in a lot and fell like being taken advantage of. But very good company to move up in and succeed."
good,"Chipotle is a great company to dip your feet into the customer service world; they value their employees and have a general laid-back environment. Compensation is good for a part-time job, although you are expected to memorize certain phrases (and you will be tested). Overall, fun place to work (if you have good employees), and is only really stressful during lunch rushes."
good,"As a Service Manager, the days are longer but rewarding. Customer Service is a number one priority.There is a high turn over rate. Alot of minors are employed.Overall,a fun environment"
good,"A typical day would start out with lots of morning prep before opening, then after opening the lunch rush would start. The crew would typically be upbeat and ready for the rush."
good,chipotle is a fun place to work. It can get busy and is fast paced but is a great company to work for. It is a relaxed environment. It definitely treats their employees fairly.
good,Intensity of work greatly depended on number of customers. The line system creates a bottleneck where things are limited by small incidents. Prep and close were quite intensive. Water for washing hands was far too hot and burned me several times. Free meal made it all worth it.
good,"chipotle has a great company culture, they always want people to grow and try to better themselves. They only want whats best for you and your family."
good,It was a place where you had to work fast paced. Everyone worked together as a team. It was fun. People would bring their ideas together to make the day fun.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,I really enjoyed working there. I got to have such a close work environment and family. I absolutely loved it . It really is one of the best jobs you could get especially for a first job.
good,Chipotle allowed me to learn many new skills and how to functionally communicate with a team. The job overall was tedious but also allowed for many skills to be learned in terms of food preparation.
good,"Typical day at work consists of:"
good,Prepare for the rush and a lot of demanding work. The pay is good and you can pick up as hours. They also will make you try to stay if someone doesn't show up. Free lunch!
good,I was young when I started here. The salary was fine then because i didnt have a mortgage or car payment. They try to underpay their general managers.
good,The training is educational and you learn everything you need to know. It is easy to advance and move up. The pay is minimum wage and the raises that you can get are minimum.
good,"Loved working here everyone is like a family and very positive most of the time, chances of you moving up in the company is fair and upper management is always helpful."
good,"Chipotle was a coo job to have and grow with. Time goes by fast when you are working and moving up. I enjoyed working there and growing with them. I became a take out specialist and I had to change stores, and that manager was crazy; so I left."
good,"Everyone works well together, fun and very fast-paced. Management team is great and always room for growth. Learn great skills and meet a lot of great people."
good,"Prepare my inventory and do the prep List."
good,"chipotle was my first job as a result I obtained experience in customer service. I also learned how to be more open, how to empower people and how to lead the way"
good,"was a great experience in the kitchen, would recommend for somebody looking to work in the kitchen. at times very demanding but it is a very fun place to work at."
good,"Working at Chipotle opened my eyes to a world of opportunities by teaching me how to be a team player, a leader, a hardworker, and how to keep a steady work flow while under stress and fast paced environments."
good,Working at Chipotle was very fun because you get to interact with so many people everyday. The food is also healthier than the average fast food joint. The managers always push you to do better and help you work your way up in the chain.
good,The work us very rigorous but it's worth it. You love the customers and the customers name you love what you do. Everyone on the job is a unit from the time the store opens until it closes.
good,"When working, I normally just try make it the best you can so that each day is enjoyable. Keeping in mind why am I here and what purpose am i here to serve."
good,What can i say i started working for Chipotle 2 years ago. Thru the 2 years the management switched and the crew switched so pretty much i had to meet new people and honestly i was pretty scared. Then i realized that everyone got along with each other and it wasn't hard after all. There's times when work gets hard like for example when people call off and there isn't enough workers or when there's a lot of customers and your training someone as well. But you have to suck it up because its just a test. Other then that i enjoy my job and im thankful to have one.
good,"The job was great! Great benefits, free meals and the crew was outstanding. But the managers were horrible. I need people who could lead the team and create a better workplace."
good,"Your hours and days are set a week before you you have time to change your schedule if needed, you just need to find another coworker who is willing to switch shifts with you. Managers are usually quite understanding. Job helps you acquire communication and team work skills."
good,Overall this company was good to work for and provided their employees with respect. I learned to interact with people more efficiently as well as hands on training for new employees.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Working here was great. During prime time hours you'd work with approximately 100 or more customers. The co workers were kind funny and made working their a joy.
good,"I worked with this company for a while. Promotes  great ideas, giving customers extraordinary experiences. They teach employees valuable life lessons!"
good,Busy with some downtime. Always something to learn or procedures to do. A lot of room for growth within the company. Weekly audits to help identify any issues for the team to address them quickly and better the flow of the business.
good,Chipotle is a fast paced environment and can get stressful at times but is overall a great place to work.  The employees are friendly and it's not a cut throat environment to work in.
good,Chipotle was a great first job for a high schooler. As a high stress environment I was able to learn how to manage time and stress well while also giving out a good product.
good,"Overall great job, fast paced and day goes by quick. Sometimes can get annoying with hours, had to stay there late many times closing. Good workplace."
good,"Competitive and rush was a typical day at work. I learned how to take good decisions in seconds and afford company's goal. Workplace culture was enjoyable and well-oriented. Customers was specific most of the time and hardest part could be described as the ""tension"" for less hours."
good,"The location I worked at had a fun, exciting atmosphere that you wanted to be at. From the second I walked in I was getting trained and I was wanting to learn. The management was willing to let me help and learn and teach."
good,Good start off pay and management. Bi weekly pay. Nice clean work place and good hours given to employees. Management was good as far as attitude and scheduling.
good,Honestly te most funest job I've ever had made you feel like your at home got to learn different things throughout the day manager ment was always there asking how we're doing having one on ones together explaining how can things change for the better of the company
good,i cleaned dishes interacted with customers cleaned bathrooms i began to love chipotle and im sorry i had to leave but i would reccomend this place of bussiness to
good,Chipotle is a great place to work with many diffrent types of people fast paced work envorinment. Chipotle is a great place to work you way up the company. in less than a year i got my first promotion to kitchen manager. With in three months from then i was promoted to service manager and started running shifts. Being a service mananger you get to work side by side and teach people as well as manage inventory and labor. Another responsibilty is ordering and receving food and equipment orders.

good,Chipotle was an amazing work environment. I grew very close personally both to management and staff. My time there will always be remembered. I have not had a job that fun since.
good,All time favorite job because it taught me so much about the work life and all associates had the same 13 characteristics to be a chipotle employee so everyone got along pretty well and we became a family. Sometimes the line would be out the door with customers but as a team it felt like a breeze to serve every customer with the best food and customer service!
good,"What i enjoy mostly about this job is that I learned every station in a year or so. Allowing me to work different things every shift I have to work, makes things interesting through out the day. Very friendly workers and managers, family oriented environment."
good,"I absolutely loved working at chipotle, they are really a step ahead of everyone else in the industry. It is nice that they have what is known as an interview with the crew which means that management is not solely responsible for hiring a new crew member."
good,It's a great working enviroment however it is difficult to strike a balance with work and school personally and professionally. However with that being stated Chipotle is a wonderful company that has much to offer their employees. It's a brilliant entry-level position!
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer.

good,"Chipotle was maybe my official LEGIT job besides some jobs that required my commission, but that's not my cup of tea.  "
good,"Taking menu orders from customers and promptly serve them"
good,"This was my most recent job, we were very understaffed and always left work late. Management would be upset with overtime even tough it was impossible not to get. There were also other members being supported with management positions that had been with the business for less than 6 months while i have been an employee for almost a year. Overall, this place of work would of been more beneficial with a different outcome that couldn't happen."

good,"Nice place to work for those who looking to have a better team work ethic. People can learn many things from Chipotle, as well as they can grow in many different way."
good,"It is pretty similar to any other food service job but with slightly better benefits. They pay more than other food service locations. There is a lot of work that goes into the job though because the company expects a lot. Management is okay. Few are actually trained the way they should be. In terms of advancement it can be difficult to stand out among all the other crew members."
good,Great place to work if you want to learn. There's a lot of room for advancement and any opportunities to learn about food and food service. Management can sometimes be a pain but overall great company to work for.
good,"Team setting, great costumer and amazing work environment. Management is amazing plus there is always room for improvement"
good,A typical day at work would be the line of customers to the door or passed the door. The hardest part of the job would have to be making sure the customer leaves satisfied and happy and portions of the food.
good,"It is fun to work here , but u get really tired , the standards of the company are really high , I would argue the compensation for these high standards - low to me . Team and people you work with are worth of all discomfort - they are caring and supporting , plus you get free food when you work , which is delicious and relatively healthy . "
good,Fast paced job. I loved the people I worked with. Managers were nice but sometimes you would not get your breaks!! ....................................................
good,Chipotle has always had wonderful people culture in its restaurants as well as in its home office. They push you to achieve your fullest potential and generally have a positive influence on your professional growth as a young professional.
good,"This company was friendly and very well organized with room for growth and a great staff. The customers were nice and the job was easy, simply and the time went by very fast and smooth"
good,"Normal days would include slow progression with minimal heightened periods. Much prep, clean, and closing. A lot of training and evaluation. Sometimes it was overkill. Much training included morning prep, customer service, food production and construction, cleaning, etc. Many workers were straightforward, whereas the managers were a little harsher and a little less hospitable due to the tedious nature of the work. The most difficult part of the job was having to remember and practice every single regulation and guideline. It did make the work flow easier, with less disruptions and complications. The most enjoyable part of the job would have been the all around enjoyment of working for the company, having to meet specific goals, as well as being able to compete with other employees for positions, raises and other incentives."
good,my time period at chipotle was short due to my education and the time scheduling. but the gave me a humbling chance to earn money for my personal needs such as education.
good,"Great place to be at, and really easy to move up in the company. However it's a fast past job. If your a hard worker then it is a easy work day. The management are great and fun to work for."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer.

good,"I have already submitted a review for this company and do not have much else to say regarding it.  "
good,"All striving for the same goal. great environment for advancement, and a great job to start getting job experience. Everyone gets promoted within so you work closely with the same faces often. Also no culinary skills needed then teach you everything you need to know to make the perfect burrito :)."
good,"The best part about this job is the awesome people and management you have to work with. The job itself contains a lot of work with much to do on a day to day basis, so unless you move quickly you can find yourself behind schedule. Chipotle cooks their food in a very professional and dignified way, so you will find yourself making much of the food in the kitchen and performing activities such as marinating meats and chopping vegetables."
good,"I feel like this is great job to learn new things and move up into management if you are interested. The people and company are very generous in training and in giving you the hours you need for your life. "
good,i enjoy working for the company and i wish to continue my employment here. co-workers are friendly and sufficient. Management is always professional. Hardest part of the job would be  the lack of overtime availability but other than that i love it!

good,A typical day at work was either very busy or semi-slow. I learned in there that it is best to work smarter not harder. The management was overall Ok. My co-workers were great we all got along. The hardest part about the job was working on the line to serve food when the line was all the way to the entrance. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and getting to do things I usually do not do.
good,Working at Chipotle you have to be fair and friendly treat all your customers with the same amount of respect. We are trained to always stay busy and productive there is little time to joke around. We must stay postive and professional at all times.

good,good company with many great benefits and incentives for their employees. Very friendly environment but also very fast paced depending on location. Overall a good job for college students and someone looking for opportunity.
good,Typical day consisted of listening to all types of music while sharing laughs with co-workers. Occasional rush to the front doors that would take us maximum 5 minutes to get through. Management could have been better. Co-workers were angels! Hardest part would be the guests. Most enjoyable would be the co-workers.
good,This job is very customer service oriented. You are constantly on your feet moving and multitasking. The best part about this job is the culture and the people you work with.

Only issues uve had working there is you have times you need to get certain things done by and if you dont it puts everyone behind. But it teaches you lots lf thing like responsabilitly and a good pace and lots of kindness. Managment is great there fun and leaniant and help ou if needed and care for yoy in and out of work
good,"very fast paced, got to know regular customers and their orders, do different jobs each day, not always ""cooking"" or "" on the register"" variety of foods; pork; chicken; vegetarian"
good,"i loved working at Chipotle, the managers were amazing people and the employees were just as great. my job was a grill cook, so i cooked all the food for the line."
good,Chipotle requires a unique management style.  General Managers are not as focused on numbers as they are on the culture of their store.  This is a great concept but can be very taxing.
good,Maintain dish area clean serving customers service. Food safety procedures and Food prep. Including correctly performing task with proper work skills. Maintain right Temperature for food and cooking.
good,"A typical day at work included a knife and a cutting board. Slicing, dicing, prepping, preparing while thinking 3 steps ahead was taught in chipotle as well as keeping a smile and relying on your crew.

good,"Fun people to work with, lots of room to advancement, young vibrant crew. competitive wages for work, fun work environment, lots of training."
good,"Working at Chipotle you've to be on work looking neat, and ready to go. You've to move with a sense of urgency with everything you do, or you wont last long. As a manager everyday was different from how much you prep to how many people should be working, or should leave early. One thing I got from working at Chipotle is I learned how to make others better by teaching, validating, and giving feedback. So I basically learned how to bring someone that isn't so good at something , and work with them to master the task. The hardest part about my job as a manager was making others better because you've to mix the easy soft side with the tough hard side. The most enjoyable part of my job was helping people reach their full potential, and bringing put from crew to manager."
good,I have given almost 3 years of my Life to Chipotle; I do believe its time to move on! I am ready to put all of my skills on the table to find a job adequate for myself ; and I a good employee for my employer!
good,because I could not balance my daughters bus schedule with my job I ended up losing my job there. They take everything very serious and to high standards and I respect that but it made it hard for people with two working parents.

good,"The definition of Chipotle is Team work, empowerment, and top performer. I can honestly say that working at chipotle everyday was a learning experience. I honestly liked going to work daily."
good,"The average day was always busy. It was rare to have a slow day. Thus there was always much to be done, whether that be cooking, interviewing, training, developing, scheduling, or conducting meetings. The management structure at Chipotle, in my experience, is second to none. However, that structure is often filled with people who are equipped but not fully capable of carrying out their duties. Chipotle has always done an excellent job of hiring the highest quality people and so almost everyone I came in contact with there was an absolute delight. And the majority of them were very hard workers. The physical and mental demand of the job was immense and cannot be understated. It is a very intense work environment and can tend to wear on people very quickly. But at the end of the day it was the people that I worked with that made it an overall enjoyable experience. Personally developing and training people to become better employees and individuals was by far the most rewarding aspect of the job and is something that I will take into every workplace I enter in the future."
good,"At Chipotle I was responsible for both closing and opening store duties whenever necessary. Chipotle is known for cross training and making their employees well rounded workers, thus I was able to learn cash responsibilities, food prep, regular cleaning tasks(including dishwashing), customer service. The take-out specialist position which enabled me to work more closely with customer satisfaction, as well as taking responsibility for online and catering sales."
good,I enjoyed working with my co-workers.I also enjoy cooking very much.I 've cooked for as much but not limited to 500 guests.
good,"I loved working at Chipotle Mexican Grill. The culture is uplifting and encourages everyone to do their best work. Co-workers pushed each other to do better and stay positive. The management knows exactly what it takes to run the restaurant. The hardest part of the job was simply the pace of business, fast but manageable. The most enjoyable part of the job was, for me, the crew and working with people who shared the same passion for excellent work as I do."
good,"This was a great place to get to know others and learn how to deal with different personalities and situations. Also, learning to perfect one thing and quickly moving on to the next."
good,"Good work environment, worked as part of a team. Hardest part of the job was rush hour when lots of costumers come in and place large orders."
good,"Hustles Fast pace, learned time management coworker was dependable. There wasn't any thing hard about the job. I love to cook so I enjoyed my time with this company"
good,"A typical day at Chipotle,well it depends what time you come in,I usually work mornings."
good,"Chipotle's diversity is the company's best quality. Doesn't matter what type of person you are, there is a place for you in chipotle. "
good,I loved working for chipotle was constantly busy the only downside was hard for advancement and was not making enough to support my family. my co workers and management team were awesome hardest part of my job Is just how hot it gets in the restaurant. I learned a lot working at chipotle culinary skills how to cut and dice. how to marinate and prepare excellent delicious food.
good,"A ""typical"" day at work would have to be, high-paced, high volume, overall, very busy. Expect the unexpected, that's for sure. Don't let a book fool you with it's cover, there is no actual typical day. You're faced with things like the typical, not so typical, costumer complaints and concerns. You're faced with challenges that may seem easier than they actually turn out to be. There is a lot to learn, a lot to know, it's very similar to attending school. You have to get familiar with the culture, the expectations and the longer than long, 8 hour shifts. It's definitely a tough job sometimes but it's comes with it's perks, you're surrounded with people who become more than just coworkers, we form friendships that eventually grow into something deeper, your second family. I use to think that it was just our specific location and the people that I worked with that made it pleasant to work there but apparently, I was wrong. After attending a nationwide Chipotle meeting during the E-coli crisis we faced, I realized we weren't the only ones who formed bonds far greater than you can possibly imagine and if you're wondering, yes, even with management. Despite their obvious superiority, they don't treat us poorly. They actually care about us. Not everyone can say the same, right? Aside from the environment itself, the opportunities are great. It's way easier to move up in management than it is in most places. The pay, eh, it's average, it's a bit higher than minimum when you start off but if you work as expected, you can expect a raise. "
good,"A typical day at Chipotle consists of being fast, motivated, desired, and ELEVATING others is super important! Chipotle is very strict about how everyone should be learning from one another."
good,Throughout the year I worked with Chipotle I learned a lot of great communication skills.  A typical day at work consisted of preparing food for the day.  Along with that I kept a high sense of energy and great attitude.  I was able to make some great connections with some of the co-workers which I can say now they are more like family.  I feel the hardest part of the job was being more vocal about certain things.  Which I do feel upon leaving I have become more confident with that. The most enjoyable part of my job was mainly the great vibes.
good,Chipotle is a very fun environment to work in- depending on which one you work at. Some stores are a pain while others are great. Same logic goes for coworkers and management. The work is simple and easy.
good,I enjoyed everything about my last job. Outstanding and comfortable environment to work in. I enjoyed working with all my co workers and managers. I also Gain great experience working in that field.
good,Working for Chipotle is challenging and fulfilling.  We always have something new to learn and also we always try to teach the ones around us to help others advance.
good,"My role was to make the salsas, grind cheese, chips. I also cleaned the dining area and washed the dishes. I was also assigned on the line where I served the food to customers."
good,As it being one of my first jobs as a teenager i really got a feel for being a part of team that was supportive. i really enjoyed the experience with a diverse group of co workers.
good,The food is delicious. I think with a little more work in the management area this can be the best fast food restaurant in the us
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotle Mexican grill has changed the way we eat, and live. Though sometimes management was strict and hard on there employees, it was only for the better of the company.

good,"It never feels like your working. Is such a fast pace enviroment and there is always something to do. You never get bored, and your co-workers become your friends. The management is great and everything is well organized"
good,"Working here presents multiple opportunity for growth, the pay is more about the same as an average restaurant, but there is quite a few raises"
good,This was my first job and it was very fun. Very comfortable and free environment. Manager was very nice but also very strict. great for a part time job if in school.
good,"Fun thing I would say about this job is that I will always laugh everyday with my co-workers, we were like a big family always helping each other in every possible way. I say the hardest part of the job would be doing prep which I would do all day. You would have to do everything real fast like you have to be the Flash to have this job and excellent on multi-tasking. I learned that being team is part of being a success in everyday of working Chipotle well mostly any job that requires team work."
good,A great opportunity for high school students looking for a part time job. The management was not the best but there was a definite room for advancement.
good,El ambiente de trabajo es agradable se tiene confianza para preguntar cualquier duda y se motiva para ascender en la empresa. Existe apoyo laboral de rápido crecimiento.

good,"Chipotle is a great place to work, however I don't see myself working there for many many years. "
good,Overall enjoyable place to work with a lot of hands on training as you  go and continual support to make you better. Management runs the place just fine and minimal issues occur.
good,It all depends on the managers. I had great and bad times there. The work is hard and you have excellent opportunities to grow in the company. Sometimes it loses its balance between your personal life and your job.
good,It was a good place to work for a while. It gave me a lot of good kitchen expierence which is what I am now best at. I would definetly tell someone to go work for them. depending on the store you go to it can be a great time.
good,fun work place. learning new skills everyday. friendly cow-workers. not a strong management though. lots of customer which makes our customer service to grow and develop everyday.
good,Chipotle was a great place to work. I had an amazing opportunity to advance in the company. I left because of college. The hardest part of my job was balancing it with my academic career.
good,Its a great place to work and the people there take pride in there product. I learned no matter what the day may bring never give up and never go out with out putting up a fight its up to you how your day will start and end. My crew was awesome managed about 7-10 workers on a day to day base i ran a tight shift from the kitchen to the front door. There was really no hard part if you set yourself and your crew up to be successful your day would run great so that's what i need i learned how to set myself and my crew up so that we would not fail even if that means me as a manger coming early and leaving late thats what i have to do i don't believe in failing
good,"My typical day at work consist of being a cashier or being on line. When you're a cashier you have to make sure the lobby is clean at all times. I learned how to become a fast pace worker and a fast learner. The management system can be inefficient but very motivated people. My co-workers make it a fun environment to work in. They work very hard to achieve goals. The hardest part of the job is making sure that everything is organized and make sure everything is in place at all times. This can be hard because of busy we get. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing the customers enjoy their experience at the restaurant. Also, the co-workers made the job fun."

good,Fast pace atmosphere where customers is our first priority. We pride ourselves on providing the best food and the best customer service
good,I love working for Chipotle it has its perks. I like e=interacting with the customers and rolling monster burritos. I wish the management was a little better but overall Chipotle is awesome.
good,"Shift is usually about 5-8 hours but could go for as long as 10-12. Work is based on assignment tasks versus time frame. Need to be a hard worker and very flexible to work here. Need a professional attitude and can learn to take constructive criticism. The place is hectic and the amount of guests is insane, but it's upbeat and fun if you learn to go with it. Overall a good working experience with understanding management. There's some drama but you're good as long as you keep out of it. Decent pay. Great job advancement opportunity."

good,"worked well with all employees, they were understanding about all my school related scheduling and management was very understanding"
good,"A typical day would be to prep food and supplies, serve at customer's request. At the end of every shift I would take inventory of what supplies are left. I would perform sanitation solutions for better health service. I learned that it is you how makes the food taste good to the customer. My manager encouraged me to put my best foot forward and my co-worker helped me throughout the way. The hardest part of my job was tolerating standing in front of a hot stove for 12 hours but my co-worker and i made it fun so the time went by fast."

I've learned that being patient and have a great attitude takes you greater places in life. Hard work and effort makes you a bigger person and change of attitude. Being confident in yourself is the key for success. The hardest part of my job was the timing. I had to do certain food preparations in a short amount of time; But through practice and effort, got the hang of it. What I loved about my job was that communication to others. Everyone was being friendly to one another and a smile makes someone's day."
good,"I enjoy working with some great people who are very open to helping me out if needed.

good,I learn alot dealing wit a fast pace work area. Co Worker were nice and help me out alot.
good,"conduct high standards everyday"
good,"My days generally consist of running shifts efficiently for a uniquely extraordinary customer experience. People development and consistent training through one-on-ones helped me get to know my team and grow close with each individual creating a great work environment. Working with my team to trouble shoot issues and handle customer concerns is apart of the everyday challenge. Learning management skills through one-on-one training with my supervisors has been an amazing experience seeing the organic growth through the company first hand. The inconsistencies with my hours and scheduled are unaccommodating to my home life, I would have to say that is the only negative with my time with the company.

Working there I learned that work can also be fun . The management was great . They made you feel like they were your equal . The co-workers were also nice and always had a positive energy.  The hardest part of the job was during peek hour and there was a lunch rush and we were missing workers . The most enjoyable part was just seeing customers leave with a smile on their face and me knowing I had something to do with that."
good,Great pace to work at and eat at! positive attitudes make the atmosphere great
good,Greeting lots of customers and giving them that home feeling that your welcome to come and eat. a typical work day is very busy/slow depending on the hours of the day which include lunch which is the heaviest. i learned everything from cleaning tables to greeting customers to working with serving food on the line taking orders to moving up to preparing and cooking the food. Management is great they do everything they can to train an help you move up. Co-Workers are great very helpful. the hardest part of the job well for me was closing really couldn't get the handle of being done on time.

I would make salsa from 8-10:30 for the entire day, and then help all of my coworkers finish up their tasks and wash any remaining dishes. From management, I have learned that my ultimate goal each day is to strive to work faster than the previous day. From my coworkers, I have learned that when everyone does their absolute best and works as quick and efficient as they can, we all benefit because we get a longer break. The hardest part of the job is working with difficult customers and pleasing them in any way possible, even if that involves giving them a refund. The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing each customer smile when we make sure that their needs are taken care of and that they are truly satisfied."

good,"Chipotle is an amazing job, I enjoy working here and learning to be a better person each and every day. It gets very stressful at times but most of the time we get along and it's very smooth. The management is pretty good, except when at times that they post the next weeks schedule the day before(on sundays) and they cut hours when they hire too many new people."
good,"i really enjoy working at chipotle because it thought me many different receipt with food, the crew members were very  friendly. overall it was a good work experience i learned alot"
good,At Chipotle we always stayed busy and we had very loyal customers that came back for delicious meals. I learned a lot about their culture. I loved that my managers trained all of us to have a strong mind set of hard workers and to help each other out. I loved the rush hours they were fun and intense!
good,"great job, fun co workers nice managers, had fun every day at work hardest thing was the paper work I did daily to become manager"
good,always on your toes sweating and tired while the customers keep coming in
good,"Everyday was very similar we did everything we could to give the customers the burrito of their choice to the best of our ability."
good,"work is fun, I learned how to cook different foods, and my management team is perfect and fun to be around.. my co-workers are awesome too, they are motivated and they motivate myself as well. The hardest part is getting all food on the line while its busy and your doing it by yourself. What I enjoy most is cooking the food and seeing my customers happy and enjoying their meals."
good,I had a good experience at Chipotle. I had great managers and an excellent team during my time there.
good,this job takes a lot of work and understanding of customers needs. got along with co workers.
good,"The environment was amazing for a work place! I absolutely would recommend working here. The people you work with become a team with one another, best job I've ever had!"
good,my skills advanced to the next level in this field.preparation for food. mantaining production and cash
good,"Everyone knows exactly what to do, management is great, and good benefits."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Learn new things everyday"
good,A typical day at work is coming in at 7 or 8 a.m. and prepping the food from the time I start until we open at 11 a.m.  In the morning we prep everything from the lettuce to the guacamole.  We all converse among one another and enjoy each others company.  I have learned so much as far as prep goes. I had never worked in the kitchen prior to working at Chipotle.  Management is good.  The hardest part of my job is being as speedy and quick as the rest but of course that takes time.  The most enjoyable part of my job is that I'm always busy and doing something.
good,People are rewarded for their hard work from recognition and promotions
good,It is cool working there good exp. I love giving good customer service to the customers and you are able to move up fast
good,A typical day at work consist of cooking fresh food to order while maintaing a clean work area. You will aquire knife skills and customer service skills at chipotle. My co-workers are infectiously enthusiastic and motivated individuals. The most enjoyable part of the job is putting a smile on the customer's face before they leave the store.
good,Chipotle Is an excellent restaurant. Its the best Mexican grill to ever happen in the 21st century. Working their requires you to do a lot. Because its actual cooked food that's has to be prepared quickly it often gets overwhelming. Chipotle lacks diversity which can cause a lot of miss communication.
good,If you ever come to Columbus Ohio you should check this place out.
good,"A typical day at work for me would be to come in anywhere from 7 am to 9 am, I complete tasks all over the spectrum of Chipotle. I work the grill I open prep, I open the salsa station and also work the register and the food line. Most of the time I am making the food and more specifically the guacamole which consists of 84 avocados per case and I usually make 5 cases. This job pushes you to better yourself and the people around you. Management makes sure you are the best performer you can be and our coworkers do the same. The hardest part of my job is closing the restaurant only because I like to be in bed at a decent time for my opening shifts but other then that I have caught on to everything pretty fast, I am a extremely fast learner. The most enjoyable part of my job I would say is are my coworkers, the managers hire employees based on 13 characteristics that the company requires, so throughout the whole day I am surrounded by hardworking, enthusiastic energetic people, I love it!"
good,Chipotle was a nice place to work. The management and staff were  friendly. It was a fast paced environment which made time go by quickly. The hardest part of the job was when it was the dinner and lunch rush with people lined up out the door in season and not being able to get to all of them fast enough. The customers where always nice and understanding. The best part of the job was learning what goes on in a restaurant. Overall it was a great place to work.
good,"My typical day at work included preparing and cooking food to order, maintaining a clean work area, and training new team members."
good,A typical day was being quick and precise and understanding the customer come's first.
good,"working early shift as i did will definitely give you the hours you need for a handsome paycheck, but be warned that is because although your day may start at 7 am but end at around 7 in the pm. The hardest part of the job was keeping a real personal life with my relationships, going to work way early and coming home way late after some pretty physical work for 9 sometimes 11 hour days. at some point if you do not maintain a steady sleep schedule you will be crashing whenever wherever. coworkers were the bom-diggity, and the environment they created was also dank-diggity."
good,- Fast paced yet fun
good,"I liked working at chipotle mainly because of the standards we, as a family, were expected to hold. We treated the store like it was our home."
good,"First come in an hour before the store opens and I prep the food. I learned how to make vinagarette dressing from scratch which was interesting, make guacamole from scratch as well. Hardest part of job is prepping the food and making it. Most enjoyable part of the job is learning something new from coworkers every day."
good,It was my first job and it was a great first start. Met a lot of great people along the way too.
good,"A typical Work day would last about seven to eight hours and you would get there at eight in the morning or four in the PM. In the morning is when most of the prep. work is done frying chips, mixing salsa, or Cutting some Romain or Avocados. Then have in a really nice ""Chip talk"" family meal with the people you work with and talk about the day to come. Then in the night shift we would do a quick talk before work and then have staggered breaks threw out the night."
good,"over all it was a very nice place to work! i've had lots of fun learning, communicating with coworkers, they treated their employees with huge respect. i would love to work their again."
good,- Co-workers were a joy to work with
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Be there 15 minutes early. Had to prep fresh food everyday, Including chips, and taco shells."
good,A day at chipotle is fun and fast paced. Didnt really learn anything new that i didnt already know from past restrants. Management is layed back and likes to have fun.
good,Chipotle Mexican Grill is an appreciative job and is in a great environment for all. Everybody there has an understanding of eachother. It is where great employees grasp onto another chapter in their lives in which success is embraced in many different duties which stands as a challenge! It is one of the best yet. Good costumers and managers there make it just that more intriguing.
good,overall chipotle wasa great place to work it had its ups and down just like every job does the new management has made chipotle a great place and i would recommend people to work there if they arent going to school because it ask for so much
good,"aprendí los distintos tipos de cortes y cocciones de la carne en la parrilla, la gerencia es muy buena, mis colegas son muy colaboradores"
good,"training and development, cash audits and deposits, inventory counts, store orders,"
good,"I learned how to become a faster worker. Also i learned how to complete more than one task at a time. This job was a multi-task job and I learn how to magene it. Closing and manager not understannding me. The most fun part of the job was the preparation of the food.My cow-workers were really fun to work with , everyone get alot. Some of the managers were real cool but other are real mean and disrespectful towards the workers. Overall, I had a nice experience working at Chipotle."
good,Open up the tort (tortilla) station. Cut limes. Turn on fryer. Fry chips and taco shells. Bag up chips and stock shelves and cart. Work front line until time to prepare for afternoon Tort crew member. Make more chips and taco shells as needed.
good,"It was great working here. I learned many things her at this company. Management was excellent, and the co-workers."
good,"Fun to work at, takes their jobs very seriously but also makes it very fun."
good,"i currently prepping cutting lettuce ,onion, and bell pepper preparing dish such as guacamole and fajitas"
good,"I love working here. The customers are great and co-workers and managers are always there to help you out if you're struggling. We cook all of our food fresh every day and this company is so picky about being sanitary. Chipotle is one of the cleanest restaurants I have been to. At my specific location, I don't get many hours which is why I'm looking for another job. Also if you don't speak a decent amount of Spanish it can be hard to communicate with some people."
good,A wonderful place to work in my experience. Management is encouraging and helpful. Co-Workers are great people. Chipotle has sustainable practices such as limiting food waste by recycling. Would highly recommend this workplace to anyone.
good,The good in this job are the employees. When you have everyone on the same page and they are polite it helps your day flow better. The bad about the job is I done person is not on the same ohde it messes up the flow.
good,In general the working environment isn't terrible. My experience wasn’t great when they fired the manager who hired me since there everything started going down but in general most of the managers where great there where just a couple who made it working there horrible.
good,"Chipotle, when it works ideally is an all around job. Great benefits and plenty of opportunity. However the freedom given to management can be overbearing when you're dealing with people who have selfish tendencies or cannot seem to accomplish what's best for the crew and store."
good,"Very easy job to do, I loved it at first but the environment got worse and worse every week. Some of the people were very rude and made me wanna quit, as my first job I was really disappointed and hope my future jobs have an amazing work environment."
good,"As a college student, I really like the fact that Chipotle was flexible with my hours. I am constantly going back and forth between school and home and I am able to transfer between chipotles, which is really helpful for me."
good,I really like chipotle but i work second shift and am usually up late im looking for a 3rd shift factory type of work tht can pay me more than chipotle
good,"I love working at Chipotle, the people I work with make it very fun. It is a good place for advancement. Closing shifts tend to be late nights though."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Fast service, an ok management team over all. Pay is good, job is easy, communication is good with co-workers and management team. It’s a comfortable working environment"
good,"For entry-level hires at any Chipotle Mexican Grill environment, there is always something to do or something to learn! You will never get bored about what is being taught inside the restaurants, corporate offices etc."
good,"The actual work I did was mostly enjoyable and a very friendly environment, managers treated us fairly and there was a strong sense of appreciation and belonging inside the store. I just wished the corporate entity behind the company did a little more for the stores and was more appreciative."
good,Walk in ten minute before the start of my shift. When the shift starts check on the state of the kitchen and if any thing needs to be done right away. At the end of the shift there is the cleaning for the next shift. The management was fine some better then others. The hardest part of the job was that some times the person would let there work fall behind. The most enjoyable part was that you always had something to do.
good,"Fast paced, diverse work environment. Front of house and back of house options. In house promoting but can be extremely delayed even when promised. Excellent benefits."
good,"I had a part time job. I had no major issues while working there. Expectations of employees was high, and standards for quality were high. You had to work fairly hard, but the work often felt rewarding enough. Was a pretty good job to have initially."
good,Working at Chipotle was a rewarding experience.  The shifts tend to be fast paced and highly energetic.  The hours are good and seemed to pass very quickly.
good,"They teach excellent work ethic, food safety, and functional team work. Growth potential is promised and tested for greatness. Have a sense of urgency be ready to move."
good,I really enjoyed my coworkers and my boss. Everyone got along so well and respected eachother. they worked as much as they could with my schedule. Love the food too.
good,"Even though Chipotle can monopolize your time, the pay and opportunities make it all worth while. I always had fun at work and made great friends who have become like family."
good,Overall it was a good place to work however they did not live up to the standards they set. My pay raise was suppose to be increased many of times for being an employee with them for so long but instead of doing so it stayed at the same rate.
good,"The job was fast . paced and was rushing, but overall it was good. The place I worked at was primarily busy, But I managed to keep track of everything. The job was a good starter for all other jobs"
good,"Chipotle is a pretty fast-paced, high-energy job that can be exhausting if you're not used to being quick. It's a lot more labor-intensive than you'd believe. Other employees are usually really cool but often times management can be disorganized. Overall, was a great place to work at if not tough on your feet."
good,A typical shift consisted of setting yourself and your team up for success. The company's workplace culture system really empowers every employee to master their position and to move on to other positions.
good,"Great place, hard work, depends what manager; they are still kind. Food service is easy, simple menu but the cook position takes much dedication and strength."
good,"A typical work day would start relaxed but then all of a sudden, it would get extremely busy. I learned to take my tasks step by step to not get confused which helped me create a efficiant flow while I work. Everyone was helpful, respectful and responsible. The challenging part when I first started was the speed but I overcame that with more experience and got very good at it . The best part about my job was being able to socialize with people, which I enjoy the most."
good,"It’s an ok job, the pay is decent but it’s also stressful, if you apply just think about the location and what you’re getting into. It stays busy and the customers can be rude. You’re not going to get along with everyone, just do your job and you’ll be fine."
good,"The recurring problem at every chipotle is probably the lack of leadership, I loved working there because of my coworkers but we were all treated poorly by our managers, it was hard to get in contact with them and sometimes they didn't even show up to their shifts."
good,"Chipotle was my second job. They basically hired me on the spot, and from there was where i started my journey with the company. Starting as a crew member and eventually climbing to management and transferring from Ohio to California."
good,"I enjoyed my time with this company it has introduced to different business aspects, new people, new culture, and was a overall solid job to keep the bils payed."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I do my best to always be on time, to always give my 100%, work as a team player, communicate with my co-workers and managers and enjoy what I’m doing ."
good,Chipotle was a good starting job . I originally had a great boss but when she got replaced it started to be a bad work experience . Not a job I can see myself with in the future . It’s mentally frustrating.
good,"Chipotle Mexican Grill has been one of my favorite jobs thus far. They are very good on offering great benefits such as school reimbursements , raises, great health insurance and many more. Through this company i have learned how to work fast pace, apply the proper customer service skills, and also learn the different temperatures that certain meats must be held at to prevent any food borne illnesses which i thought was very important and also interesting. This company i will defiantly recommend to a college student such as myself who are looking for a part time job and also great benefits"
good,"Chipotle is fast paced and hard work but it is all simple enough. They have the timing for prep and service down to a science, so, once you get into the routine it is second nature. The starting pay is decent and there are benefits available. Tons of upward mobility if you have the skill and focus for it."
good,"A typical day at work was great filled with wonderful customers and coworkers. The management at my location was struggling at the time, but everyone was able work around it and make it efficient."
good,"A typical day at work would start slow or fast, never an inbetween. I learned to get faster, with help from my managers in a high energy location. The managers were absolutely fantastic, always helping and took care of problems on the spot, which honestly was my favorite part. They listened to every side of the story for whatever problem is at hand and were willing to talk it through rather than immediately fire you."
good,Everyone that I worked with at Chipotle took their jobs seriously and there were very few weak links. It is rare to see a fast food chain maintain high moral with their employees but Chipotle always seem to do so.
good,Chipotle was a great experience. You are trained in your first day and encouraged to do as much as you can. The longer you work the more you learn and the more jobs you can do. Everyone can do every job and there is still a lot to do when it is not busy. Plus you get a free meal.
good,"I learned  very much at chipotle ,, everyday there’s something new to learn , it’s a lot of Multitasking but a fun but as a kitchen manager you really have to stay on top of the food safety and quality"
good,Everyone is very friendly and the hours are very flexible. Perfect job for college students looking for extra money. Great hours and an overall easy job to follow.
good,Chipotle sets incredibly high standards all while having fun. The culture drives the company no matter where you work. Consistency is key at chipotle and it really shows.
good,This is a very fast paced job and it would not have been enjoyable if the workers were not as friendly as they are. I loved my experience there. The management was great and everyone works as a team.
good,"Overall, Chipotle is a nice place to work. The entry level positions are more fitting to a teenager just trying to make a little extra money, but there are chances for advancement to managerial positions. The atmosphere is great, the employees are positive and hard working. When requesting leave or time off, you are sincerely listened to and understood. They offer a 401k, but no type of insurance. Chipotle provides GMO free food, and employees receive a free meal each shift."
good,Great work environment and boss who not only cared about your development in the store but also about your development outside the store. Im currently in school as well as other employees and he cares a lot about our education and ensures we are always doing good at work and outside of work. He became more of a mentor then just your average boss.
good,"Working for Chipotle Mexican Grill was an amazing experience. It gave me the opportunity to learn, and grow. It was just a based on favoritism, and who was liked more in the restaurant by the bigger bosses in the branch."
good,"If you like to keep busy, this is certainly a good place to work, at least at busy locations such as the one in Erie, PA. Very fast paced and can be stressful at times, but the co-workers were great for the most part and for the area the pay was competitive."
good,"I worked at Chipotle for only a short time, however it made a great impact on what a job is supposed to feel like. I was able to go to my manager for anything! He was very flexible with my schedule and accommodated my needs. I feel like for the hard work and labor you put in and with the company being so big they could offer their employees a more compensation."
good,I learned a lot when it came to food safety. My GM was great at training me and helped me develop my skills when it came to training other crew members. When we were fully staffed it was really easy to request time off. The crew i worked with felt like family.
good,"I learned how to cook and different tasks within the team who was working What i enjoyed the most when working was how friendly and selfless the people on my team were, and they were willing to help me with no hesitation."
good,The job was great!  very flexible schedule and also very great environment I wish I could’ve stayed a little bit longer.  I happen to get a terrible general manager in my area.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Management could have handled certain situations better but overall they created a great work experience and environment overall. I enjoyed my time here
good,"It starts off slow, relaxed, lot's of conversation and good energy with the coworkers. At my location we get slammed during peak and then the conversation stops and it's all business. The management is great, they know what they are doing and do it well. The culture can get a little toxic sometimes but for the most part it's a positive environment and everyone minds their own business. The hardest part of this job is the stress that comes with peak, the most enioyable part is the people, and the food."
good,over all a fun company to work for gain lots of experiences and knowledge of the field as well as expanded my network. still enjoy the job i love the opportunity's the company offer
good,"This jobs is a great starter into your life, they hire young polite educated people.  They are happy to answer any questions for entry level teenagers and Etc."
good,"Nice environment to work in. Multitasking and working fast paced will help you. I learn how to clean and build more customer service skills, Nice management going on. The hardest part would be a fast-paced environment but it is not that bad once one gets used to it. My favorite part is interacting with customers and my co-workers while making delicious food."
good,"Nice place to work but if there is not an already strong management team in place, it can be hard. Manager position are challenging but doable. Good job overall."
good,"My job at chipotle was my first job, and it was the best first job I could have had. It gave me good experience in customer service and dealing with people and situations at the restaurant."
good,You have to do a lot of cleaning due to this work being a restaurant. The pay for working here is not reasonable due to all the duties that have to be done.
good,"I mainly enjoyed my time at chipotle, my only concern was how the old GMs and RMs had handled certain situations towards the workers. Some conflicts were either left unresolved or were not handled in the best of ways. They have gotten new management since then so I'm hoping that things have only gotten better from there."
good,"No down time however,  you will aways find new things to learn! You have a variety of people working with you, with different backgrounds and age. Chipotle is a place where team work is crucial. Work hard, then have fun!"
good,"the culture at chipotle is great, you have a lot of people that cares and always willing to help. You hire, train and develop your own managers, a lot of opportunities."
good,Der Team ist sehr freundlich immer und der arbeit ist gut organiziert trotzdem es ist leider ein sehr anstrengendes Job und wenn du willst bildungen gleichzeitig nehmen in der vollzeit (Z.B. ich ein deutsch kurs einmal pro woche etc...) dass ist nicht möglich und deswegen war ich nicht lange da.
good,"long"
good,I had a lot of fun working at this job place. Management could be better at times. Communication wasn't the best at all for me at times there. But I really did like the growth factor
good,"Despite often being a stressful and hectic job, I very much enjoyed most of my time at chipotle. The crew was super awesome and I got along well with nearly everyone, including my managers. Sadly a lot of managerial changes were made and new managers they brought in were incompetent, rude, naive and straight up unlikable. I'm glad I quit when I did."
good,"The only thing that kinda keeps you down is management. Some people are good to work with, some are not. You just have to focus on your job and follow directions in order to success."
good,Good place to eat I enjoy working there and I lear a lot in this company I start like everyone from the bottom and chipotle was my first job in the country
good,"The Onedia St. Chipotle in Green Bay, Wisconsin was by far my favorite job I ever had. The work culture and coworkers are amazing. The work is challenging but any manager is open to answer questions and is very patient as long as you are doing your best work."
good,I personally liked working at chipotle. It was very fast paced and you always had to be on your feet. I did enjoy the benefits such as discounted food.
good,I enjoyed working at Chipotle Mexican Grill. My superiors were professional and hard-working and I felt that they were always fair. I would recommend this job to a friend.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,I enjoy food so it should be how to properly make my cuts..it showed me how to work in a fast pace environment and work well around others..and a hectic environment
good,Very good job it just was to far of a distance I received good money and the hrs were great i would work there again if I could find a closer location .
good,Chipotle promotes from within mainly so people looking to move up in the company can do so very easily. Great benefits and good pay for hourly workers.
good,"outside of the pay it was an amazing place to work, you have the oppritunity to work with a large group of people, the shifts are fast paced and fun it makes time go by very fast"
good,Chipotle requires the very best workers and being really fast and kinda impossibly fast is a must. Theres some strict almost cult like work culture but if you really enjoy taking pride in something its good. Its just intense is all so be ready to work hard. They do compensate well and advancement from within is definitely their culture.
good,Thankful for the opportunity to work at CMG. Career advancement and autonomy without micromanagement were some of the highlights. Great work life balance.
good,"It was good overall, they constantly challenge you to do better and offer a lot of advancement opportunities if you show effort and interest in advancing."
good,Loved working especially with good management. Quick to move up to new positions. Avid about leaning all positions with as much training as needed. Lovely environment.
good,"Great place to work if you are young and eager to learn.  Have to love the Chipotle ""culture"" to really enjoy working there.  The hardest part of the job was keeping full time workers there."
good,Chipotle was a great place to work and still is. The only cons about it are that sometimes to much is expected but all in all a great place to build a great work ethic
good,"The job isn't easy, especially when it's busy. You have to work fast and accurately. But the coworkers were great and you have a good time while you're serving customers."
good,This was one of my first jobs and the most faced paced environment I’ve been in. You have lots of things going on at once and not everything is going to go your way. There’s lots of things in factor when working here.
good,"A typical day is wrought with stress and confusion. This job has taught me a great deal of life and customer service skills. I was considered for a management position and my advancement has been put off for almost 3 weeks now. I'm currently completing tasks for that of a higher paid position with out receiving compensation. I do enjoy knowing exactly what to do and being able to complete my job to the fullest with some additional completion of other tasks. But with the lack of promotion and said problems voiced to the management, I'm fed up with the wavering promises and regrettable may leave soon."
good,"Over all amazing place to work. Just back house is over looked in pay. we're highlighted as Aces but not seen as aces in pay. We do alot teach, help new cure members and most show are energy. We should atleast inquire a dollar more in pay. We make the store run, they should atleast show use they care a little more. Over I do give it a 10"
good,cool environment. i liked working there because i worked with my friends. i enjoyed my time there for the most part. i got a lot of hours; i worked as a cashier
good,"Its a great job if you like to get long hours and work hard and meet incredible people through the process. Managers are bred from within. Had to leave for personal reasons, but wish i hadn't."
good,"Most days are extremely busy, but the weekends are a hit or miss. The manager is a little difficult to work for because they micromanage everything and doesn't communicate very well. The employees are great to work with. Lunch is free when working and 50% off when not working."
good,"Overall, amazing, fun, hard working and rewarding place to work.  I had the opportunity to work at several other Chipotle's around the area.  If you are there for the people or looking for career advancement it really all depends on the GM you have.  They will make or break the experience for you.  Good place for people who go to school."
good,Chipotle was a friendly environment to work in. It required an up-beat attitude and to always have a smiling face. You had to work fast but also efficiently. The job taught me a lot about customer service and that the customer is always right. The managers didn't always hire the best workers which made it harder on myself and other co-workers to get all the jobs done.
good,The chipotle in Chastain Park was the best work experience that I have had since I’ve been working. It thought me how to work better in a team and how to act in a friendly environment
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,This is a great place to work. You will get free food during your shift. They pay is really good and they have a lot of benefices for their employees.
good,"The hardest part of the job were the lunch rushes when we were short staffed, but we were trained to adapt quickly to different situations. The most enjoyable part was building chemistry with fellow team members and working off of each other’s strengths and weaknesses."
good,Enjoyed my time with the company immensely.  I left the company to relocate to another city.  Decided a short time later seek seek another position with this company.  What used to be a place all about its people is now a place about the dollar.  Lost sight of what made them a great company.
good,"The work is tough, especially when first starting out. However it is a company you can grow with if you enjoy the restaurant business. If you choose to only work part time, the skills you gain while working there are invaluable."
good,My experience with chipotle was a good one I like to think. We were very fast paced but it wasn’t like an intense fast paced. I got to build relationships with many of my guest which I enjoyed.
good,"Love the fact that they are very serious about keeping our food safe and our people clean. "
good,"They don't train you so well, It's a quick paced environment, they encourage you to teach yourself and use their unorganized prep sheets, yet you need to do everything in a timed fashion, theoretically making it impossible for you to do a through job while since you can't teach yourself without failing your team."
good,"I would definitely work here again, there were many job opportunities and equal chances for any team member to advance if they truly desired to. A fun work environment and great atmosphere altogether."
good,"Good systems in place to keep the restaurant running well and keep training on track. They have a lot of opportunities to learn good kitchen skills and management skills. The restaurant only runs well if staffed though, if you go into a store that is struggling the job gets exponentially more difficult. One or two bad or slow employees per shift will ruin it easily."
good,"Chipotle is a fun place to work although it gets very busy , it sometimes gets hard because of the customers other then that its really fun! and interesting also"
good,"Teamwork was huge at my store, and everyone always made newcomers feel welcome without being too lenient on what expectations were. I appreciate everything I learned while working for this company, despite the change in attitude towards what matters. The focus changed from making sure the workers were happy to making sure profits were increasing no matter the cost."
good,"Working at Chipotle was great, as everyone on the crew got to know one another. We would strive to better one another, and help each other if they required help. Managers were very understanding with everyone's schedule and would try to ensure that everyone got the hours they wanted. The first few days were difficult, obviously to trying to learn and adjust to the work, but it soon becomes a routine. I felt that my experiences with working under pressure, working with a group, and customer service has improved greatly while working here."
good,My hard work gets recognized and I feel like a valuable worker. I love my coworkers and I enjoy going to work. I have gotten an increase in hours lately which has really helped.
good,"The Chipotle located at 50 California Street, San Francisco was a very busy location.  Every member was always working on a task and we often would usually 10 hours every shift.  This was a fun job because each task made me feel accomplished after completed, and the work was enjoyable."
good,great management team. the amount of work done didn't match the pay. the benefits were great they don't like paying overtime. extremely clean overall.
good,"My experience at Chipotle was overall very positive. I enjoyed my time there and the culture was a very uplifting one for the majority of the time I spent. It was a very challenging job, that did push me a lot. I had not had plans to move up to a salaried manager with the company for personal reasons, however the time I spent managing in Chipotle was extremelly beneficial and readied me to be somewhere close to a salaried position. Management spent alot of personal time developing my abilities and training me to be a better manager. Although there were rocky points (getting switched to different locations often in the last two years, many different changes and objectives, etc). However the teams that I worked with in the patch were always very willing to help and to guide and make each other better through these processes. Overall Chipotle was a very impressive experience albeit quite challenging and somewhat misguided near the end. However even through some misdirection in the company it seemed to run very well on a consistent basis which made this not a negative experience in the least bit. This did leave me to believe that I owed something to the company at the end of the day because they had invested so much time in to me. I learned things like p&l, food deliveries, management techniques, food rotation, food safety, knife skills, culinary skills, etc. However at the end of it I had to leave the company for personal reasons."
good,Great  place to work. I would recommend this job to any body that is willing to work and have fun. Be creative and successful at what you do and you’ll go up in ranks really fast
good,Some days were good others not so much. Everybody did there best to work together and keep the restaurant clean and started to become close. Management stayed in contact to ensure policies were implemented and all employees were happy and comfortable
good,Work environment is very friendly. Everyone is there to help you learn and grow as an employee. Typical day consists of your designated job along with other cleaning and prepping tasks.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotle was a fast pace enviroment especially on grill, wich is what i did. All my co-workers were really cool and i made alot of friends. I learned alot when I worked there like how to cook all the meats and dice it all up, how to scrub a grill the right way aswell as cleaning the rest of the kitchen. Overall a good place to work."
good,"Typical Day: Nonstop work, Fast paced, 30 min breaks if one opens or closes"
good,Awesome advancement opportunity if you put yourself in position to excel in your position.  Company is great overall. Yearly convention with team and managers
good,My coworkers were very friendly and I enjoyed the atmosphere. I wish I was still working there but I needed more hours and I couldn't handle it physically due to my disability
good,"Job experience at Chipotle Mexican Grill was outstanding. Was hiried upon the grand opening in the location of Twin Falls, Idaho. The training experience was fun and challenging."
good,"The most enjoyable part of this job was the people and how everyone works as a team. The most un enjoyable part was how hectic it could get, but overall the job is somewhere you can learn and adapt with the help of your leaders."
good,"I have learned many things working for Chipotle. The team and managers are easy to get along with, feels like one big family. Certian days are harder than others but employees work together to make it possible. The hardest part about working at Chipotle would be to either ask for days off or keeping up with the pace of the job. You receive a lot of customers throughout the day, sometimes so busy it can be hard to maneuver to complete other tasks. Overall I would recommend this job due to the good pay, but not if you are not able to withstand a crowd or multitasks."
good,Ive learned many skills while working there. Got great experience and unforgettable memories . Made me grow from a boy to a man. Wouldn't change my choice of working here for anything.
good,"A typical day at work would be wash your hands then jump right into your daily duties. I've learned that you'll have to get familiar with all your duties as quick as possible so that you wont slow your coworkers down. The management was very helpful when giving instructions on how to go about doing things. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the customers who would be on the phone while ordering, causing frustration between both the customer and I. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and growing familiar with the customers as well as the coworkers."
good,"Co-workers were kind and made me feel welcomed. Managers were very helpful in such a quick-paced environment. Anytime I had a question, all i had to do was ask. I never felt upset or angry in the work environment."
good,"This is a GREAT first job. I established amazing work ethics from working at this chain! Free food on your shift and always opportunities to move up within the restaurant. Only chain I have worked for that actually seemed to care about their workers. Management was great, wonderful support system. The workplace culture was generally positive. Hardest part of the job was balancing when food should be served and prepped according to how busy the day was. Everything else was very enjoyable!"
good,Working at Chipotle was a great experience the management was terrific. Great place to work for college students who want to work and continue being in school at the same time.
good,i would be in at 6 start meal prep lunch break was at about 10-10:30 i believe store would be open at 11. peak hour is at 12-1 which normally is the busiest part of the day.
good,"I love working here. The amount of professionalism that Chipotle sets for their team is top notch. I love the customs and ways that each Chipotle has and somehow manage to be unique to each store. They have taught me that a sense of consistency and a mix of spontaneity can be manageable in the work place. Though at times it may be fast-pace, overall the experience you get from working at a place like Chipotle is well worth it."
good,I really enjoyed working for chipotle & I’d recommend anyone whose really excited to work to apply for the company. The management did their absolute best to train me and get me where I needed to be be in order to do my job correctly.
good,"I loved working at Chipotle for the first few months, but after that, I didn't enjoy it as much. Nearly every shift, I worked overtime. And when it's super busy you probably won't be able to leave for another 30-45 minutes later. You'll have to deal with sensitive customers and they take forever in deciding what they want. They can be in line for 10 or so minutes, and still, don't know what they want to eat."
good,A typical day at work is clocking in and beginning to count out a cash drawer. Then checking to assure everything is stocked in case of a rush. Then cleaning until everything looks spotless.
good,"Been working here for a number of years. I genuinely enjoy what I do, I love the people and the work environment provided. The hardest part about my job isn't managing the crew it is communication among managers. Communication as far as us all being on the same page and that isn't any specific person fault, it's more about the way that we all were trained. We all have been trained in different stores so some things I may know another manager may not and vice versa."
good,"Working here was fun on occasion. My last location was way better than a previous Chipotle location back home in the Bay. For me, a job environment is very important. From day one at Chipotle everyone was very welcoming and willing to help me catch up to speed with the new procedures. I liked it a lot."
good,"Overall i did enjoy working for Chipotle. To this day their vision sticks with me in my other jobs i have held and my current one. Empowerment! Day to day it was a decent place to be, the managers were awesome and the crew worked as a team. Aces in their places, working in restaurants most my life, i can honestly say, Chipotle was one of my favorites to work for. It did get busy and very fast paced but you never had to worry about being out there solo. Your team was always behind you."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,The job duties were very simple but had to be done in a timely manner. At times the place can get very busy but overall a great job. The hardest part was finishing all duties asked to perform if the day was hectic.
good,"I sort of liked working there. It was fast paced and the crew was awesome, however the manager was really slow and in my opinion did not connect with his team very well."
good,"As a morning worker, each crew member is responsible for prepping food items until open time, in which each team member is placed in a position for lunch rush that exemplifies best ability to perform as quickly and efficiently as possible. Management team was constantly observing portion control and individual advancement of each employee. The culture at Chipotle encouraged persistent training of crew members in multiple positions in order to move employees up in the corporation."
good,Everything is handmade daily so there is a lot of physical demand. Cut-size and presentation is very important as well. Customer serivce is also very important.
good,it was fast paced and relaxed  the employees are cool to talk to and overall its a good enviorment friendly customers and the job is pretty simple to do.
good,"I worked at Chipotle and I honestly could say it was a really good job. The only thing I didn't approve about, they took away your hours if you called out, even if it was a serious reason."
good,the most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people and interacting with different kind of people. it is quick paced so ur day goes by flying its a family.
good,"good job, flexible hours, hours are flexible and you can work as much hours and days as you want. the management could've been a little better but the job was pretty good overall."
good,"a typical day at work is busy until the lunch rush is over"
good,Chipotle was a very fun place to work at fast paced people friendly an great customer service. The learning experience was good to it was my first job.
good,"Free burritos and tuition reimbursement (up to $5,250/year) what more could you ask for? The pay could be better, but that's true with any large corporation. Best thing about chipotle is how flexible they are. I could literally work 39 hours one week and then take two weeks off. It's pretty cool, and very convenient as a student."
good,"Its a fast paced line of work from a crew to a general manager, most responsible people are able to thrive in this job. Chipotle might or might not be your job it depends more on self if you love to work in those conditions. Every store is different so maybe you'll find a slow flow of customer at a store but mostly they're about keeping the store at high standards and up to the companies expectation."
good,"Although I love the experience and knowledge that I received at CMG, it was very fast paced and intense at times. The coworkers were great and the management was excellent. CMG really knows how to compensate their workers. I would have not left it it were not for the distance in travel to get to work."
good,"Chiptole is a great work place if you’re trying to obtain skills and experience in the restaurant industry. Is a very quick pace environment, so working as a team is a must."
good,"a very fast paced environment, scheduling time off is difficult, a lot of work, long lines, work under pressure, gets really busy, pay is good for a part time job"
good,"Generally working for Chipotle is more rewarding than most fast food experiences. My team was very close and supportive. The education benefits are wonderful and the skills learned will stay with you for a lifetime. I left to focus on more special events and fine dining, but if I hadn't wanted that, I would have stayed here!"
good,My experience has been great overall. When you are employed here you just have to be willing to do the work. The overall culture here is great despite the recent issues with the business. Everyone here strives to be the best and serve the highest quality food in their area. Food safety here is important and if you can't keep up it's best you leave.
good,"Great people to work with, they're all very helpful and fun. They make work easier. Fast- Pace environment. A lot to learn but you get used to it in about a month. Leveling up doesn't take very long depending on how well you work."
good,Picking Chipotle as my first job was a great decision. As a starter job you learn great team work skills and the fast paced nature of the busier stores trains you to work well under pressure. Overall I learned a lot that has helped me grow professionally as a worker.
good,A typical day of work was fast-paced. There was a lot of time management skills that I learned. The hardest part of working was not getting tired. The easy part of working was the fast pace because it was challenging and it gave me skills to have diligent work while working fast.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Working at Chipotle is an open door to great learning experiences and fast position advancement. Whether the day offers a lot of sales or low, it is a fun and productive working enviroment, and aside from the minimum stress levels, very enjoyable."
good,Learning curve initially during the busy hours. Everything becomes standard once  you get settled in.If opening your main responsibility will be to perform acquired tasks on time of opening which will become normal to do once you know all the ingredients.
good,I loved my job. The people was wonderful. It is very fast pace work but you will get use to it . They have tools to help you to make sure that you do not get hurt.
good,"Well, you start off at 7.30 am depending on what station they put you on like tortilla, salsa, prep, or cook and there are certain tasks you do in each station..."
good,"Extremely fast paced and demanding, but the work environment, culture, and management, all made it efficient and rewarding. Like you were a part of something."
good,The management was amazing but the customers were often rude at times. Chipotle gets busy fast so be prepared to work all day non-stop! The food is prepared with great care.
good,"Work well with others"
good,Great place to work  great employees and the culture is different unique not like most. It was a pleasure working for this company always good times and good work days.  The crew was full of energy and happiness. Lived by the 13 characteristics.
good,Open and close store. Daily prepping of food for line and grill cooks. Order trucks and recieve deliveries. Inventory count and stock inventory. Food safety audits. Writing weekly schedules. Hiring and on bording. Weekly interviews with new applicants. Cash operations and cash handling. Traing of new hires. Performance reviews.
good,"Great people, great workplace, if it wasn't for septa going on strike i'd still be employed by this company. I the pay could be better I must say, but the work experience makes up for it,"
good,"While the pay and benefits are nothing to write home about, workers generally start at a little more than minimum wage, and gain preventative insurance benefits (routine checkups are the order of the day, things like emergency room visits aren't covered). The store I worked in was very busy most of the time, and work was almost always non-stop and demanding, leaving little time for anything but on-the-fly training, though I've come to understand my experience doesn't reflect the norm for the company. I liked and respected my managers, but they were frequently rotated out and reassigned to different stores, with one or two only staying a handful of months or even weeks."
good,Chipotle was and is what chipotle is and will be as it is a good place to work and yes it was that. i had a great time with my team at this location in sf.
good,"In my years at Chipotle the biggest thing I've noticed is the disconnect between the culture the company wants and the actual day to day environment of Chipotle. My biggest advice would be simply to find a good one. Working at Chipotle is a lot of work for virtually the same pay as other food service places. If you're not constantly tending to customers you're expected to be doing a sometime monstrous amount of prep work. If you're not fast you won't last. There's always something to be doing, which, if you're looking for a job where 8 hours feels like 4, you'll be in heaven. However, if you're looking for an easy summer job, Chipotle isn't for you. The greatest and most rewarding thing however, is the promise of moving up. No joke Chipotle's opportunities are endless. If you work hard enough and care enough you could be going from making 25k a year (base crew salary) to 60k a year (average GM salary) in a handful of years."
good,"This is a good job for first year college students and during high school. Its fast and easy money. Simple job, just have to have a strong mind to handle everything at times."
good,"A great place to learn how to work with others as a team. High pressure to be fast , but helped me improve to work under pressure. A great community since everyone helped each other out."
good,"Chipotle is a very fast-paced restaurant which could be stressful at times, but it made the time go by a lot faster and my co-workers made the job alot easier"
good,You are given the opportunity to advance here and you feel that supportive culture the moment you start working here. Upper leadership is great and invest in you and your developmental needs. Chipotle has excellent benefits and want you to feel supported.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Busy with some downtime. Always something to learn or procedures to do. A lot of room for growth within the company. Weekly audits to help identify any issues for the team to address them quickly and better the flow of the business.Prep cook and clean food and provide a great friendly experience for customers while hanging out with great people and eating some really good food.
good,Great opportunity for a start off job.. The atmosphere was a excellent environment to work. The customers are enjoyable to talk to and my co workers was very humble and welcome me with open arms. They have great opportunities to move up in the company.
good,"A typical day at work is never the same as the last or the next. There was always something new going on at work. This always kept me on my toes and excited about what could happen next. I learned how to be a top performer and continue to be empowered at my job, This lesson is something that can be used outside of the workplace, which is something that I am very thankful for. The management was open to new ideas, very flexible, and professional. All of my mangers were willing to lend a hand when necessary, understanding of certain situations, and giving encouragement when need be. The hardest part of the job was adapting to new areas of the title ""crew member,"" because there was always something new to learn. The most enjoyable part was being able to be yourself because the entire company is a boiling pot of different people and personalities."
good,"Competitive pay, mostly friendly work place, sociable environment, fast paced, must remember store goals and vocabulary phrases. I personally had conflicts because my job was about 20 minutes away from my home."
good,"Chipotle was a very different place for me to work. This corporation really cares about more than just it's profit and if you are to work here you have to be very hardworking and passionate in all you do. Advancement is definitely possible and hard work is noticed. I had a hard time with my availability while working there during high school because this job requires much of your time, but overall it is a very positive work place."
good,"Great Company overall, their help/hot-line makes the employee's feel as if someone has out backs. They give great benefits and the company really cares about it's employees. The management team in my Cross County location was wiped out and brought in a better trained team of managers which was good and bad. They new managers had more knowledge about the store and how to properly run it, the bad part was they were highly discriminatory and ""looked out"" for people similar to them. They were in relationships with other team members and gave special treatment. When a team member would talk to them about their problem they were then on the ""hit list""  and would then start dropping their work hours causing them to complain and resulting in them quitting or finding another job. I really loved this company but couldn't talk the store managers. I learn so much from this company and i am forever grateful."
good,"First of all, the culture in the work place is great. The people I work with are the reason I love my job so much. This is all due to great managers who enforce the mission statement of Chipotle, to be a top performer. The managers essentially train you to eventually take their place, and manage a branch yourself one day."
good,"As my first job, Chipotle was a job which taught me how to handle myself as a leader under stress. This is a great place for anyone entering the work force as Chipotle forges character by persevering through periods of intense labor (i.e. the hellish lunch rushes with an understaffed crew)."
good,"Chipotle is a very fast paced environment and if you don't know what to expect when you start working for this company, then it can become stressful. When working for Chipotle, you're going to be serving a different customer every 30 seconds and you have to be quick. Other than that, if you do well enough, then you can't start to climb the management ladder if you're up for it and it can teach you how to work under pressure."
good,"A typical day at work was coming in in the morning and preparing for the day. To prepare for the day I would either fry chips, prepare salsas or prep lettuce and other foods. I learned preparing food with integrity is very rewarding. The management of Chipotle was extremely organized. The workplace culture was very fun and inviting. It made me excited to come into work everyday. The hardest part of the job was staying away from the food. It was hard not to when you get a free meal every shift. The most enjoyable part of the job was the mission and the people. The staff and customers made the job enjoyable."
good,it was nice place to work. nice co workers and management they all teach one another to be top performers I loved that about them very fast paced though
good,"Work for this company for 8+ years. Started as crew member and work my way up. Great place to work for with opportunities for natural leaders with great work ethic and dedicated. I learn great leadership skills, team work and business managent skills that I will take it for rest of my life. Getting to know the company's culture is a must for me which  helped me stay motivated to achieve the store Manager role. Yet in the last 3 years the upper management/area manager have been lacking of experience and motivation which has lead me to leave the company and seek other adventures."
good,Value being Punctual and Professional. Always ask the  general manager if there are new procedures or expectations for chipotle because things change daily at chipotle. Follow chain of command if you want or need answers to any questions or concerns you may have.
good,This job was tough and fast paced I loved it but there need to be more flexible with the managers and give them more time off and find help if they need it and not push the management to far
good,"The work may appear complicated at first, but really all of the separate jobs are very easy, and you're guided and given hands on training. There's plenty of opportunity to move up and the culture and people are very positive."
good,Sometimes you have to do things on your own so just be more aware of how people do certain things so you can learn. Always remember to have patience and have a smile.
good,Coming in to a great atmosphere where you could interac with all the member. Having a fast pace environment where you are still able to adjust to the settings.
good,"Great place to work if you're a person who can stay focused and your feet for 5+ hours at a time. I love working here, I just need more money. The staffing and management at Chipotle is great, the environment is wonderful and always friendly. Chipotle as a company right now is trying to do a lot at one time and I personally believe that things would go s lot smoother if just one thing was focused on at a time."
good,everyone at Chipotle is great to be around. The atmosphere is always fun and everyone there is like a big family. I love it there and Im glad I got to experience chipotle.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I'll say working there isn't for everybody, it's almost like a skill that you have to hone and most people don't handle that very well. but overall, once you get everything down and become more and more proficient at it, the work is a natural breeze but there's always something new to do every single day, and that's why I enjoyed it so much. The pay was also substantial, it was very rewarding towards the end of the day."
good,"Great job for upbeat personalities. This is a fast paced environment. Must be willing to be a customer servant. A very busy work environment. Always on your feet, yet great opportunities to advance."
good,"My time spent at Chipotle was easily one of the most rewarding entry-level jobs I have ever held. "
good,"Wish I could have stayed with this employer for a lot longer than I did. Other outside factors affected that, however. Great work environment with equally great people! They are very understanding and flexible. Also very hard working and dedicated group of people."
good,The food was amazing . It would get busy but the teamwork that we had was the greatest. The length that we took to make the customers satisfied was really good as well .
good,Chipotle is a environment where a crew member has the opportunity to move up fast by enhancing their skills by being a top performer who is empowered to achieve high standards.
good,"The work is fast-paced and is stressful but can be fun with the right attitude. Customers expect their food dealt with with the upmost care. Just like any job, do the job right and you will be rewarded."
good,"My experience with the Danbury CT mall location was an excellent. I was introduced to the food industry's leading example in fresh food, high standards and a fun atmosphere with great room for growth. I had a management team that catered to my hectic schedule and provided reasonable flexibility. The dynamics of the team were quite friendly and honest which eased the normally intimidating position held by an inexperienced teenager. The quality of training could have been better as the training schedule was a bit disorganized. The pay was sufficient and increased periodically with consistently improving performance."
good,most enjoyable part of the day is making the people around me better everyday. my coworkers are the best great to work with
good,"Constantly meeting new people, work place deffinetly has given me some additional people pleasing skills dealing with customers nonstop."
good,It's a good solid place to work and the management and crew are amazing. At least most of the crew is amazing. The only problem with the company and my location in general is that they hire family groups and they tend to run everything. So if one person in this family decides they don't care for you they will do everything they can to make sure you don't advance anywhere within the company.
good,A typical day at work is always busy I've leaned top prefomens is someone who has the ability to preform good work for them & the company. Our management is awesome. Our hardest part is when we get very busy sometimes. What I enjoy there is how we all work hard to prefrom good work.
good,"Chipotle is a GREAT place to work. I enjoyed it, especially having some laughs with customers and coworkers. When the entire team is working like a well oiled engine, the day is incredibly smooth. Then there's restaurants like the one I worked at. Support just wasn't there. It wasn't the General Manager's fault, it was from the Field Leader and above. They didn't support him like he needed and it caused a lot of friction in the store. We were always understaffed and it was a struggle to get through some days. Don't let that deter you though, once a store is fully staffed and the support is there, opportunities are ENDLESS!"
good,"Not only would it be exciting working with a group of people that enjoy what they do, you're also able to learn a lot about the customers. There would be difficult moments but that didn't last long. I've learned to manage the customers and assists with their needs."
good,"The benefits this company gives the employees is very helpful and I recommend anyone working there to take advantage of them. Working at Chipotle taught me how to interact with customers and treat others how you would like to be treated. Since I was cashier, this helped me also focus on the dinning room area which remained clean and organized under my watch."
good,"Chipotle offers amazing advancement opportunities if you are hardworking and willing to dedicate your time to the company. If you are not, this place is not for you. It can definitely be seen as a career path more than a part time side job."
good,"the company care a lot about their culture, offer distinctive benefits and the food is great. need some changes and the cashier should have people to help him in the lobby while peak hours,"
good,"I come in and clock in. I say hit to everyone and check my prep sheet to see what i have to do that shift, check the amount of dishes there is and start working as soon as possible to get my work done on time."
good,"Chipotle is a great company to work for. It is nothing like what it seems like. You do a lot of work all day and it can get overwhelming but the people you meet there are unique and make your time worthwhile. Management can get stressed out and be a tad unreasonable sometimes but overall they're very understanding and reliable. If you show out, they work with you."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"It was a fun working environment, loved working there. I had a lot of opportunities. They have alot of opportunities there for their employees. They would work with your schedule."
good,"Great place to work. A fast paced environment where teamwork"
good,This is probably one of the most exciting and satisfactory jobs I've had. The crew is very supportive as well as the management team. Friendly work environment as well as very organized.
good,If you are not used to a fast paced environment this may not be the job for you. What I loved the most about this job was that it taught me to keep my head when under pressure. Chipotle is always busy so I always remained on my feet because there's always something that needs to be done. Managers made sure everyone was comfortable at all times. The atmosphere was very friendly and diverse.
good,"Great company to work for. Flexible for me starting and ending as a high school student and still gave me 28+ hours/wk. Advance quickly, good management and fast promotions/training on different stations. Learn how to deal with picky customers but nice having a simple menu with few options. Hardest part of job is staying ""inspired"" by their standard of ""Food with Integrity"", ""Empowerment"", etc. Great coworkers hired based off the same traits as you, making it easy to make a friend."
good,"A typical day at work would be me at the cash register, making sure the lobby was clean and neat at all times, also that there were enough drinks in the fridge, enough chips and enough bags at all times. I learned how to prep some of the food, I learned how to make chips, I learned the importance of customer service. The management was fair to everyone. My co- workers were all very nice and helpful. The hardest part of the job was how hot it got since some of the food is kept hot. I loved interacting with customers and my co- workers."
good,"Working in the front (tortilla 1 specifically) was always a busy and a hard task. I was the person who greeted all the customers and started the orders. I also had to complete the online orders as well. Working with my other co-workers was always fun, being that this was a hands on team job. The management of this job was really cool and understandable. Nothing was easy working at chipotle, but that's what made it all so enjoyable."
good,"Enjoyable workday, agreeable co-workers, and fair management. Frequently interacted with customers. I enjoyed making the chips."
good,"Every other day it gets crazy busy, and you have to work twice as hard as you already do, but it makes time go by a lot faster. I've learned a lot about Chipotle's culture. The management is AWESOME :) They are great supporters, and try to help with whatever. Co-workers, come and go, but they ones that stay are the best!"
good,"Co-workers have different attitudes towards each other everyday."
good,"It's not like any other restaurant, the chipotle culture is very distinct and is one of the few places where each individual is valued beyond their pay roll. I learned many cooking skills as well as restaurant management and task delegation. It has helped me develop as a leader and made lasting connections."
good,"A typical day at work was practically preparing the food throughout the day and making customers orders. I actually learned how to make a really big burrito. The management was great. He was really funny and always cheerful and happy. The coworkers were too much into their own bubble with one another. Very grumpy when your new. But once they actually got to know u, they were very sweet. The hardest part of the job was getting work done at such very unbelievably small amount of time when your partner calls out sick. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting feedback from customers basically after they finished their food and saying how delicious it was."
good,"Overall the store I work in is great, but the advancement is slow and sometimes unpromising. I love the staff and the overall vibe to the environment. Chipotle offers many great opportunities which is always great, but this job is meant for those who are looking for something more fast paced!"
good,Fast paced work environment with great room for advancement. Supportive management concerned with you as a person not just an employee. Promotions based on ability and skill not seniority.
good,"The job is great, great management, fast pasted job, but thew compensation is low. This is a great ""starter job"". Fun work place with supportive management and employees."
good,"Fast-paced work with great people by your side, but little opportunity for advancement. Empowering culture and overall great company to work for and promote."
good,"While working at Chipotle I learned time management, a strong work ethic, as well a sense of pride for my work. I was encouraged to work hard and learn new skills.There are managers who started in my same position and have put in their best efforts resulting in success as well as job security.Co-Workers and Superiors are both encouraging and suppoirtive as well."
good,Chipotle was the job that made me a fast worker. The steady flow of Customers plus the Fresh and high quality of the food sometimes lead to tumultuous days but the Culture of the Store makes for a great work environment.
good,"Had a great time at work. The workers were always cheerful and excited to work, and always had a smile on there faces when they served the customers"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"A typical day at work is very busy, but fun. Relaxed environment and management. Plenty of opportunities to advance in the company."
good,Chipotle is a hard working but fun work place. There is always something to do so your always productive however its what you make your work place how you treat others and how they treat you. one thing tests sport of the job thats enjoyable is that you get a free employee meal. on the contrary it is no enough pay the pay runs bi-weekly and i would be working like 60 hours including overtime and still be only making around 400 dollars.
good,Everyday i was able to learn something new. The staff was working hard as a team. The management was more than willing to help as much as we needed them and they were more than willing to teach every member anything that they wanted to know. I had a great connection with everyone involved with the company and made some great friends. Although we all did get along pretty well we still were able to get the job done in an orderly manner and were productive in everything that we did.
good,"Assist customers "
good,"People are nice, customer service quality is high, unique culture and really care about people development. there is developement book that we use to see the progress from each coworker so manager could track the progress easyly. full or part time get the same benefit (dental, health, and vision insurance)"
good,"fun workplace, good culture, awesome food, supportive management, learned how to be customer focus, great team relationships, learned new techniques includes inventory and data entry"
good,"I got lucky when I started working here."
good,"Typical day at work is making our chips and food fresh everyday for the guests. we strive to make each and everyone's visit to Chipotle a unique experience. We have a vision, its to create a team of top performers who are empowered to achieve high standards. We help inspire that vision by trying to make everyone better, everyday. The team is always awesome to work with who create a fun, yet professional work environment for everyone. The hardest part of the jon is probably opening in the morning and making sure everything is perfect. It's not a hard job, there is many objectives that need to be completed in a time frame. We do everything with a sense of urgency. The most enjoyable part about the job is definitely all of us working together as a team everyday to make every customer happy and satisfied that they chose Chipotle."
good,"I was skeptical when I first joined the Chipotle team. They kept working with me and I just kept getting better and better. It's very tough at first, and you'll want to give up. but if you stick with them, it will all pay off."
good,excited to go to work everyday. Busy most of the time and stressful. Customers are mostly nice but you get a couple bad ones. Room for advancement is awesome! you can move up quickly. Pay is too low for all the work expected. You get a lot of experience from this job.
good,"In order to be successful you must put your team before yourself and make sure you help others when you can."
good,I worked the cash register and learned how to deal with the lunch and dinner rush as well as difficult customers. I learned how to precisely and promptly ring people up in an efficient and personable manner. The hardest part about the job was working an hour past my scheduled time every day. The most enjoyable part of the job was the phenomenal team I got to be a part of.
good,"I enjoyed working here very much, great people, lots of hours and growth opportunity. Recommending to anyone looking for a good starter job."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle can be stressful. If you are working with the right crew, everything can go pretty smooth until it gets busy."
good,"Chipotle is all about team work. The company is very fast growing. They are very anxious to develop the workers. The team is very close knit and friendly. Out of the four years I've been with them I've been trained as a crew member, fax manager, kitchen manager, and service manager. Upon leaving I was being trained as a apprentice promised to soon have my own location."
good,Food Prep - Inventory - Critical 7 Weights -  Forcasting Sales - Serving Customers. Regular crew duty is just to provide great customer service so that they will leave and come back happy.
good,"Chipotle was a great two months for me before I moved to LA, I loved the food and the benefits and the people. Good hours as well."
good,Great place to work with awesome future growth. Fun atmosphere. high pressure situations and fast paced environment.
good,It can get hectic on lunch hour depending on your location but overall you'll have fun meet some interesting people & enjoy where you work. Well... at least I did!
good,"Everyday is something new whether good or bad it's up to you, I've learned to always trust your first instinct and to treat the kitchen as if were yours. My coworkers were what inspired and motivated me to come to work and pull long hours because we were friends and we had fun together. Hardest part of the day was peak time (busy)and the most enjoyable part was how we as coworkers became family."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"i work at 8am , go on break around 10 enjoy my break with ,y co worker usually have to do my food orders and invoices"
good,I had fun while I was there and I would still be there if my original general manager were there.
good,It's a lot of work but it's worth it. A lot of prepping is involved with opening the store and keeping it supplied for the day. Everthing is made fresh. Nothing is processed. The crew must communicate effectively with each other especially during peak hours. The people are awesome and the enviroment is a positive one. I would recommend this job to anyone who is self-motivated and has a positive attitude.
good,"My typical day at work begins with checking all that I have on the line and restocking what needs to be refilled based on demand from customers. Then I must serve customers with a friendly up-beat attitude and at a timely matter. Finally at the end of the shift I must clean and restock everything for next shift of people to come in a timely matter. "
good,"Fast-paced, easy to get along with coworkers, amazing opportunities for advancement to management."
good,"help manage store, handle food and catering orders, handle cash."
good,"Busy environment. Great learning experience, very well defined training, great opportunities for advancement."
good,"For work at Chipotle Mexican Grill I would say that it is a very challenging area of work. A typical work day consists of constantly being on your feet and working very hard, but also making that work to provide a better experience. For example, if you work on the grill you are cooking chicken, steak, and fajitas for the customers while also working on keeping your station in a clean condition and also doing the dishes during off peak hours. What I learned from this job is that although the work may seem almost impossible at first, if you keep trying and working on doing something better more and more everyday eventually you will see that this ""impossible"" task is only a test to see whether you can work harder and better. Management has a very uplifting aroma, meaning that the managers there are very nice to work with and they know your potential. They want you to succeed just as much as you want to succeed yourself. The co-workers also give off the same feeling as the management team, they are all working with you to help you succeed to getting to a higher position in the job. The hardest part of the job is the problem with underemployment. Underemployment is hard because if we are understaffed we are expected to work just as hard as if we were fully staffed and at some points this becomes very tiring when someone will call out and know that their job is still safe. The most enjoyable part of the job is knowing that if you have put a lot of dedication and time into your job, eventually it will pay off, so long as you are a hard worker and you would like to succeed in the company."
good,"Great job for students, work well with varied schedules, customers love to eat chipotle!"
good,"Working at Chipotle Mexican Grill has taught me a lot about work ethic and how food should be prepared. Other than the amazing food, Chipotle has a great background story. I've been a kitchen manager for about a year now and m position definitely has its challenges. I feel like I have to babysit people who are much older than me on a daily basis. Despite those few frustrations, I love the people I work with and we all get along great! Everyone is willing to pick up a shift if something unexpected comes up in life. I work with some pretty amazing individuals. They make the job that much more enjoyable. Chipotle is also a great place to work because they give you the opportunity to move up in the company. For example, I started at minimum wage, rolling burritos. Right off the bat, they told me if I worked hard enough, I can become a manager before no time! They weren't lying. It opens a lot of doors, especially for people who don't have degrees! I'd definitely recommend a Chipotle position."
good,I made food for customers and preped it before i left. I cleaned the entier restraunt before i checked out.
good,"Overall it was a great place to work at, good crew, great food, great advancement opportunities, decent pay, the only downfall was a few members of the management crew began to fall apart and stop caring."
good,"Chipotle is a restaurant that chooses employees wisely. Standards for day to day work and the person, themselves, are high. Chipotle is clean, organized, proficient and expects the employees to be the same way. I learned how to manage multiple tasks at one time while still enjoying my work. I learned how well to work with managers side by side and how important it is to have organization. The hardest part of the job is also the most important; to make sure each and every customer is completely satisfied. While it may be hard to do I enjoy doing so and want to make sure that every customer gets what they want and need in a timely fashion. The most enjoyable part of the job is having good working relationships between coworkers and managers. Knowing that you are able to do your job and count on your coworkers and managers makes the job more enjoyable."
good,Fast but friendly pace. The entire team I teaches each other. After working here I feel confident in my ability to perform any where. The job taught me the skills to manage a kitchen and then the restaurant. great pay and benefits and promotions based off performance.
good,"Occassional rude customers, but over all friendly workplace. "
good,I learned how to fry tortilla chips
good,"As soon as you walk in the coworkers would greet you with a smile. Then you put on your apron and wash your hands before you start doing anything. It seems a bit slow if you work in the morning, but around 11 to noon the restaurant really starts gettin interesting it's crazy how many people come for some delicious food. I learned that some people can either be very picky about what they want on their food, as other don't really care. One of the best parts is that if you do a great job or have a really positive attitude the customers would give you compliments. One time, a customer went back to the line three times just to see my smile, plus he really enjoys eating here. The coworkers are extremely helpful because there is so much to learn, and the managers watches you like a hawk to see if you make any mistakes. If you make the same mistake constantly they'll be a litte strict, but that's what you need right? Other than that, Chipotle is great place to make new friends, serve/eat great food, and make good money for people with no experiece of working they train right on the spot."
good,"A typical day at work I would usually be doing various jobs like, mainting the floor where everyone sits, out and out. Also, serving people and preparing foods. Cleaning the bathrooms and work area. The most important thing that I have learned at this job was team work, they were like a family there. Management was very good, always on their toes and kept us in line and my co-workers where very fun to work with, but they did not get distracted at all. The hardest part of the job was learning the salas and fun part about it was always doing something different."
good,Depending on what position I was going to be manning that day would depend on my morning jobs. With each position requires different jobs when opening. Each person opening has their duties which we all complete at the same time and take our break before opening. The day passes swiftly because it was always so busy in my location. It was a very intense hard working job but i enjoy working hard so i did not mind. You definitely earn your keep. The management did not seem very stable but we all got along very well. The crew is like a team and we all worked together very efficiently. With a crew member that was lacking everyone suffered i would have to say that would make the job very difficult. Chipotle is not somewhere to work if one is lazy and not willing to give alot. But it can be very rewarding if you treat it right.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotle is a fresh/ fast food restaurant, a regular day at work would start preparing food, fixing tables, cash count registers, and get the whole store ready for lunch time which was the busiest time. I learned all to prepare food, cook food, customer service, customer feedback, customer satisfaction, scheduling, and more experience on cash handling. The co-workers were fun and a great team, the hardest part of the job was to keep up at busy time to achieve daily goal, but at the same time it was fun to achieve the daily goal and celebrate all together."
good,"Chipotle is a great place to work, If it werent for personal reasons and a confrontation with one manager in particular I would have stayed."
good,I liked working around the team members. The food is awesome as well as the management team.
good,Working with chipotle allowed me to experience diversity whether dealing with co worker or customer it was a great experience
good,"I absolutely loved working for this company. Even though I feel like they didn't treat me fairly in the end, I still believe in everything they stand for. I believe that they are an amazing employer and I am thankful that I had the opportunity to learn from them. It has helped me get to where I am today."
good,The hardest part of the job was time expectations within daily tasks. Often preparations would be done simultaneously to tasks due to lack of staff or organization. I learned how to continue to exceed expectations regardless of outside factors.
good,This job is very compatible for anyone looking for a job for the first time since everyone there is there to help you with the training process. It is very compatible with student's school schedule and a generous salary.
good,The place is good and clean with competitive pay and good benefits. I usually work the morning shift and get done around noon. Sometimes I work in the kitchen too.
good,The overall experience was quite good and it really helped me to understand and learn various aspects like customer services and working in a fast paced place.
good,"A typical workday consists of greeting customers, taking orders, ringing up customers, maintaining a clean restaurant "
good,"I loved working at both of my Chipotle locations! One was more busy and that is where I truly flourished and was on my way to becoming a manager. A typical day at Chipotle varies because there are several different positions within the restaurant. For me, it usually involved coming in around 6am or 7am, before the store opened and starting up grill to cook. I would stay on grill, cooking all meats, beans, rices and other proteins through an 8 hr shift. Management at Chipotle varies, but for me, they were some obvious flaws. The workplace itself was usually upbeat and positive. In the mornings, someone would play music throughout the store as team members prepped or fried chips. The hardest part of the job was the heat--especially when working grill. There aren't many opportunities to leave, especially at a busy store and if no one else is there to help you run grill you have to stay. I learned a great deal at Chipotle, but mostly that work friends can feel like family, and I definitely enjoyed that the most, along with all the opportunities to advance and learn different positions."
good,"Shifts were typically 7am to 4pm or 4pm to 11pm. Chipotle had a fantastic workplace culture; everyone cared about each other. The hardest part was enduring the exhausting, non-stop flow of customers. The best part was the free food and tuition reimbursement."
good,"You experience at Chipotle is really based and the people you work with, and if they're really willing to follow procedures step by step as well as their work ethic. If you got a good team, you'll love working there."
good,"I came in at the start of a new store, so I had two weeks of in-depth training before we even opened. The bosses have been fantastic, encouraging, and helpful. Most of my co-workers are fun to work with, which is a major plus. The work isn't hard, but it can be extremely busy and stressful during peak. The benefits are also the most amazing you'll get from a food service job."
good,Good teamwork. Nice colleagues. Opportunity to learn new things. Fast paced. Friendly and daily customers. Nice deals. Great opportunity to get your hands dirty. Very clean.
good,"There is a lot to do and a short time to complete it. The day starts with prepping food which takes 4-5 hours of time. Once we're open, it's all customer service from there. The lines are tremendously large, yet people are extremely patient and the lines move relatively fast if your team is comfortable, well stocked, and experienced. The hardest part of the job is learning to roll burritos and calling out food to your grill person before you need it."
good,People there are super nice to talk to and work with. Manager was really accommodating and kind. The place was very clean and organized. They made sure that everything was sanitary.
good,everything at work is organized and prepped ready for the next day. team work was and important part of the job and also customer satisfaction. very happy place to work at when the right people were around.
good,"the starting position is one that I would highly recommend for someone's first job. Things are very fast paced but easy to pick up, and a bond grows with coworkers through necessity, because if you're working together the work gets done faster."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"If you come here with goals you can really enjoy your time here, if you come in thinking this is just another job you might find it dissatisfying or to much work for not enough pay but they do give back in forms of free meals, paid time off, paid vacation, paid sick days, dental and vision, 401k, paid tuition, bonuses, incremental pay raise based on performance, ability to move up rapidly, flexible hours. It's an ideal job for goal oriented people and students, those who dont I found where the ones who came and left in months if not weeks."
good,"Working as a cashier in one of the busiest Chipotles was fun, helped me to work on efficiency and speed all while maintaining great customer service to guests."
good,Not to bad very detailed and helps you find what you looking for. I would recommend this site to others family and friends. Couldn't be any more straightforward
good,I took job until something better comes along. Close to my house so can walk there if need be. Daily tip out helps. Also free meals and 50% discount off the clock.
good,"This job is a good first job or for a high school student. The was decent, the pay increases were awful. My increase was .50, and I did half the work the managers did."
good,"I worked at 2 different locations in 2 different states. At the first location, where I started, I loved it. The company mission and values are actually quite remarkable and the CEO Steve Ells is incredible. The training is the best I've ever had at a job. Free meal daily. Tuition reimbursement, benefits for part time employees. Opportunity for advancement is second to none. Chipotle STRONGLY prefers to promote from within rather than hire externally, and it's one of their core values. Because of that, people work harder, and take pride in their job because they know that they can be the next to get promoted, and that's a great feeling. Even if you've never been in management before, if you're a hard worker, they will believe in you and give you the necessary help to get there. That's something that I've never been offered. I worked on crew for 3 months and got promoted to kitchen manager, then another 3 months I got promoted to a service manager, and another 4 months I became an assistant manager. All of that with no management experience."
good,"Good place to work at for a new worker, the staff and management will try their best to make you feel at home. Clean and healthy establishment to work at."
good,"It was helpful it taught me different positions, good teamwork, all the respect about a restaurant business all the manager were cool and nothing is hard on a job it might get frustrating but never hard ."
good,"I work on the grill almost every shift. Relying on teamwork to achieve the goal of getting the job done. Even though Chipotle serves food for the customers, teamwork is heavily needed; everyone relays on everyone. Everyone does get along with everyone. This makes out Chipotle Culture a happy, great, environmental workplace."
good,Muy buenas oportunidades para superarse en la vida como empleado
good,"Great place to work, but not if you're only looking for a paycheck. You have to put in effort here. It's very hot and fast paced, but if you catch on you can keep up."
good,Organized and dependable and very friendly person who’s liking to expand upon my experience as a hard worker. Detail oriented with a focus on accuracy and efficiency. My reliability multi-tasking functionality and dedication improves the business needs of my future employer.
good,Just very crazy don’t know what to do for my manger training not a a constant plan overall really look into what kind of chipotle you working in good luck
good,"A typical day at work is very busy due to construction and warehouse workers being on break. I've learned how to move quickly in intense situations along with keeping a clean space to work in. Managers can be stressful but they are very helpful with teaching new people on how to serve guests in a polite, respectful, and clean manner. The hardest part of the job would be the position of grill as it requires full focus because you will standing in front of a hot grill while making large amounts of food to continuously be served to guests without any waiting. The part I enjoy the most about working there is the co-workers and usually the environment itself luckily does not add stress to the day-to-day tasks."
good,"I absolutely loved the people I worked with. We were like one big family that helped each other out no matter the task. The only reason I left was because customers were rude and always demanded more food, which meant we would lose money and therefore get our hours cut. You do get a raise after a job performance review about every 6 months and I loved getting discounts on the food. Management was also very reasonable when it came to schedule flexibility"
good,"Now I know what you're thinking, working at any fast food place is tiring and exhausting. But working at Chipotle gave me structure and  confidence to be myself. I enjoyed my time there and it had a profound impact on me."
good,Working at chipotle everything had to be done in a fast pace and clean manner. Customer service is the number one rule for chipotle so it was a really fun and friendly environment.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Employees are very welcoming with a sense of humor. Know how to interact with you. Makes time go by fast. Very sanitary and great habits of keeping clean and organized.
good,"During my time here, it was a wonderful experience, I know it was fast-paced and busy for my first time, I was able to develop needed skills in life but the pay was good, the most enjoyable part was the free food of course but everything else was great, I kept the workplace clean and relaxing for the customers, that's always a good feeling."
good,From the very first day I started at chipotle the managers were nothing but understanding. They really worked with me to make sure I knew what I was doing.
good,"I love it here, I just feel that my pay isn’t enough as far as the cost of living in my area but I’m hoping to advance quickly. Very fast paced but nice atmosphere"
good,I liked the culture around chipotle hence why I stayed longer than I anticipated. They ask a bit too much for what they pay you. They expect you to know some things on the top of your head. Memorizing things in short periods and expect you to know it.
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is the environment and the people I work with. Everyone is really friendly and we all treat each other like a family. We are always helping each other and giving advice on how to improve our restaurant as a whole.
good,I worked at chipotle for a year. When i first started i was very quiet and slow. Some people did not like me because i was very slow. As I continued to work there I became very quick and ended up becoming close friends with the people who did not like me the most in the beginning. I was always on the line and would train people. Everyone starts off slow but it was great to see how much better they get after a couple of days or maybe a month later.
good,"Tuve que dejar la compañía debido a asuntos personales en España."
good,"Chipotle is a very fast pace environment. They taught me how to manage angry, stressed customers. Hardest part of the job was dealing with multiple people at once. The management is better than most places. It is fun working here."
good,"Enjoyed working and meeting different people. Chipotle is very busy restaurant, but the people love it. It starts to get frustrating rolling big sloppy burritos and dealing with peoples satisfaction."
good,"Can get very busy during peak hours, which could make the job stressful at times. My coworkers made the job very enjoyable, we were able to work and have fun during busy periods."
good,"If you're lucky enough you will be employed in a store with a caring manager and co-workers who appreciate and care about you. Working at Chipotle can be a task; some days are a little more laid back while others you will be working non-stop for hours during your shift. The starting pay is good compared to most food service places, but if you're expecting annual or quarterly raises, you'll only get one if you want/have the time to advance in the company. I am a College student who works part-time and after almost two years at this company I haven't received any raises and I do not have the time to advance to management positions, so that is one downfall to the company if you're looking for part-time work. Also, depending on your store there will constantly be new hires, even if your store doesn't particularly need any, so they will probably take a majority of hours for training. Hours can be cut back tremendously for you in this case, while other weeks you might get more than usual. All stores are obviously different but these are my more personal experiences working here. They do give paid vacations but it is mostly for full-time employees (working 35-40 hours a week)  which I think sucks because every employee should have that benefit if you're working at least 20 hours a week, especially with a job that an be extremely demanding of your efforts. I won't lie, it can be a very stressful environment during peak times (12-2PM and 5-8PM)  but anyone who cares about this company can do it!"
good,"This job can get quite stressful at time since there is always costumers. The one thing I learned while working there was to always ask for help when you need it. Whether it be in the front, making the food, or working the cash register, it is more beneficial to everyone if you ask for help when it is necessary. This job is not difficult, but it will require you to work quickly."
good,"Job is easy but it's different everyday depending on sales. Being a manager is easy since you get promoted from within and they pay for your exam to be certified but some employees Will test your patience since you have to stay on top of some that don't wheel with a sense of urgency. You have to be energetic, upbeat and make sure you are not sick or you will be sent home and lose hours. Learn the brand have fun. Enjoy tasting all the food throughout the day for quality. Every store is what you make it they are all different, with all different personalities."
good,"Working here isn't too bad as a short term job, for long term you should probably go for management. If not then you shouldn't work there over a year. It can get very stressful."
good,Coming into chipotle I learned alot about food. The growing process was great and my management team took the time to make sure I had the proper skilling and training.
good,- Respecting the dress code by wearing the brand of chipotle as well just working with good awesome people who has a great attitude. I would recommend
good,"It isn't as laid back as it seems, because it is a food establishment you have to be very serious about washing your hands and keeping the area clean so you don't cross contaminate, they are really strict on how you portion your food and how fast you should be working. They have lots of handbooks that you have to go by if you ever prepare food or are making things in the kitchen or if you're cleaning an area. If you do work there make sure you're properly trained, the people are really nice though, and funny. The only thing I didn't like was having my work hours cut so short because we were overstaffed. I went from originally 4.5 hours to 3 hours or less, and I was only working for two days a week. I had hoped that since the pay was really nice that it would make up for the lack of hours I was scheduled to work but I noticed my friends were making more with a lesser wage because they were actually getting scheduled in to work more hours."
good,"A typical day at work has one prep food for the next day (Chicken and/or steak), washing dishes, cleaning back of house, and trash removal. I learned what makes people have a good attitude for the rest of the day, and I learned that one should ask oneself, ""What could I be doing?"". The managers were relaxed and very helpful. Hardest part of the job is sitting in the freezer, putting chicken pans. Most enjoyable part is having a clean kitchen."
good,The best part of this job is the culture that you get to be a part of. There are days where it's tough but you can always pull through with your team. Chipotle encourages promotion from within the company and that's how I made my way up all the way to general manager.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,My typical day at Chipotle requires restocking and dealing with customers and making sure they are always happy and getting them what they need in a short manner
good,"Chipotle was a great experience for me. My only reason for leaving was because it wasn't a full time job with more pay. I learned to work hard and efficiently under pressure. I learned how to work as a team and how everyone's role is important, no matter how small it may seem. The hardest part of the job was dealing with customers and meeting their specifications. Sometimes they would get upset about prices or if they do not feel that you portioned their food correctly. The most enjoyable part of this job, other the free meals, was working with good co-workers, who have fun together and enjoy each other's company."
good,"Excelente equipo de trabajo, muchas oportunidades para promoción, bonos laborales, buen ambiente laboral, excelente higiene y muy buen liderazgo."
good,I really enjoyed working at chipotle. I started off as a cashier and I also got to move around the kitchen as in get on the line to make bowls and burritos. Got to marinate the chicken and the steak for the opening crew and also kept dishes down through out my shift so that my crew wouldn't have to stay all night for closing.
good,Great company I progressed at it Avery quickly also a very fun environment to work in. I’ve worked there for a year and a half and every few months or so I learned something different.
good,"I’ve onky been working as a cashier here for about 2 weeks or so but I already have the feel for everything. It varies by store but I had 3 paid days of consecutive training by another cashier. I honestly don’t think that was enough for me but I got used to it. My trainer was extremely understanding and very friendly. All the crew members are extremely friendly and I love them all already. Being a cashier, I’m in charge of restocking and making sure the dining room is clean. All this + peak hours = hectic crazy mess. You’re not allowed to leave your station during peak hours so that means the dining room is becoming a mess but you can’t do anything about it. The workload can be extremelyyyyyy stressful and overwhelming but after awhile you can learn to manage it efficiently. My general manager is so great so I have no complaints on management! Overall, the atomsphere in the crew is amazing and makes me want to work but the workload can be hectic and stressful."
good,I had a good time with he people who worked at Chipotle. It was a fun place to be however at times It was fast pace but thats can always be a good thing.
good,Has great way of working with others. The hardest part of the job is nothing if you actually do what your supposed to and stick to yourself helping your team as much as you can the job is pretty easy.
good,"Good culture at Chipotle, management was awesome and was always on top of things. Great benefits, face-paced work environment made it a longer process learning the system, shadowing was the best source of learning here."
good,"Chipotle is my actual first real job. I had the opportunity to go to school, finish and still worked at chipotle with great hours for two years. I gained many skills and learned how to lead my team and myself. I work with a great team and I have so many great memories with the people I call my work family."
good,chipotle is a very good place to work at. we get a lot to learn here.the staff here is really friendly. everyone hepls each other with the stuff. clean anh hygienic place.
good,"Very fast paced time is always flying by but definitely way to stressful and competitive, depending on store some crew was very difficult to work with"
good,"Everyone works in sync at Chipotle. If one person fails everyone gets put down. Chipotle is a big cut throat place, you have to constantly give 100% of yourself to suceed. You get better at the job but it becomes hard on your body physically."
good,"Chipotle is very fast-paced; you'll never be bored! You can learn anything you want in the restaurant, at your pace. They have many learning tools to help you for each station. There are always opportunities to move up in the company."
good,"This is a fast paced environment where you can stand on your feet for several hours in a day.  Occasionally there can be a lot going on around you, especially if there are people talking behind you, getting orders from customers in front of you, people telling you things on either side and dishes being done.  The people are fun and willing to help make others better.  I learned how to multi task and talk with customers and help with their needs."
good,The amount of work that the back of house staff has in comparison to the front of house staff is largely disproportionate and if you're assigned to BOH it is unlikely you will get put in the front because you have to be trained specifically for that station. Management seems unwilling to take the labor cost of a certified trainer to train you for the front when they can just keep you in the back.
good,"I learned how to work under pressure thanks to Chipotle Mexican Grill, which I think is very important. I get along with all my managers which makes my shifts easier to manage. The hardest part about working here is that you HAVE to always be fast-paced, even when there's nobody in the store to order food. So make sure you're always full of energy! Overall, I love working at Chipotle. It built my patience and tolerance towards co-workers, managers, and customers."
good,"Chipotle is a great place to work, it is very flexible with my hours as a busy teenager. i get along well with my coworkers and everyone is really willing to help out."
good,Chipotle was the first job I really had. I started working there in 2000 and my time there was great. Chipotle devloped me to the person I am today. Great people great culture is why I stayed so long.
good,It's a very fast-paced job. It's also a great place to meet new people and gain experience. They make sure that you are comfortable and understand your job.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,While you work at chipotle guest experience is the key to customer but they also want their food done fast at the same time as being friendly. While working here for more than almost a year I gained a lot of experience that will help me throughout. Like being a leader while making food. Talking to the customers and making sure they have the right order.
good,everyone you work with becomes a family to you. its a very fast work enviorment but it will teach you skills that will help to your benifit. you would love to work here.
good,"Working a Chipotle is nice, it's not for everyone though. It's very busy from the moment the door opens till it closes. You can get easily stressed but at the same time it's fun to work there if you like high pressured environments. The culture behind chipotle is amazing and I love the high standards they hold for the company and its employee's. The hardest part of the job is the amount of time it takes up from your life, people tend to call out a lot so you end up getting called in a lot too. The most enjoyable part of the job is the people there and the amount of knowledge you learn."
good,"working at chipotle  was a great experience always stayed busy always made sure customers was always happy. Like meeting new people , love too train others."
good,"Chipotle was a great job for those who need a good job to start somewhere, it can be very fast paced but prepared many for a lot of obstacles thrown at them. It also definitely helps develop a good work ethic."
good,"The management at Chipotle was top notch, they were really great people. The people at Chipotle were great and I really felt like I worked on a team. I just wish I had gotten paid more. "
good,"An average shift at Chipotle was often busy and fast-paced, but after working there for about a year and a half, it got easier and more enjoyable. Getting to know regular customers and meeting all sorts of people everyday is something I will never forget. I learned real patience, how to perform above standards during rushes and other stressful situations, and overall excellent customer service. The management never lacked understanding or kindness. I would say the hardest part of the job would be difficult customers, but I have mastered the calmness and corrective actions it takes to handle such problems. The most enjoyable part is easily the friendships I have made with coworkers and customers."
good,Overall this is a very fast paced and up-tempo job. Every single day at peek their were customers non-stop. Very cultural and understanding workplace.
good,"Very good place to work. Everybody helps you. And everybody is trained the same way. And very nice managers, they will help you with everything that will help you improve everyday"
good,I worked more than one store. One particular store had some of the best management I have ever had. Overall the job itself was as expected. You make and serve safe and delicious food in a timely fashion.
good,"A typical work day is pretty fast pace and very busy , I was taught to check ok pretty much everything , the hardest part of the job is prepping and working the grill and the most enjoyable is the fresh food"
good,A typical day at work was very soothing and required maximum concentration because of the quick/fast tempo to the workplace. The main goal at my time working at the restaurant was to teach and educate further crew members into becoming the best possible contribution. The management was great offering tips and new experiences to the crew members whenever they were needed. The hardest part of the job was the fact of getting paid with a small salary.
good,"For the most part working for Chipotle is quite a task but all in all its a fun job to have. The job is fair and rewarding, competitive, fast paced and challenging. Brings new light to the term ""fast food""."
good,"A typical day at work includes preparing/serving food, cleaning work stations, and restocking product constantly throughout the shift. I learned how to multitask with multiple time sensitive issues consistently throughout the shift while working here. Management has a strong understanding of day-to-day goals and objectives, while effectively communicating that to the rest of the team. The culture is individual performance oriented, while there is support available from your crew members. The most difficult aspect of the job is effectively communicating with other team members during peak hours in order to effectively prepare and serve food. The most enjoyable part of the job is the the free employee meal provided with each shift that you work."
good,"During my time at Chipotle I learned a lot and grew a lot as an individual. I quickly became certified at all the positions that they offer crew members: Grill, Grill 2, Tortilla and salsa, Cash, Expo, and even takeout specialist. This taught me how to handle people at every type of interaction and environment. One of the hardest parts about the job was following the strict safety procedures, because while cooking or making food with a line of customers out the door we'd still have to wash or hands at the top of every hour while changing out sanitize buckets. Despite like not sounding very difficult, it slowed things down considerably, but thankfully we were taught ways to combat that and rotate people so things don't get bogged down. As for the greatest part about my job there, it would have to be the coworkers, because without them I wouldn't have stayed as long as I did."
good,"I would recommend for anyone, Chipotle is an amazing company with many options to go wherever you want. You work hard you'll easily get promoted aslong as you show up and do your job. Every chipotle starts higher than 9 dollars an hour."
good,"learned a lot made lifetime bonds and hd ""high standards"" burned in my brain. i use almost all of what i learned here in life and my job now and any other job i have had after chipotle. great team great moto!"
good,"Its a very cool workplace friendly employees and customers. There are some days where its very slow and you have time to prepare everything, then there are those days where its very busy and you run out of things a a lot"
good,"Working for chipotle was both the most stressful and rewarding job i ever had. I was able to jump on the management track and become a manager in less than a years time. The culture in chipotle is absolutley amazing and it inspires you to truly change the world. The managers i worked with were dedicated to my success and i felt an important part of the team. If you work hard and use the tools that are given to you, you can have a very rewarding career at chipotle"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Chipotle creates a great working environment and the managers care about what you are struggling with and they care deeply about you. The benefits were nice and the pay was better then okay. It is fast paste and you do need to have very good patience.
good,"When you go to work, you are greeted by every worker, the overall atmosphere is energetic and fast-paced. I learned how to manage my time and be more independent yet depend on others too. Chipotle is a lot of teamwork and communication between coworkers."
good,"Working at Chiptole was equivalent to Cooking 101 and Restaurateur courses. Its what made me get back into cooking professionally. I learned everything from knife skills, cooking rice, grilling, frying, food orders, food prep, and management. I also learned what and not to do in management. My managers were young, 23-24 at the time and had very immature ways and soon began to take advantage of lower management. They weren't interviewing people ambitiously causing myself and other lower level managers to work positions and manage. Even closing managers, resulting in me feeling overworked and taken advantage of."
good,Great experience. Lots of room for advancement. Strong company morals. Would recommend to work here. Loved management. Can make into a career. Great company.
good,"As a person with little work experience, Chipotle was a great job among other jobs that don't require degrees or relevant experience. It pays slightly better than similar jobs."
good,Working at Chipotle Mexican Grill is very rewarding. You learn many new skills and develop the ability to work with others in a fast-paced environment.
good,"Good place to work at, you need to be really ambitious and be a great worker , everything is great , only the raise , as manager you don’t get big raise , only a few cents more very 6 months. If you’re lucky a 50 cents raise a year."
good,"My work ethic improved after working at Chipotle. This company takes care of their employees, pay is great. Fun work environment at my location. I have no complaints other than it is a very labor intensive job and you will sweat!"
good,"It's a fun workplace with great management team and amazing coworkers, they allow everyone to have a say on whom to hire which is great. A review occurs every 6 months to see if you deserve a raise, more improvements = higher raise. It's great at first, but the longer you work the more annoying the job gets which you tend to lose passion with their standards but if you work with people you love, they make you want to not quit."
good,"The people that i worked with were amazing. Everyone is friendly and you'll get along with whoever you work with. Everything is pretty easy to do once you get taught on how to do it. It's not like they are gonna yell at you when you get something wrong either, they always make sure that they can just make you understand everything the easy and nice way."
good,"Great entry level job. Worked this through college and was able to work around school schedule. Awesome culture at Chipote, company really cares about its people. Compared to other places it doesn't feel corporate at all. Managers performances are based on empowerment, customer service, and team satisfaction (rather than sales). Pretty cool place to work but there's not much money in it. You wont get a real pay day until your a restaurateur GM."
good,Its a great fast paced environment. They have sick paid hours and offer tuition reimbursement. It is a good fast growing company and offers career opportunities.
good,The job was pretty simple and fast pace at rush hours. Team members were pretty cool. You can advance in the company pretty quick as long as you put in the necessary time and dedication.
good,"Chipotle had a friendly group of workers, but even though we were supposed to be let go at 11pm, we were often there cleaning until at least 1am, and if you stay past 12:30 am you work without pay."
good,Every employee in Chipotle respected each other & we all treated each other like family. There wasn't favoritism and the whole crew always was on task helping one another.
good,"Working for chipotle has been one of the best things that have happened to me. Some people would argue and say it's not a great place to work but to me the only explanation of that is that they were lazy, didn't try hard enough, or just wasn't cut out for the job. There are many benefits of you work hard and prove yourself. And none of the tasks/jobs are even that hard."
good,"In order to ensure advancement in the company, constant persistence is necessary, including constant inquiries into additional training and experience in other areas of work."
good,Working at Chipotle has been an absolute pleasure. I have worked there for over 2 years. Started off as a crew member and made my way up to management within a year. Got promoted to a Service manager before my two year mark. Chipotle has the right culture and attracts the right people with good work ethic.
good,I used to enjoy working g at chipotle but over the years it has changed into a place where I'm no longer as happy. It still serves as a happy place to some.
good,Was at chipotle for almost 4 years and I loved every second of it. Awesome environment and pretty good managers. Fast paced and very competitive for hours and advancement so it pushes you to be a very skilled worker.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Great place to work! Great place for advancement. Place depends on they type of managers you have and how much they care about the store. They care about their employees and work with your schedule. Employees are always pushed to put in effort and do their best. Higher pay than most other fast food places. Good coworkers as well.
good,It was great working here. So so much growth opportunities available in the company. Many of my coworkers began management training while I was there.
good,"I worked for Chipotle for 2 years and it was great although it was very physically strenuous! The management ranges for every location but they relatively have a great culture to produce great work and care about its employees. In my 2 years of working at Chipotle, I got about  4 raises which was great and they were always flexible with my schedule and times that I felt necessary to resign."
good,"id come in and my co workers would always yell welcome to chipotle."
good,"A friendly and easily going environment for employees and customers alike. Always trying to do the best possible for maximum efficiency, while caring for the workers well being. Flexible schedule and positive atmosphere."
good,It is a good company and a sense that you get promoted one show needed to be you get good benefits and working there changes people lies but also you're overworked and you don't get paid enough for what we do  chipotle changes something every other week making it hard for the crew members who work there your body might start hurting from all the cutting and bending over I will say after my two years of working there I'm over it
good,"Working at Chipotle was a lot of fun but the management sucks. A lot of people slack off and you may get stuck doing everything yourself. All food is made fresh every morning and if you open, you will be making the food for the day."
good,Advancements are there if you are making those around you better.  The more you advance the better the benefits. Culture plays a huge role in working there. Well at least that depends on your managers.
good,"Worked at Chipotle for about two years, had a very lovely tim, worked with very cool managers and coworkers, but after all that time received very little upward movement, asking for pay raise was like pulling teeth."
good,"On an average day with a regular flow of customers, one could expect to remain busy throughout the day. The work is sometimes stressful but very rewarding. Management is supportive and for the most part always willing to help out when the store gets busy."
good,"Working at Chipotle taught me a lot about giving a excellent customer service experience, making sure the customer was satisfied at any costs was very important to us. During my shift i was in charge of the lobby, making sure it was clean and organized. Sanitation was very big as well i think that was the hardest part about Chipotle is the amount of bleach we had to use to disinfect anything and everything. The management at Chipotle how ever was not the greatest, they were very unorganized and unprofessional. The most enjoyable thing there were the employees and the customers! Everybody respected one another."
good,you will work very hard and everything is fast pace. Be efficient and work well with other employees. You have to pay attention and be as helpful as you can with the costumers.
good,Chipotle is life. i eat it alomst every other week . i used to love working here . severing beautiful food to beautiful people. the management was great too.
good,They do have great job advancment. However when a new manager stepped in they basically cleaned house with employees and hired all new people. Plus they have a bad reputation for getting people sick with their food.
good,"It is fun working for Chipotle but management positions are stressful. Moving up is easy if you work hard for it, but the resources to help aren't always there."
good,"Being this was one of my longest jobs, I have learned so many different things about myself and the company itself. This knowledge will be beneficial for my next step in life."
good,"Day to day I would handle the cashier duties ( customer service, cleaning dining area, bathrooms, replenishing drink station) The hardest part of the job for me was feeling over worked while I was still getting an full time education."
good,"My typical day at work includes working on the line and serving customers through that. Sometimes I also work on the cash register. I have learned so much about people skills and how to handle very stressful situations. My managers currently are very supportive and helpful for when I have questions and encourage all of the crew members in the work place and out of work. Sometimes that culture can be a little tough, because not all of the crew communicates well. So there are times where we run out of food while customers are waiting there. The hardest part of the job would probably be the pressure and expectations people have for me, because I have been there for almost 3 years and that is longer than most people last. I do love my job and I do not regret for a second. The friendships I have made there I will have for the rest of my life."
good,Chipotle is a great company if you're all about advancing. If you're willing to thrive and learn new skills this is a great company for you. They're all about their culture and developing people and promoting within the company . I've been working at chipotle for three years and I've been promoted 3 times . There is always room to grow and new things to learn
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Chipotle was a great place to work at! I enjoyed it so much. I left due to college. The only downside was the schedule and how it was unorganized and management was a bit off but overall great place with good benefits!
good,"I loved everyone that I worked with. You need to be a real team player and have good communication skills. Loved working here. Loved learning so many different skills from customer service, to cash handling, to food prep, to food cooking."
good,"Great company to work for. They are pioneers in new age food safety standards and truly follow their Food With Integrity policy. Over 2,500 management opportunities open each year so those who put in work can reap the benefits."
good,I loved working with this company for the 3 years that I was there. The people really care for each other and are always willing to help each other out.
good,"its a great place to work, jefferson pointe just has bad management, benefits, free food, everything is so fresh there."
good,Great company to work for. Hardest part of the job was the amount of workload given to you with a low wage but the people culture is great. Teamwork is valued.
good,"Job is great, you definitely learn a lot. Very fast paced and upbeat environment. Sometimes felt like i was in high school again and not at work... good food though"
good,"As the third busiest chipotle in the nation, my normal day is very busy. I lead the front of the house and interact with customers to provide an excellent guest experience. I've learned some classic culinary skills, how to interact with customers, and how to manage a fully staffed crew. The workplace culture was very fun and connected. The most enjoyable part of my job is to interact with my crew."
good,Management team cares and speaks to you as a person but the shifts are long and pay is low at first. Takes some to be promoted but opportunity is there.
good,"Everyone always had a great attitude and always made it seem like being there was your second home. In addition, everyone that came through that door was always welcome with a ""Hi welcome"" and a ""Bye have a wonderful day/night""."
good,"I loved every day that I worked at Chipotle. You can't have a bad day when you know there's a free burrito coming later! The best part about the job is that your manager was once an entry-level employee, and has a level of understanding that can only come from experience."
good,The job used to be fun to work for. Then the co-CEO retired and they started making new rules. We used to have a vison: change the way people think about and eat fast food with a team of top performers empowered to achieve high standards. They removed that vison because of the new rule changes. The high standards portion of the restaurant was thrown out the window. What made us different from fast food is now being eliminated.
good,"I learned a lot about cooking, food safety, and preparation while employed here. The staff was very friendly and we worked well together."
good,When I first started working it was kind of hard but i got the hang of it pretty quick and it made it very fun for me. The hardest thing about working there was being grill (the one who cooks) which is what I am. It's challenging but it's fun at the same time. Everyone is friendly there and you don't get bored working.
good,"During the summer months, the lunch and dinner rushes were brutal. My location always seemed to be understaffed so those who were working, were forced to take more responsibilities. The management was very friendly and approachable, we were all good friends and often spent time together outside of work. I spent a lot of my time at the restaurant, and long days were very common."
good,The location that I have worked at had very good management. The whole team was organized and was clearly told of the expectations from each employee. Managers and employees were very understanding and focused.
good,its was a nice and fun averment to work in. I got to learn new things and gain expariance in new things. I also like how they understand peoples transpotation needs and are willing to work with you.
good,By far one of the fastest paced and fun places I've ever worked for. Not the most challenging job but you need to be able to learn things quickly and to be able to handle alot of people coming through the doors during peak hours.
good,"Chipotle is a fun place to work with a constantly happy environment. We believe in creating an excellent guest experience while maintaining professionalism and fun. A typical day consists of prepping all of our fresh ingredients, designing a deployment with every crew member's tasks for the day,ensuring money handling is done properly, and well as overseeing all store operations and making sure every customer leaves satisfied."
good,"Depending onnwhat type of store you work at it can be a good place to be at. I have currently transfered twice because of the distance from work to my home was far and also because I moved from New York City to Chicago. Managers can be very helpful guides for the most part. The job itself haves a heavy demand of cleaniness and tasks to be completed for each shift. Very fast paced, must be quick in your feet."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I have been working at chipotle for 3 months so far and it is a very simple job with a fairly flexible schedule depending on management. There is always roughly 7-9 workers in the restaurant daily and each person is automatically assigned to a station with each station having its own responsibilities and duties. It gets busy during lunch and dinner hours and it will feel like you're being overwhelmed during those times in the first couple weeks, but that feeling will quickly disappear as you work there more each day. Overall, it is an easy, quick-pace, and friendly environment to work at. Would recommend as a starting job for high school students."
good,"Being able to complete your tasks in an efficient manor in a reasonably quick amount of time. Maintaining a clean work station and being able to be personable with customers to finish their order. Communicated easily with coworkers to have a positive work environment. Customers, majority of the time, are pleasant people and thats what makes the job so easy and fun. Dealing with unpleasant customers was the most trying part of the job, but learning to have excellent customer service with upset patrons is what one can take away from this job."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle there's usually a line out the door! This is especially during peak hours which is when we're the busiest. So there is a constant need for clear communication, among the team and with the customers. During peak hours EVERYONE is on the floor including managers to insure the line is moving efficiently. We're constantly motivating, praising, elevating one another so no one's effort ever goes unnoticed, which makes your work environment more enjoyable. T"
good,"Working here I have seen the restaurant from the inside. Everything is clean and healthy; the company's standards are constantly stressed and enforced. This job is not for everyone, however.  Even having experience in the restaurant field, I find Chipotle to be extremely challenging. The pace is fast and the standards are high. While I agree with the high standards in food service, I am barely (if ever) able to keep up with the pace and provide adequate throughput. It is challenging, but also overwhelming and stressful (when I think of how disappointed I am that I can't keep up)."
good,"I definitely enjoyed my time working at Chipotle. I loved the culture of working my way up through the ranks and learning as well as teaching positions along the way. The CEO of the company is amazing and he has amazing award in place for all employees. It's a great culture and definitely changed the way I felt about food and the nutrition that I put in my body. The down side can be, like any restaurant business, your time is really not your own; especially as a manager. The culture is alive and addicting and you want to see your store and fellow employees succeed. "
good,"its a pretty cool job for the pay, you'll love it if you're a social person! for me personally it was just okay, i wasnt in a good place"
good,"Team work and empowerment are the culture of Chipotle. Not only does the crew welcome new employee in a hospital manner, but entegrity is instilled in all aspects of the job."
good,"Chipotle is a great place to work, especially for those who have a lot of energy and are interested in working on a team. It's hard work, but it pays off. Growing in the company is easy, and management can be rewarding. However, it can sometimes take more time than you wish it would, given that it is a restaurant, and the stress can become a little much at times. Overall, however, a great place to work."
good,Good work enviroment. Everyone worked as a team. Very organized and clean. Taught me alot about team work. Just was looking for a better salary.
good,"A typical day at work involves basic cleaning and making foods for the day and for the next shifts. "
good,"I loved working for Chipotle, it was a great place of employment and had a wonderful atmosphere. Everyone there was so supportive and worked to better you as an employee and person everyday. They truly care about their employees."
good,"Constantly Elevating and Teaching those around you so they can be better than the one training them. Co-Workers worked hard but we all know how to have fun and created those encouraging circumstances. Cleaning as you go. Proper hand washing procedures, along with challenges daily and changes to recipes, and procedures. Have to be able to ADAPT QUICKLY. Great hiring process and benefits. My favorite part would be going into the store with everyone having smiles on their faces and being able to teach and elevate those around me."
good,Great company for someone young and getting into the business. culture is excellent for teaching young managers and creating leaders
good,Enjoyed working there. coaching others to be better at the job role. Gained a lot of experience working there and most importantly management.

good,Chipotle was a great friendly workplace that communicates with all their workers and customers.The management was good they were well organized and outspoken about anything.
good,"Overall, this place is very fast-paced and nonstop work. Our managers are always pushing us to be top performers and the co-workers are nice and friendly. Our culture has given the whole team a family bond. By far, getting along with your team is the easiest part. The hardest part is that you almost never get to leave at your scheduled time."
good,"I love the environment, co-workers are caring and united. I have learned plenty of customer service ,thanks to this company and gained confidence within myself I'm truly grateful with this company for the opportunity given to me.."
good,Chipotle is a very great company to work for. It is extremely fun and the opportunities for growth are vast. It just becomes a routine after a while. After a while it take over and you have no personal life and it is only work all the time.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"the location i worked at was almost always very busy."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle for me varies between what job I was assigned to. I was a cashier, cook and line server. Prep was a big part of Chipotle because without it, we were not prepared for the day or even to open the store. Chipotle did encourage me to work harder and also leave personal feelings at home in order to get the job done.  The hardest days at Chipotle was when co-workers didn't work together as a team. Team work, to me, was the key to success to overcome anything when working there. I would say that the best times when working at Chipotle was when we celebrated our success as a team. For example, if we were down two or three people those were times we would come together as a team to help each other have a successful, stress free day."
good,"Chipotle is a good place to work , with good hygiene and quality of food, they respect you a lot as coworker, it's fun and relax work with them."
good,"always busy non stop that's what i loved the most. i learned that the company grows within there's opportunities always knocking for a crew that wants to b a manager of a store.The management was okay but they would argue so much among each other when it came to my general manager and apprentice , the co-workers were easy going and always kept a smile with me and they would bring food or snack for there shift team. the most enjoyable part of this jobs was when the birthday came the general manager would always buy cakes! but seriously it was just the fact that every time of the day/night there was something to do and never bored"
good,"Fast-paced, busy, caring, a bit hectic, quality, comfort, and lovely people. I learned how to maintain balance even in hectic times and how to prep/work with multiple food. Management was wonderful. They truly cared about the employees and our lives/problems. My co-workers were always very helpful. It was like a family. No one gossiped or put drama before their work. The hardest part was some of the physical stress. The most enjoyable part was working with people and making people's day even a bit better with my service."
good,"I absolutely loved working for this company, they strive to make sure you do your best and they WANT you to advance in their career."
good,one of the best places to work at! really nice people and its really an awesome environment! Teaches you how to work with others to achieve a certain goal.
good,"A typical day at work was awesome! I learned different ingredients and cooking methods. The managers are cool, my co-workers were fun to work with."
good,"I open or close the store managing shifts with 12 to 15 employees and manager under my supervision. I would make sure that costumers are getting an unique and extraordinary experience every single day. Make sure that we have done donations and fundraisers every three months. Deposits, cash counts and inventories in daily bases. Co-workers are really helpful and fun people to work. My favorite part of the day is to interact with the costumers and serving their food that particular way that they like. Even the food it's the same every day, we all have different ways to eat it."
good,Great company to work for. The opportunities are endless and everyone in the team is very fun to work with. Very fast pased environtment and great team work.
good,very busy and overwhelming at times but good job overall. coworkers all get along. managers care and are always helping crew.
good,"A typical work day at Chipotle Mexican Grill starts out with all different kinds of knowledge about the food your going to serve and prep for that day. I was always learning something new about our food and always raising my standards when it came to food quality and safety. The management I was taught by was always very educated and dedicated to developing all of there crew members and making sure everyone had equal opportunity to excel into management. Almost all of my co-workers were awesome to work with because Chipotle only hires people with 13 key characteristics that they look for. The most enjoyable part of that job for me was the food culture and how they  took pride in the meats and produced they sell, Its starts from where and how the animals are raised all the way to how the food is prepped before being put out to serve. The hardest part about working at Chipotle was meeting all the prep standards but when I finally accomplished it I felt like I could complete anything else any other job threw at me."
good,working here was kind of challenge I never thought chipotle was so much work until I became employed with them. management was pretty good they was always negotiable and looking to move up any associates my coworkers and I always work our hardest to please all customers on a daily basis.
good,"A typical day at work was coming in and opening up the restaurant.  I learned how to run every aspect of the restaurant.  I learned things like recruiting, writing schedules for the crew members, Doing audits for the restaurant and just the financial aspect of running a successful restaurant. Management was very rewarding because I was able to be a great example and leader for my crew members each and everyday! My coworkers were always eager to learn and get ahead in the company which made me job easy. The hardest part of my job was working more then twelve hours a day sometimes to make sure the restaurant ran smooth. The most enjoyable part of my job was being able to create amazing opportunity's for the crew members. By training them and motivating them it made them reach there biggest potential."
good,"I worked for Chipotle for 4 months and I loved every minute of it. Unfortunately, My life schedule didnt work so well with the job. I didnt like the fact that there were so many managers. To me, It comes off as hectic, Because one manager will tell you one thing, And another will tell you something completely different. It was often stressful. But overall,  A great work environment and great benefits."
good,I love working at chipotle it was a very good learning experience. they taught me a lot. everybody was so helping and nice. u really have to be a hard worker to keep up its so much to do with so  little time but everyone pulls together and make it a team project. no one is ever left behind
good,"My work experience at Chipotle was a great one for my first job. My managers were always there to help and were very understanding. I had a great crew who would help each other to keep our work place running smoothly. Chipotle is very dedicated to their vision of changing fast food and they make sure their crew members have that same dedication. The most enjoyable part of my job was my crew and interacting with the customers, the hardest part was my position (which was cashier) is responsible for making sure the dining room is clean and stocked at all times, the trash is taken out, and the bathrooms are cleaned and stocked. Thats a hard thing to keep up with at 7 months pregnant. Were I not, it would not be the hardest part."
good,"Awesome place to meet many people, as chipotle is always busy. And it gives you a chance to work and communicate effectively with your co-workers"
good,I like working with the people customers providing great service and working as a team to complete the daily task
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,We were never not doing something active in the workplace if I wasnt doing dishes I was cooking or helping the girls in the dinning room. The most enjoyable part was working with the customers to get there orders right an also the music in the back of the house. The hardest part was staying till about 2 am after my shift to deep clean the restuarnt.
good,"As soon as you walking in, you're on the move. It can be a little overwhelming if you don't have patience when it gets busy. Everyone helps each other out."
good,It can be fun most of the time. The non stop rushes can be very overwhelming. The closing workload is sometimes overwhelming as well. The co workers and customers are friendly.
good,"Every morning I would come in to work with a smile on my face because I know I wanted to provide the best customer service there was. When I worked at Chipotle I learned so much. I was exposed to learning their culture and also to be a top performer in every sense of the word. Daily, I would encounter a few disappointments but I was able to learn form them and move on. It takes courage to experience something that is not pleasant and yet knowing how to cope with it. Most of the co- workers there were good people to work with and there were others who tried their best to fit in. Over all, my experience there was remarkable. I learned a lot about the workplace and its functions."
good,"As a service manager I had lots of responsibilities but overall its a really great culture.  There is definetely room for advancement if you are interested in that.  I was lucky to work at a very busy location which was extremely fast paced and you were constantly doing a million things at once, but I love fast paced so it was great!"
good,"Work would usually consist of busy days with great customers. I learned to make burrito bowls, roll burritos and make the salsas. Some of the managers were amazing people. My co-workers were amazing. They were easy to get along with, made work fun and made everyone feel like they fit in or belonged. They were very welcoming. The hardest part of the job was rolling really big burritos but practice makes perfect. The most enjoyable part of the job was actually doing the job, being able to work with great people and customers."
good,"A typical day was usually come in wash your hands, do all the preparation work for that shift, do dishes in between needs of the grill or the serving line. Cleaning all the equipment all the time."
good,"Fun, hands on, busy, and unpredictable. Valuable 13 characteristic chart we had to follow by which made us all better workers to begin with. Our staff was a huge family and we all worked together to get things done."
good,"I've never worked for a company that cared so much about their employees! Chipotle provides incredible benefits. Anyone that's hired has to go to a crew interview first so that the crew is comfortable and gets along well with new employees, which creates an awesome work environment!"
good,"I would get at chipolte at time, I would make sure verything was in order and take payments from my costumers.I learn how be very fast and take payments from my costumers while cleasning the dinning room and other designated areas. Management was very hardworking and they would look out for our needs. My co-workers make the best working enviroment, and also they would help each other create a comfortable and productive work enviroment.The hardest part of this job is that is a very busy restaurant.The most enjoyable part of the job was all the employees and management."
good,Great management and excellent staff to be work with. Everyone showed a positive and professional attitude. I learned how to be a top performer. A top performer is a employee who shows up to work on time. Looks forward to coming to work and learning new things
good,"Great family oriented environment, so much opportunity for advancement."
good,"A typical day at work includes the co workers working togother to create a great envirement for our cutomers.  By working at chipotle i have learned to be a quick and energetic person who enjoys giving quality service in all aspects of my work place.  The managers are super friendly and make everyone come togother to enjoy what they are doing and become comfortable with eachother.  My co-workers are great they are always focused and dedicted to what it is they are doing and they all care for one another.  The hardest part of my job would be keeping up with the lobby during our huge rush, but even that isnt too bad.  The most enjoyable part of my job is being able to spend time with cool people, by that i mean not only my co- workers but our loyal customers."
good,"Taking customers orders, ringing up transactions, multitasking between working the line, and maintaining cleanliness of the store"
good,great advancement great values fun shifts very clean and all natural
good,People would enjoy working there because it is somewhere where you can get your full hrs. Co- workers help each other out. The hardest part of the job is nothing! It has a great atmosphere.
good,"One of the best places I have ever worked. I would love to stay except I do not make enough money, and that's not changing anytime soon. Other than that, perfect!"
good,Chipotle is an amazing place to work. It isn't very time consuming and you get to get a part of the restaurant experience on your side. It's definitely a place to work when you wanna start off. It gives you opportunity to move up as well.
good,i love me some chipotle..it was a great place to advance..
good,"Pretty much mornings are spent prepping food for the day, and I actually just started closing the store recently and its difficult for just an hour to close the lobby AND patio while trying to clean the place thoroughly like management wants it."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,- Prep food that will be needed for the first shift. Always served fresh.
good,"I clock in for work, wash my hands. Prepare food as listed on the recipe guide. Wash dishes and clean up work area. I learned how to make all the food and how to steel a knife, work the line. The management was great, they always came in with energy. The co-workers are the backbone of the store. they come in early and leave late. They keep a smile and is quick to make your food with care. The hardest thing is to remember the kids menu. The most enjoyable part of work is just coming and knowing that you have people that cares about you and will help you out when you need it."
good,"When I applied to Chipotle, I knew little about its food culture and its mission of changing the way people eat and think about fast food. I found out rather quickly, however, under the guidance of managers and crew members who have truly invested their entire beings in the company. Over the past year, I too have fallen in with the Chipotle story. I share the company's belief that a customer's expectation of food quality should never be lowered just because the restaurant presents itself as a fast food joint. Chipotle cares very deeply about the food it serves to its faithful customers-- which is demonstrated in its practices of sourcing food locally and using only naturally-raised meat. Remarkably, if you sit down with someone who works or has worked at a Chipotle, you will find that he or she cares just as much about eating really GOOD, natural food. Working at Chipotle is fast-paced and never easy, especially during peak hours, but the sense of accomplishment one gets from clearing a lunch line or beating a throughput goal, knowing that food quality was never compromised for the sake of speed, is invaluable. Chipotle does more than keep our stomachs full and happy; it makes us increasingly aware of how much better fast food can be when it is made by unbending people with high standards."
good,I love their integrity at the company and they even let you build your own schedule when I started there in 2015. Don’t have too much of benefits but they do at least care for you if something with your family or yourself happens.
good,Working here I learned a lot about food and food safety. It is what I say helped me become a good cook. With that being said the pay could have been more for what I was doing.
good,Fun and challenging place to work. I have learned a lot like being a kitchen manager and working as a team. The hardest part is not everyone pulls the same weight. I often work harder than others.
good,"Not only was this job fun, but it had very distinct steps in order to move up in the company. If you were making your goals, providing excellent customer service, and delivering healthy food, you could easily move up."
good,The one thing I would like to say at chipotle is that the people there go above and beyond for the customer. I feel the best part of working at chipotle is the people there make you feel at home the always have your back and make the work enjoyable.
good,Honestly chipotle was one of my favorite places I’ve ever worked. My coworkers were awesome. The work was relatively easy. And there wasn’t a lot of drama
good,Several advancement opportunities . Fun and high energy environment. Can be fast paced but have excellent management on sight to help with the daily hustle.
good,This job is great with helping people and helping the employees move on with life. The employees get along and it’s a family friendly place to be at. Had a lot of great benefits
good,The job had a very fun and exciting culture and the pace of the work was fast paced. The customers would come daily and In big numbers at times which was overwhelming at times but was still fun
good,"Chipotle is great company, they have great customers services, and the food is also fresh and well prepare. I would recommend Chipotle to anyone for eating place and also for working."
good,"The job seems a lot at first as it's a chain restaurant so there's a lot of rules. But once you're trained you realize it's not that bad. It's not a bad job, just expect to work a lot."
good,"I loved the job I did, everyone was do nice and welcoming. Management never lasted long and was a constant struggl, there would be months without a GM and work began to be overwhelming."
good,"This is a fast-paced work environment with friendly hard-working crew members and good management. I learned all crew member positions, such as cook, cashier, busboy, and burrito/food maker within the matter of several months."
good,"Chipotle is a great place to work! Coworkers and management make you feel welcome and a part of the team. Very fast paced, but a positive environment. Great opportunities for advancement and overall great management. They are very considerate and understanding of employee needs."
good,"Chipotle is a highly competitive restaurant chain that drives its employees to execute the highest of standards in food safety, excellent food preparation, and hospitality. Its focus of accountability and high standards are what drive the success of each restaurant. However, it can be daunting to execute day to day and monthly metric goals as there are more than enough audits in seemingly every aspect of the business. It is what makes this company great but also a challenge. Working as a crew member is a great introduction to knowledge of food preparation and hard work. Any management position introduces a plethora of opportunities to learn business management."
good,You do onsistent tasks along side your teammates. Maintain your level of professioncy and always smile at customers and ask about their day. You have to be quick because the lines get long at times.
good,The management is very young and needed more training. My coworker we're all friends and UK students who all needed to be trained customers service. Other then that it was a great place to work.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"It’s a great place but can be overwhelming and stressful, you have to be on your toes and know all your rules, which are a lot. There are so many regulations and Dos and Donts, like I mean a lot! But pay is great, hours can be great and flexible, very easy to advance also not to meantion the Co gives back, like free meals when you’re working and they pay for your schooling. Crew members are really chill and fun, we work as a team and it’s a great place but if you get too stressed easily, probably not the right job for you."
good,"Its just not for me. It isnt my lifestyle. Its a fun place to work for though. Working there is fast pace, very competitive, and very clean. Ive never seen a bug there. Maybe a bird but they can come in through the door. If you want to work there; be fast pace and confident."
good,"Stocking the cash register, utilities in the soda area, cleaning, smiling and being kind to everyone including employees. Everyone took a liking to me!"
good,"Despite some of the higher up managers that weren't the greatest to work with, the team I had was absolutely amazing and always worked so hard, came in on time, and showed me what its like to be apart of a family."
good,Good hours and benefits. Cowokers were great and management was good. It's a place where you can definitely advance. Good place to make money and learn new skills.
good,"Chipotle is a friendly place to work along side with a team. Greeting people in is always a requirement with a smile. I would work in a fast paced environment grilling food, cleaning dishes, and greeting customers in."
good,"I worked at Chipotle for part of my college career, and I have a lot of great memories from working there. It was competitive because we were pursuing a status of being a top notch Chipotle Restaurant. This made all the employees have a fun but yet competitive atmosphere because with being ranked a top notch restaurant came multiple promotions and pay raises."
good,"I love working at Chipotle, the benefits are amazing, and the coworkers are great too. Management is always willing to work with you with your schedule. I love the high-paced environment and seeing people's smiles when they know that their food is going to be amazing."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle would be simply clocking in, getting in the right uniform (apron, gloves and hat), then referencing the sheet of paper that addressed each of the employee's stations for the day. My typical duty was the Takeout Specialist in training which allowed me to manage online orders and catering orders. If the day was slow, I would also help prepare any salsas or marinate meats to make sure we were always ahead. My most enjoyable moment at Chipotle would be the ""Bogo Nights"" when customers would come in all excited about the wonderful deal they are going to get. The night would become very busy and laughter filled the air making my shift run smoothly even if food began to run low. The hardest part of the job would have had to been the lack of employees on busy nights. When you have a line starting to get longer and there are only a few employees working, the shift seems very long and very stressful."
good,"Walking into Chipotle is a learning experience, from the people to the employees and the work. Some days seem busier than others, but with the right crew and management and the right attitude it can be fun! ive been in all aspects of the restaurant and the hardest part can be closing at times. especially if your understaffed and its busy. They ask a lot of work at night. But a clean safe environment is Most important!"
good,"I would come into work, everyone has smiles on their faces ready to work. If someone was not feeling up to the job that certain day, they would go home and we would get coverage. I start early in the morning, preparing safe and delicious food for my customers. 10:45 comes around the corner and we unlock the door. From 11-3 its busy. I have the responsibility of cooking and serving all of the food.  "
good,Chipotle is a great place to work and has increased my management skills and knowledge. I love the people I work with and enjoy the daily challenges the job can bring.
good,I really liked working at chipotle and I would definitely recommend the job for anymore who is a hard worker. When you work at chipotle you work as a team but you are also given credit for your individual work. You will make lifetime friends and gain great skills.
good,"Chipotle Mexican Grill is a fun,and fast paced work environment. I work with great coworkers, and managers. The general manager could use some more training."
good,"I enjoyed working here but it was not the career for me, I wanted to do something more ahands in the had nothing to do with food business. although everything was fair and I had no complaints I decided working there is no longer a good thing for me."
good,I loved chipotle. It was never a day we didn't have a line out the door and had to get 30-40 people in and out in a matter of 10-20 minutes no later. I can say this was the best job I've worked at that has challenged me. Its fast keeps you on your feet your always hands on.  If your looking for competition go for chipotle.
good,"Mixed diversity with friendly employees. All around preferable job for both rising in the ranks or a steady job. Managers know what they are doing, and help teach when needed."
good,"I enjoyed working there, but unfortunately their hours were not well suited for me as a student. However, if you are looking for a great place to work and are up to the  challenge I encourage you to work there. You'll really enjoy it!"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,7-hour shifts were usual and fast-paced. A perk is that we had paid breaks and we could get the food during our break for free. The hardest part of the job was keeping your cool when customers got difficult.
good,This job can be anxiety inducing just because it's such a high volume location. There are wonderful managers in place that make sure their employees are being treated correctly and provide encouragement. The managers are also very flexible with scheduling.
good,"very great place to work, very great staff. management is awesome, they want you to be great and quick with everything you do. customers are great and consistent. challenges you to be better and overall just a great place to work at."
good,Never had any problems with the employees or management. Really effective hiring process. Opportunities for growth as an employee. Very organized work tasks
good,A typical day at work was pretty busy. I would get to work and get put to work right away. I have learned to be very patient with customers who didn't get what they wanted.
good,"Morning's were very busy during lunch my duties as Prep Cook where to blanch vegetables, dice onion's & bell pepper's, and tenderize meat then wash dishes."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle begins with preparing for opening. Cooking food, setting up the line, and taking temperatures. Then comes the fun part, serving the customers and working with the cashier and cook to get all orders out hot and ready. Management will be different at each store, but at mine, my managers were awesome. They were one of the crew, they still did their jobs, but they took care of us all. Chipotle has an upbeat vibe while you're working, there's music constantly and other than rush hours can be pretty relaxing. The hardest part would be learning the menu at first, but once you got that down you should be able to do the rest easily. The best part is the coworkers, oh and the free food of course."
good,"Fast paced"
good,"Every crew member has a different and specific role in the team: Line, Cashier, Grill or Prep. It's different for each role depending on what shift you come in as: Opening, Mid-Shift, or Closing. For me, the management was a bit rough/sloppy at first but it changed when I got a new manager and now the store has progressed. The crew I was around was always supportive and helped everyone out."
good,I learned how to work with team all together and how to achieve mutual goals. The management team was quite helpful and motivate you in tough times. The most enjoyable part of job is to cook food and deliver outside while listening to music.
good,"It's a high energy work environment with amazing people! Management is great and fair, they always try there best to work things out for you. Workplace culture, at my chipotle, was very relaxed."
good,"I started working at Chipotle March 2017. It is definitely a place where you will be elevated, as well as inspire others in the work place. I enjoy majority of the crew members that I work with. Managers are really great when it comes to be involved in the workplace, rather than just watching everyone else do the extra work. Schedule was a bit stressful, but they are very accommodating with people going to school."
good,"The stressful part of the job depends solely on the position. I would still recommend becoming a crew member of chipotle but understand if you are short staffed and or running behind you need to catch up or you'll most definitely get stress out when a rush comes in and you have almost no food to serve. "
good,Chipotle takes great pride in providing their costumers with good quality food and experience. You are expected to learn and apply your skills everyday
good,flexible shifts and a great starting wage. it is a great part time job that provides help with paying for school. it is also easy to move up in the company if you put the work into it.
good,"I usually worked a morning to afternoon shift, but almost always stayed for a few extra hours because working there was so much fun. i even worked a few double shifts opening the store to closing it up. Joking and laughing with your colleagues is encouraged so long as it doesnt interrupt the flow of business (throughput) Hardest parts of the job is usually when theres a certain food item that has been sold out. The solutions are usually what gets a little tricky, whether its telling 50+ customers they dont have their favorite item, or having to drive 10 miles to the next chipotle so we can borrow a few of some of theirs."
good,"I like working there Managers, Co-Worker, Customers are great. I love to meet new people. But yes some customers will upset at time so it gets frausted at time. Then some of your Managers and Team member show you all different ways to do things and at the end of the day its still not right to them. That's gets upsetting as well"
good,My first experience at chipotle was the way people work hard! I'm hard worker but over there must of the time is stressful . I like the way people do cleaning and very fast my best experience is the way the clean and the was fast...
good,"a typical day at Chipotle consist on restocking, taking food temperatures, maintaining a clean dining area, prepping food for the next day or shift. I learned how to work in a really fast paced environment. Management took pride and ensuring that food safety laws weren't being violated and  ensuring everyone is doing their task fast and correctly. Chipotle was very diverse with people of all ages and nationality. The hardest part of the job was dealing with evening rushes an staying on top of restocking the line during a rush. The most enjoyable part was free chipotle, great leaders and everyone was helpful when i needed help the most. fast and efficient training"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Great management and the managers care about you and want to see you succeed. The other crew members are always helping you even if it does not call for them to help you in their prep for the day which is extremely nice to have true team work.
good,Hard part of the day was rush hour. It can get very busy but very friendly community and work staff to be around. Very clean and food is great. Staff and management is very approving.
good,"Chipotle strongly believes in promoting from within, you can grow with the company and learn a lot in general if you are willing to put forth the effort, hard work and dedication"
good,Working at chipotle is a very fast-paced job. Be prepared to handle many things at once. The benefit of this job is working with awesome people and you are encouraged to move up positions.
good,"as a morning crew member, i got to prepare a lot of the food for the day a couple hours before we opened, i learned a lot about handling food and making food and following recipes closely, management was awesome and pretty understanding most of the time, the lunch and dinner rushes were extremely difficult to get through, but all my coworkers were super awesome and really great to work with"
good,"A typical day spent here would be serving customers, cleaning up your area, and just being positive. I learned how to prep and cook food, learn how to cashier, and properly clean and sanitize everything. I got along well with management, they were always there when I had questions and trained me properly. The hardest part of the job is having to give your 100% all the time. Chipotle strives to be their best at all times and many times if a person is slacking they are let go, but overall being my best 100% of the time taught me discipline and showed me that I can overcome anything with hard work. The most enjoyable part of the job was all the skills I acquired, the people I worked with, and the food."
good,"Everyone got benefits, paid breaks, and hours due to availability. Throughout my Chipotle career, there was constant change of management due to stress and a lot of new hires. It was a challenge, but worth while being in college."
good,I enjoyed my time at Chipotle and I was able to overcome many personal challenges using the things that I learned specifically from Chipotle's training model.
good,"Awesome place for a first job, have good benefits, great opportunity for growth, somewhat difficult work on grill and prep but still paid the same as easier jobs that are done, common for mangers to play favorites."
good,"I enjoy the family we have as a crew. Management is caring. Cross trained. Typically busy, can be stressful. Hard on busy days. Friendly work culture."
good,"Fun atmosphere and cool people. Slight issue with management, but that has since changed and been fixed.  Make sure you get your training and ask questions, as it may be fast paced, but it is definitely fun and easily accomplished work that is rewarding in the end! I still use the recipes at home for dinners!"
good,"The initial training was quick but thorough which allows new hires to start working quick. All jobs are fast paced but each one has a system that, if the team does their assigned roles properly and managers are competent, allows for the fast pace to work smoothly."
good,Prep all the food that will be used that day and get everything nice and clean. My co workers are friendly and vibrate which makes the shift more enjoyable.
good,The company focuses on food safety and its culture. Managers should know that they have a wide range of responsibilities = can get overwhelming at times.
good,It is a demanding job only if you're working in the kitchen or on the line during peak hour. Other than that it is a rewarding job with a free meal every day that you work.
good,"Chipotle works to make sure they have happy employees. They pay higher then most quick-service restaurants, and there are constant opportunities to move up within the company. The atmosphere, crew, and managers are always friendly and empowering. Chipotle is a great place to work if you are an entry level hard worker that is looking for a long term job to move up in."
good,Loved it! Moved up fairly quickly. I was trained very efficiently so that I am able to work every station within the establishment. Management was a little young but the environment was good.
good,You're work ethic is important and being in a team of 30 at a realitivly simple shop allows great room for advancement and delegation practices. Work hard and have fun!
good,I loved the people I worked with to death and had complete respect for the company. My only woes were that I feel that you were slightly underpaid but since they have lots of room for advancement and are always looking for managers at least in my experience its pretty easy to overlook that. The job itself was insanely face paced and  you have to focus on multiple thing at once and they are constantly striving to make you a better worker. However it was definitely worth it.
good,"I love working here! The culture here is so down to earth. I have made so many friends here and a shift is actually enjoyable. Management makes sure that workers are keeping the restaurant and food at high standards. I have been a worker on the line as well as working on the back of house. Whenever you need help, someone has got your back! Plus the starting pay beats any other place. The only bad thing is that things are constantly changing. New policies will be put in place and then changed again not much longer."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Once you get used to the place it feels like home. the things that they teach you not only apply within the store but also in your everyday life. The culture is interesting and the customers love everything about it. It makes you really believe in the things that you're selling
good,"I worked weekends and it fit to my school schedule perfectly. Manager always knew what they were doing and had an answer for everything. All employees followed procedures and repetitive techniques were used to keep the vision of the restaurant strong. I loved working there!"
good,Plenty of room for advancement and a fun work environment. You learn a lot about prepping and gain strong knife skills for anyone interested in cooking. Time management is stressed and taught here.
good,You work hard for the benefits and I feel like you are paid well for a food industry. After working there for months it began to take its toll on my body and constantly being tired (worked prep) The only reason I am looking for a new job is to utilize my degree and advance in the world.
good,"My time with Chipotle was an amazing opportunity to learn more about food culture and techniques. The management was always enthusiastic about training and development, while challenging us to do great work and have a fun time doing it."
good,"If your the type of person who enjoys fast paced and constant direction then this is the place to work. Chipotle offers tons of benifts but of course you must be able to offer a great performance every day. The staff is great and if your management team is strong and has the knowledge then you pretty much have landed a career. I would recommend Chipotle to anyone, everything done their is self explanatory and nothing isn't possible at Chipotle."
good,"Starting there with the crew and management at the time was great. Our chemistry was unbelievable, we were able to make quotas that were expected, and get all our duties finished in a timely manner. Once corporate wanted to get involved the team moral went down because they put unnecessary pressure on us."
good,"Chipotle was a fun enviorment to work in and you get to make somebody better everyday. It's a little stressful and fast moving but, you get a great feeling afterwards when your done. My most enjoyable part was working with my crew. The hardest part of the job was keeping the store at 101 percent clean."
good,"I had a great time in my two years at Chiptole. The companys vision an mission are unlike any in the industry. On top of that they really have a way of inspiring people and getting you to belive in yourself like never before. My favorite part about working for Chiptole was that we constatnly try to not only make ourselfs better but every one else we work with. When the culture is in place it truely makes an unforgettable experince for not only the guests but the crew as well. I strongly reccomend people, especially at entry level to apply to Chiptole. Great opportunitly to move up and develop real world skills quick."
good,"Your always have something to do so you never just standing around, i learned everything i needed to learn to become a cashier at chipotle and more, my management is always on top of everything and the same as my co-workers, the hardest part o the job is when there is peak, which is when rush hour comes in, and the most enjoyable is when we joke around when we can."
good,"Chipotle is an amazing place to work. It's a family environment and everyone is friendly. It's a great company to work with and has great benefits with pay, school, and health benefits. The managers were always supportive and the co- workers were like brothers and sisters. The easiest part was coming to work and putting a smile on customers faces but the hardest part was trying to keep up with the fast pace of the restaurant but it's all worth it. I learned about customer service, how to cook amazing food, great communication skills and how to be a great crew member to an amazing team"
good,"Chipotle is founded on a culture of high standards and top quality crew members, and probably one of the best ""fast food"" places or even one of the best part-time jobs you could have. Chipotle is full of team players who care about you and want to optimize the Chipotle experience for not only for the customers, but for team members as well. Each Chipotle crew is like a family. Chipotle does so well because everyone is so in-tune and supportive of one another. Chipotle is a very popular eating spot, so your hours can be intense and fast-paced, but as long as you have your team members with you supporting you, you know everything is going to be okay and hundreds or thousands of customers are going to leave having a great eating experience. Chipotle also offers good pay and benefits, and you get an entire free meal every time you work (and 50% off on days you're not working)."
good,Management team was enthusiastic and fun to work with. Crew was all about teamwork. Each store had a goal. Very clean store
good,"Typical day of work was taking a 20 minute lunch break before starting your work. I learned several things like frying chips, serving portions of food, cleaning, etc. The management was very helpful and cared about our opinions. The co-workers were great! They were very kind and generous helping me out in the beginning. The hardest part of the job was pleasing some customers. The most enjoyable part was the staff."
good,"What you give is what you get at Chipotle.  If there are any problems there are easy ways to fix them and there are lots of opportunities to move up. As a crew member you help costumers, prep food and clean as you go.  On the job you learn recipes, portioning, costumer service, team work and communication.  The management is good and makes you feel needed.  The co-workers are nice people, easy-going and friendly.  The hardest part of the job is during a rush in any part of the store but it's also the most enjoyable if you like fast paced things."
good,"On an average day I come in do prep or do grill work. I either close or open."
good,"learned new things everyday"
good,It was an enjoyable work place. I never went into work upset about having to work there. Never had a bad experience working there.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Usually a busy day coming in to work. Like most fast food restaurants, lunch and dinner times are the busiest. Learned full customer service and communication. Some of Chipotle very useful marketing techniques through the food industry. Hardest part would be to keep up it high standards when you begin working there. But with the right management, the workload is surprisingly satisfactory."
good,"Fantastic place to work! The people are absolutely amazing to work with. The managers are great and care about you, your life and goals. Great family environment."
good,"Amazing crew members, supportive management but could work on caring more about how crew members learns and develop to a farther point than just a chat, but actually applying the crew feedback for themselves. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my coworkers and learning from them but also becoming almost like family."
good,"My time at Chipotle was split between two different managers, and there was a definite shift in work atmosphere and policy with the change. I loved it at first, I gained a lot of wonderful experience, everyone was accommodating and the general manager was great. Things were much different come the new manager - the entire atmosphere changed, and I really no longer enjoyed the company. So really, it depends  a lot on your boss"
good,Chipotle is a great place to work with many advancement opportunities. I really don't have any complaints about working there. I'm seeking something different other than fast food.
good,"Its a very fast paced work enviorment, and business. I learned great customer service and people skills, food safety and prep. All of my coworkers we treated we equal respect."
good,"Working in teams is great. Learned many skills in the kitchen. Management was cool. Coworkers were all motivated, keeping spirits high even on the gloomiest of days. Hardest part of the job was agreeing with management all the time. Very understanding when it comes to sudden days off."
good,"Chipotle is one of the hardest companies I have worked for, but is one of the greatest I have worked for.  Great Company, can take you far."
good,"Chipotle it is a hard-working job, they made you do a lot for only $9 an hour. A typical day at work was usually busy, from managers to staff always slacking and have to deal with very rude customers. The management varies, some managers were really cool and some were not meant for the job. All of the co-workers were awesome, I met amazing friends there they were the reason why I enjoyed my job! The opportunities were great"
good,Everyone there was always in a good mood and was upbeat. There was always someone willing to help you without having to ask them. The management team was willing to show you new things and wanted everyone to be the best they could be.
good,An Normal day is having fun while you work. Everyone is like one big family. Learn more about food there than i knew my whole life
good,"A typical day at work is prepping/marinating meats. Then dishes for 2 hours/ grill work. Then break, more dishes, then floors & walls, & filters then close."
good,"At Chipotle we would work face to face with the customers, basically serving the food of there choice. I learned how to work in a fast paste and get everything done at the right time. My co-workers were fun, helpful, and hardworking people. The hardest part in Chipotle was probably having to switch out foods while trying to handle customers. Although I am very great at multi-tasking trying to do everything at once, helping the customers, and trying to keep a fast paste sometimes gets stressful. Besides that I enjoyed having to prep the food. I used to always get compliments from customers which had me leaving with a smile in my face."
good,a typical day at work was pretty fast paced but manageable. the management team was very understanding and patient. my co-workers are what motivated me to keep up even when i wasnt feeling up to the task. the hardest part was dealing with customers and the most enjoyable part was preparing the food
good,"Different from all other Chipotle's in New Jersey, this store is the busiest in the state, even on slow days such as mondays and sundays. Over all the Chipotle standard has taught me a wider vision in the food industry and team work. This store might be the busiest but it is also one of the best places to make good friends."
good,"Great environment to work in, great culture. They truly care about their employees well-being, as well as providing amazing customer service."
good,"It was always fun to come to work. Everyday started slow on register, but the same customers would come in, and they'd eventually start coming in because they became my friends as well. I learned how to have fun and get work done at the same time. Management was awesome! They were nice, motivating, encouraging, and I truly felt they wanted to see the best for me and the other co-workers. The co-workers were really understanding and encouraging as well. I looked forward to going to work. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with rush hour and also dealing with impatient customers. The most enjoyable part of the job was coming into work everyday knowing you'd make someone's day a little bit brighter. Plus work was fun there, it was always exciting waking up to work."
good,"I usually worked the line or prepared the food while following strict guidelines for health and safety purposes. I learned a lot about cooking, and preparing dishes. Management was pretty good. Co-workers were friendly. The hardest part of the job I would say was the scheduling because at the time I wasn't an online student but a commuting one. The most enjoyable part of the job was free lunches."
good,"Responsibilities "
good,"Chipotle was a great place that I will always remember. I learned much more than just the industry it self, I went in depth with their entire team of restauranteur and their views on the long run individually."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Most days working at Chipotle go well and I have fun. I get along well with everyone I work with and I receive an adequate amount of hours to work. I've learned how to manage time more sufficiently as well as how to work under pressure. The management is fine, but at times frustrating. The hardest part about my job at Chipotle would have to be keeping up with the amount of customers on certain days and not getting too overwhelmed. I do however enjoy being in the positive environment Chipotle has and knowing that the food served is organic and fresh."
good,Going to work everyday is fun. The employees and managers are very friendly.
good,"The management is one of the best I've ever seen. They create and family type environment that is fun and inviting. The job can be stressful at times, but most of the time is fun. The best part of working her is that you are constantly learning new things and there is always chances for advancement."
good,"A typical day includes working on the line and serving food to customers, or doing food prep/cleaning"
good,a new thing everyday. couldn't learn Spanish so they fired me. that's one con.
good,"The only bad thing about Chipotle is that I decided to leave. I have never worked for a company that I can honestly say I have never had a bad experience. The great thing is that promote strictly from within, so for myself starting as a prep cook I was able to move into management within two months!!! I loved the culture they had of a fresh take on fast food, which it was. I was trained very well by my management team, so we'll that I was promoted twice with 6 months. Overall wonderful company"
good,"I love working with this company ,great working crew and manegment"
good,I was a student when working at Chipotle and there were very flexible with my schedule. The environment at the job was great and the management team always taught me new skills. I was able to pass on these skills and felt empowered.
good,Not only is it a great place to learn your people skills but who doesn’t want to eat free chipotle? Haha I enjoy the overall experience of working here for the simple fact that most the time the energy in most chipotles is lively it feels modernized and fun working here and again the people skills you can gain from working here is amazing.
good,Great company that allowed me work flexible hours. I had good support from managers to grow into my role. I loved the friendly staff and regular customers who come in.
good,It was a great company to work  The people working there are fun and they like to get the job done right. Everyone there helped each other get the job done
good,"Not much to say, but they have good benefits even though I wasn't there long. Frying chips and taco was my favorite part of the day I might add, but being on the line kinda sucked of course."
good,The management at Chipotle was terrible I didn't like that the management would allow workers to talk about their sexal actives at work the head manager was barely there I really didn't like that and the workers were all click up in a croup like high school that was terrible.
good,"Nice environment. Friendly people. They gave you free lunches and Health benefits, but I did not get near enough hours to be able to provide for myself or pay my bills."
good,"Chipotle was my first job, I started there about a week after I had turned 16! I played sports and I was still in school, the manager worked with my schedule and I still got plenty of hours. Chipotle was like a family, everyone was close and we all worked together. The hardest part about the job was it would get very very busy so you have to learn to pick up your pace when need be. "
good,"Everyone loves Chipotle, so it's typically pretty busy. I work at the highest-volume location in my patch. It has made me a faster thinker and better organizer. Can be overwhelming sometimes, but still a pretty fun place to work."
good,Cant really speak to bad on Chioptle. Had an ok time workibg here. Sometimes management is a pain but I really learned alot as my first job. Room for growth
good,"Chipotle was great i learned a lot as a kitchen skills, help me undertands people needs and grow mu self as a person."
good,"I have a busy day at work usually, I’ve learned a lot about people of all kinds and how to deal with them. The management at my job is very proactive always striving for excellent guest experience. The hardest part of the job is getting through a shift with a short staff. It’s a little hard at first but once you’ve found a way to make it work it gets easier. The thing i have enjoyed most about this job is the people within, it is so satisfying to see the people that come in and to watch them grow as individuals knowing you made them that way."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotle is a place where as long as you do your job in a safe and responsible way, you can have fun. If I wasn't moving I'd shoot for a GM position. Hopefully a texas store will hire me"
good,"Chipotle was always organized and they always had fresh food. Chipotle was a easy job but the work place just wasn't for me. I needed a job so I could start getting money, but I want to get paid more."
good,emphasis on teamwork in this company and someone who is a quick learner will flourish. Have a sense of urgency always otherwise its difficult to survive shifts in the back of the house. Its a fun community of hard workers who want a healthier lifestyle for Mexican cuisine.
good,I had a great experience at Chipotle. My management team was very uplifting and pushed me to do my best. They understood my tight schedule as a high school student and appropriately accommodated me.
good,"Very warm environment and very understanding, hard working coworkers. I had a really good experience at chipotle, and they were very understanding of why I had to leave (family medical emergency)."
good,"I would definitely recommend someone who has a busy schedule but also needs income. If someone wants to advance i would recommend working here, definitely room for that wonderful experience."
good,"Chipotle is a great place to work if you are looking to move up. They provide health benefits, along with sick time and 401k. This is a very fast paced environment with all of the time on your feet."
good,Great company to work for with good benefits competitive pay. No overtime allowed. Quick and fast paced work environment. Safety and health are major concerns of the company and everyone strives to uphold the standards
good,"Chipotle is a very fast paced moving company. Lots of hard work, builds great work ethic and creates high standards within. It's you against the time clock as everything is created on how long it should take you to complete a task. From dicing onions in a timely manner with precise cuts to standard to Serving the food on the line to our guest. They will build a better you. Chipotle just happen to hit a very bad bump in the road. Depending on your leader, you can strive or fail. Chipotle has a culture that wants to provide that family/work/life balance. They want you to become successful under their leadership and provides great stability."
good,Working at Chipotle has been a great experience beacuse I was able to meet new people and make new more friends. The people who work for Chipotle are are nice inside and outside the restaurant and working with them has been a lot of fun.
good,Great job with many advancements. Chiptoles is a great place to wor. It bcomes more a second family. Everyone works as one team. Everyone covers a shift if needed help is always offered. Mangers make sure no matter how busy everyone gets their breaks. All mamanagers step up to help when  when needed .
good,My experience at chipotle was great. It was competitive but fun. The environment made time pass by fast. You get your breaks paid and get free food when working
good,"A typical day at Chipotle would consist of serving customers and constantly cleaning up areas. I learned great work ethic and how to be mindful with food and healthy eating. Management was very friendly ,understanding and helpful."
good,It was great while it lasted. People were chill when they could. When customers came in it for serious and began too get difficult. If like fast paced go for CHIPOTLE.
good,"A typical day at work was not as busy as other Chipotle locations. It was located in a quiet neighborhood and whenever it got busy, it wasn't that difficult to handle. I learned a lot since it was my first paid job, and met a lot of employees there that helped me along the way. The workplace culture was very friendly and so were most of the customers. The hardest part was whenever it got busy and there weren't enough employees to help out in the front. Most enjoyable part was actually working in the back and learning about the fresh ingredients are placed in the foods."
good,"Chipotle is every thing a young starting person who wants to manage a team needs to learn, they give you the tools and skills that you need to know to manage a company"
good,"I had great experience working for Chipotle. Learned a lot, met bunch of nice people, delicious food, many opportunities to build your carrier, well paid."
good,"The environement is very welcoming and you could tell the company really cares about its employees and customers alike. The managers, at least in my experience, were very freindly and were only tough on you to ensure you were doing your best. Hours could seem long on slow days but when it gets busy IT GETS BUSY. overall, i would recommend this job to either a college or high school student that wasnts a part-time job while going to school."
good,"no time for breaks or mistakes. very busy and fast pacing. go in early prepare chips, clock in, i learned to multitask very fast. once we open you must greet customers in a friendly manner, watch what food is being prepared, ring it up accordingly"
good,A typical day at work is productive to me since every moment you will have a task at hand to keep the restaurant running smoothly. I learned the ability to improve my time management to be able to complete tasks at a much productive speed. The management could use some improvement on their methods of accomplishing and acquiring a successful workday for themselves and some of their employees. The workplace culture is sort of like a family. I enjoy that since everyone is helpful and caring from the moment you start. The hardest part of the job is probably the amount of pressure to serve at a quick speed while also making sure orders are filled correctly. The most enjoyable part of the day is when everyone is on break and can really sort of get to know each other a little bit more.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Loved working for Chipotle if your a college student and need assistance throughout school there great with helping students succeed ... I learned a lot there specially in the kitchen because of chipotle I'm a greater cook and family man
good,"I liked working there because it provided a nice environment to work in. It is so welcoming and managers try their best to help you out. "
good,for the most part easy but could be stressful when there is a huge line. Free food is amazing and the company is a really cool one to work for. Training kind of sucks but not too bad.
good,Great experience for anyone whos willing to put in the work there is so much attention to detail and everyday you find yourself learning something new.
good,"Une journée de travail a Chipotle était agréable, jamais d'ennui, avec des collègues très gentils. Le plus agréable était le contact avec les clients, notamment avec beaucoup d'étrangers ! En revanche les supérieurs mettaient constamment une pression qui pouvait parfois être excessive"
good,"It's a good job with usually energetic and friendly employees. It becomes frantic at times if you work at the Danbury Mall, but you get used to the hustle after awhile."
good,Once you get used to the place it feels like home. the things that they teach you not only apply within the store but also in your everyday life. The culture is interesting and the customers love everything about it. It makes you really believe in the things that you're selling
good,A typical day at work is coming in make sure all my team is good check if there anything that need to be done or someone that need my help and coming in to a place were you feel happy and know that its a reward when I know I made someone around me better and feeling valued. I have learned how to manage a whole store when I thought I thought I wasn't going to be able to.
good,"You should expect a lot of work and focus. Chipotle is very serious about their reputation and food, they have set rules for every task. If you are looking for a job that you can advice in fast, this is definitely the job for you. Chipotle will become a lifestyle."
good,"When employed at Chipotle, a sense of urgency is a must. If your tasks aren't done within the next hour, everyone in the team and the customers will be brought down with you-- great impact because they get so many customers at once. The good thing about Chipotle is that the manager does kind of like a monthly mandatory progress report and they check up on you with your knowledge to make sure you're not lacking anything you need to know about the workplace. Chipotle is definitely a fun place to work and the employees make you feel like you're accepted no matter what. There's a variety of different nationalities there when I worked there as well as when I dine in there."
good,"Making sure everyone on my team is in great, letting them know if we have any big orders today or any changes today. Just so we are all on the same team."
good,"family like environment "
good,A typical day at work involves dealing with customers and working with a team. I have learned how to use a knife to prepare food. Management consisted of various leading styles. Co-workers are  multi-cultural and with different kinds of personalities.
good,"A typical day at work would be training my crew, help guest with any questions. I`d give them a tour of our menu and explain how it works."
good,Working at Chipotle Mexican grill was great I met really nice people
good,I love that they promote from within so all managers know their store from the bottom up. They are very strict on rules which ensures safety and consistency.
good,I learned how to create and enforce my own work culture where people worked together and had a fun and loving work environment. I love this company because there was plenty of opportunity in growing into a career. I enjoyed working as a team with my crew and managers.
good,"A typical day at Chipotle is fast paced, friendly, and a fun enviroment. What I learned at Chipotle is how to connect with everyone. The management team was very supportive and goal oriented. My co-workers were highly motivated and always looked up to me. And one thing I enjoyed the most was dedication to customer happiness."
good,"During my time at chipotle, it has been a very good learning experience. I've got the chance to learn with one of the best mangers that chipotle that has to offer and that is due the company's culture and the support they have for the management team to hold them responsible to create  a fun, respectful environment and most importantly to develop and empower people to become future leaders. "
good,"It was a very rewarding place to work and learn the skill set that I gained. The management team was also very respectful and responsible, the benefits were also very rewarding."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotle is a great place to work at overall, highly recommended for a part time job it’s got great benefits  as well as great workers.. For someone that’s trying to reach 35-40 hours for example me I don’t recommend just because its not a huge workplace so it doesn’t require lots of employees as well as lots of hours other than that, no complaints"
good,"Chipotle has allowed me to progress in my life, it’s shown for how to communicate more efficiently with others, and also how to properly manage the store without any supervision."
good,"A typical day at work was every different but very alike all at the same time. i learned how to cook Chipotle chips.I did inventory everyday.I learned how to close the store. I learned how to stock ,cook ,clean how to sever and talk to costumers.the work place was  filled with many different people but i got along with everyone and still do. the hardest part was  first leaning something because you have to be fast but careful. the most enjoyable part of the job was getting greeted every morning from everybody ."
good,"A typical day at work consists of your team is ready to go for the rush that involves aces in their places ready to go and all stocked up. I learned a lot of time management here, and to always think on your feet."
good,It's pretty decent. The crew at my location is dope and you get to move up fairly easily as long as you show heart an put in work. They have good benefits.
good,"It was a fun experience for a first job,  the people are team players and we all help each other out.  The quality of the food is great and clean. The place is quick pace environment ."
good,the food is great there ethic fantastic great company to grow flexible hurs fro 11 to 10 o clocck the  best are the burritos and bowls  with tabasco sauce
good,"Great atmosphere, overall decent place to work for a Summer job. Hours were not consistent. Learned some good teamwork skills and made some pretty good friends."
good,Working at Chipotle was a life-changing event for me because of the employees and the customers that made it's so. They were so outgoing and great in spirit that it made you feel at home and comfortable with interacting with others.
good,"At Chipotle, I learned how to handle monetary transactions, speak to customers and multi-task with the cash register and taking care of the lobby. Chipotle is a great company because they will always promote from within and take you all the way if you work hard."
good,"Working here is definitely a challenge at first because it's not like any other fast food place. All of the food is fresh and made of high quality ingredients. It's definitely fast paced more times than not but it's the challenge that makes it fun. Everyone here cares for each other and it's not hard to request time off and get people to cover your shifts. This is definitely a job for someone who has integrity, works well under stress and cares for the quality of a team"
good,i enjoyed the ongoing culture and close knit support that i received from my team. Highly empowering each other to be top performers daily and working to better ourselves the team and chipotle as a whole
good,its a great company with good quality of food and costumer service. coworkers and managers were awesome as well. i learned a lot from them in my time there
good,Great opportunities and room to grow. Must be willing to work hard and sweat. It's not an easy job but a great way to learn how to operate in a fast paced environment.
good,"Preparing food throughout the day as needed, anticipating and reacting to customer volume"
good,"It was a very difficult job to obtain. The interview process was extensive. However, I loved my job a couple months into it. It was a fun work environment with awesome people."
good,"Working with Chipotle was a great experience, i have never worked in the food industry before but working at chipotle mexican grill really taught me a lot about working with food and food standards on the job, Really great work ethics and amazing environment."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"A typical day includes greetings at the door and a very fun and friendly environment. The co-workers work as a team and help with the stress levels that are expected to occur while working in such a busy store. The skills learned are valuable. From learning to use a knife, to dealing with customers, and learning to work as a team."
good,"Everyone is a big family, it was crazy busy all the time but the people I worked with made it tolerable, great company to work for. i think the coolest thing there is when getting hired, you get interviewed by the crew, not the mangers. its the crew that chooses to work with you."
good,I believe there wasn't enough communication in management.
good,interesting place to work at. very challenging and the people was nice. the people I worked with were great and I learned a lot working there. If I had a passion for the food industry I would still want to work there. just with a different location.
good,"I loved going to work, making employees and customers smile. Enjoyed working with everyone and gave my best everyday when I arrived to work! It was hard because I was a single mom driving far."
good,"Depending on who's on your team, Chipotle could be a fun place to work at. However, in the beginning I've dealt with a lot of problems. I had a manager who was very disrespectful and racist towards me and my fellow co-workers. When it has been brought to a superior person in the company, our complaints were ignored and put to the side. Until one day our manager got caught doing something extremely unethical."
good,Worked there and got a paycheck. Great first job. Learned knife and management skills. Work life balance was very difficult to deal with as management was extremely overworked
good,"fun flexiable , but couldn't keep a well managed store , i loved ny crew and coworkers id love to work with them again, i didnt like that all of the GMs picked favorites"
good,"hectic work days with crazy schedules and no space for ability to balance life schedules. learned the adp system and working in stressful environments. management was unreliable and if they did not like you, there was no way you would make it very far. co-workers were ghetto and focused on their selves. nothing to enjoy. hard to juggle school and this job in particular."
good,overall experience was excellent but how the general manger acted was no way for any person to act. there was discrimination both for race and gender.
good,"I worked at the location next to UCLA. There were constantly people in there. This was my first job. I was going as fast as possible taking orders. Apparently I wasn't fast enough. It was overwhelming. They fired me. I went to apply at a different chipotle that was closer to me and I found out my last manager put me on the corporate ""do not re-hire"" list. Inconsiderate. The manager at the new chipotle said he was excited to work with me and that the pace would be perfect for me. But it couldn't be helped."
good,friendly co-workers a company with customers of all races and very friendly and considerate management.
good,Staff was fun and lively. There was always something to do which made the work day move a lot quicker. The atmosphere was always alive and happy. However management needs help.
good,Working at chipotle you will learn a lot of new things. You will really learn how to cook if you really didn't know how to cook before. you are able to make tips and it is also a fun and exciting job to be apart of.
good,The hardest part about working here is that always be ready for rush hour on weekends. The general manager at the time while I was working there always come up with lies to everyone.
good,The manager is silently racist and colorist. Had only Hispanic and lightskined workers on the line and the dark skinned ones in the back. She wanted me to work when I had an viral infection when I told her I could barely breathe or stand and got mad when I quit. The rest of the shift leaders are colorist too.
good,"• this store is not really busy "
good,"My typical day would be line prep. I would be the first to greet the customers behind the glass, and ask what they would like to eat. I would also be in the middle to where I would be filling up the bowl, burrito, etc. I also would help bad up food items when we were very busy and tell the cashier what the order was while I would ask the customer if they wanted any chips and drinks. I also closed and would help with cleaning duties, and marking food for the next day. I learned how to roll a burrito pretty well, and also how to be fast paced and multi task at the same time. The management was unfortunately lacking. It seems like everyday I would go into work we would have anew manager, and I would have to explain how I have another full time job and that what they scheduled me fore to work at Chiptole conflicts with my other job. The culture at chiptole is awesome the environment is fast paced, but it's the employees that make it fun to work. The hardest oart about the job was learning how to roll a burrito without tearing it. The most enjoyable part was being able to get discounted burrito bowls."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Pros"
good,Training is not that great they just kind of throw you in but make so you know safe first. It was fun be in the back house cooking not really around people.
good,"Recommended, selected, and helped locate or obtain merchandise based on customer needs and desires. "
good,"Management gave unrealistic expectations and promised EVERYONE a promotion. Only the popular received promotions, they work you half to death. Management was very hypocritical, they would set expectations of the crew then turn around and do the exact opposite."
good,the one thing i loved the most working at Chipotle was the food! they always gave away free food even when you didn't want any. till this day i still go in there and order my favorite burrito which is the Steak Burrito!
good,"A typical day at Chipotle Mexican Grill is Hectic. Its always busy and fast passe so if your not fast your bound to fall behind on pretty much everything. I have learned a lot of pros and cons at Chipotle. Pros: You will learn how to food prep, gain confidence in yourself and your abilities, and Customer Service skills that you can pretty much apply to any job. Cons: A lot of unprofessional co-workers and managers, favoritism, and rude customers.  Management there was OK! and yes I said OK! because sometimes It was amazing and other times it was unprofessional. The hardest part of the job for me was learning self discipline, being sore and working non-stop, remembering everything about chipotle from the beginning of time and the rude people. The most enjoyable part about working there was being part of a great culture with high expectations, having fun with the co-workers and feeling like family, and the pay check wasnt too bad for a college student like me!"
good,Experience it for yourself. Then you’ll make the ultimate decision in your opinion. I have nothing else to say.. yet i feel obligated to do so..shrugs shoulders 😐
good,"A typical day of work was pretty busy because it was on a college campus. I learned how to deal with customers and manage interactions. The culture was not the best because I felt unwanted, but the most enjoyable part was working there overall because I learned a lot."
good,"I loved working at chipotle! It was very fast, but I enjoyed talking to customers and getting to know my coworkers. Management wasn’t always the best, but it was there. I do not get paid enough for what I do."
good,"My job was to man the grill and make different ingredients, wasn’t very exciting job just something temporary. The job wasn’t too difficult however I wasn’t very interested in working with food."
good,"Chipotle was a pretty good job to have but, it did have its stressful days. I liked it but, there were alot of rude customers. That would be the hardest part of the job."
good,Fast-paced working environment. Could get cuts and burns easily. Be prepared to have an active memory and be up on your feet for the entire shift. I left when management changed so some of the job description might have changed slightly.
good,"This company provides a welcoming and fun workplace. They employ people of all backgrounds, religion, race, creed, criminal background, etc. They focus on quality all around - from customer service, to product quality, and provide everything you need to be happy as an employee."
good,i feel like it depends on which one you work at the on i worked at was terrible i got verbally abused all the time and the management didn't care at all but the Establishment its self was wonderful
good,over worked. usually called in on off days for needed help. did not work hand and hand with you to help move up in the company. the best part about working there is meeting amazing people
good,"Building a culture of promoting from within and then bringing in outside hires does not look good from a management point of view. that basically is saying we like u enough to do all the hard work, but not to be a leader. I would still be there if that was not the case."
good,"Working at chipotle was one of the best experiences i had. People were always nice. I liked the fact that we served their food right on the spot so everyone will leave happy and not have to wait for order numbers to be called, etc."
good,"i learned helping other make people always feel happy and helping them a lot. do not let go at first, try and try at least you get their."
good,Worked with great co-workers getting to know customer's was a good  a experience it is a very busy enviroment building a burrito was a challenge.

good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"I was responsible for hiring and training new associates. I was in charge of making sure any service equipment needed for the store was updated and ordered accordingly. I also was a prior kitchen manager that trained new associates within the kitchen, Created truck orders as well as inventory for the store."
good,"Great work lace, great food culture. They were very ethical about where they sourced their food from especially the meat. I loved how fresh and and delicious the food was"
good,"Learned how to interact with Customer. Became very outgoing, and a people person, more than i already was. Loved coming in to work, the environment was very fast paced so it was intense but fun and a bit overwhelming at times in a good way."
good,"I would greet customers and serve them food they asked for, as well as clean all equipment and do the dishes. I learned how to be more-self-sufficiant. While my manager was nice to me, she would complain about co-workers to other employers, which I find to not be a good quality of a manager. My co-workers were fun, nice, and hard working. The hardest part of my job was doing the dishes because I had to do it at a fast pace. The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with the customers."
good,"Cut limes and lemons, make tortilla chips, make taco shells, bag tortilla chips, serve customers with excellent customer service."
good,"Arrived at work I wore my mandi, after I washed my hands and then I wore my gloves ... then serve the customers and friendly sonriente..aprendi many things such as the size of q portion was to serve, keep my area clean. how difficult communicating with my friends at work because I speak little English and I am a little timida..ala time to close my station .. poruqe empesaba very clean and tidy to leave the next day. and congratulated me for doing my job well .."
good,"Working for Chipotle was fun, I got to meet a bunch of great people and got to learn a lot in the process. The Managers were great until you got up in the corporate level but most of them are not with the company anymore so it should be way better now. the hardest part of the job was remembering all the policies and procedures but once you have that memorized its all pretty easy from there. I loved being with the crew and making people happy with our food."
good,Experience was a successful day understand each character different consumer. How to recognize them see the satisfaction of feel at home.
good,"Working at Chipotle was amazing, the whole outlook of the complany and the values we had were incredible. The employees all had one thing in common and that was the genuine hospitality we all had to give to one another and our customers. Management was awesome when I first started the job then it slowly went downhill as time progressed. Overall it was a great place to work and I love Chipotle."
good,My experience at chipotle was a good learning step for me. I began to feel underappreciated as a cook because we were often inadequately staffed . Subsequently I would often be depended upon to fulfill the roles of multiple employees instead of one. And the pay for the amount of labor expected of me was unnaceptable.
good,"Worked with great people"
good,". While this was a great company when I started I've yearsseen it decline from a very employee-centric to a bottom-line oriented organization. Employees are becoming numbers and everything is run from the company's headquarters in Seattle, WA...even when they don't understand what goes on in remote locations. My belief in this company has waned over time and I would not work for it again."""
good,"A typical day includes gettin in at 8 and leaving at four pm fo rah emoting shift. I worked on the line and really enjoyed interaction aft meeting new people. Whenever there was a rush, my co-workers and mangers where always there to help the line."

good,"Chipotle has an interesting culture, however when I worked there, the people were very dedicated to making the store A+ quality and delivering excellent customer service"
good,Typical day would be making sure prep is being done for the day. Making sure training is done effectively. Also writing schedules. Taking inventories and placing food orders.

good,"everyday your shift is non-stop work to be done, with the dishes, chips to be made, food and supplies to be stocked, customers to tend to, food to take temperatures of,etc. working at chipotle is hard work but it pays off"
good,"Primary duties consist of taking orders, preparing meals, packaging food items, and ringing up customer purchases. Secondary duties for Chipotle crew members include preparing food and ingredients, opening and closing the store, and cleaning"
good,Higher management is a big reason why I had to quit. I was a Service manager doing apprentice and GM roles. When I spoke to upper management about taking on this extra responsibilities with no help and not wanting to move up so soon.
good,"It's in a mall setting so you would have to be comfortable working in a fast paced environment. The management is good, they work around your schedule outside of work. Benefits are great."
good,"Overall, probably the best food-service job I've ever had. Employees are valued, customers are taken care of, food is prepared with strict guidelines, resulting in a collectively pleasant guest experience."
good,depending on the shift opening or closing the jobs do vary a bit. Every person pretty much has a set job or station they take care of. time management is a very key thing.
good,Chipotle was not the place for me but it was clear the passion and will to work every employee had. I will miss that and I know they will do great things.
good,Did not have to many complaints about this job other than do not get burnt. They wont let you off the clock to try to handle the burn. The pay was fair but the hours were long with people calling out of work
good,It was such a fast paced environment everything was go go go. You were always thinking on your toes and had to be alert to your surroundings. Being a kitchen manager this was more my job then anyone elses.

This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Enjoyed my employment there, a great company to move up from crew member to manager fast ! However the chipotle location I was at had very poor management."

good,As a starter job working at Chipotles Mexican Grill was good because it allowed me the able to manage my work hours around my personal life. In return I was able to work more shifts.

good,A great experience. Learned so much and was able to work with great coworkers. I would highly recommend working at Chipotle and having people learn not only how to make great tasting/amazing food but the ability to work with great people.
good,"There were many good things about this company/location. The food is great and you get a mixtue of fast and slow paced times. Over all, I really liked the experiance that I gained from working there."

good,Its was a great place to work the manage was helpful and all the co worker was to theirs no hard part in job coming to work to get the job done and enjoy yo day.
good,I love that I can work as little or as much as possible at chipotle. I have triplet girls and have made a decision to not work full time until they are ready to enter school. The management at chipotle has been extremely flexible and supportive of me.
good,Even though this is a great place to work with great benefits it's also VERY stressful at times!
good,"good hour "
good,"I loved this job! The regulars made the day that much better and while this is a very fast paced environment, it makes the day go so much faster. I love the Mexican culture and they try and stay true with the hiring of their people."
good,to work for Chipotle Mexican Grill an individual has to be ready to work with hard working workers and dedicated to their job.  This company is always doing work.
good,A regular day at chipotle is kind of hard if you dont know what youre doing and if you and the other team members arent on one accord. things get backed up very often. the managers are always there to help and give advice.
good,"A typical work day consisted of interacting with customers, such as taking their orders, preparing the food and assisting the customers in purchasing their food. I would run the cash register and also work on the line preparing food for the customers, it just depended on what I was scheduled to do each day. This Job taught me the importance of working hard and doing your job right. The management was good, they worked will with the staff. My co-workers were good to work with as well, everyone worked hard. The Job wasn't hard if you did it right, so there wasn't really a hard part on this job in my opinion. I enjoyed the whole experience of this job, everyone was nice to work with which made shifts fun."
good,Fast paced all the time to get the customers in and out the store but being careful at the same time working with a good team of employees.
good,"It's been a while since I've worked here so I can't speak about the franchises much. But the company itself is fantastic, with a great message and real concern for quality, fresh, organic food."
good,I enjoed working here. I learned alot of things while being employed here and it helped me with alot of things. It was my first job and tough at that. I had a good experience. The hardest part was having to learn everything within 3 days of training. The easiest part came after a month of getting used to .
good,"A lot of fun, actually. There were people always trying to make the best of the situation. It was fast-paced and organized. They trained you to be able to do any position in the store, like a well oiled machine. It got crazy sometimes but the thrill of it all kept you going. Management very intuitive and respectful. Everyone was a valued member of the team! Pay was alright, hours were plentiful. Rising in ranks was almost too easy. Very clean, organized, self improving. They cared about their employees, truly."
good,Managers are great at teaching what each individual needs to know to perform his or her job as a top performer.
good,"A typical day starts out by doing prep work before the restaurant opens. This involves making chips, salsas, guacamole and hot food items such as rice, beans and chicken. In addition, preparing the restaurant lobby for customer use is required before opening time."
good,Come in and get started...
good,The crew was great. Management needed some work but were good people and worked well with your schedule. Clean. Good morals. Loved working there.
good,"It is a good company to work for, but their management team was not well picked. I learned how to handle people in various types of moods and how to difuse bad situations. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the management, but the best part was my co-workers and regular customers."
good,it was relly bad because everyone just to play around and there was no order. maneger just to go outside every 30 minutes and smoke and they didnt help anything
good,"Your day will consist of doing whatever task your manager asks you to do. You may be cooking, serving, prepping, cleaning. You may even be asked to take out trash, clean the dining room and mop the floors. You're there to work and they will put you to work doing whatever needs to be done"
good,"Chipotle was one of the greatest opportunity I have ever had, while I was in High school and college. "
good,"• Female senior manager is totally unprofessional/impatient. "
good,"Chipotle was a very fun and learning experience, I had a lot of growth while working at Chipotle. They have great benefits, healthcare, stock options and 401k plans as well as helping with school financially!"
good,"Always get along with your managers they influence a lot of the General managers Opinion, Stay on Top of your task, try your best to not fall behind. If you fall back the entire store falls back"
good,"I loved working at chipotle. If I had a choice i'd still be working there however my manager was not good at his job. He would make everybody else do the work he was supposed to do. As well as the fact that he was inappropriate with a lot of female workers. Overall ,if you took him outa the equation, chipotle is a lovely place to work. Y'all work as a team and are more like family than colleges. I would recommend applying to anybody."
good,"Overall I enjoyed the time I spent working at Chipotle.  I loved my coworkers, and everything about the company.  I didn’t have the best management team however, making it hard to want to stay working with them."
good,"I worked for this company for about 3 years and it was great, I got to meet a lot of new people and it got me out of my comfort zone, normally all restaurants have a good vide"
good,"Gm- salary position. 50 hrs a week, work more like 80 hrs. Loved chipotle for a while. It was fun for a while- until it wasn’t. At any second my job was at risk. Loved the mission. But hard when you’re constantly short staffed and a sick policy that could get you fired if you let someone get sick"
good,"Poor management, there was always an argument among the crew and also the management. People quit the job weekly. Always understaffed, crew was overworked."
good,Breaking a sweat is something that will always happen at chipotle. The people there never stop running around to provide the best service. At sometimes it can be super stressful but the day goes by fast.
good,We would always get busy for lunch time we had a small dinning room but manage to get the busy on time. Cook enough food for the rush hour and will always be on time to work.
good,"getting food prep ready at my fastest pace, how to food prep first job in the field. management was ok, due to keep putting me on prep knowing I was'nt the fastest. The culture was awesome loved everything they stood for. getting my food prep done and ready on time. serving fresh food daily to my customers."
good,"Busy , some managers have attitudes , enjoy meeting people , very honest, tiring but good pay , some managers are very helpful , they give good advice , enjoyable"
good,"Chipotle rounded me out as in my depth as human. I was taught a different language , how to chop like a real chef , and food safety that I can take with me everywhere I go. It's a people place so make sure you enjoy people before applying."
good,"i mean it was pretty cool, i loved the crew but the general manager began to act fake and petty so it was time. i also didnt get my raise in time because they lagged"
good,"Chipotle should only hire people with a sense of urgency, if you think it's just another fast food job, you are sorely mistaken. The hiring process allowed other team members to be apart of the selection process, which helped out some pick the type of person they are going to be working with."
good,"Honestly, in my opinion everyone who had or has worked at chipotle will have different experiences with this particular job. Some may be good or it could be a bad experiences for others. I loved everyone there including the GM. I did the morning shift , it was really chill and everyone is just having a great time (says customers when they come in) due to use having a Bluetooth speaker in our facility that keeps us working/ socializing and of course welcoming & serve our customers !"
good,"My only issue was store-centered. I was only working 3 hours a week. The company itself was great, and offered many benefits, including paid breaks, and free food on the job."
good,"Chipotle was a great first job. I learned a lot there. It's a very fast-paced environment, but that makes the time go by faster. The customers are fine overall."
good,"Everyday was busy day as all of our ingredients and dishes are made fresh every morning"
good,My review of Chipotle is fair because the customer service was good. Very fast paist. There are alot of customers that are nice and kind. The workers are great.
good,"It is always very busy working at chipotle. Requires you to be quick paced and attentive. The hardest part of the job would have to be food preparation, but it can also be the most enjoyable as well."
good,"A typial day at work was always busy. You walk in and the store is flooded with people. I learned that working hard, moving at a fast pace, and grinding as the only way you'll make it in the chipotle industry. You have to work hard to play hard, once all tasks and prep is over with then the fun begins. Hardest part about the job was to please picky customers, while trying to abide by our chipotle standards. The most enjoyable part about my job was working with all my friends, you'd go to work together, leave together, hangout after work. It was all fun."
good,"A typical day at chipotle is very fast paced. Alot of traffic everyday keeps you on your toes. You learn to keep a look out for everything and keep an open mind. With the right training, Management is very well balanced between how much we physically put in and how strong minded you are. working with the crew members and showing them the kind of workplace we deal with is fun, as part of our job is to keep the team happy. the hardest part of my job is making sure the work gets done with out actually putting in labor and maintaining a training set of mind. your never done training. my favorite part is being able to talk to customers and answer any questions or concerns they may have."
good,Chipotle Mexican Grill is a fun environment to work in.It has a extensive employee and food culture.We treat both with respect and hold each to a high standard
good,"▪ Managed restaurant operations in terms of staffing and scheduling functions"
good,"I felt encouraged and supported by my crew and management. I was also pushed to my limits to make me better, it was fast paced and left a life long impact on me because of how close the crew was. Almost like a family, definitely unique to anything I had worked previous."
good,"Management was great, they played their parts as managers but also helped out the team members as if they were just another employee. Co-workers were very proficient in giving constructive criticism. Everybody is helpful and respectful."
good,"A typical day for me, is walking into a fun and loving environment, and being welcomed by a warm and loving team that genuinely cares about me. I'm usually learning something new everyday, whether it be skills such as, life skills, business skills, people skills or kitchen skills. I have a pretty great management team that loves me dearly and cares about my well being. My co-workers are awesome to work with and have a great work attitude so it's always pleasant to work with them and see their smiling faces. The hardest part about working at Chipotle, would be the physical work and exuding all of my energy at once, all while being incredibly busy. It sometimes takes everything in me, but it's worth it at the end of the day, because who doesn't enjoy hard work and a challenge? The most enjoyable part would honestly be being able to work in an environment where I can 100% be myself. It's truly gratifying."
good,"It was a very fast-paced atmosphere. There wasn’t one specific duty you would do, you try to combine everyone together, and work as a team as I like to say. The customers are very genuine, because they just want their food, and if you serve your food how you are supposed to, they were happy when you greet them with small talk here and there, and just make them feel comfortable."
good,I would go in at 4 and take over the line from the morning shift and take care of all the mise en place for my shift and that morning shift. I learned that 85 percent of my time was spent on preparation for service.
good,This was a very fun but also professional job.  The line is the most fun because you get to talk to the customers as you're preparing their food.
good,it was a fast paste very busy restaurant co-workers were awesome but management wise was horrible i enjoyed the company it was just the way they worked us it was like everyone had more then just one job they was desined to do be cause we was short on staff. then the manager was never there but the assistant mangers always argued and talked about each other to us the employers. it just wasnt a professional place. and when i did leave it was like nothing mattere when i tried to handle the situation the proper way.
good,"working for chipotle has been a good experience and is a good company to work for. But you don't want to be on the general managers bad side when it comes to her ""favorite"" employees. She was willing to lose great top performers to low mediocre performers due to favoritism. its a sad thing to see. in order to get the hours and pay wanted you need to know the right people and have the right friends. And pretty much lower yourself to them. at least that's how it felt for me."
good,"I loved this job so much. I was always able to learn something new and I always had a choice to move up. It was fun, fast, and upbeat!"
good,"I learned to cook and cut , I learned to treat customs better , I learned to serve people and I learned cashier and to clean my area and the restaurant."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"It was good I learn a lot of stuff that I didn’t know and I Thank then"
good,I loved working at chipotle. It was my first job I was able to work with management it helped me paved a way for my future. Everyone’s nice. I learned so much working in that company
good,Chipotle is a great environment to work in. They have flexible hours especially if you're part time and they value college students. They allow you to move up within the company and pursue your career in your filed of choice.
good,"Although Chipotle was very busy and a very fast-pace business, it is a great experience and a fun way to get experience. the environment is usually happy and yes it can be stressful but for the most part it is a great place."
good,When I worked at Chipotle it was good and ok at first but I always known my manager didn't like but I didn't say anything because maybe cause I was new but she just being rude
good,"A typical day at work for me was coming in saying hello to all my fellow crew members and getting right to work. At this company, l learned times management this workplace is very fast pace and you have to be able to keep up. The hardest part of my job was keeping up especially with online orders coming in as well as walk-ins. The most enjoyable part of my job was just being there we were all like a family we laughed but we also got our work done overall it was great."
good,"It was hard at the beginning but i am a quick learner and i adjust very fast, management was a great team, was always a great help when ever i had a question and so were the crew members."
good,"Chipotle is a great, ethical company. It has paid sick days and scheduling is often flexible. It isn’t an easy job but it is fulfilling to know you’re serving clean and healthy food"
good,"The struggles and hard work that I had learned from Chipotle has been a awesome journey for me, it made me a better person also taught me how to interact with people. I will never forget the great things that it had taught me."
good,Great job and a great workplace. The environment is very clean and the workers there are very nice and positive people. One thing I liked about the job is that it felt like a family. Everyone respected one another.
good,Chipotle is a great place to start if your new to this field. They do train and will work with you. The work is pretty straight forward and easy. Good luck
good,Chipotle was a very fast paced job. Nice people and awesome customers. At chipotle you are allowed to be yourself and not be judged by how you look...

good,Me gusta trabajar en chipotle es un lugar de un biem ambiente es un lugar muy divertido
good,"Working at Chipotle was the best job I had. I was stuck with terrible management unfortunatley, but the collaborative and competitive environment helped me grow. Fun coworkers. Great food."
good,"Great Management , the work environment is one of a kind. The managers are very helpful and co workers as well. Working here is a good way to build relationships as well as a fun way to make money."
good,Chipotle is one of the best jobs I’ve had it’s a lot of fun we move at a fast pace so the days go by faster and the staff are very friendly and welcoming to new workers !!
good,Chipotle has great training and is very in depth. It was one thing Chipotle should be proud of. They have good videos and great apprentices to train new crew members. Overall the environment was very friendly. I left due to the manager who was s
good,"It was a good experience but they did not help you a lot with working around your needed hours, and they were too pushy on making you act a certain way"
good,"You would come in around 7:50 am and prep the store for opening at 10:45, as cashier I was responsible for frying & bagging chips, making sure the drink stations were neat and clean as well as the bathrooms and the dining room. From this job I’ve gained better communication skills and customer interaction skills. I’ve learned to move fast as a cashier and keep the line short at all times while keeping smiles on the customers faces. The workplace culture is chill. We played soothing music over the loud speaker in the dining room while people ate their food and people loved it. The hardest part of the job honestly was the management. The service managers overall were good and friendly, but the general manager made the workplace unfair and treated workers with disrespect. The most enjoyable part of the job was the employee to customer connection. It was always a good time with customers."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"A typical day of work consisted of a variety of tasks such as, preparing food, serving food, interacting with customers, answering phone calls, ringing orders up and so forth. I learned how to multitask, interact with customers, how to cook, and how to work as a team with coworkers. You have to work as a team with your coworkers otherwise things would fall out of place. The hardest part of the job is pace because you have to really be able to move quickly. The most enjoyable part of the job is learning what you're capable of and how much you can accomplish."
good,"This company offered a great culture, while offering a challenging work environment. The company offers flexible work hours and a fun environment to grow in, however, it is a very flat structure so the growth opportunity is limited."
good,Driven individuals but my experience the individuals that were hired were very selfish. I worked at a second location with employees who were much more considerate and were more about the vision of chipotle then their own vision and it was a much better work experience
good,"A typical work day was getting to work and opening by 10 and also making sure to never run out of food, it was a very stressful job at first but was worth it"
good,"Great place to work, a lot of changes that are easily balanced. Been working there for 4 years loved every second. Repetitive job,  easy to follow procedures"
good,Everything at this job was great until a new district manager came in and he was very rude most of the time using curse words to employees and making me feel uncomfortable. Many people at my location quit after he came into power.
good,The workplace culture is amazing. Everybody who works in chipotle knows the culture and its rituals. They know about the founder of chipotle and about all the background behind its product.
good,It is a great work experience but the pay was too low for the amount of work and the general manager wasn't the best. Although the staff were friendly and the cumtumers were great overall.
good,"It was super fun working at chipotle unfortunately our general manager was fired and replaced with someone else,, this was the reason for me leaving. They had great staff and we all were like a family."
good,"Everyday at Chipotle brought new challenges. Foods were freshly prepared, daily, so that is how everyday started. Chipotle was a very fun and motivating place of employment. It was all about people development. I truly enjoyed working side by side with several different ages, ethnicities, and personalities. Chipotle taught me how to view things from several different ways as opposed to only one structured way. The job itself was not challenging however, I would have to say the hardest part of my job was firing people. Although it had to happen, it just didn't feel good to tell people that they were no longer employed. I would definitely say that the most enjoyable part of my job was watching people grow and develop. It brought me such joy to take a person from a crew and develop them into a manager. I also thoroughly enjoyed interacting with the customers, both new and old."
good,I loved working here for a while. But unfortunately I didn't get along with the general manager. However if you have the opportunity to work there I highly recommend it on the off chance you find a great manager.
good,"speak up loud and clear and always make sure you have a smile on your face, even if a customer upsets you. the customer is never wrong (: one thing i wish i was told is that in the first week your body might be a little sore if you aren’t really an active person so make sure you’re prepared for a mini workout haha"
good,I really enjoyed working here. The management just wouldn't work as a team. Job was fast paced and had to keep moving. Great place to work. I learned many skills on how to cook and speak with costumers and learned great social skills.
good,Working at Chipotle is a great opportunity to learn how to tend to customers in a professional manner while learning to manage time multitask and give quality service .
good,had it for a summer job and enjoyed myself. Cool coworkers and managers. paid lunches and free lunch ! 50% off food when youre not working and i believe salaries start at 10$
good,Thus was the best place I'd worked at for an while i loved the coworkers the mangers. It was an fast paced environment so needed to be on your toes. And you really seen the same customers everyday
good,"Fun place to work at, especially if it’s your first job. It’s a very busy environment, I reccomend if you are in school is better to work here over the summer. If you are in school it can be very stressful due to long hours. Management makes you feel like you’re part of a team but sometimes they can be not as professional."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,employees all work together the managers are lazy its always really busy so no one should be sitting around at all everything is a fast pace so you have to know how to keep up & remembering things
good,great learning experience the culture was fantastic the team work is phenomenal I couldn't ask for more every day was an enjoyment working with people that care about the food they were serving
good,"Chipotle takes care of its own with benefits for the most part. Some essential medication was not covered and I paid thousands out of pocket. They have a clear cut plan for advancement in the company as well as the culture to back it up. However, even with all of the pros, it ultimately will depend on your in-store management if you succeed or not. Also, Chipotle is VERY demanding of you effort wise, but if you believe in their culture and apply it, your hard work will not go unnoticed."
good,I loved my career with Chipotle Mexican Grill because of it constant challenges; I was able to move up quickly with the support I received from my colleague.
good,Chipotle is a great place to work if you want to work in a fast paced and team orriented job. It has a great atmosphere for customers. Very friendly work staff. Management was fairly well trained. Hardest part of the job was the evening rush everyday
good,"Prepping before shift starts making sure everything is good before shift starts. I would make fresh food, clean up and also do other duties that the boss tells us to do."
good,While working at chipotle you learn how to take responsibility and learn how to truly balance out life and a job. While working here you have to learn how to work together as a team not just as an individual.
good,"great job to work at, great pay, offers great hours, free meals when there on break, meets all kinds of great people. Some days its very busy and tuff but its gets easier"
good,"Always on your toes, they expect a lot out of you, it mirrors the makings of a cult. They care a lot about there employees but it's hard to get attention when the emphasis is on the customers."
good,"When i first started at chipotle, i knew i was going to love it. It was fast paced, amazing people, great pay and benefits. It was a family, but not everyone there saw it that way. Some people did not mix well which is okay, not everyone does. But the managers there were also very childish and didn't really do their job right or treat everyone fairly. Always make sure that all the managers do their job and don't just go there to get paid and make friends."
good,It was a very nice place with  friendly people. The free lunch was great and half off on a meal to take home was also a great touch. A lot to learn but once you get it its like riding a bike.
good,When working at Chipotle it was my senior year in high school. I wanted responsibility and took on a job. Working at chipotle and being eighteen they worked me till one am or close to two. I enjoyed working there and I learned a lot from working in this kind of business.
good,"I worked with some amazing people. Their food is amazing. I worked the night shift, 4-close which would be range around 11pm-1am. The hardest part of the job had to be keeping up with the customers."
good,I worked here for a while and made my way to Kitchen Manager. I was making decent money but I did not get along with the management. Prepping the food from scratch and taking responsibility for what you cook for the customers gave me great satisfaction.
good,Going into work happy end upsetting. Unprofessionalism is main issue. Crew Members are playing around constantly and eating the merchandise.  The work overall is very good. Crew members tend to not know how to speak to customers correctly when the restaurant is very busy.
good,"Chipotle was a very nice experience for me, especially since it was my first job. Starting pay was $9.00. For the most part, I liked majority of my co-workers. However.. my managers were rude."
good,I felt like I was working with children when you give your honest opinion they will label you as a low performer they will hold you back if the gm wants someone else there even when its your turn and have open availability and then want you to train them
good,I enjoyed working there. It's like working with a family where we all help one another. It was empowering and a positive workplace
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Overall cleanliness is great, staff is friendly, and dedicated to producing high quality goods. Awesome compliance with industry safety and health standards. Clear, concise recipes. Family environment."
good,"Always doing hard work always working on your feet and putting excellent work into everything you do, and must have amazing customer service, and of course always greeting others."
good,"The company have a lot people and "
good,"Depending on the shifts, mornings are cool."
good,The atmosphere was decent until the manager shift and then they refused to cut my hours back and everything got stressful as I tried to balance my college work. Managers kept dangling promotion then not giving it to me
good,"Sort incoming mail and scan into workflow, key and audit and average of 115 invoices daily. Provide customer service to both your restaurants and exterior customers. Process any urgent payments in Oracle for same day payment release. Statement research, account analysis."
good,"chipotle was my first job so i learned how to be more open, how to greet, how to pretty much everthing i know now. they taught me to greet customers coming into the work place how too properly clean and stock also prep . the management was great and i enjoyed pretty much the whole job. didnt like the cleaning the grills always burned my self.the was the hardest part also"
good,I love the values that chipotle stands on. They are very team oriented and supportive. It was a good stepping stone for me and help me build many skills.
good,"Chipotle was a great experience for me because it was my first job the co-workers and managers were easy to get along with and always willing to help, i was able to move around all the job the Chipotle had to offer from line server to cook witch helped me gain a lot of great experience."
good,It was a fun place to work. but truthfully I loved the food more than anything else. The people I worked with were pleasant. However it just wasn't the right place for me personally.
good,Everyday is a challenge with prepping and being able to perform at a very fast pace everyday.
good,"On a typical day I would set goal for each employee that was working on my shift. next I count down cash draws to ensure that the safe is balanced, this way I know what to expect at the end of my shift. After this I head to the front of the line and gather everyone for a short five minute overview of what is expect from the team. I communicate all goals, empower them to think as leaders. and motivate them to be infectiously enthusiastic to provide that ""WOW"" for the customers. As service Manger the main goal was to ensure that the customers received first class  service, while managing the operations between the front and back of the restaurant. This have thought me how to be an effective leader that motivates the team by showing them how their role in the company contributes to its success. Work in such an industry have also thought me the importance of time management and being conscientious of the work environment at all times. The hardest part of the job was dissemination of information between shift managers, which sometimes made it harder to operate and execute plans and the most effective manner. To combat this problem I implement the use of the log book to ensure that management is prepared and can work more cohesively as a team. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people I worked with. By getting to know them I was able to better understand what motivates and empower them. The high energy environment created an atmosphere that didn't feel like just work but being apart of a family with the same goals at hand. This developed in me a great passion for the company"
good,A typical day at work would be helping the customers decide on the best burrito or bowl that they could make.  I have learned how to communicate effectively with the customers. The management team was different depending on if you worked with the morning management or the night management. My co-workers were very acceptable to new employees and very respectful to our beliefs. The hardest part of the job was trying to get the perfect burrito rolled. The most enjoyable part of the job was always wanting to go to work and spend time with my co-workers inside and outside of work.
good,Fun job had there not been a switch in manegemnt i would have stayed
good," The over all work structure was well designed but lacked  proper management. I loved most of the people i worked with."
good,Chipotle is a very fast paced job. Lines are out the door everyday.
good,"I enjoy working here because its convenient and local, because Im also a full time student. Its hard work, but fun as well."
good,"A typical day at work included food preparation in the morning including washing and chopping vegetables, mixing salsas, cooking meats, and frying tortilla chips. We always had a line at the door before the restaurant even opened. As a team, we would prepare the customer's food . Each employee played an important role in the customer's experience at our restaurant. We worked on a front line which means the customers got to order specific food items and watched us prepare their meals, there was no room for errors. Throughout the day I was responsible for stocking and cleaning the dining room for the customers as well as continuing to prepare food and assist in financial transactions. Our management was always right beside us, workin just as hard. Our crew was extremely close and we knew we could count on one another. The hardest part of the job was making sure we could keep up with the rush. We were a popular restaurant and there was never a dull moment. I loved this job because I was able to be an individual and still apart of a team. I still have ongoing friendships with my co-workers and managers. The most enjoyable part of the job was acquiring new customer service skills and learning how to work effectively under pressure."

good,I really enjoyed the people I worked with at Chipotle but the overall environment was very stressful. There's always a million things to do but you also need to be able to help a customer at the drop of a hat.

good,It was unfair how i lost my job a manager told me to use tips for change and the director couldn't believe he would do that so i got terminated it was a lesson and a fault all in one i wouldnt do it again
good,"I've been working at Chipotle Mexican Grill for a total of 4 months now, and it has been the best job I've had out of all the fast food places I've worked at since I was 16, I am now 21. Co-workers are friendly, collaborative, and hard-working. The managers are relaxed and understanding people when it comes to family, school, and making sure their employees are comfortable and happy working there. They tell you at the interview that they expect a lot once they have you working, unlike most places that are okay with people not having any experience and building that by scratch. I'm grateful for the feedback and performance reviews as well as learning new things every other day. With that being said, it's an amazing restaurant to work at if you're looking into working in the food industry while pursuing college, or in need of a part-time gig, striving to become a manager, or just to get free delicious food."

good,"Amazing food safety polices, amazing people to work with. The company truly cares about their employees, absolutely love this company! I would reccomend this job"
good,"Always really busy even on slow days you're kept busy. A lot of the food is made from scratch. Hardest part, a lot of people call out so  can make a day very stressful. Most days are fun, crew members were all around my age. I was a manager so gained a lot of experience."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"this job was very easy no hard feelings toward , i just can’t get paid every 2 weeks anymore if i want to do what i got to do so i figured looking for a job that it’s weekly and gets paid 12-more is good for me right now"

good,"Chipotle is a wonderful place to work at, great place for a first job and to help you get your mind on track and strive for success. The staff do try really hard to make sure Chipotle has a healthy and safe work environment. A typical day at work will be fast paced, but eventually you grow into it and you'll find yourself improving over time. I've learned a lot ever since working at Chipotle, they've given me so much experiences that has allowed me to better myself for success in the future. The management will never be perfect, but you really do appreciate every thing they do even if it isn't perfect. The workplace culture is amazing, the culture of it allows you to have an in depth look on how dine-ins would be like and how the flow of each hour of working would feel like. The hardest part of the job has to be time management and prioritization because every day will never be the same, so without proper planning and time management, it will get difficult very fast. The most enjoyable part of the job is interacting with customers and the staff, being helped when needed and doing everything as a team. More than anything, I find it pleasing when my crew and I do everything we need to do as a team and when being to give great quality food to our customers and interacting with them. So yeah, I recommend Chipotle! It's very great overall :)"
good,"I really enjoyed working here! I had a lot of fun. The customers were cool, the food was healthy and delicious, and this job didn't ask too much of me. It was a good place to work, as far as ""hat jobs"" are concerned."

good,"review of the day "
good,"Great benefits , easy to move up to higher positions . It’s all about fast paced and good energy"
good,"Chipotle has a culture of cross-training and promoting internally, which gives plenty of opportunity to grow from within the company. each manager and store is different and they are typically willing to work with school schedules and other jobs. Some employees have typical workplace drama and issues but don't let yourself get involved. It is a fast-paced job where you are required to learn quickly and work even quicker."
good,"Interview was great"
good,"Chipotle is a great place to work at!! All of my managers and coworkers were all great to work with when I worked there! Everyone is super nice, has a strong sense of urgency, very motivated, and ambitious. We were always working hard everyday to reach our goals and had fun while doing it. I learned providing excellent customer service, coordinating as team, as well as trying your best everyday. Managers were always understanding and flexible offering help all while being excellent team leaders who empower their employees to be better truly paving the path to success for the chipotle team."
good,"Chipotle was my first job. I'm extremely thankful for the work skills that it taught me while I was there. I learned how to work in a team and be a team leader, as well as how to work in a fast paced environment and even how to cook very delicious food. Chipotle is a great first job because the culture is very team based and cooperative and your team members want you to succeed."
good,I would recommend working at Chipotle Mexican Grill because it's very fun fast and has many opportunities to meet new people  through employees aswell as customers
good,"A typical day at work would be a quick paces peak time, 6-8 and fun team work among coworkers. Hardest part of the job was when it was slow and you had little to do. Most enjoyable was my coworkers and how we all got along."
good,"My two years with Chipotle was very filled with all types of fun and learning. I worked at three different locations and each stores management was different. Now the management was good but each location had a favoritism problem. When I was at my first store they gave me the gist of it all and kinda just threw me out there, but at the same time things I needed to get done were merely common sense and for me were not hard at all and because of that I learned things rather quickly. Why I didn't ever get to the manager position will and can be answered in many different ways but favoritism is the biggest threat of most companies not just this one."
good,"i dedicated my heart and soul to this company because it gave me the opportunity to better myself and others. whether you're seeking a career or just a job to save up money, i recommend chipotle. you will meet so many great people."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "

good,"I enjoyed working for Chipotle, it was an amazing experience for me. Some co-workers was good to be around. I believe I would still be there if things didn't change for the worst. But overall Chipotle is a good company to work for."
good,Everything in there is easy you just gotta put effort into it be fast pace especially during those rushes other than that my crew members were great! including the managers.
good,"In my opinion, it was an excellent first job. It was very team based and speed based. I learned a lot about customer service and how to handle certain situations. The hardest part of the job was trying to go faster when I cared more about presentation rather than speed. The best part of the job was either the other people that worked there or the rewarding experience of bringing a smile to peoples faces."
good,I have been working at Chipotle for almost a mo tj now ans i must say it is a great experience for me so far as it enhances my customer service skills and work experience.
good,"if you need a little pocket money, that is. It wouldn't be my first choice career wise, but if you are just trying to build up and add to your resume then, I say go for it."
good,"Great job, I have learned a lot at Chipotle. Teaching and Leading people in an Empowering way. Being able to connect with my team and set goals week to week."
good,"Chipotle was a fast placed environment to work in with lots of great people. The management always took the time out to help you, especially when we were taught something new. The hardest part of the job was being able to keep up with everything in a fast paced environment if you were not able to multitask. I guess I would say dealing with certain customers would be the hardest part of the job. I enjoyed being in a fast paced busy environment."
good,"I enjoy everyday with my team, it doesn't matter how busy we are we always make things happen! We have many responsibilities, but we work together as a team to succeed."
good,"Chipotle was a great place to work! It didn't work out for me personally due to scheduling issues, I wasn't making enough money for my needs and got offered a job with better pay and ended up taking it. BUT, chipotle is great with their workers."
good,"Consistently busy, but depending how staffed you were that day, it could have been super smooth or super rough. Climbing up to management was quick to say the least."
good,"It is a great atmosphere working there, your constantly on your feet and have to keep up with the fast pace environment with the constant customers. Get place for opportunities"
good,The workplace started out amazing and cozy. Then a new manager came into play that was way to young to be managing a store. Took advantage of her power and made the work place not so comforting.
good,A typical day at chipotle is preparing food for guest. Chipotle is all about a smile and leaving the guess happy! Customer service is definitely the key!
good,"If the back of the house wasn't cleaned at the start of my shift I would make sure it was up to code, before I began my duties for my shift. close or open, At the end of every shift I made sure I set the team after me was set up for a successful shift."
good,Chipotle was a wonderful experience and an incredible environment to work and I had a lot of fun and learned so many new things.  I love the food I love that they were willing to teach us and train us. The managers were very delightful and so were my coworkers.
good,"I enjoyed my time working for the company until new management took over, it went downhill fairly quickly which was unfortunate because I had had months of manager training only to see no advancement because of the new management that was set in place later in my time with the company."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"review my schedule for the day make any adjustments that might be needed with people of food. Always learning from my co-workers better ways to manage and help motivate. Also learn things from my guests. What works in the restaurant and what we can improve on. Run a 10hour shift making sure morning afternoon and evening are set up for the day, the rush and the next day. Running a fun shift, while providing that great experience. The buzz that happens when were all in motion. The hardest is just hearing something that might have been wrong with a customers order. But always making that negative into a positive is a great feeling that the whole team can take pride in. We are like family."
good,Very fast pace work place I learned how to different entry level computers skills with accurate account from operating cash register working very close with supervisor and co- workers to get job done. The end of the day was the hardest closing the store. my customers interacting with them very joyful...
good,"Every morning there was a time frame for each employe. The management was the most talented part, I enjoyed working in the company, it was very challenging."
good,mu typical day was busy and i learned to be very diplomatic when dealing with people. Management sucked. The Assistant store manager was a bully. My co-workers were the best. The hardest part of thejob was my assistant manager was all over me. And the fun part was i got to interact wih customers
good,"At Chiptole, you have lots of room to grow. Depending on how fast you work, how you are with the costumers, how fast you learn, and if you have the drive to preform. Chipotle is a unique nationwide fast-food chain. We don't use factory processed foods or many prepackaged goods. We cook all the food in front of you so you know what you're getting. We prepare all the salsas, lettuce, sour cream everything in back. The only things that we don't ""chop up"" in back is the tomatoes and corn. The co-workers are great, it's honestly like one big diverse family. Don't think that Chipotle is only Latinos and Americans, everyone can work there. Any one from African-American, Asian-American, Mid. East-American, ANYBODY! It really is a great place. The management is also great. They're not your typical managers. They can be friendly and be a friend, to an extent, but, they know how to get stuff done. There really is no way to say what the easiest part of working at Chipotle and what the hardest part is. They're all equally the same. It all depends on if you're a cashier, cook, prep person, dish washer, or a manager."
good,"This job consists of a workplace where I can grow not only professionally but intellectually, where my own ideas are received as well as innovative ideas and knowledge acquired in the past. Where my knowledge and work is appreciated in terms of having an economic stability and security within the organization."
good,A place that show their costomer what is their culture all about and like to give knowledga to the customer to what they are about to eat as well the employee.
good,"I actually loved my chipotle. Great area , great staff , My Team reminded me of family. I loved coming to work. If I could start a new location with the same crew I’d be in paradise."
good,"Overall a fun job. It’s super easy yet very hard at the same time. There’s a lot of work that goes into our food, as we make everything fresh, cut limes, make salsas, marinate our meats, cut all the ingredients, etc. The customers are the ones that usually make the job harder. There is always a long line and you have be be high energy and fast! Overall, the coworkers and managers  are amazing, it feels like a family and everyone gets along. It feels like you’re just hanging out with you friends while you are working. Also good food benefits; Free when you’re working and 50% when you’re not working."
good,pretty stressful sometimes because one minute to the next we get so busy & some of your team members won’t be on their A game & you’ll have to wait & let the line get longer & longer
good,"The entire time I was at Chipotle, I loved the job. It had a very good and healthy energy from the day i started to the day that i left. The job was hard and you needed to be fast but it was enjoyable. The people and managers that i became friends with were awesome."

good,A typical work day was fast fun and enjoyable. I learned how to prepare food and manage my time. Management was fairly okay. Culture was “good”.... but the hardest part was dealing with customers during peak hours of the work day.

This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,A typical day at work consisted of me setting up the front line and then helping customers. I would usually stay at the front of the line to help train any new crew members and keep the shift running.
good,The type of days we got was a fast pace lunch rush. The crew members also showed me how to cut with a knife. I liked working there the customers were nice.
good,I did my review based upon my experience at chipotle. I loved everything about it besides my managers. They had favoritism with other coworkers. The co workers were very respectful and polite.
good,"Overall, this company has really good values and i appreciate how they want to give their employees the best chance to better themselves while bettering their own company"
good,Working chipotle is a very hard job. Especially because  management  keeps cutting hours but keep raising the expectations for the employee. Making working there stressful and difficult
good,were a family at Chipotle we all hate each other but love working with each other idk what else you want me to say why is there a minimum on this my first sentence pretty much sums up everything
good,"A typical day at chipotle would consist of preparing food for the customers, washing dishes and cleaning. When opening we often had to cut and prepare food to be cooked and served"
good,"If you are a people friendly person this place is best for you , you need to be able to cooperate with others and be quick paced. I was a cashier some times other people didn’t communicate well with me down the line and it was annoying but overall it was a good job I quit to pursue modeling"
good,I only worked for a month and it was a great experience. Some companies don’t care about their employees but here they care and we make sure everything is right
good,It was a nice expirience but it was to demanding and too fustraded people would get attitudes for no reason but overal the job was ok i liked making burritos.
good,"a lot of benefits. free food during shift. free food one hour before and after shift. "
good,It is a great way to get Into food business or work in general. You get free meals when working and discount when you’re off. Paid well and good people.

good,Chipotle is a good fun respective place to work at I been working for Chipotle since 2015 an I love it there I enjoy cooking an having fun with the rest of the team
good,A normal day flies by. Management is great and co workers are super helpful. Pay is good but every 2 weeks. Free food while you're working and half priced after work.
good,I have been enjoying my time here and hope that I am able to advance in my career. The management is helpful and constantly available. They are flexible and understanding when life happens.
good,"manager is very helpful He is very nice .I did like the job but i wanted more of a city job The work place was clean, food was fresh, they made sure u had gloves at all times, it was a busy place i enjoyed seeing alot of people"

This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,it could be a lot of fun with the right staff. it gets busy but thats when the adrenaline kicks in. everyone is very competitive. The best shifts are the guys shift and make everything into a scoring contest on who can get the most work done. its pretty lit
good,I enjoy working at Chipotle. It is a fun fast paced job. The customers are enjoyable. And we make bonds with the regulars that come in so they feel welcome
good,"I absolutely loved working at Chipotle. I worked in a very fast and busy place. I work better while under stress. The hours were probably the hardest part of this job. I would close on a Saturday night and then immediately open on Sunday. My favorite part of working here was the employees. I loved every single one of them. I only had a problem with one which was a particular manager. If someone couldn't make it to work that day she would ask me to close and when I told her I wasn't able to, she would roll her eyes at me and hold a grudge. Other than that everyone was wonderful and very helpful in the training process. It would be a great first job or part time job for anyone."
good,"is a fun workplace, i wasn't working for more than 4 or 5 months and became a kitchen manager hopefully going to be service manager soon the hardest part of the job is keeping calm and make sure you are capable of working under pressure"
good,"I was with Chipotle for 4 years, although I didn't receive everything I was offered they opened a lot of doors for me. Chipotle was my first real job and I've met a lot of great people and felt what it's like to work for an amazing company. They care about their employees and offer a lot of benefits and reimbursement for college tuition."
good,Fun and easy environment to work in. Management was always laid back but always made sure the crew got their job down. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with the fast pace during peak times. The most enjoyable part about this job is actually interacting with the customers and providing them with great food.
good,While working at chipotle I learn the essentials in running a business. I had the ability to make my own decisions in the restaurant As well as make The Choice of developing future leaders or firing people that are in the way the vision.
good,Working at chipotle introduced me to a fast pace environment and was my first food services ko I really enjoyed working there and the discounts that were available to the workers. Management wasn’t that great at that particular location beside one manager who everyone loved.
good,Pay was nice but the managers were either the coolest manager ever or a socially inept weird who crawled forth from a swamp. Employee benefits are great though free meal every shift and great competitive pay. They don’t value loyalty though. I worked their for nearly two years and they fired me for a mistake that they never talked to me about and said they did.
good,The grill is one of the hardest yet funnest positions to work at. You need to learn what the Cook-To-Order is in order to succeed in the workplace. Co-workers are very friendly and always supportive.
good,"I actually learned a lot of cooking basics when I worked here. The job is very fast paced so if you know you're a slow worker, I would avoid this job. The pay was good, not great, but you do get a free meal when you work and a discount when you don't. Overall, I would work here again if I needed a job."
good,"Good place to work if you want to have a part time job with no aspirations of growing."

good,You can learn a lot from working at chipotle. when you first start they want you to keep learning more things. I had learned how to do different types of things. i loved the crew i had been working with.
good,"a closing shift is usually getting whatever task you need to get done thru out the day to not get caught up with to much work by closing time which is 9:05 thru out my day i cleaned when ever i didnt have food on the grill because when on grill duty i usually only have to cook foods when needed and temp and taste the quality of it before serving,"
good,"I learned patience and team work at Chipotle. Chipotle offers a friendly work environment, with both the customers and co-workers. The most enjoyable part of the job was face to face enteraction with the customers."

good,It a great place to work honestly. They provide you with a lot of benefits. They are a fast paced type of restaurant and they work together as a team. The only thing I would say they could change is giving more hours out to their employees. I enjoy helping the customers and making sure their food looks good enough to eat.
good,"went well, had a great team, its always good when your team works well together. I love managing its really rewording for me, all the people that i worked with and for were really awesome."

good,"Best job I've ever had. I often wish I could go back. I did have to leave due to a family emergency, and I was looking for another job that was closer to home."
good,needed more organization through the whole restaurant everything was so rushed manager complained we were working to slow closing at night was hard to get every tiny piece of rice off the floor food was great
good,"Very upbeat environment, can be fun while working if staff and manager are in same page. Very good food, clean and tasty. By following directions you'll enjoy making salsas etc."
good,"Very great culture to work in, a lot of room to grow with this company and make great money while working in a stress free environment. I love working for Chipotle."
good,Great employer... Not so great if you have kids. Its an awesome work environment but they demand a lot of time. Very fun place to work. Loved the attention they pay to their customers
good,"It is a very good job I had so much fun and learned so much while working with this company. I felt like my co workers weren't my co workers they are my like friends and family to me. I got along with everyone and including my managers. The people are great the food is great, totally recommend!"
good,I absolutely loved working at Chipotle. I learned so many life skills that have stayed with me. I felt proud of the work I did and made lifelong friends.
good,"The job and the company are both great, however I would'nt plan on doing much else with your days, as you will be quickly swamped by work both in and outside the kitchen. Excellent opportunities to advance, but you must commit to the company."
good,"The only thing I loved about working here was basically the free lunch one would get on their lunch break, because the closing was a mess. Too much drama between employees."
good,"I used to work in that company for many years, and working in that company there are so many goal to achieve and that because that is what I like it of it.

good,"As Chipotle is very well known, it does get pretty busy. The managers are very friendly and everyone has a good time while working. Most enjoyable part of the job is my coworkers. Hardest part of the job is getting rid of the long line."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,I loved working here. With such a chill environment with such geniune people I hated to leave. I made some of the best friends in the work place and they are awesome
good,"Money made working for this company is earned and even easy days  can still prove to be a challenge. I've learned a lot working there, how to maintain constant quality control and how to stay strong in seemingly difficult situations are just a few skills I had improved while working there. Most of the management I feel was rushed into the title due to the lack of leadership positions filled, with that said the managers there worked efficiently and dealt with most issues appropriately. I also feel that there was a lack of some rational problem/resolution issues with those in the management position. The culture and environment being as well established as it was, made me feel excluded from the social aspect of the job due to the lack of the ability to speak Spanish as well as other things. The hardest part of the job for me was back of house and the most enjoyable part about the job was the people working there and the excellent food."
good,"Company chooses the some of the best employees, work as a team. I enjoyed the environment. Manager was great at answering questions when new, makes you feel like family and gets job done."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle would be to clean the store and prep all the food for the day, then serve it to the customers until your shift ends."
good,Such a great place to grow and advance. Take the time to learn everything it will make you a much better employee. There are so many stages to this job and you will really get a great feel for yourself here. You can not fail with their career path.
good,I love chioptle it was a great job it was very fast paced and all the team was working together to make sure the orders were going put correctly and ensure that of the food quality and allergens of the food.
good,I really enjoyed my time at chipotle even though it had to come to an end. I loved working with the different people who had many backgrounds and this one store managed to give them a second home in a way. Work pay was great. You start with 9.15 an hour and then work your way up from there with 25 cents added every month.
good,"Though my role as a cashier was exhausting, the cultivated relationships among my coworkers gave meaning to the time spent working."
good,"Work hard play hard, this company embodies the culture of hard working Americans coming together to accomplish one goal; and by golly they have a heck of a time enjoying themselves while they are at it."
good,I love working there meet new people every day you learn new things see new things they challenge us everyday good place to build yourself you will never get bored something is always happening it's a very good and high energy and volume
good,I started working at Chipotle and grew to love what the company stood for! I also enjoyed how the help me develop into a better leader and trainer! Overall great company
good,"Training as needed, flexible schedule, incredible management and food safety, learned working with a crew and what it was like working in a functional workplace."
good,"I truly loved working for Chipotle. Its really one big happy family there, everyone is very welcoming. A typical day is coming in working to prepare the food before the store opens and serving it to the customer. The environment is very fast paced. Everyone seems to love doing what they do. There is also a lot of opportunities at chipotle. I was working less than a year and was promoted to take-out specialist and received a raise!"
good,"Good job,  good opportunity for grow up , I learn everything,  kitchen , line food  , cashier , dishwasher,  I love this job for many things,  just really fun work"
good,Chipolte is not for everyone. Great family atmosphere. Great team members. Enjoyed working with all managers. Maintained clean work space. Well trained staff.
good,"Typical day at work would be a busy lunch/dinner rush which taught me how to work in a fast pace environment, managers would join in as well If we were too busy or if one person needed help. If you did not know something or needed help you could ask a co-worker and we/they would kindly help. Hardest part of the job was learning everything about the store, where everything belonged, learning every position to become a KMIT(kitchen manager in training) which I actually enjoyed learning If I had to choose which job I wanted to go back to it would be this one hands down."
good,"A typical day at work is coming in few minutes early, change into uniform, head to the back to clock in. Either I would start on server or cashier. Cashier consist of counting my register, making sure I have the default amount (400.00) then I would restock anything in the cashier area. (receipt paper, napkins, trays, soda cups, gift cards, etc) Once everything is set I then can start ringing up orders and using the P.O.S. system. Server consist of restocking my server area (flour and corn tortillas shells, bowls, lids, foil sheets, etc.) I then began greeting customers and asking/making their orders, making sure they have everything they need is their order."
good,would come in and turn on all the equipment in the store. then check out the walk in and make sure everthing was okay and then tart morning prep
good,"I love working here as a college student. They have accommodated to my schedule every semester and was able to find the time that works for me. I've been here for about 3 years now and I've seen many come and go but no matter what everyone that has ever worked here were friendly and brought great energy to work. The work environment is one of the many things I love working here. As a day gets busy or overwhelming, co-workers and managers will do their best to make you comfortable. I wouldn't say the work place is laid-back to the point it's lazy, but laid-back as in, management tries to not make it a stressful place to be even when it does get busy. The hardest part about this job is trying to stay calm during rush or a high volume of costumers coming in at once and still maintaining great costumer service. But even then costumers can be the best part of working here. The regulars that comes through make things better by acknowledging that we are also people and not just someone who makes their lunch. I've been here for a very long time and chipotle has given me the skills to succeed not just at this work place but any where else. I've taken what I've learned here and have applied it to my other jobs and to my school work."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Very busy, and stressful if things aren't in place. Co-workers are very diverse. Customers can be very impatient and rude."
good,"Chipotle is always busy with very little down time. While the daily tasks are repetitive there is always room to learn as well as develop future leaders for the company. The journey to restaurateur is a long and difficult one but in the end will be worth it. I love the people I work with and how they make me a better person every day. The best part of my job is teaching someone how to do something new, seeing the look on their face, and then watching them run with the knowledge they have received. When my employees are promoted to management or take-out specialists it makes me feel like I am making a difference in their life. The hardest part of my job is the inconsistent schedule I keep. I like to know when I will be working and when I will not but when you are constantly short staffed by three or four managers and up to five crew members that is not always possible. It is difficult to make plans with my family when I never know what days I will be working and if I will be called in on my day off or not."
good,it was crazy at cracker barrel but fun. it was the busiest store that I have ever worked at. I got to enjoy everyone I was around and talk to great people.
good,"Had a great time within the couple of months I worked at Chipotle."
good,"Great place to work. The management was great when I was there."
good,A typical day working at Chipotle consisted of fast pace working. I learned how to be a take-out specialist. I learned the right way to walk with a knife when there is constant movement. I learned how to cut chicken and steak the Chipotle way. I really learned the Chipotle way of how Chipotle restuarants are ran. Management was okay only because we went through two general managers when I was there and was on another when I got let go. That location has only been there for a year and it had about I believe a total of four general managers before it reached its one year anniversary mark. The hardest part of the job was not being able to keep up when you have just learned something new and have only worked that station twice. The most enjoyable part of the job was just coming to work and put smiles on customers faces while working together as a team.
good,"Over all a great wrk place, everyday was a challenge whether it be the business or the people . I was personally invested in the growth of each individual on my team. Personally developing managers all while running a business was the most rewarding part."
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how you personally grow and develop. Long hours of work and very fast paced environment. However while working the food was free and the people you worked with were awesome.
good,"I would start the day off by prepping at 7am for what was needed for the day. Then I would work the line or as a cashier, to make sure customers received great service while purchasing great food. I did all around at Chipotle, giving the customers a great experience while eating at Chipotle was my purpose while working there."
good,The place was a horrbile work enviornment. Made you feel so unwanted and not well places if you weren't of mexican origin.
good,I love it. Its like im home having fun but working making the work place a better place. Great employees. Just needs better management.
good,"a typical day would be to come in, check and see who was working on my shift, then print out the PM estimated sales sheet along with the prep sheet. telling me what i needed for the rest of my shift compared to what we had on hand. fill it out and come up with a deployment to get everything finished before peak hours including crew member breaks. count in the safe and my PM drawers, after deployment we would begin to send people home and begin breaking down for closing. i would make sure everything was preclosed and i would count any break drawer."
good,"i learned that i have 13 characteristics that most jobs look for. at work, business was face paced and it applied pressure to your life. the management was good. they just have a very high turnover rate."
good,Chipolte is a great place to work while going to school. Chipolte has always worked with my schedule. I have been in the service industry for many years and this company's work ethic and dedication to customer service is undeniable.
good,i love the job and customers i love the food and the enviroment. i have never woke up and never wanted to not go to work. i love the way they make their food its with love.
good,"Where to start, although it is a kill or be killed workplace it is also pretty fun in the light that you know what your doing and why and not mindlessly slaving away. I feel bad that they let me go, broke my heart but what can I say; if it was bringing my team down and was keeping them from being the best that they could be then I hope that they are better off..."
good,"Great place to work as a team.  Also working in various positions from handling the cash register, ensuring customers orders are correct and dining area is clean."
good,"It was a fun outgoing job that I love going to work. My day may have been frustrating but they always make the day better and the management is perfect I could not ask for anything better, I felt that I have improved as a person and as an employee. Their are always good and bad part to the jobs but for Chipotle I never really found anything bad, I do not regret this job."
good,"Working there was like working at home. It taught me more about how to care about the things i put in my body, how to check food temps, use measuring tools for recipes, and how to manage a store. Co-workers were like family, and let you glance on how others live in life. The hardest part about working there, was not smiling. the energy it brings to give a customer a smile after a long day, makes you feel great! The best part of the job, was being told i was someone to look up to there. Being giving a chance to manage my own section of the store was a great experience!"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,We freshly prepare the food every day starting at 7am in the morning. The cashier would open the door for waiting customers outside waiting for Chipotle to open. The hardest part about the job is cleaning up at night because at times we were there till 1am. The best part about the job is interacting with the customers.
good,"I learned a lot from working at Chipotle, it is a very up beat fast working environment. your sense of urgency had to carry you on throughout the day. Management always had to be a step or two ahead of the crew. What i loved the most is that the management worked among us ,and hardly was ""stuck"" in the office. Co-workers became a second family providing a friendly atmosphere to work in."
good,i really enjoyed working here i was at the start of the line which was awesome because i like to interact with people.....
good,a typical day at chipotle is would be as soon as the doors open people flood in
good,Great company with good benefits and a good work culture. Expects quality results from high performers. Accounting Center is a good place to work for anyone in the accounting or finance business.
good,"Chipotle has taught me so much, I work nights and the crew is great. We've had two different General Managers and they've both made great impacts to the store, the store takes customer satifaction very seriously. The most enjoyable part of the job is training new employee's, being able to teach them skills is something I really like."
good,Chipotle is a fun place to work you need to see how the other side is and chipotle is a experience
good,Working on the line you're responsible for providing the best customer service along with a good steady flow on the food line. You learn everything from toasting tortillas to portioning foods to rolling burritos. Every team member you work with helps you along with your job duties every minute of the work day. The hardest part of the job would probably controlling your stress levels and making sure you keep your head steady while serving your customers. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the satisfaction you get after completing the fastest lunch rush at the same time as you kept your line clean and all the customers were served and happy.
good,"I was anywhere from a cook, to prepping the food, to being up front and dealing with customers."
good,The company is growing daily. There Food with Integrity is by far one of the best parts in there mission statement.
good,"It is a good working place"
good,Good work environment. Great people to work with. Overall good experience no complaints. Everyone was professional and cares deligently about their work
good,Its a very fast pace restaurant so everything needs to be done on time. I enjoy prep and you will have to be a quick learner and must be able to follow procedures.
good,"You get really close to your usual customers and can make them very happy, it's not a bad job at all but people can be entitled, disrespectful, and over the top also working on Halloween will definitely make your legs hurt the next day if you are on cash but the working part isn't bad and quick to pick up"
good,Working for chipotle was a overall good experience .The people were nice and helped me feel somewhat at home while there . It being my first job I learned a lot about how important it is keeping areas clean while preparing food and making sure customers are always satisfied .
good,"The work was fast pace, but once accustomed, procedures became easier and routine. Practice makes perfect. Management was helpful and very team oriented. Workplace culture was conducive for social interactions. Hardest part of the job was the pace that was necessary to maintain. The most enjoyable part of the job was the comradery."
good,"Great place to be at distracts you from what ever, always doing something interacting with customers daily manager doing there job over all good"
good,"A great company in terms of benefits, training, and hands in experiences, however it requires a team effort throughout the whole process. There were a few issues within the rest of the management, lack of communication and assertiveness."
good,The company as a whole is amazing it’s just once your their for a while it gets kinda miserable because they expect a lot of you and sometimes it’s not worth it for what they pay you
good,A typical day at Chipotle would be very fast pace at the beginning of the shift then slow down towards 9pm. I’ve learned a lot about how to communicate with customers and how to attend their needs in order for them to have a go experience at Chipotle.
good,A great place to work where multi tasking is required and excellent customer service is a necessity. I've grown so much as an employee who knows how to better be a valued member of a team.
good,It was a great company to work for with plenty of room for growth in the company. The managers were always available to help us in our daily production and to assist us with any problems that may occur.
good,Getting customers their food and seeing the happiness the food brought them was amazing!  Getting them in & out for mainly the rush hours was fun. Customers were like little kids.
good,"Normal work day."
good,I dont have much to say but it was an good place til gm left. Other then that excellent co-workers. Job was easy if you keep pace team work was key. .
good,Great place to make news friends. Chipotle workers will become your new family. Be prepared to work in a fast-paced and stressful environment. Chipotle also has a lot of high standards that you must meet to work there.
good,Chipotle Mexican Grille was a great place to work . Employees were pleasant and managers made the work place enjoyable.  Lots of benefits and flexible hours.
good,Caring team members and a constructive boss make a workday productive without being too competitive or fast-paced. I enjoyed how Chipotle staff resembled a community.
good,"I got along well with my coworkers. My managers were great, they always tried their best to work with you and help out. Everyone works as a team. If your having trouble, there is always someone there to help out. It could be stressful at times when packed but they train you well enough to handle that."
good,I enjoyed working at chipotle for my short time experience. If i had a chance to work there again i would. It was a pleasant experience and also great management.
good,This job was the best one i had ever had. everyone loved to help you learn and it also taught me many things that help me in life today. the business has high standards that i completely understand and love to teach to others.
good,Like a shot at a new career. You won't be disappointed. I was really excited on the work environment.  They are flexible on the schedule. The training was right on what to do.
good,I worked for chipotle for 6 years I loved working there because they where really flexible with my schedule. My managers where great probably one of my favorite places I have ever worked it’s really easy to move up positions if you do your job ! The only bad thing I can say it’s a really busy business so you will have ALOT of things to do !
good,i didn’t like it because of lack of communication with my managers . it was my 1st job so i didn’t know what to do & they never really helped. i was on my feet majority of the time & we did get a break and free lunch so that a plus. you can’t leave the front during peek to so eh that kinda sucked.
good,"Team oriented, very fun and high energy environment. Food is prepared fresh. Clean work place. Fair breaks. It was a good experience. Definitely good starter job or good for students! Flexible"
good,"It was a good experience, I learned how to run a business and work with different cultures and personalities, I also enjoyed giving great customer service."
good,"Good place to work , very friendly environment , cool managers, team work. "
good,Everyday the team leaders remind us of what should be our main goal of the day and also how we can better ourselves by going above and beyond. To give the customer a great experience.
good,"You learn a good amount of kitchen skills your time there. However, like most places, you'll find yourself doing the work of those who care less than you do. While your success is your own, depending on the restaurants particular situation, it may take longer to generate results due to individual restaurant needs/priorities"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Well working here was a really great job, there is a lot of young people and it very fun. Just that drama does get out of hand so when working here stay professional and try not hang out with so many of them. This store has a bad rep."
good,"An entry-level position, a Chipotle crew member job provides the perfect opportunity to test employment seekers looking for work in the fast food industry. Primary duties consist of taking orders, preparing meals, packaging food items, and ringing up customer purchases. Secondary duties for Chipotle crew members include preparing food and ingredients, opening and closing the store, and cleaning."
good,Great place to work as long as you want to work hard. They will challenge you to do better with your work. Very positive and a place where you can get promoted for working hard.
good,"It is not a bad place to work, especially if you are looking to work a lot and make money it is easy and flexible for college and high school students. The only issue I had was with the management."
good,I loved the people I worked with and always had fun at work but there was always a lot of people working when we only needed 4 or 5 max. I always worked 4-11 and that was just too late to be in school and to get anything done.
good,"We Catered to Costumers of All Ages and Types & my peer Team members were very diverse which showed our costumers Everyone is welcomed ; worked well together thru out the day"
good,LOOOOOOVE working at Chipotle it was one of the best places I have ever worked at . The management was so friendly and willing to help you through anything you need.
good,The work environment is great at Chiptole. Everyone at Chiptole is pretty nice and hardworking people. They do have their own busy periods and non-busy hours. The environment is great to work in and the schedules are pretty flexible.
good,Chipotle is a fun environment to work at. Everyone always has a smile on their faces every shift I have. Managers are always helping you out when you need it and they never complain.
good,Perfecto para aprender como ser organizado y profesional en el ámbito de restaurantes y servicio al cliente.
good,"A typical day at work was very quick and busy, and encouraged team building as a shift was not possible to get through without working with fellow crew members. The management was very helpful and supportive of trial and error when learning the basics of the job. The hardest part of the job by far was learning all health and safety standards since there are so many rules and regulations to remember and abide by. The most enjoyable part of the job was becoming acquainted with other employees because getting along with other employees made coming into a work something to look forward to. Working at Chipotle taught me how to properly handle food, work under various types of management, how to work well under pressure, and improved my customer service skills, and I would definitely recommend this job to anyone."
good,"I enjoyed this job, and it's pretty easy to get good at it. I loved the free meal with every shift, saved me a lot of money. There was sometimes drama, but you kind of expect that at a minimum wage job."
good,I would get to work in the morning and start prepping all the vegetables I would slice and dice onions jalapenos peppers lettuce and also keep up on the dishes as well as the trash.
good,"Lo que aprendí fue a estar en todos los roles de trabajo, y aprender de cada uno de ellos, no depender de los demás, para hacer algo, todo el tiempo fue trabajo en equipo. una experiencia muy padre con un gran aprendizaje."
good,"It is your basic fast food/customer service job. i learned how to handle food, communicate effectively, and deal with loud customers. it was fun but very busy in my area and tiring."
good,"Not applicable or a good place to work at wouldn't recommend the stress to anyone, fast paced rushed environment , fired me for poor workmen ship when i worked over time an did other peoples job was not paid enough own mangers steal from there company!!! do not go here!"
good,"Some of the management was terrible, but it’s a great place to work if you are a busy body. I loved the customers, the gave me a good feeling at work."
good,I liked working at chipotle as a part time job. The pay wasn't bad but I was only 19 years old when I worked there. its not meant for someone who has bills and children. For a teenager this job is perfect.
good,Chipotle offered many day to day benefits such as free meals and discounted food on days off. The company had high standards for customer service and food prep but this was done to ensure quality and safety and was almost always taught and reinforced in a positive manner.  Overall a great place to work and lots of opportunity for advancement at the restaurant level.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Hands-on, productive job. Worked on line, cash, prep, and dishes. Hardest part was working under pressure during our ""peak"" hours. Management was not the best. However, the managers were great to work with. Fun workplace."
good,"It is fun and upbeat and everyone has a positive attitude. Expecting cleaning and a lot of rules for handling food. Customers should always leave satisfied with their meal and as an employee, you are expected to ensure that they are happy."
good,"I stopped working there, but my manager kept on the Chipotle career path and now owns a Cadillac in a matter of about two years. This company IS a regular food industry job, but it IS NOT in the habit of treating their workers poorly."
good,"A great job. Learn how to handle money, prepare food and customer service. I loved  being able to prepare the food and taste it right after. Seeing the customers enjoyed the food made my day because it told me the team and i did a great job preparing the food."
good,It was a good place to work for while I was in highschool. I recommended it to a friend and they also enjoyed working there. Paid breaks were definitely a plus.
good,To be honest I liked working at this job because when it was the busiest time of the day that was the most fun and hectic and memorable time I had at this job! Hard work was the key to making the day go by fast and exciting.
good,"i was a prep cook at the chipotle i worked at and the work was very fast paced and labor intensive. i felt like i was doing more work than other positions. the work environment and culture was nice, the expectations for tasks being done perfectly was intense."
good,In my two years with the company I grew fast and I caught on very quickly picking up skills on the grill and learning my way around a knife I am still employed by Chipotle but I want to grow and learn more in kitchen.
good,"Chipotle is a great learning experience for how to be self-sufficient to support a team. Every shift is a bare-bones number of employees adjusted to business projections. If one crew member is out without a substitute, the entire shift becomes harder and more stressful. Everyone that works there truly feels like a family, everyone looks out for each other and regularly meets outside of work."
good,Chipotle is a great company to work and build yourself and learn more. It is very time consuming if the management is bad. Outside hires make it more difficult and are treated better. You give a lot and get more than the typical restaurant. The standards are very high and I love that I learned so much.
good,Chipotle was probably my favorite place to work. it is fast paced but definitely rewarding. They definetly prefer to promote within and reward hard work. Staff is usually excellent to work with as it is usually a thorough  process.
good,Working at Chipotle was a great place to find a first job. And it was fun too work with other people and be in that type of environment. Getting to know other staff learning about cooking food and just being in the kitchen was a really great experience.
good,Chipotle maintained  an environment set with a knowledgeable management team. Leaders of this stature created employees driven to improve the company.
good,I enjoyed that we made everything from scratch and we worked along side the associates. It was a great work environment and great place to advance. I didn't like the change in upper management and making the numbers became more of a focus than the people.
good,"be fast with the sense of urgency, be very friendly, no negative attitude. keep it safe and always follow the pepper rules. Never ever have a negative attitude even if your joking. always be positive"
good,I worked for Chipotle for 7+ years. During this time the company helped me grow as a person and a leader. They look for people with ambition and show them the path to unlocking your goals. You have to have a good work eithic and a strong drive in working with food with integrity while developing those around you. The hardest part of this job is to find a good work life balace.
good,it was a really nice place to work I just thought they didn't pay enough for how much effort you have to put in and they told me I would get a raise after six months which I never received
good,The workplace is very busy for most of the hours that the restaurant is open.  During peak hours it is important to try to have little to no stress due to the fact that the line should never truly stop moving.
good,"Chipotle taught me how to separate my personal life from my work life so that anytime I went into work I left the negative energy and stresses at the door so I could be the best customer service employee I could be. The management was very accommodating with my school schedule and the pay for the job was very adequate. I am very grateful for the techniques they taught me, which has helped me in every job I have held since and every job I hope to hold in the future."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,The company is a great place to work. Food Safety and Quality concepts are growing strongly into the company's culture. A lot of liberty to make decisions and no micromanaging. Empowerment culture in full. A lot of young extremely talented people. Too bad Chipotle is relocating to a very expensive place. Few will be invited to relocate and less will go to a place that is very expensive.
good,"Chipotle was a challenge and no day was ever easy there, they have very high standards. The benefits are good however after the new CEO took charge things haven't really been the same. It isn't as special or unique of a restaurant as it used to be. No more people culture."
good,i really love working at this place it is so laid back  place to work i really enjoyed  and they have  the best staff ever sometimes i would love to go back and work for them it is a nice place to work
good,"A normal day at work consist of repetitive work if you are on the line, nothing is too hard nor too easy. It's simple, first time may be hard because your just learning, but it does get easier. I've learned more ways to please customers, and to help them get what they want.If there was problems where we couldn't give them exactly what they want, we were taught to, try, or call the manager if we didn't know what to do. The management wasn't poor, we have some pretty cool managers, who like to hang out, but when it came down to business they did not play. Most enjoyable part is just getting able to work for the company, and being coworkers with funny amazing people."
good,"From the time you clock in, until the time you clock out, you are engaged in working hard and fast to achieve your task. For me this was ringing up peoples orders. I had to stay focused and on task at all times"
good,"very fast pace especially during lunch rush"
good,"The working atmosphere was great. All my coworkers were friendly and my managers made it easy for me to be flexible with working hours. The work can get a bit stressful when it is busy but other than that, it is manageable and not to tiresome."
good,"Working at chipotle was really lay back and i get along with everybody i work with so the environment was great to me. When you work well which means do what you gotta do, everybody there going to love you because you doing  what you supposed to do and that helps everybody else with their part of the job. Manager going to lay back wit you and let you take days off if you really need to because you was working hard every time you been there."
good,"In my opinion working at Chipotle was a character building experience that I think everyone should have, working at Chipotle made me open my eyes and learn to take correction and balance my work loads. I really loved working there but one thing I wish I could change is my behavior and attitude towards being redirected and not showing my frustration in a fun/friendly workplace. I am oh so glad that I walked out of Chipotle noticing that I had an issue and changing it for the better for my future job opportunities. "
good,"Working at this company it’s a really good experiencie, since you get to learn a lot about food industry customer service etc.. also the fact they give you the chance to grow up and be part of the family"
good,"Chipotle's fast paced helped me get an edge on real life work experiences. I was part of grand opening when the store first opened in location, i worked more than 8 hours a day and handled a lot of responsibility due to the store being brand new."
good,Chipotles approach is very different than other company’s they want you to know it’s history and become a part of it. So fun and unique . I enjoyed my time .
good,Easy and stress free job where everyone gets along with everybody. Managers are super flexible with schedules and are all very outgoing and positive. You get paid very well for the amount and type of work that you do.
good,"I loved working here! I met some of the best people, learned a lot of practical skills and had fun at the same time! Really god places to start if you are young. Pretty flexible with personal schedules, team-oriented, and you will feel valued. Chipotle is always trying to keep their team happy. Boys: you will be put on grill. Expect to sweat and hate your life, mes your wrist up for life and learn how to grill. Ladies: you will be up front. Cashier is the easiest postion! Get good!"
good,They are fantastic to work with I had a great experience with them. I absolutely loved who I worked with I loved my management! There were not any benefits for working as a crew member. But you were guaranteed hours. They had breaks with a free meal per day when you worked. They have really good food safety had classes that you took for people who have not worked in food service. Training was one on one. Great company to work for.
good,"Chipotle was a good entry-level job that had an easy-going and corroborative environment, as well as an excellent restaurant manager. However, there was some conflict with shift managers that was often overlooked and ended up affected the crew as a whole. These managers were unorganized and barely took the time to train new employees, which was desperately needed since we were so low on staff."
good,A typical day at chipotle was fine the management was horrible because they were young and didn't know how to keep there business up also the job was far so I  have to find another job close to home but the job is fast pace also the co workers work together as a team I would love to work with positive energy and hardworking people as myself.
good,"How the shift goes depends on who is working and how hard. The pay is pretty good but the work expected makes you understand why. You HAVE to be fast paced or you will get behind. When you work a shift with crew members who are confident in their station/knows what they're doing, the shift is smooth and it feels like you have the best job in the world. Other days, if there is even one or two people who aren't pulling their weight/being slow the stress is unbelievable. At busier stores, favoritism is a thing and who advances/gets trained on more stations is based on who the manager likes or ""identifies as a future leader."" At slower stores, there is definitely more cross-training going on but not at bigger ones because they simply don't have the time to train everyone. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people you meet, paid breaks, and free food on your break. Hardest part is starting out and getting used to being in a demanding job that expects you to be constantly striving to get better. What I've learned is to not get butt hurt about being corrected. Constructive criticism is a big thing here and they are always sending out new procedural updates/changes so you will never really know everything anyway. I've had managers who really do what the best for you and help you out/teach you as much as they can and I've also had managers who expect you to know everything from the start. My best advice is if you get the job expect to work hard and have some fun. If you're laid back, this isn't the job for you. Trust."
good,"It’s a good place to work at, it’s stressful and stays busy so make sure you know you can handle it.  The people there are very cool to work with and everyone gets along very well."
good,Very fun place very easy greet guest when they come in  fast pace   Very friendly place . Hot food serve have to pay extra for any extra they also have tacos
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,The job is a great job for students because they re flexible with hours. The help you and work around it to make sure your are still able to maintain school.
good,i learned food safety procedures and restaurant safety procedures. learned various preparation of food in a big volume also how to work the grill as well as food prepping skills.
good,"Working at Chipotle Mexican Grill I gained many crucial skills in the workplace. I learned how to manage in a quick paced environment, always performing tasks while having little to no downtime. All my coworkers and managers were very friendly. Most of the customers were kind, however, I've learned to deal with those who were not. I got one free meal per shift on my break, which lasted 30 minutes for an 8-hour shift and 10 minutes for a 4-hour shift. The hardest part of the job was closing because as a cashier my responsibility was to clean the whole dining area, bathrooms, and restocking all items in the front, not including food."
good,"Chipotle is fun with co workers almost as close to your ages, meaning great co worker connections, so much attention to food quality would have you coming back to chipotle as a customer often than you thinking when comparing chipotle to other fast food joints"
good,"I don’t really have nothing to say it’s a fast pace work environment high energy, gives you hours as long as your willing to work overall good place the problem that I had was racist management"
good,"I think chipotle has made me a better harder worker, id definitely recommend working at chipotle to all my friends. This job is for fast passed workers who like running around and completing tasks in a timely manner."
good,Fast paced team environment.  Enjoyed team members and management were helpful.  Most difficult thing was the schedule was inconsistent so it was hard to schedule school or a second job.
good,"Tough but very fun job once you know what you're doing. Need to be smart to get ahead. Laid back, but fast paced at the same time. Management ends up working crazy hours."
good,At chipotle they encouraged you to talk about the company as well as advance in the company . There was a-lot of room for growth there and you can only advance from with in the company . I can say that they do care about their employees and their costumers .
good,"Chipotle in mentor was one of the best places ive worked at. They gave me as many hours as i wanted, they are a great team and they absolutely care for you there. It is fast paced & bisy but i live for that."
good,"Its a place for someone who wants to advance with the company. Must be fast paced, quick learner. I would say only apply if your willing to work and be reliable."
good,"My experience at Chipotle was a good one. Although its increasing in popularity and the work load can be much at times, the system instilled within the company makes it worth the hard work."
good,"Loved working here the crew was always in good moods and very helpful . Fun working environment , but managers were always being changed and I think that was hard on the crew most of the time because we were always adjusting to their rules"
good,"I loved working at Chipotle as a part time job during college. Management is great, and they really stress the importance of adhering to Chipotle's standards - whether it be food or customer service, we were expected to be on top of it. Definitely one of the better fastish food service jobs you could have."
good,"My typical day at work i would open in the mornings make a prep deployment then start off my prep. I have learned a lot at Chipotle, especially because it my first real job that I have. They have taught me how to cut and dice onions, how to count inventory, and many other things. The Management team is fair, we have our days and I can say that because I am apart of that team. We all get along pretty well. We all have the same desire as the managers. The workplace culture is where is should be . Chipotle is a great place to work at, I've met a lot  of great people there and they make you better as a person and as a worker. They believe in you and instill confidence in you that is why I've stayed at Chipotle for so long. Now its time to move on to what I really want to do. Chipotle can be someone career, they have plenty of opportunities  for their workers. The hardest part of the job was doing everybody else job because the crew didn't finish and as the manager you have to make up for the things not done so that mean staying late and not even getting overtime for extra hours you stayed. "
good,"Great Job and an amazing place to work. Was very intense with a small team, but the culture strives to give only the best to customers. Holding and maintaining a great standard at all times and interacting with customers in a new and refreshing way."
good,The job was easy and fun because most of my employees were my age and everybody was friendly. the hardest part of the job was the rush hour and giving right portion of meat.
good,My only complaint is the manager doesn't work around my family. I have kids and they don't seem to understand that. I have even taken the time to introduce them to my kids and they still schedule me on hours that prevent me from being with them.
good,If you are a hard worker and want to move up in a company this is the place to go! Managers are always giving feedback on your job performance and definitely lead by example by always having a positive attitude and working hard. Loved this job!
good,"a typical day at work is a fun place to be and who you work with. "
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,the people i worked with were extremely nice. The environment was very home like. The work was not hard. Everyone helped out. Everyone is very kind and understanding.
good,"I came into Chipotle very unknowing of what occurs behind those glass windows. The work pace is pretty fast, so it was a tiny bit difficult to learn all I needed to know. I was not really trained at the restaurant I worked at, so I would say that my experience taught me how to become self reliant."
good,"A typical day at Chipotle was very calming & some days hectic. My coworkers were very nice. I learned how to do multiple things in the store. My main job was to work the line. Management was very friendly & nice. The workplace culture was a place I could look forward to going to everyday. My hardest part of my job would only be when learning a new task but, it became very easy once I got the hang of it."
good,i work here for only almost a year it was great learning experience for me it was my first fast food position they have great cross training program where you learn everything with in chipotle from cashier to cook to management its a great place to work
good,Great benefits and a fun and exciting environment.  Very challenging and rewarding. Tons of room for advancement and most promotions are done from within
good,it was a great working experience everyone is always energized and ready to work. they make you feel like you belong eve as a new employee. you always get free food on your breaks and you get a 50% discount as well
good,"If you work hard, you will bear the fruits of your strenuous labor. One thing I have learned at Chipotle, which seems to be a valuable tool, it is the ability to operate in excellence. This job will teach you to think, be, and speak in excellence."
good,Chipotle is a great place to start for a career in food service. You can move up fast in the company based on your performance. Also teaches you life long skills that you can use in your everyday life.
good,Arrive early prepare the sauces and certain foods from natural products. Then prepare your area and provide wonderful customer service by always greeting them with a smile and maintain a professional work culture.
good,"Typical day would be opening up setting my self unto start prepping the product I was assigned to do so, and hep break others. I've learned a lot with Chipotle, I've learned to basic procedures to very important ones that I use until this day. Management was the most amazing, everyone was always very thoughtful, helpful and amazing uplifting spirit. Always very helpful. Hardest part would be when we were at our busiest and i being short staffed, when I was in charge for the first time to handle customer complaints, and in charge of the new hires. It was all difficult, but learned aa whole lot from it. The most enjoyable part was the people  worked with and the experiences I had with the costumers and giving them a good experience."
good,"This company was so loving and welcoming to every employer they had. It was always a fun time to go to work, not many can say that these days. I enjoyed going to work whether it would be a hard day or not. I learned better interaction skills with people and the importance of working hard."
good,It is very fun working there . you can learn a lot of skills. you get raised base on you performance every certain time . You gett free uniforms and fre meals
good,"Chipotle is a fun working environment, fast pace and often busy. It requires high engery and positive attitude.The management team is poorly they do not treat the crew with respect. The most difficult part of the job is able learn how to time your task. For instance you're being time on quick you prep your food freshly. The most enjoyable part of the job is that you can be yourself around everyone with no judgment and the crew are often your friends inside and outside of work. I enjoy working with the crew most then the managers."
good,"i loved working at chipotle , i opened and closed it was a new hands on experience,I learned a lot it was a very friendly work environment it was layed back and very fast past ."

good,"A typical at work went by smoothly the atmosphere was awesome. Customers were even awesome, especially our regulars. The hardest part of the job was the many different cultures and trying to understand their language, but it was also veru interesting."
good,Worked as a line worker. This was a very fast paced job and was a bit hard at times. I enjoyed more of the prep and marinating of the meats rather than working the line but overall it was a fun job.
good,"I love chipotle. It was only my second job. I feel in love with the culture and people really fast. They dont mess around when they say that if you work hard, the possibilites are endless. Alot of people go into this job expecting some kind of management position just given to them, thats not the case AT ALL. You have to earn it. I loved it. Always will."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer.

The managers are there to help us and care about us and help us get better at our jobs. We all try to elevate and improve ourselves and each other to perform well and create positive experiences for the people we serve,"
good,A typical day at chipolte is preparation of the food and making sure everything looked fresh. What i learned at chipotle was to have high standards with it comes to cleanliness and making sure the food was cooked properly. The hardest part of the job is that it was a small crew so it was a lot of responsibility for only a few people.
good,"Chipotle will be life if you choose to take that path. It was like no other work environment ever, very nice place to be. Management was very empowering, co-workers were outstanding to work with,"
good,Chipotle was an absolutely excellent place to have a career with when I was first hired with the company.  Since I have been there the opportunity for advancement has decreased due to the recent battle they have been facing. However it is still a great company to work for short term.
good,You are always moving when it is busy. Management is great and are willing to help you with needs involving work and or outside of work. The crew is there as well to talk to and very friendly.

Food knowledge, Customer service knowledge, workforce knowledge, etc. Coworkers were excellent, everyone is on the same page and at a similar skill level. The hardest part was time management. The best part was the culture of the company."
good,"Chipotle is a wonderful place to learn about what it takes to run a great restaurant, while providing amazing customer service. A typical day at work begins and ends with non-stop commitment to food safety and procedure, while at the same time providing a fun and friendly atmosphere to work in. The hardest park of the job is being consistent. That means being a top performer on every shift that you work. Every aspect of the job is difficult, and it only gets more difficult as you move up and get promoted, adding on responsibilities to your every day tasks. To me, though, the challenge of the job is its most rewarding feature. Since I have worked as a manager at Chipotle, I have learned so many new things in regards to business, marketing strategies, and restaurant management. It also has given me a chance to inspire people and be a leader. Overall, Chipotle is an awesome company that gives room for amazing opportunities."
good,"It's fun to work here. The team is great. The work is fast paced, but fun! They offer pretty Good benefits. You get a free meal, when you work. All in all I like it."

good,"Chipotle cultivates a work culture based on team work and integrity. Information about the stores goals, sales and shortcomings are shared openly among the entire crew. Cross-training in self-sought and encourages employees to be self-motivated."
good,You are always busy which is great. It is fun yet we take the job seriously. Multitasking is a big thing in Chipotle. It's a great place but unfortunately where I worked the management wasn't great and that affected my environment. It affected my life outside of work and I decided that what was being done was not fair and I left the job.
good,I enjoyed working at chipotle while in high school. It gave me a good idea on how to deal with different types of customers. I enjoyed working with the people because they taught me how to prepare all the different foods.

good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Overall, Chipotle has a great culture and is a great place to work when starting off earning job experience. Fast paced but easy to manage, everyone works together like a family."
good,My typical work day consists of coming in conversing with the person I am replacing on what needs to be done that they couldnt accomplish before the end of their shift and asking the manager what needs to be prepped. I either work as cashier prep or serve the food and either position I can accommodate and I always closed the restaurant no matter which position. I learned plenty about food safety as well as counting down drawers and entering all invoices in the system. I had great co-workers most of which I trained so my shift went smoothly. The hardest part of the job was getting the store closed on time I spent most of my nights doing the duties of others because I could get it done fast enough. The most enjoyable part of the job was pleasing the customers I left not one person unsatisfied my entire year of employment and that i wear proudly.
good,"Prepared everything fresh. "
good,I've learned of time management. I learned to work at a fast pace and accurately. I enjoy working with my co-workers. I take pride in my work and my store.
good,"A typical day at work for me varied. I was either on prep or I was doing grill and most of the times I had the opportunity to open other positions such as tortilla and salsa. I learned a lot working there they helped me to better become a leader, helped me to speak up and be more vocal and just gave me the skills and experience that I was looking for so that I can use them in my future career path. management was pretty cool for the most part although I believe things could have been better. My co-workers were awesome people everyone got along great it was like one big happy family. I believe the hardest part of the job for me at a point in time was being vocal and talking more. The most enjoyable part of the job was just being able to have fun and get the job done at the same time."
good,Overall the best job i've had so far. Helped me to further my customer service experience and interact with the public more.

good,"fast-paced, friendly managers, setup or prep while listening to music, serving customers at a position. learned cooking prep skills, customer service experience, cashier, cleaning applications serving, dish-washing, co-working team oriented experience. Friendly, but immature co-workers. Time management was the most difficult task. The most enjoyable part was when you see the customer's satisfaction on the customer service, we made peoples days and I love that feeling."
good,"There was always good communication throughout the work place, everyone always felt included in everything. Each employee had there one personality which brought great connection within everyone."

good,"Its a fun place to work, every worker has free lunch and the Chipotle Redmond has a great team, i had to leave that work because of personal reasons but i really liked to work there."
good,I would go to work and go straight to the kitchen for 8 ours a day i would prep the food for the next day. washing veggies to washing the dirty dishes from the food. i would preform most tasks given at Chiptole dealing with food.
good,"It is a great first time job! It throws you right into learning and honing your customer service skills. Even though I have moved on, I still hold a lot of appreciation and respect for the industry."
good,"I enjoy working in Chipotle, the crew is easy going and reliable most of the time.  The restaurant is full for the most part of the day so the on going rush is continuously.  We remain active providing customer service to each customer that comes to ask for food.  I have learned to prepare food and to work in a rapid paste."
good,"Chipolte was a fast paced work place. It prepared me for hard, strenuous jobs that need self discipline and a common goal to work towards."
good,The company celebrates natural and humanely raised product. They focus heavily on people culture and the way we interact with one another. There is a very deep pipeline of managers up for promotions. Great company to work for but the work load did not equate to the compensation.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"when I was working at chipotle my day was good & some days where bad . the good things was that everybody at chipotle got along and it was a every busy food restaurant and I like busy work. the managers was good , they had teacher me a lot. there wasn't really a hard part to my job that part I enjoyed the most was cooking because it kept me real busy on busy day because it was challenging ."
good,"Great for if you're looking for your first job or something to get you through school, very manageable and flexible. Great pay and people, nothing too outstanding but better than slumming. High Quality Fast Food if you will."
good,"A typical day of work is usually very busy and fast paced. I have learned how to manage my time and patience. As well as devote a great amount of fun and exciting experience for all of our Customers and Crew. The management team is amazing because they are always there to help, teach, and make the crew realize their potential and value by allowing anyone and everyone a chance to succeed and move up. The hardest part of my job is probably remembering all of the recipes for making salsa and cutting sizes, but there is a crew handbook available at all times so I could always refer back to that this way the food never tastes to plain. The most enjoyable part is the atmosphere. Even though I am currently a cashier I have the chance now to become a Take Out Specialist. There is always somewhere to go within this business. I am a person who performs excellent work no matter the challenge, I empower my team by demonstrating fun new ways to get through the day. We are all about Great healthy eating and displaying to customers that they can still have fast food in a healthy way."
good,I have worked for Chipotle for a little while now. I loved meeting new people from costumers or new employees. You can definitely learn a lot from each other and how to build your costumer service working here.
good,"The culture is unlike any other business I have worked for before.  They encourage you through every step of your advancement, from crew member to GM.  The work place is a place of fun, and hard work."
good,On a daily basis we would have a hectic amount of people come in hungry. Of course as a team the service needed will handled if we all committed to our roles. Some days it would be so slow that some of us have extra time to deal with things that we might not get too in a regular day such as extra food prep for the next day.
good," Actively greeted and interacted with customers before and during the ordering process."
good,"Busy day, but great and friendly environment. Lots of opportunity to always learning something new which allows me as an individual to grow."
good,"I loved working at Chipotle, the management was sure to make sure that the work environment was a happy one. When I worked with customers I had a very satisfying feeling when their needs are met and their problems were solved. My coworkers were also very helpful and everyone was very much like a family. When we had new hires I took it upon myself to teach them new things and techniques that would improve their sense of urgency and performance. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the rude customers, however I always found one way or another to assure that our services were above expectations."

good,It was very fast paced and fun. I learned that you always fight for what you believe in. Management was great and ran a tight ship. My coworkers taught me how to speak Spanish and were very friendly. I miss them a lot. The hardest part was losing the job. My enjoyable part  was meeting people with so many different backgrounds.
good,"Customer Service; Interact with customers assisting with food requests "
good,"I absolutely loved this job. Great work environment, awesome employees and management team was great. You would clock in and automatically feel good about what you were doing and about the food you were preparing. We took great pride in our cleanliness and our food preparation. We were all about customer service, and our fast paced service. Management had their good days and bad days but they were always willing to help you learn how to do your job more efficiently.

The most enjoyable part was being able to provide great customer service and produce such great food"

good,A typical day at work included creating a team of top performers who are empowered to uphold high standards

good,"The management is laid back yet on their toes. Everything is expected to be done properly and on time yet you are still expected to have a good time! Being apart of the Chipotle team is awesome, you automatically feel like family and you always receive the most utter respect. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with the business because of how busy and popular Chipotle is it's almost packed all day every day. You will love environment there!"

good,"Fun energetic, providing excellent food and hospitality. Never a dull moment both with customers and your employees just all around Fun job"
good,"Working at Chipotle was a great experience. I loved the customers and the food quality! The only bad thing about this particular Chipotle is that the management wasn't the best. Once we were appointed a new GM he played favorites with employees and it wasn't fair to the crew members who worked hard! When I was first employed it was like a family but once the management started to change, the family became more distant and it wasn't a fun place to worked. It seemed as if no one wanted to really wanted to work. But I learned to keep smile on no matter what because at the end of the day, the customers are our main priority and serving food with integrity is what we are really there for."
good,I learned so many ways to cook Mexican food. My co workers were fun to work with. I was always laughing. They made me feel important to the team.
good,"Work day included prep of all salsas, chicken, steak, salads and onions. Management was never really around to help our store get its feet together. Hardest part of the job was finding good talent that would stay to become management. Most enjoyable part was probably experience in opening 2 restaurants."
good,"Day goes quick, great food, good benefits, good pay, good company culture."
good,"working at this compagny makes me improving my skills."
good,I always looked forward to going into work because it was a place where you could be yourself and have fun while working and dishing up customers food items. Every body had the opportunity to move up to a higher position if they showed they had the ethic and wants for the position.
good,"Chipotle is a great place to work at. Over all everything is pretty much fast and easy, you just have to be really fast ."
good,"Being a cashier was probably the hardest job in the restaurant because they were responsible for everything such as cleaning the dining hall and restrooms, preparing food and checking it out, refilling utensils, etc. Overall, the job was fun"
good,"Fun and honest place to work, working shoulder to shoulder with crew and managers; see the progress of others and help them to achieve their goals,hear customers complain about prices was not so delighful but on the other hand, see them coming almost everyday for lunch or dinner was a great deal at the end of the day."
good,A typical day at work consist of assisting customers with making their meals.
good,Great Job new management came in and alot of people lost there jobs.
good,I love the crew that I worked with including management. I love how Chipotle kept to their expectations when it came the food service.
good,Chipotle is a great place to work. I met all kinds of people and served to the fullest of my ability. They have great work ethic and team spirit! I am thankful for the time I spent with Chipotle.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,They treat you like family great place to make you feel like home and a awesome place to work at...you learn alot your less stressed out and the best part you dont clock out unhappy you go home feeling successful.
good,"Fast paced workplace with great management, respectful co-workers and clean enviromment. Their culture is based on the cleanliness of the workplace and the safety of their employees."
good,Great company friendly crew..I love it there.always how in with a positive attitude ready to learn anything they are willing to teach..great for collage students willing to work around school schedules..they really care about there employees.
good,overall great place to work MOST of the team was great! It was busy just like every other food place! As for management they should communicate better with each other!  And if theres someone that need to be address for something it should be done to that person so they can work on it Not everyone ells but them!
good,"tasks were easy and straight forward and its "
good,"Don't try to work here if you plan on being on your phone or walking/taking your time at work. This is a fast-paced job, where you have to improve and get faster everyday. Every task you do will be given a time limit that seems near impossible to reach for the amount of work you'll be doing, that's what makes succeeding here so great. If you prove to have a great attitude, you're on time and you're fast & clean, you will be promoted- or transferred for a promotion. Pay is good (even better at at a store that's struggling so I'd look for jobs there first, if you don't mind the extra hours). This job is great for those who like a challenge and if you really want to succeed at it, you will. Everybody who worked there was like a family."
good,"Everything about the company is amazing , the management for the stores can vary in likability. I did truly like my experience with chipotle, they were very kind to me knowing it was my first job."
good,Staffing is amazing and fun to work with. Amazing experience and family comes first in this company and that was a big plus in my books. Only bad thing was it was only part time.
good,"The company is amazing. The benifits are great. if you can deal with the stress of a kitchen go for it. But a word of warning, I worked under one GM for 2 years who was amazing. She left the company (on good terms) and was replaced by a mildly incompetent, passive aggressive one with poor communication and leadership skills. Everyone with any sort of seniority left with our old GM, except me. Moral tanked and the place suffered. Long story short, in the interview go with your gut. If you dont like the GM interviewing you you probably wont like the job."
good,"I learned allot about food at chipotle. Such as food safety, knife skills, and temperatures of foods. I had a great time at chipotle but management gives close to no money to general managers to give to employees for raises."
good,"Easy advancement, flexible hours, the crew was very encouraging. I advanced in my to spanish mostly here. Uniforms were comfortable, closing was just always a nestle, but they just liked it done right."
good,"A typical day at work would be a very busy day. The lines would always go out the door with customers wanting food. Just when you thought the line was going to go down, it doesn't, more and more people come swarming in. But we held our ground and did not give up."
good,Working at chipotle teaches you several things including working with food safely. We provide fresh ingredients every single day. From the start of the day we begging to prep and cook in order to have a successful day of happy costumers. Working with such a motivated team makes this job as enjoyable as it can be. Everyone gets along.
good,A very busy place to work you stay on your toes but a great places to work .The people are nice and fun to work there! And also have a help u with school program thats great so you can go to school and work and they pay part of it.
good,good environment and team members. Everyone was helpful and understanding. the customers were regulars and the management was extremely kind and friendly
good,"It's better than any fast food, besides in and out.  It's also paid breaks too, free food as well. The employers are pretty good people and most are great to work with."
good,"co workers were great management sucks. I was over scheduled, management asked more then time could consume. for example if your not a cook or cook prep you should not be handling food till it's on the line, I had managers asking to do 5 things in once to be done within 30 mins."
good,"Working at Chipotle was fun and gave paced. You were always encouraged to do more, learn more and be more than what you were when you started. A management position can be easily attained with sweat equity and eagerness to learn."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotle is a very busy place to work, your are always on your feet which can be a good or bad thing. When working here if you put forward your best efforts you will find yourself learning all new things in the kitchen and eventually may find yourself in a management position. The thing about the management however is that it can make or break your entire experience. Besides that the workplace culture is pretty fun, you will have people you do and do not enjoy working with no matter what location you go to, The hardest part of the job however can be dealing with other employees that are incompetent or rude. Working alongside hard workers that treat fellow employees with respect is by far the best part of the job."
good,I love the work that is required of me. And I have a great support team at work. I’m taught what I don’t know with out any judgement. The safety of customers are amazing. As well as the health of the employees.
good,I really enjoyed my experience and learned from working there. It was a great first job and i liked every day there. The management there was very understanding and reasonable.
good,"Although my time was brief at Chipotle it was a very fun job. I got along well with all my coworkers, I was able to learn everything in the kitchen and on the register."
good,"Good work environment, not enough hours but I’ve really enjoyed working there overall. I even learned a lot and I’m grateful. This was my first job and it really taught me necessary skills"
good,it was pretty easy day by day doing the exact same things whether it was doing prep for the next day or cooking the food as well as serving the food  and being the cashier. i definitely loved working there just because everyone was treated greatly and over all felt like a family
good,"The managers were godsends. They didn't treat you like you worked for them. You worked with them and that's how it felt. Very clear training and positive learning experience. Strict health code and regulations but this never got in the way of employment. Amazing co-workers who really cared about you and would not hesitate to make you feel like family. If you get this job, don't leave. Best work experience I've ever had."
good,"A typical day at work was a lot of waves of fast paced work and leisure resting time in between. The local was near a few schools, a gym, and work offices meaning there was distinct groups of people coming in at certain times. My only distaste with Chipotle, and it's more of personal experience and not necessarily relating to all Chipotles or Chipotle as a company, but my religious days were not respected. I'm Jewish and I was scheduled to work on my holy day and several holidays. While the schedule could be changed when asked, I went into the job making it clear that my weekly holy day I would not be able to work, and that request was not respected. That was my main reason for leaving Chipotle, but as I said, that was a personal experience with the Chipotle that I had worked at and not my opinion on Chipotle as a whole."
good,"Chipotle offered great opportunities to move up if a person was motivated to do so.  The benefits to entry level employees far exceed expectations including health insurance, 401k, etc."
good,I loved working there but they hired some new people which were my “friends “ and they thought that cuz we were friends it wasn’t necessary to take the job seriously and made me do everything myself.
good,nice place to work. people are great and nice environment the company has some awsome benefits as well. managment  is very well established. working with customers is a awsome experience and chipotle is a great way to start
good,"I was a kitchen manager and I really enjoyed working at Chipolte, upper management was fantastic, we were like a big family. I was always excited to come to work. There is always room for advancement."
good,Very great for first job Team Players Graat leadership different position you can learn new things everyday when learning bout the whole store great history and learning about the store
good,Great work environment.  The company expanded very quickly and it shows.  They need to slow it down and focus on getting more consistent at executing systems at the individual restaurant level.
good,"It is good working environment to high school students; however, I am looking for a more stable income job. The manger is flexible with schedules and highly understanding to emergencies."
good,"Amazing work environment with fantastic coworkers, management however does not seem to be too interested in the work struggles that fellow employees have."
good,"Chipotle has a bubbly atmosphere. It’s very social. The managers aren’t very hands on, but they are very good at tossing blame around. But they are all good people."
good,"Welcoming staff, very helpful , very kind. Loved working here wish I could've continued! Plenty of room to grow which is the very best part of the job"
good,"You will get hours and other benefits. But can be very stressful if you don’t know what your doing. "
good,"Loved working at Chipotle... had some G.M. issues..."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"The best place for a first job, or if you’re just looking for something part time this is definitely it. It’s a lot of room for advancement you could literally be on cash one week and a manager the next but you have to know all of your “  chipotlogy lol"
good,"Working at Chipotle is what it is, it is difficult and they require you to put in a great amount of work if you are working within any role in the restaurant. Usually very good about scheduling and allowing you to tailor your hours to best fit your needs. Worked there as a college student and was able to balance work and studying fairly well. People were also excellent, and management was very kind and hands-on, despite being somewhat inflexible on most day-to-day functions."
good,I enjoyed working for chipotle. I gained alot working for chipotle and dont regret anything. The company gave me great benefits and opportunitys and was a life changing experience for me.
good,It was a good restaurant job it not fast food but it's not a full restaurant eithier. The food was great and the crew was super friendly. This was my first job.
good,"It was a face but fun place to work. You are expected to put in work, it's not easy but you end up loving it. It is expected you show improvement but with the right leaders and trainers its easy to really get the hang of it and improve quickly."
good,Everyone is always helpful and super friendly so the work area was fun. I really liked it even though it was fast paced it was a fun experience and I met fun people.
good,i was kitchen manager there for a couple of years and i have to say even though it was a tough job at times it was the most fun amd most rewarding job ive ever had.
good,"I originally planned on working full time but had to leave due to sudden change of plans. During my time, at Chipotle, I was met with cohesion in a positive environment. Would work their again if possible."
good,I loved working here it was so fun and such a rush. Its hard work and pretty busy. Great people. The customers can be rude and you arent allowed to stand up for yourself but over good company to work for.
good,I was able to work with an awesome management team. The crew was a pleasure to work with. Very energetic and willing to learn and provide great customer experiences.
good,"Very quick paced."
good,the place was a nice vibe but the advice they give they dont always keep their word and then they turn the story around like your a bad guy. after i got back from being very ill i was not gonna get my job back.and that made me look at chipotle in another  sense of looking and i was very unhappy.
good,It was really fun to work at learned alot of stuff. Learned alot of stuff like cutting and preparing food overall I learned alot about cooking food and keeping it at a right temperature.
good,"Chipotle has a very efficient front and back of house system. My responsibilities varied, whether it was organizing and putting away truck orders, running grill/prep/line positions, training new hires, or maintaining facilities cleanliness and parts replacement"
good,nivel de trabajo exigente con altos estandares y calidad.
good,"Working at chipotle is a great first job in my opinion. They really teach you what it means to work with food while at the same time how to deal with certain types of customers. overall, its a really great working experience."
good,The job environment is very good. Standards are very high and met on all pillars. Very professional and runs smoothly. Training is thorough and team effort is 100%. Management is good. Pay is above average and benefits plus bonuses are very good. The only qualm is the low number of stores in the state and thus limited opportunity.
good,"The thing about Chipotle is that it depends on everybody to be equally engaged, focused, and driven. If one person is slacking or falling behind, the whole business suffers. I was lucky enough to work with an excellent team that gave me a taste of what it was like to do top-notch work. I had worked in foodservice before and had a pretty negative opinion of it. Having a competent and motivated team, however, changed my mind. Working with people who want to do their best is rewarding and enjoyable."
good,"I learned a lot working in chipotle, gives me an good experience and amazing people to work with .  Good chances to grown on a chipotle career ,  great oportunities to grow ."
good,The Chipotle in Walnut is always crazy busy. There was never a time you had nothing to do whether it was preparing food for customers or keeping the environment clean. Time went by really fast every shift especially because of the friendly and outgoing coworkers. Only complication was the hundreds of customers you would encounter on a daily basis.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Chipotle will always be one of my favorites. Your guranteed ro get full while saving a little money because the food is fairly priced. The customer service is what stands out to me they're awesome!
good,"Excellent fresh ingredients restaurant. The food is amazing and our automata are even better. We woke in a fast pace , cleasiness , and positive attitude"
good,"Chipotle Mexican Grill is definitely one of those jobs where the people you work with determines your overall experience there. Luckily, the hiring process is taken very seriously and everyone hired is chosen for fulfilling Chipotle's goal. I'd highly recommend applying and getting the opportunity to create your own Chipotle experience."
good,"I’ve learned a lot from chipotle,as well as being in the kitchen to approaching a customer with kindness under all circumstances.Its a nice fast moving environment almost all the time!."
good,"Working in this company was my favorite thing I did in my life, I learn a lot of things, specially English, I find myself being a manager, and I find myself running shifts, developing different skills as manager, and I’m so grateful with this company."
good,"I had fun every day while working there and the staff definitely were more caring that i expected. i communicated better, the most enjoyable part of the job was cleaning and being able to get to know the coutomers"
good,"When I was there it was a great company to work for,they promote within and the crew seam to be really happy, pay was not great but the opportunity to Advance was great."
good,"I loved working there, but the managers never communicated to us how we were doing, or if we had any complaints from customers, and i just never got any feed back on how i was doing. It was very disappointing and i felt was very unprofessional. the company was great, the managers were not"
good,"Stars bright and early, around 6 am. Make all the opening food for the first shift. Gets busy as soon as the store opens and no one sits down until after 1:30 pm. Time flies because its so busy anyways. Set up for the next shift from 2-4 and then you're done! The hardest part would probably be how fast paced it is or the fact people are really upsetting. Managers are constantly being switched around or ""let go"" so don't connect too much with them, but definitely develop a good rapport but it helps. I love how everyone gets along there and it doesn't work if not everyone is a team player. It forces everyone to get along and its nice."
good,"clean, productive environment. i love the music they play during shifts, uplifting management from when i was working anyway, now might be a bit more intense i've heard. very good for challenging work ethic, productivity, results and overall skill and dedication to advancing"
good,I loved the experience that I gained from Chipotle.  I got frustrated with not being able to make changes to certain things because of the rules even though they didn't follow the rules above management.
good,Making sure the all the food on the table was clean and prepared right. Greet every customer that comes in and giving them the best bowl or burrito that they have asked for
good,Chipotle was an easy going job it was not stressful. The manager was very good at managing the restaurant and made sure everyone was doing their jobs.
good,"a typical day at chipotle is arriving in a good spirit ready to work and ready to learn a new position, putting customers first and making they're day! , I've learned how to roll burritos , and make quesadillas ..also learned how to cook the food from scratch! , the hardest part of the job is keeping up with everything work..keeping it clean..serving customers.. and doing your job. but its worth it. the most enjoyable part of the job is accomplishing everything i mentioned!"
good,My experience at Chipotle Mexican Grill was a good one to obtain. I worked a good amount and balancing work and school was sort of difficult therefore I felt a bit more prepared for life once I got out of Chipotle. I developed many close relationships with staff members and my managers who were always on top of their game working to make our location the best that we could be.
good,"started as a cashier, then line cook, "
good,"Working at Chipotle was stressful at times during busy hours, but otherwise it was an organized and fun environment with the right managers.The hardest part as a cashier is to maintain a clean lobby and closing the restaurant."
good,"fast paced, stressful customers, great teamwork, collaborative teamwork, great training, disrespectful manager, diverse employees, food prep, time management."
good,"Working at Chipotle in the mornings is great. The management is great, they study the peak hours to be able to schedule you the correct amount of hours based on labor throughout the week. "
good,"This job has been good not only to help me advance my experience, but it also has helped me out in a lot of ways. I’ve never had better managers and a more flexible schedule."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Fun to be around coworkers"
good,Everyone is enthusiastic and it is a great place for beginners at a food place. It is a good place for students as their availability can be flexible.
good,That place was such a great place to work and build up confidence and later on meet many people that I can call my friends and then later on learned many skills.
good,"There’s days that chipotle would get really busy depending where you’re located, so you have to be rushing with you’re crew and still provide a great customer service."
good,Chipotle had just opened the first store down in New Orleans. When opened business was crazy busy. The management staff was always ready for the rush had the most positive attitudes. They followed a mission everyday to keep the crew motivated. They also applauded their crew on how great they were doing. The experience was everything .
good,"There's different things to do while working here. Depending on your position, things get easier and it's fun once you get to know your coworkers because they treat you with respect."
good,"My Chipotle was much more fast paced from open to close, since it was in the middle of a college town. It was very hard to be prepared when there were constantly ingoing and outgoing customers."
good,"Chipotle is a great job opportunity to grow in, meet"
good,"Chipotle isn’t an easy job let’s start there ,If your lookin for an  steady pace job chipotle is it.Very Friendly environment if u love serving u customers happily chipotle is the job for u ."
good,"Very fast paced especially during rush hour! When closing every worker cleans their station and is expected to be quick. Line server typically gets 9.25 in TX and cashier .25 more!! "
good,"This company is not for everyone. It is demanding and can be stressful at times. Policies are being changes constantly so you have to keep up. Just work hard and you'll be fine. I am thankful for everything they have done for me but we still have room for improvement.  I would recommend this company to anyone that is starting off in their career to develop essential skills such as team building, training, and customer first culture."
good,"What I love most about Chipotle are the people.  The team is your family.  You make life long connections to the people.  Working in a Chipotle is not for everyone, but for those who have the opportunity to work with one you will become better."
good,"I love working at chipotle for only one reason and that is the people who work there. If it wasn't for the fact that everyone there has such amazing and fun personalities I would have never lasted this long. Chipolte is pretty stressful and tiring when it comes to working but the people there make everything so much better. If you work at chipotle you will fall in love with your job and it will become hard to quit, just because of the people there."
good,"I feel like it’s was a fast working area always had to stay on your toes."
good,"Plenty of room for advancement, good team environment fair management staff, and an overall good place to learn.  I was able to learn a lot about working in the food service industry. I was not limited to just one job, I was able to do multiple things for various jobs and moved up very quickly."
good,"I was terminated because got promoted to a position where I worked and then a new policy required my position up to have a background check ran and my mistake I made year's ago had me terminated. But, people like me are always judged and well I continue to fight the good fight!!!"
good,One of the best companies I've ever worked for.  They promote from within and they teach their crew members how to master the business.  I highly recommend working here.  But I can't believe they hired the CEO of Taco Bell.
good,"My co-workers made the job fun. It is quick paced, but it made the time go by faster which I enjoyed. One thing i didn't like was that sometimes I had to work really late and I had to give up time with my friends."
good,"Very relaxed and fun to work at chipotle, co-worked are very friendly and fun to be around. Everyone likes to help one another and very fast pace at rush hour it can be stressful"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Great place , great food, great management. I really can’t complain about this place. They never seemed to let you down . It’s very nice place to go to"
good,"I think chipotle has made me a better harder worker, I definitely recommend working at chipotle to all my friends. This job is for fast passed workers. Completing tasks in a timely manner."
good,On a typical weekday you could expect a lunch rush just under three hours long. I learned skills with knives and proper handling of food. Management was always supportive and expected excellence every shift. The culture was being speedy but efficient. It was all about unforgettable customer service. The most difficult part of the job had to be rolling a burrito with all eyes on you. The most enjoyable part of the job had to be eating my own food that I would cook.
good,The way chipotle take so much pride in their food make you love food more. The Shift FLY by very fast cause you never stop moving. Free Food just only ONCE! :'( you get TIps! I wish i had a chance to put my two weeks in...
good,I loved working there I was 19 when I started and by the time I was 22 they made me a Gm. Its a place where if you put the work in you will be rewarded.
good,"Not only is chipotle one of the BEST places to get fast food , but we are always having fun with our customers and staff to make sure everyone is having a good time but , that our work is done."
good,I believe that chipotle was an good environment because everyone came to work ready to work and everyone dud there part which made to company run smooth
good,Always on your feet always smiling always moving anyone can interact with guests the food is amazing its a fun place to work depending on who you are working with but watch out for the ones who smile in your face and talk behind your back!
good,"I started at Chipotle on the morning shift, prepping for the lunch hour. Dicing jalapenos, opening tomatoes, all for the famous guac. After prep was complete, I would clean my station and load the fresh meats and veggies into their assigned slots, ready for the lunch rush. Once my shift was complete, I made sure to restock the coolers so the next teammate on the line was fully prepared for the dinner rush, minimizing confusion and waiting time. The workplace culture consists of laughter, teamwork and determination. Working together as a unit created bonds from countries all over the world, and I'm grateful Chipotle game me the opportunities they did for me to advance my career"
good,"Chipotle is a super easy place to work. I would recommend this to anyone. Every wants to see you succeed and a lot of the management is promoted from within, which I think is awesome. But the management I experienced was not the greatest unfortunately."
good,Love Chipotle the manager at the time was rude judgmental and very disrespectful to certain customers never helped around the store when we short on staff.
good,"Great work ethics, high energy and fast paced. They have training to get you on Management level if interested. Equal opportunities employers and flexible schedules."
good,"Everyday I learned something new because there is always room for innovation. The corporation, itself, does have set policies and procedures, but they are not too demanding or hard to follow. The workplace culture is built to be like family and to empower everyone. It does not always happen that way, as people are different and personalities can clash, but overall the management team does a good job at hiring the best fit for the crew."
good,Love the job and the people. The job was very fast- paced and enjoyable. A little stressful but that's typical. The management was great. I felt like I was part or the family right away. The managerd are very professional and hard working. A typical day at work was quick and simple. I learned to really be dedicated to customer service and improve customers experience. Very friendly and family-like. Highly recommend.
good,"Our GM was currently replaced and the new manager works us to the bone in an understaffed store and isn't there for the team when we need him. If he isn't in the store he wants nothing to do with us. I love the company, but the lack of real management is horrendous."
good,Since the moment I have arrived at chipotle I have experienced a fun place to come to work and use my skills. I have moved up quickly from just a team member to now general manager  no real complaints about working here
good,its a great place to work but management needs work the employees are great with the normal lunch rush people who come in the work invierment is also great
good,"Overall I loved my experience working at Chipotle. My coworkers were super easy to get along with and they worked very hard. My managers delegated very well and encouraged the team a lot. They also lead by serving us and doing a bunch of the hard work. For me, I knew it was a temporary job so I didn't put in a lot of hard work in an effort to advance in the company. But, there is a lot of potential at Chipotle to advance and grow."
good,Chipotle has cut-throat hiring standards but it is for an amazing reason.The staff there was absolutely astounding while the manager was sweet and understanding all while being hard on you to learn all of the rules and standards that the company of Chipotle holds all of their employees to. The location I worked at was Restaurateur status and I can completely understand why.
good,"Typical day would be creating and delivering an excellent guest experience while maintaining proper food safety policies and procedures. Ensuring that the food looks and taste delicious, making sure the feel of the environment is alive and  that the flow of the customers is at a fast pace."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Just had great managers. Loved the vibe of the stores. I think that Chipotle  would be a great place to work if the pay was raised or commission involved.
good,"Management works well with school schedules or any upcoming events. Not really a duty specific work environment, mostly crew members who are crossed trained to work any position and time."
good,"- Typical day at work= Cashier, come in stock up soda machine and walk-in, perform cash transactions, close the store"
good,"Chipotle is a fast paced environment filled with friendly faces and great food culture. You'll find employees bustling around preparing what they need for the day, keeping the store in top shape, all while keeping customers happy during their stay."
good,Chipotle is a great job to start off with as a teen. Very flexible hours as well as a great staff. Management was excellent and the store specifically that I was a part of always received great reviews.
good,"Typical day- For grill you just need to help out with some prep stuff which is easy"
good,"Westwood, MA Chipotle was one of the best jobs I have ever had. However, they could not get my schedule straight after many weeks of begging and asking them to change it the kept it the same so I decided to leave the company"
good,Chipotle is an amazing company to work for. Chipotle takes care of each and every employee that works there. They also take care of each and every customer that comes in the store. Chipotle based it's business on the organic food that they sold. Everything in Chipotle was organic and did not attain any growth hormones before being sent to each store.
good,"The job was rather tedious and had to make sure everything was done correctly. A typical day starts with preparing the food required in the mornings. Things like the lettuce, cilantro, and onions are done first to make sure the evening crew has enough."
good,Working at Chipotle is a good job. I learn how to run a business and work with people and build the crew members up. I learn how to have great customer service along with taking care of any issues they may have.
good,"It felt like family to work at the Chipotle I did. Every day was filled with laughter and smiles, even during the stressful times. You also learned proper food preperation down to handling the knives correctly. Overall great place to work."
good,"Great people and great vision. My first job and they trained me in the line, prep, grill, and cash. After 1 year I became a take out specialist and a kitchen manager in training. They are really great and motivational, also they offer many chances to gain raises and promotions. They work hard to allow the crew members to move up in the system. They do expect people to give the job some priority and occasionally can expect people to stay later than scheduled."
good,"Working for chipotle was an awesome inviroment and awesome job to juggle between school and everyday life. A lot of things anyone can learn in this company, also an awesome part time you could turn into a career."
good,It was usually a very busy place. We needed to know knowledge about the company. Coworkers and management here felt like family. The most enjoyable time about the job is when the holidays come around the corner. People make your day go by quicker since it gets so busy.
good,"I love working to Chipotle. The atmosphere is full of happiness and energy. They train new employees very well."
good,"Starting at everything was pretty good, I was one of their top employees and even set to become a manager soon. The downside was that they wanted you to figure it out on your own without their help."
good,"Quick but not easy job handling with sauces and burritos. Very good quality food, everything is fresh. Managers work with you and understand your learning level."
good,"this job taught me the skills I would need to become the top performer I am today. becoming a top performer wasn't an easy task, I had to push my way up and be eager to thrive and be willing to speed up my skills and get more organized at the same time try to teach my co workers below me to try to do better than me."
good,fun to work here if you are with the right people. If you work really hard moving up in the company is very possible. the company does make some of the day to day task more difficult than they should be but they said earlier this year that they were going to change some things.
good,I love this place! I love my coworkers as well as most of our customers. I love how we take pride in our food and being able to make someone's day just by preparing their meal. The family type atmosphere is undeniable and we all love one another. By far the best company ever!
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Normally for me, a typical day at work is once you come in on time, clock-in . Put on the apron , wash your hands & proceed to your station that you are assigned in.Unless otherwise . My experience with working for Chipotle Mexican Grill is I've learned new tasks everyday. It may be difficult at first but once you get the hang of it you'll be just fine. There's not one thing I like about the company or my surrounded because I love working with wonderful co-workers. We make it fun at work and always good vibes. If there was one thing, I didn't like was some customers can be rude but that's how every job is."
good,"With knowing that Chipotle is a very popular restaurant, it was very rare that we had a slow period.Even with that being said I always remained positive and so did my team. It was understood that the customer comes first and should always feel comfortable and welcomed. It was also understood that our team should be filled with top performers and low performers would not be tolerated. Working for this company gave me great work ethics and customer service experience."
good,"Work is easy, you are trained to work in a station and once you master it, you get trained onto the next and are apart of a team that does the same thing. Once you become great at all tasks promotions are pushed forward. Management team is great and know what needs to get done. The hardest part of the job is the repetitiveness, some say that is a good thing. The free food when working is a great plus."
good,This job helped me gain experience in customer service as well as become a fast-paced learner and quick to provide excellent service. Prep work in the morning is on a strict time schedule before the doors open. Co-workers are easy to talk to and everyone knows their specific duty.
good,Was a good company to work for and was trained in other jobs besides cashier. It's very easy to move up. They also are very good with working with your schedule. Everyone is is very respectful and work well together.
good,I don't really have none. I just loved the position and pay. I enjoyed being trained in different areas of the store. I just wish that I could of stuck it out with my pregnancy and that the manager was more understanding.
good,I worked here right after I graduated from high school and the crew was made up of a bunch of fun people from different backgrounds.  My Spanish speaking skills drastically increased after just a year.
good,Love the knowledge instilled and how detailed they are on procedures and rules. Learned alot about the work place and what it neans to have empowerment and leadership skills.
good,The people I worked with were great and made me love going to work. The work environment was always so upbeat and all team members were very positive. They definitely were a team of all top performers
good,"when I started at chipotle, I was working prep and grill. I came in at 8am sometimes 7am to start prepping for the day. when we open at 11am I was working on grill or the line sometime."
good,always there for employees ensure restaurant needs run the place smoothly but constant busy. manage 30 employees. do schedules hire and train new employees. responsible for inventories.
good,When i walked in before starting i prepared the food that i was assigned to do . At 10.30 i counted my cash draw up to 500 each day . Then i would tell customers would they like at chips or anything to drink then gave them total they gave me credit card or  cash . Co workers always happy and ready to teach someone something new .  I learned how to smile a lot and roll a burrito and making a bowl. The hardest pat was marinating the meat . Enjoyed meeting new people.
good,"managements okay, procedures are a little strict. the food is great but its definitely a lot of work. great opportunities for advancement"
good,"N/A"
good,"Overall great place to work, although the compensation is not very high.  At times, scheduling and personality differences cause immature rifts.  The company preached empowerment, which is a great concept, except poor execution by the majority of the management staff leads to entitlement and overall, hostility,"
good,"A typical day at Chipotle was super busy. At this business I learned you can enjoy taking care of others, I learned how to do extreme multi-Tasking. The hardest part of the job was the amount of customers we had a day and being able to prepare all of he food on time."
good,"An awesome work environment, everyone being helpful to each other. The most fun I had was working with the customers and trying to make their day. Not only that working with my crew on the line and being able to talk to my managers openly. Everyday was a challenge for me as in learning something new everyday."
good,"I admire what this company stands for and am proud to be a part of it's initiative to promote the humane treatment of animals and eliminate hormones, preservatives, and GMO status from it's food. I am proud to be a part of this team but I feel I need to move to a more professional work environment which makes greater use of my education and skills."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Working for Chipotle is a lot of fun. The work atmosphere is friendly, warm, and welcoming. They also teach you how to achieve high standards and teach employees how to work together."
good,This has been a fun place to work at despite stressful situations. Chipotle is a very busy restaurant and customers expect a lot from us because they are paying higher prices here than other fast food restaurants.
good,"A typical day at work is fast-paced and physically demanding.  I have learned several culinary techniques. The management team is young and as they go.  There is not a general manager at this time.  I have a lot of fun at work, we all have a family-like bond with each other.  The hardest part of the job is it can be very busy and often we do not get breaks.  We have not had a general manager for a while, which makes it more difficult without a defined leader.  My favorite part of the job is my co-workers and customers."
good,"A typical day at work is being able to manage the needs of the customers such as additional food in their meal such as chips and salsa or guacamole. I also had to make sure to follow the proper kitchen safety and keeping the environment clean.The hardest part of the job would be keeping the environment clean when it is peak hour (lunch and dinner rush). It is hard to get off the register to continue to provide forks, knives napkins for our customers. The enjoyable part of the job at Chipotle is a fun place to work since it is diverse. I can meet new people and learn about that persons culture. I enjoy learning about someone else's culture."
good,"very good workers. good management, good work days. nothign hard. fun all around. enviroment is very fun and good. pay is alright"
good,Extremely fun work place all the variety of people and having a management team that let us be ourselves as well as professional. The most enjoyable part was feeling like one big family at the workplace and being comfortable.
good,"Chipotles desire to change the way fast-food is prepared and served; using No GMOs, no steroids or antibiotics in any of the meats, gluten and allergy free foods available. The ability to move up within the company and the very motivated management to assist you to that goal. A fun filled but product environment not only for management, team members, but also for our customers. Making Chipotle a desired place to work."
good,Great place to work at absolutely loved the place. the rush and the relationship i built with employees are fantastic. the managers are so worth putting up with. they inspire the employees to do better .  what i disliked about working here was the fact that they make the schedule late.
good,"nice place to work."
good,"Great culture and work environment.  I was constantly challenged to make the people around me better.  The management was understanding and motivational.  I learned how to manage a multi-million dollar restaurant which included: hiring, marketing, developing team members, crisis management, guest services, food and inventory management, and facility ownership.  My coworkers were great.  The hardest part of the job was inspiring the people around me, but it was also the most enjoyable part as well."
good,"It is a great place depending on the location. Love the culture and the support you get from your coworkers. Management all depends on location, because not all leaders are the same and some help their team more than others. Many of their leaders often contradict themselves or makes work difficult for others. The customers are great and so is the work culture if the store has it right."
good,"It was a great job for people like me who desire constant movement and interection with customers and coworkers. Everyone was always friendly and welcoming, especially when I first started."
good,"This Job was one of the best jobs I had., but the down side was that we were always short handed when it came to crew members. Most of the co-workers really cared about their job and wanted to make people happy. The hardest part about the job is trying to get what didn't get done during the day because of being short on crew members. the management was okay, but it was getting better. I learned that if you work hard to make the consumers happy, that you too will be happy and will make working way easier and nicer. The most enjoyable part about the job was know you are serving quality and quantity food to the consumer."
good,a typical work day consists of the employee being on their feet all day being productive. it is a fun work environment however with lots of opportunity to move up.
good,"A typical day for me would be getting in at 7:00 AM and opening. I would make tortilla chips for the day, and set up the production line. We would open at 10:00 AM. I would work at the beginning of the production line, and take each customer's order and start that order. I would maintain a clean work space and work with my co-workers to keep the customers moving and happy. The hardest part was making sure the customers were moving quickly down the line, but also making sure I am as welcoming and polite as possible. When it was slow I would either help with prepping the food in the kitchen, or do as many dishes as possible. I would always keep busy. My favorite part of the job was prepping food because we would have music playing and it was very relaxing. I also enjoyed making fresh food and took pride in doing the best I could."
good,I learned how to put on my happy face even when i was upset. Also that no matter what always respect everyone around you
good,"fun environment"
good,"A typical day of work for me at Chipotle consisted of slicing and pitting 9 cases of avocados which were to be prepared for guacamole that we served throughout the lunch and dinner service. I also sliced and diced onions for the Pico De Gallo salsa, as well as sliced green peppers for Fajita Onions and Peppers.  When needed, I made crispy corn tacos by deep frying them. I served customers on a food line, mostly serving the rices, meats and beans. Throughout my shift I maintained the back of the house by washing dishes and keeping the back of the house sanitary as well as the dining area."
good,Many things can be done at a days work at Chipotle. You will always be serving customers and working fast! I would usually work the grill and line. Co-workers where always energized and created positive vibes. The only hardest part of the job was making sure prep was done cleaning the chip fryer. The most enjoyable part was the busy times because the day goes by fast and your in your zone!
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"happy fun hard working "
good,"If you love food, whether you cooking or serving, then you would love working at Chipotle.  I have a love and passion for food; therefore, I decided to test the waters here. Within months of starting here, I advance from the line, to cashier, to prep/dishwasher, and training for Kitchen management. This was and still is my favorite job I have ever worked at, I loved my co-workers from both morning and night shifts, I loved what I did, and spent almost every waking moment at this restaurant.  Management is always there to help, no need to rush them out of the office because they were working the line with you or helping prep food for the day.  The hardest part of the job would have to be cleaning up the mess left after a terrible rush of hungry customers but other than that I love the atmosphere, the culture, the people, and overall the passion to cook and serve great food!"
good,"my days at chipotle are very busy. I run the cash register, work prep, work on the line, and I am able to help out on the grill"
good,Great for an individual looking for personal challenge and personal growth.
good,"There was never a boring day at work. With the high volume of customers, the hours of the day just flew by. Managers were funny and friendly. My co-workers made the job even more enjoyable. The best part of the job is the free lunch."
good,Chipotle is a great company to work for. The food is really food with integrity. Its the kind of work that sends you home exhausted because there is always something to do in a short amount of time. and most of the managers and GMs have worked their way up so they are honest and everyone is friends with everyone.
good,"A typical work day would include, prep, cooking and cleaning, housekeeping, cashier, front line, and online orders. the hardest part of my job was keeping up with my training. once that I learned everything I was able to grow with the team."
good,"A typical day at chipotle is really busy. We get over 100 consumers a day, but the best thing about it is we all work as a team. We help each other out no matter what your position is at the job. Managers work with hands on and gives everyone the opportunity to feel equal. Nobody is better then nobody. I learned a lot from chipotle, even through I always loved helping people no matter in what way, chipotle embraces that all the time. We will do ever we can to make our consumers smile and return to our store. I learned taking action when something is wrong should always happen. I was always a team player but chipotle makes you live it without thinking about it. My communication skill improved dealing with so many different consumers and staff. Being a top performer and empowered is the way I live now. I don't nothing in chipotle is hard we can learn it just might take other longer then others but that's ok we have a team to helps  and the best way to learn or do something is when you have a positive surrounding around you."
good,The work environment is fast paced while being productive.Its alwayys fun and talking to the customers was my favorite part of the day. Chipolte has the most loyal customers.
good,"This job is awesome, I lived in Las Vegas, Centenial Hills area. The Manager Megan is amazing, she knows exactly what she is doing and can answer any question. Great customer service. This company strives to build not only great relationhips with their employees but great relationships with the customers as well. Its very easy to advance in the company. You're able to become a manager in 6 months but you have to work hard for it and know what you're doing plus be good at what you do. Not to mention This is the Cleanest ""fast Food"" company you will ever see and the food is always fresh, ALWAYS."
good,"Work day included prep of all salsas, chicken, steak, salads and onions. Management was never really around to help our store get its feet together. Hardest part of the job was finding good talent that would stay to become management. Most enjoyable part was probably experience in opening 2 restaurants and being a General Manager for another store."
good,Excellent place to work and lots of opportunity to advance.
good,"I loved my typical day it was always great with the costumer and my co-workers. I learned how to take orders and have a boss, and learn to save my money over time. I like my boss he would work with me with my transportation and with some family problems i was having to deal with. My co-works wow, they would help with anything/everything. I can't and would never complain about them. But the thing was when i need to remember things that was part of the normal day was hard. And when it was my first day with out having my boss looking over my shoulders. It was different and it was hard remember cause of the pressure for a bit. But i got over it and worked around it and made the best of it. I think the most enjoyable part would have to be closing. Because that it when all my co-workers would just come together and clean hang out talk, and we would get to know each. We would joke around with each other and play jokes and it would be the  best time some day i wish i didn't have to leave."
good,Work was always busy. This job taught me how to work in a fast paced manner as well as being able to interact with others professionally at the same time. Management was a little immature with some situations when it came to hiring new people but overall great. Co-workers weren't very experienced with customer service. Hardest part was trying to teach others how to be professional and have fun at the same time. Most enjoyable was being able to work for a very fun and live company that is moving up in the food industry.
good,This job is not just a job it's a career that can help you grow your personal and interpesonal skills. It's ver fun and fast paced but it does get stressful because most of their restaurants are very busy.
good,"I loved working for Chipotle. I had gathered people that are all great to work for me. The whole company has great morals and qualities that anyone should look for in a company and life. While you can climb the ranks quickly, once you get to Apprentice and GM, you do not have a lot of free time outside of all the hours you need to work and between meetings. They don't seem to understand that people have other things in their lives besides just Chipotle. It is still a great company to work for."
good,You are given the opportunity to learn how to run a restaurant. The days are long and hard. The biggest challenge is finding great people to work for you.
good,"My days began in the morning, had to be in at 800 am and started opening the kithcen. I began by cutting clintro, lettuce meats ext. Once everything was ready we cleaned up and took a 15 minute lunch. We would open there doors at eleven. And I would be making online orders and fax orders, I was the cashier for all my orders, and I did call backs. I had a chart to log in everything I did. I count down my door and prepared it for the next shift. I cooked all my food for my line. The managers was good. I like each and everyone off them, if they had the time and we needed something they was right there. Once I became the fax manager I was pretty much on my own. The hardest part about my job was making sure that everyone was happy with there orders. I did not like having disappointed customers. So I had to make sure everything was just right. But that is what my day! Was calling them at the end and making sure they was happy, and to here them say thanks for everything Shelby!"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"A good job with good people and easily promoted. I trained employees on the grill, line and cash handling."
good,I loved the co-workers and customers and of course the food.
good,"The workplace is a very welcoming and respectful place. I learn new things everyday such as new cleaning, organizing and communication skills. The management is very helpful and make sure there is teamwork throughout the work shifts. The culture in the workplace is very welcoming and has a great teamwork in and outside the work environment. The hardest part of the job is being able to communicate with customers of their needs. The best part of the job is being able to make sure customers are satisfied throughout and after ordering their meals."
good,I Like this job it helps me learn new things like cooking and preparing food and been nice to the customer. I also how to use the register and learn to keep stuff clean.
good,"As a cashier you were the last taste left in a customers mouth before actually eating their food. So daily I dealt with any conflicts or questions that customers had, along with anything that went wrong on the food line. I rang customers up for their meals and made sure their stay would be more than pleasant."
good,Chipotle has a great work environment and great employees/managers. The job itself isnt too hard took a bit of learning but easy overall i am a cook and i do prep.
good,"Chipotle was a special part of my life. It is the first job I was an integral part of the staff. The mangers value those who desired to improve themselves in the work environment and uphold the company standards. If you were currently lacking in an area, they put you in a station you were the best at in your skills and allowed you to improve yourself in other areas on slow days. They were kind and patient. Through them, I was able to improve myself as worker."
good,"The best food service company I've worked for, yet. They care about their employees.  They take over the top safety precautions.  The crew really becomes like a family."
good,A family friendly place families can enjoy a relaxing meal. great customer service and great management. A collective team that gets orders done. Time orderly.
good,"This is probably my favorite part time job I've ever had. Great everything. I love the management, my hours, the pay, the food! The customers here are pretty good too. Longish hours, but very flexible scheduling."
good,"The work was fast pace and a bit harder than others had expected, but the people within had helped made the workday go by fast and fun. If I hadn't gotten sick I would have kept my job since it was so much fun!"
good,I have a lot of positive feedback that would go with the company . The experience honestly depends on the branch you’re at . Chipotle has tuition reimbursement a very competitive pay and overall positions for advancement .
good,Is a good place to work as a first time you get a lot of experience and always to keep a clean environment and smile to the customers and welcome them to our chipotle
good,I can work anytime i want and Crew members are friendly. It gets very busy sometimes but you feel some kind of achievement after you hit the goal that the restaurant set for the day
good,"I worked at chipotle all throughout college and it was the best decision.  Chipotle pays above-average wages, benefits, 401K, and tuition reimbursement after the first year of working there. Great job if you like structure."
good,At first I really liked to work there but now it’s really not that good it’s really hard to ask for a day of and it’s to busy for me to be by myself on grill
good,"A very fast-paced job, you need to be able to multitask and have good customer service. It can also be a fun job to work at. I learned how to have more patience and a positive attitude when working with others."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,It's a great opportunity to learn new skills.  Everyone is mainly placed whichever position their the strongest at. Great for anyone trying to get back in school with tuition reimbursement.
good,Chipotle is a great company with a lot of potential to move up in the company. The pay may not be super great depending on your location but what really keeps you at the company is the people and the culture you are around
good,The day might start of slow but out of nowhere it can be very busy. You have to make sure to listen to your coworker at times. There’s constant moving around.
good,"I absolutely loved the Chipotle location in New Hampshire. Transferring to an Arizona store was difficult, as the management was very different and I disliked it. They also changed policies regarding tuition reimbursement while I was employed which made it difficult to continue to receive the same benefits that I initially did. Overall, the year I spent in NH was amazing and I would recommend this company to anyone to work for."
good,I’ve been with the company for 3 years. Was a KM for 2 months before getting promoted to SM. The advancement to management is quick and fulfilling. This job is very goal oriented
good,"Great place to work at, also love the management any mistake that I made they correct me and taught  me other ways to approach the situation my team was also great always helping each other I learned a lot about customer service through chipotle"
good,The job was stressful at times but with training you could easily pick it up. there are many different jobs to do there so it was never boring and was always exciting and shifts go by quickly.
good,I learned how to manage and work with a group of people. Learned to attend to customers needs. I enjoyed most working in a good environment. I also enjoyed that everybody worked as a team.
good,"Cultivating a Better World! Great people, great food and great culture. Extensive benefits including bonuses for hourly crew! Work is harder than other jobs but more rewarding."
good,"Fun place to work at, very fast pace during peak hours. The environment is great. Anyone is able to get promoted as long as you prove to the team you want it and your able to do your job correctly."
good,I loved my time with Chipotle. It can though be stressful to pick up a full time position in a place with q high turn over rate. I'd probably still be there if a different location. Could not keep back of house workers at my location
good,Working here is fast-paced yet the environment can be fun depending on the co-workers. I worked at a Chipotle that was very busy which sometimes was hard but the customers understood and were very cooperative.
good,I love my job although it is very hard to balance a personal life and work life here as a manager. So much responsiblity on your shoulders with very little say so and how some things are ran. You need constant approval from above before you do something at your store
good,"Working at chipotle was a wonderful experience. It gave me time to progress in customer service, and learn how to muli-task in a profressional matter."
good,"Chipotle always had a strong people culture up until our food safety scares. They lost a ton of revenue which resulted in them becoming money hungry, rather than thoroughly train leaders strictly. They are coming back strong but lack people development skills now."
good,"Chipotle is a great place to work. Everyone is friendly, and the mangers at my store all respect the other crew members. Everyone chips in at the end of the night to help close. Learning to do things around the restaurant is also super easy."
good,I was so excited to work at chipotle because I really like what they stand for. I only needed a part time job over the weekend and the manager was super nice and understanding. I wish I didnt have to quit but I got pregnant and decided to resign.
good,"Loved it working there but I had to move on to something else, worked in morning shifts so I was there to open the store everything had to be ready I would recommend this place to anybody but you have to love being in cî"
good,unorganized at peak hours they dont give you enough time to learn before they evaluate your performance and letting you go due to your work performance
good,There is always something new you learned at Chipotle after every shift. Mainly on how to give and accept a feedback. A feedback is a tool used by Chipotle that allows the team to correct one another with out any disrespect.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Its been a great few weeks working I love chipotle I live their work ethic very bright smiles nice and caring crew members I love it the people seem to love it chipotle is great.
good,It was fun. Team worked together. We also had fun outings and it was easy to talk to my managers. They always tried to help out when they could. I do miss working there.
good,"I was around when you had to meet 13 characteristics in order to be hired our crew was great around that time, I feel as though they should do that again because some people are not enthusiastic about the job and customers will notice."
good,"Chipotle was a great environment to work at for a very long time. The hours were not bad since they open at 11am and close at 10pm. The crew works hard and I loved working with them. Being upper management, I loved trying to make the crew better and listen to their needs. The hardest part of the job was keeping up with all of the customers and working in the small restaurant."
good,Definitely a place to learn getting into the work life. My location there were very fun people and a very understandable work and duty’s. Highly recommend but it dose get busy sometimes !
good,Great place to work and easy to move up within the company and achieve advancement if that is what you are looking for within a company. Would recommend to anybody looking to get a start in restaurant business.
good,"Overall I would have to say that I had an enjoyable experience there, but in the end management needed to do a better job of communicating with the employees"
good,The only reason I have stayed at chipotle so long is because my Chipotle family. I have the best GM and managers I could ask for. They motivate me to do better and always show they care. I will miss it!
good,"My overall review about working at chipotle was that j loved all my crew members. Everything about them was what I looked forward to seeing when I got to work. Stress, the amount of people, the dishes that piled up at night: all of that didn’t matter because I knew that when I told my crew how to tackle it and how to manuever around the tough times, they would do it. The only thing that I didn’t like was the upper management."
good,Chipotle offers many things but the most valuable trait would be people skills. In my time there I have been able to work up from crew to management in less than a year I’m a very outgoing person and I dedicate myself to a company.
good,Needs improvement. Managers need to Replenish products and supplies to ensure in stock conditions at all times. communication and there  are not enough people to work.
good,"If your looking for a place to learn, develop people skill and an opportunity to grow. Chipotle is the place to go. I would recommend it to anyone. I only left due to searching for a job in the electrical field"
good,"Customers are often friendly, and co-workers were fun to be around and more than willing to help out each other. The management was also very efficient and usually both understanding and easy to get along with. It is pretty fast paced there but if one can keep up, it's a great place to work."
good,"Rush hours suck for sure, i learned about teamwork and that helped me out a lot, but the pay was pretty good compared to other places, i enjoyed probably the benefits the most and my coworkers were fun"
good,"Chipotle in Missoula, MT was a great place to work. The management was very engaged in the well being of his employees to the point of making sure that they had what they needed to make their jobs easier. The atmosphere was light-hearted and relaxed even in stressful situations."
good,Service was great. Felt good to work for a crew who all helped each other progress as the day went on. Manager would like to play favorites and make it known only certain people could be in her office at all hours
good,"Chipotle was a fun, upbeat place to work at! Lots of energy and the crew is fun to be around. The type of people you work around are those that have a purpose and drive to be there. I highly recommend this job to high school students how need a good fun job."
good,On a typical day I would either have to close or open. This mean I wither had to prepare the food or I had to clean and prepare for the morning shift. The workplace was a very good environment. The managers was always very nice and always ask about mine and other co workers well being. The hardest part about the job was the rude customers. The part I enjoyed the most was the different people that I encounter everyday
good,"Chipotle has such a great environment and culture that really pulls you in and makes you apart of their family. Its a very fun loving atmosphere but you must be hardworking, which wasnt hard because you easily fall in love with the company and crew members. However, I don't think chipotle is responsibly managed. I don't want to say too much as to the things I've experienced and heard so I will leave it at that."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,It was a decent job but it was often stressful but manageable. The free meal was always nice. The management sometimes sucked at the Charlottesville location but other than that it was mostly fine.
good,"Very busy and high paced job but had so many opportunities to move up. At 18 was promoted to a service manager and 3 months later was the co-general manager. Loved the atmosphere and people working here, everyone felt like family. The pay is decent but definitely for hard working people."
good,"I loved working at Chipotle. The managers were better than I expected, I loved all my coworkers. My specific store (I-19 and Irvington) was fast paced because it was the busiest store in Tucson, Az but it was manageable. Loved my experience and gained a lot from the year i worked there."
good,Chipotle taught me so much about how a restaurant works! I learned much about food safety and why cleanliness is the top priority with food. My managers were very nice and ran the restaurant smoothly. I loved how energetic the team was and their friendliness to everyone.
good,"The work day can be a bit stressful, but it is worth it! A great place to work. The management is all very nice and helpful, and coworkers are always ready to help and step in when you need it."
good,I loved working with chipotle. It was the cleanest place i’ve seen and ran very smoothly until the end. My location was in the middle of switching managers and they didn’t schedule me for 3 weeks. When i questioned it she said she “assumed i was fired” and her assumption left me with no paycheck 2 weeks before christmas.

good,excellent for training and building a culture in restaurant. makes everyone care about the restaurant. Great for advancement and moving up within a company!
good,Not one position could just stay ahead if one person was behind everyone was so we helped eachother instead of being about just one person . If it were just a me environment. I would’ve not lasted as long .
good,"When I worked here it was fine, I didn't like so much as what I did as much as the people I worked with. My job was repetitive, but the people who I worked with was the reason I stayed for as long as I did."
good,"Chipotle was a fun place to work because the crew was very friendly and we became like a family over time. A typical day at work included prepping food, serving food on the line to customers, and cleaning up the lobby/kitchen. The management was awesome and they were very flexible with my schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job was providing for the customers and exceeding their expectations."
good,I was very happy working for the company. They really know how to take care of their employees. They treat them like family and guaranteed them the possibility of moving up within the company. They always look within the company to promote within to give everyone the same opportunity.

good,"I learned self urgency at work and how to handle customer service ."
good,Working at Chipotle was an amazing experience. The staff and management was so nice. If I didn't understand something that was willing to help out. A typical workday was fast paced and on your feet but you get used to it.
good,"A typical day at Chipotle is simple, everyone has tasks that they have to complete before their shift is over. This job is not hard. You must have good customer service."
good,chipotle was a place where there were checks and balances. We trained with a strict schedule to ensure everyone was confident in their position before they were solo.I developed managers into leaders. Creating a family culture is key to everyone's success.The hardest part of my job was leaving. I worked in a environment where everyone was invested in others success. I promoted several managers that transferred to other locations. that was the most rewarding.
good,"It was a fun uplifting job, my coworkers were always working as a team and helping one another , being able to interact with the customers and make them smile even if its for 5 minuets. Working in chipotle you kind of get a hint of everything you get to experience almost all jobs in the store. You experience the kitchen making sauces making foods, while also working the line and taking care of the dining area. Which is good because you get experience in everything"
good,Nice place to work fast pace and you have to learn fast but its good i the people that i encountered and i love the night mangers they were nice to me and it was easy to get to get along
good,"I greatly enjoy working at Chipotle. It is extremely fast paced and can be stressful during rushes. It always keeps you on your toes and you always have something to do while working. Management is extremely friendly and promotes self improvement and encourages us to do our very best without pushing us to the point of exhaustion. They allow short breaks if you get overwhelmed on top of the regular breaks (e.g. I tended to get overheated while frying chips and was allowed to cool down in the fridge). The training is very straightforward and easy to pick up quickly, and training periods typically finished within a few weeks so we could get right to work. The hardest part of the job is working rush times, where we can make up to 75 dishes per hour, and customers can become agitated from being hungry. My coworkers were always extremely friendly and great to work with."
good,"Working a chipotle is actually a great idea overall, the team there as far as I know is very cheerful and interactive, not only will they do what they are there to do but will make you feel at home while doing it ."
good,interview process can be long. you deal with a lot of customers. plenty of opportunity to move up. You earn your hours. Work place is very culture with plenty of rules. the job isn't hard if you catch on quick lots of running for some positions. most enjoyable part is the crew members and some of the regular customers
good,Chipotle was a great place to work. Great environment and friendly staff. Room for advancement and you can move up quick if you work hard and determination to move further up. Benefits were provided as well and paid time off.
good,"A typical day at work would be to lead the shift by sending crew members on break prior to the dinner rush, and then ensuring that the customers received a fast, efficient, and overall excellent guest experience while in the store. This was done by ensuring the food was fresh, the atmosphere of the store was inviting and friendly, and the line moved at a fast yet comfortable pace. The end of the shift included oversight of the crew members in cleaning the store as well as conducting office paperwork such as inventory, and cash handling policies. The workplace and management are amazing, there is a strong family atmosphere in the store where everyone works together  to achieve our goal. I learned many skills including communication skills, guest experience, leadership position, food safety, operations and cash handling policies, and more. The hardest part of the job is the high level of energy that is needed constantly as the customers expect a constant flow of high energy and fresh food that does not run out from the crew members. The most enjoyable part of the job however is the people you get to work with, as well as being able to work for a customer who at the end expresses their gratitude."
good,"Chipotle was my first real job, it taught me how to manage my time and myself. I learned a lot of kitchen skills and how to prepare different items. My managers were always there for me when I needed, I was given a handful of opportunities and made sure I made good use of them. Being a manager for the first time here made me realize how much of a leader i could be, I had the luxury of being apart of my first new restaurant opening, it was stressful but super fun and I learned so much. It was sad to leave Chipotle but it was great time."
good,Chipotle is a fun workplace at first but after a while it gets hard to deal with certain customers. But if you have experience in customer service you should be fine
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"It's really easy to move up in this job and the people are largely very happy and kind. Even though I'm really shy, I really enjoyed meeting new people and collaborating with my coworkers."
good,"Chipotle can be stressful at times, but because of the quick paced environment 8hour shifts feel like 5 hour shifts. There can of course be drama( (you will find that anywhere you go) but overall the people are very friendly. There are many ways to move up in the company and so many benefits to be taking advantage of! They offer college tuition reimbursement, 401k, health insurance, etc!"
good,"A typical day at chipotle consists of strong communication between the front and back of house, preparing meals safely and according to protocol, and maintaining an easy, friendly environment for both guests and co-workers. Chipotle offers many opportunities to learn new skills including how to work successfully both in groups and individually. The company culture is fun and strong, bonding relationships between coworkers are encouraged for a positive flow and overall good feel."
good,"This was my first job as a teenager, however I was treated like an adult and expected to work like one. At first, this was daunting, but I believe it really set the standard and work ethic very high and made it much more enjoyable. I enjoy challenging myself. This can be a career opportunity if you're willing to make it one and become a manager. Unfortunately, the really is no moving up unless you want to jump straight into managing."
good,Wonderful place to work! Chipotle is an innovative company. Very fast-paced during peak hours. They want every employee to be trained on each position for the sake of team work. They want people that want to work for them and take initiative to complete tasks and learn new ones.
good,At Chipotle I started off on the line. Within 3 months I became a trainer and kept moving up. From there you become a cashier and then on to the back of the house for prep and grill. You will help build a great team and have wonderful management  behind you who came from the position where you started.
good,"It was an amazing first job, I loved the managers. I learned great work ethic and skills I will use my entire career. The schedule wasn't consistent. But overall a great place to work."
good,"Great place. Short days, easy enough. ALOT of food safety protocols. Can't come to work while sick, which was fine, because you'd be terminated if you did.  If you call in sick, they tell you not to come in for days at a time and miss alot of work.  Then they terminate you for that.  So....best have a perfect immune system."
good,"The job culture was very friendly an encouraging and the team is like a family. I enjoyed the interactions with customers, the fast paced environment, and the food perks!"
good,Chipotle is one of the best first jobs anyone could ask for. You always have something to do and surrounded by great people! Only issue woth my GM at the time was she was very unprofessional so i would tend to micromanage.
good,At Chipotle its important to always keep your cool; because things can get hectic with customers. Coworkers are amazing brighten your day with smiles.
good,I love working at chipotle!!! Its very fast and theres never a dull moment. The people you work with are very hard workers and come together as a team to accomplish any task!
good,Pretty good environment. It could be more successful with the right people and everyone on the same page in regards of working for the better of the company.
good,"Great job, benefits, lots of opportunities. Very busy environment. Chipotle is a sweat me company that pours into people who would like to take advantage of all opportunities they offer. Chipotle offers great training programs for all levels of management! They even offer tuition reimbursement."
good,"This was my first job and I was here for almost 2 years. It's extremely fast paced and stressful, but it was one of the most amazing places to work. The team is encouraging and family oriented, working with them felt like a second home. I learned a lot about customer service and management. I hate that we barely get paid for our work ethic, but I stood because of the team. Great environment, but we need better pay!"
good,It took a while to getting used to the fast paced work style that chipotle demanded but overall my experience was amazing I enjoyed the paid breaks and I enjoyed the free employee meals given every time you worked.
good,"Typical day at work for me was fast paced serving & learning I was still in training and while I was doing order I was still being told other things I need to know about the job. For example, what they make the food with, how much oz they need to serve, why and when they check the temperatures of foods etc. Management was very on top of there employees, always made sure how much food we was serving to people so we wont be waisting any because theres a certain amount they need to sell each day. General manager was always in my store checking the cleaning, the foods, the refridgerator and on the employess making sure we was doing out job. Personally to me the hardest part of the job is rush hour. In the beginning because i was new i didnt have faith on getting through a whole line that ended up putside our store door but with the help of other chipotle crew members we worked as a team to make sure every singke customer was taken care of and satisfied with there food. My most enjoyable part at work to be honest was over time because I knew the more hours I put in the more I prove i can be something bigger."
good,a typical day at work is a busy day at work. everyone loves chipotle so we always had happy costumers come in an we definitely stayed busy. what i learned at chipotle is patients. Because of how busy we stayed there was a lot of chaos an a lot of work to be done. some times it could get stressful but patience is one thing i always kept in mind. the management at chipotle was pretty good. we were always able to talk to the managers an communicate with them an they would listen to us.
good,"Very respectful people, generous managers and a lot of teamwork building. However it can be very very stressful since it is a fast paced restaurant. You have to be ready once you go in and never stop working or else you'll be left behind on your work, which will affect the rest of the restraints business. But if your new to the job, they train you there so no worries if your unexperienced. But again, since everything in the resturaunt has to be done by hand and by that I mean organically and properly done (not like McDonalds) but must be done quickly since Chipotle is also a fast food restaurant."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"It was a really good experience,  nice staff great fun people to work with . I left because i was having a baby. I felt overworked and stressed out . Especially being pregnant"
good,I loved working for chipotle until they changed the managers. My hours where good and the pay was also. I always felt welcome and the customers where happy to be in a good environment.
good,"At chipotle they are very detail oriented, very careful when picking out workers. I learned how to cook for the line, also learned the right and wrong things to do with food/ in a restaurant setting. The hardest part of this job was the fast pace environment but i got comfortable easy. Everyone at chipotle were very expressive individuals."
good,Chipotle is a great company to work for. I love what they stand for regarding respecting our animals and making sure they are treated and raised well.
good,Working at chipotle helps you improve your personality and make you want to take charge. I watch shy people love coming into work and seeing the guests faces and smiling and communicating with them. the benefits are amazing for students and grown ups.
good,"This job was special because they implemented work/food culture so heavily on us, they hired people who had these 11 characteristics that all had to do with how friendly & happy of a person you are, how you are work oriented and how much you care about things being done the correct way and how you go about that. The most enjoyable part would have to be not only cooking, but the people I got to cook with & for."
good,"As my first job, I had no expectation as to what I wanted. Chipotle provided me with the experience I needed to learn how to work in the food industry and with the customers. I learned how to work against the different demands of the restaurant and was able to learn the skills needed to master my responsibilities, and then train the person after me. I was cross-trained within months, and was rewarded with internal movement. For my first job, I was able to say that I went from a crew member, to General Manager in 2.5 years. I would easily recommend this job to anyone who is looking for a challenge, someone who is looking for a career with great benefits and incentives, but somebody who is ultimately looking for an opportunity to go above and beyond what they thought they are capable of."
good,This workplace really drew in good wholesome food served with a smile. The work is strenuous but always pays off in the end .The management was always eager to help everyone learn and grow it was honestly a loving environment.

good,It's a blast working here but hard work. You love it if your up for challenges and free food. Also paid breaks are a plus ! Quick advancements of your determined
good,If you don't have kids this is a great place to work. I say this only because you don't get out on time often. Usually you have to stay behind up to an hour after your shift was suppose to end to stock for the next shift. But the management was really nice and helpful. Overall staff was really good too.
good,"A typical day here I would arrive at work around 7 am and lead a crew through opening prep, grill, cash, and salsas. All of our food preparations must be done by 10:15 to open our doors to the public on time each day. I've learned how to manage an entire restaurant down to food orders and directing a crew. Workplace culture is excellent, no one disrespects one another, including me.  The hardest part of the job was being short staffed. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to teach and train others all the while becoming friends with my coworkers."
good,When you risk there you have to be very fast which I am. Also you have to a lot of patience. Also you learn a lot of new things. Meet new people. Is a great experience.
good,"Being that Chipotle was my very first job ever, I would definitely say I lucked up. In the short amount of time I was there I grew tremendously. I learned how to work well under pressure and actually work as a team memeber in a work environment. Everyone was super friendly and always willing to help me better myself and perfect my craft at what I was doing. I was always trying to better myself and my team saw that, which helped me advance as a crew member."

good,"The work was stressful, but fulfilling. You could definitely tell that the company truly cared about it's employees and their well being. Through chipotle, I learned how to budget my time and energy, as I was still in school when I first started. It taught me how to resolve conflicts between not just myself and other people, but conflicts between others as well. The hardest part of the job was to keep up with the demand- being a restaurant on campus, we got busy. Especially through being in management, it is important to work fast and efficiently, and potentially be prepared to pick up slack where necessary. I enjoyed working here because it truly felt like I earned my pay every single day that I went in."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer.

good,I believe that this company has a great environment. People are happy and it definitely shows. They work well with school and sports as well. The break schedule is also a great plan.
good,"A typical day at work would include greeting your coworkers and feel that positive vibe flow through the restaurant as well as the feeling of enthusiasm of willing to provide the best towards guests. Working hard and constantly keeping the restaurant in perfect shape allowing guests to enjoy their experience. I learned a lot from people skills, professionalism, leadership and ownership skills, as well as culinary skills. The management has improved such that we learn every day to improve output. The hardest part of the job would be trying to be 100% perfect. The most enjoyable part of the job would be interacting and working with coworkers as well as having laid back conversations while maintaining professionalism. The positivity that surrounds the restaurant also gives guests the impression of the enjoyment of serving them. If you're interested in hospitality careers, chipotle is a good way to start off."

I learned a lot working at Chipotle, like time management skills, providing the best customer service and food safety procedures to ensure top quality food to customers. I mainly worked mornings, that consisted of food prep, so there was a lot to get done in the few hours til opening. This taught me to become quicker each day. The management was tremendous because they empowered all of us, to become better and reminded us the reason why we were there. The co-workers had the same responsibilities, to empower and improve as top performers. The hardest part of the job was how busy the restaurant got, and learning faster ways to get everything done. The most enjoyable part was the rewarding feeling after my shift, and the constant feedback from my managers."

The most enjoyable part was being able to connect with people that wanted to step up and be a top performer everyday, we all helped each other improve, and we all had a close friendship with each other."

I learned how to make new foods and about the Chipotle goals and more about what they stand for. Management at my location was new. It was a new location. The managers did everything they could from their knowledge of running a busy restaurant to help us be successful at the end of the day. My co-workers were fun and they cared about the people they served. The hardest part of the job was leaving it. The most enjoyable part was being able to be part of a great team.
good,Chipotle is one of the greatest companies to work for. Potential for advancement is almost limitless. The work culture and the people you with with are upbeat positive people.
good,"Chipotle was the first part time I got after high school, I think it was a good start into the customer service industry, and I learned a lot from my training. The management was also awesome."
good,"When I was there, and the original team was there, everything was fun. The moment you step in you are greeted. It was my second home. We scored 70+ for facility grading. But now that there's a new management, everything just went downhill. Last facility grading was 30 something. Nuff said it speaks for itself. New managers are a bunch of people who to lots of talking and not enough proving themselves worthy of their spot and they don't care about their employees. The old managers and the old crew who used to work there cared so much for each other. . Overall it was the greatest place to work at. If I could work there again with the same crew, I would do it all over again. Money is not an issue.We carried each other through the day/shift during our toughest times even when we had our own concerns. We weren't considered co-workers, or friends. We were family. Period"
good,"- my typical day was just to be there standing up and charging people and smile to the customers and answer questions."
good,"a place where you can work and have fun at the same time with your teammates. great work experience. such as prep, marination,salsas, lettuce, the grill, chips. etc. everything is great."
good,"Chipotle has a great training program. The management team is taught how to identify who has the potential for future leadership within the company. They open new restaurants every couple of days around the country so for that reason they have a very extensive, yet thorough management training program. "
good,"Come in during your shift which mine happen to be afternoons."
good,"Great vision, culture, great people working with. Having the desire & the abilities to perform a great job."
good,"Great company lot of opportunity. It'/s not for everybody, requires a lot of multi tasking"
good,Chipotle creates a structured and fun environment where employees are empowered to be the best they can be everyday.  Customers like the atmosphere because Chipotle crew members provide fantastic customer service and great food.  The culture cares about how food is processed and prepared so that customers are getting top quality food.  The management is the best part.  The top manager is so organized and responsible with all employees.  He works with everyone's schedules and genuinely cares about the employees and customers.  Everyone strives to be top performers.
good,I enjoyed my job and the few customers I dealt with. My co-workers were fun to be around.
good,"my collegues made the work place feel very safe and home, overall it was a fantasic job just wish i was able to experience more of it."
good,"Chipotle was a great place to work. My favorite thing was that I got a free meal every shift. Time flew because we were always busy and there was no time i was bored. I did always get cuts though from the rice containers, which i was told could not be avoided when working during busy hours."
good,"Great job for like a student in College just trying to work hard and get ahead in life! A very changing environment, everyday I seem to tackle a new issue. A great place to work if you enjoy the challenge of making every cusomter happy. I seem to love the ""problem solving"" aspect of customer service. Everyday seemed to be like a Friday"
good,"Good and friendly enviorment, serious co workers and supportive managers. Hardest part is learning all the history of the company but the funniest part for me personally is the responsibility and trust they put in you."
good,"A typical day at work involves preparing all food products and condiments fresh every morning before opening, Greeting every guest with a smile to promote a friendly atmosphere for the guest to enjoy while dining, cleaning the facilities, and handling cash/ credit transactions."
good,"I've worked for Chipotle for 7 months. My store has only been open a year and we are already meeting with Doug about whether or not we will move up as a store. Chipotle has some of the highest standards around and my store doesnt mess with those that dont meet them. It is faced paced, hard work but every second is worth it. I love the people I work with and wouldnt trade them for any other crew. Im only 17 and my managers have already discussed possibly moving me up. If you are a salary manager they pay for college. Not only that but you get FREE food if you work and half off when you dont. If you feel like you are a top performer, take a chance, if not, go somewhere else."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Loved the food in chipotle. I like everyone of my co-workers
good,"The culture was great, the work was fast pace, the concept was the best in the business. Daily duties included managing the labor, food costs, keeping the workplace fun and keeping the guests happy. What I learned is to hire, train, and surround yourself with great people. The challenge was always finding them."
good,Very upbeat environment and of course the food is great! Management team is very motivating and all the coworkers get along great.
good,My days were filled with helping every customer through the door  get the perfect burrito or bowl they wanted. I learned to communicate with a lot of people at the same time. I also learned to keep a positive attitude throughout the day no matter how busy it got. I had the best co-workers who were fun and helpful. My managers where always ready to help and made sure everyone had a good day. I enjoyed the fast pass and helping everyone everyday. Hardest part of my day was leaving.
good,"a typical day at work would be prep cooking, washing dishes, customer service.I learned to be a good team member, and how to cook at a fast past.I had a great management team. The hardest thing I had to do was dishes cause it was a lot of them.The most enjoyable part of the job was working with my co-workers"
good,Productive and fun work place. a joy to work at. We were like one big family!
good,"Chipotle is a great place to work. Lots of opportunities and a fun atmosphere. Lots of things to learn in regards of financial aspects, great customer service building skills, great opportunity to train others, and always fast paced. Only default is the amount of people that need to be promoted within a short period of time, especially if running a very busy restaurant and quality of personal life."
good,"I love my job at Chipotle. It is unbelievably fun to work for Chipotle. A typical day involves coming in early making delicious, fresh food and providing top notch customer service. I manage a team of great people who have great work ethic but know how to have fun with their job. My job expectations are quite simple: Find and develop a team of top performers who have the ability and desire to perform great work, whose constant effort to do so elevates themselves, others and Chipotle as a whole. The hardest part of my job is finding the time to be with my family. It is a very demanding job. The most enjoyable part of my job is what I do. Chipotle is paving the way towards a food revolution and knowing that 97% of managers started out as crew is something that makes me very proud to work for them"
good,Chipotle is an excellent company to work for. They tend to be a highly motivated team of people that work well with others and love coming in to work every day. There is a huge area for advancement within the company as well as a chance to manage your own store. It's rather like a family.
good,"From the first week I started here after graduating from KU, I knew the values and mindsets were in the right place. They call it food with integrity and it carried over onto the people when they came in to work. Even though I started at the bottom, it offered every type of advancement opportunity and encouraged you along the way. Co-workers, management, and the customers were great. The hardest part of the job was the constant changing of shift schedules, the best part of Chipotle was the people that just loved life and loved being there."
good,"great company, my days were fast and productive, management was ok, everyone worked as a team!"
good,"Provided excellent customer service, greeting customers, cleaning restaurant. Teaching crew as well how to do these things. Ensuring crew followed procedures."
good,"A typical day working at Chipotle was fast paced at all times; preping food, all organic, meaning no assembly line/manufactured food. All food made from scratch and then serving food all with lines up to the door constantly. We had deadlines and we met them more often than we didn't. I learned that standing and thinking too much about all the work that has to be done is a big ""no no"". When a lot needs to be done, you move until you are sure there is nothing left to do, and then ask what else needs to be done. Another thing I learned at Chipotle, THERE IS ALWAYS SOMETHING TO BE DONE. Especially, if you want to run a successful business."
good,I learned great people and management skills. Everyone has a similar personality so it makes for a great and fun work environment every day.
good,"A lot of interaction with various people, which is great to learn how to interact with customers with different backgrounds. The management in the restaurant really manages their staff well. I really enjoy working with a variety of people. The only issue with working at chipotle is the lack of hours i get"
good,I was able to advance in this company quickly. I learned alot nd I was able to build a solid team that was like a second family.
good,I learned a bit of spanish while working with this company. I also learned how to prep food durning the morning shift.
good,I love working at chipotle   But right now my child is young and I really am feeling the need to be with him more.  So I just need a job where I can work less and spend more time with my kid
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Chipotle Mexican grill is a very nice place to work but you must be prepared to work at a very fast pace alongside your team members and everything at chipotle is prepared fresh which attracts more customers to the fine establishment.
good,"Chipotle is a great place to work, be ready to work hard, really hard. The work helps you grow in numerous ways along with the help of your crew. You will learn a lot from working here and be prepared to work any other jobs in the future with ease."
good,I as a Chipotle employee can honestly say chipotle is front and center when it comes to satisfying your customer.  Your managers communicate thoroughly but there are times they will purposely leave you out in the open to test your isolation skills . While working there I have never received payment problems or schedule changes that were gone unaware .
good,"It’s a great place to work, but you have to know how to work fast in busy moments  expect to work in more than one station. Closing time was always great because if someone is done cleaning their station they will help you so everyone can get out at a good time. Overall a great place to work, you meet amazing people."
good,There is room to grow within the company for motivated individuals. Great benefits. Management is good at supporting the team and developing crew members. The hardest part of the workday is keeping up with the customers but as long as you work with motivation and keep focused you can easily get everything done.
good,"First, you come in and sign the red book and get a health check. Then you go and do your morning task, mine was to bag chips and make sure we had plenty ready to be brought to the front if needed. After morning prep is done we go to our assigned places, I was the cashier occasionally on line serving food. "
good,"Overall, working at chipotle has a lot of great benefits, especially if you're a college student. Working environment is always fun but professional. Freak management, clean, and friendly."

good,While working in chipotle in hialeah I noticed that it’s a very busy area and people are eager to eat and go back to work . The costumer are very polite and the employees are very helpful and always jolly .
good,Friendly customer service to offer. Great fresh food that we prepare. Coworkers are very supportive we laugh and have fun but also have our times to be serious.
good,"Really fun people ,super fast paced around ""peak"" but overall a real challenge. There were people that were kind and some that were not so friendly.  But fun"
good,A very good fast dining and kitchen experience. Training is excellent and thorough. Longevity is inevitable and benefits are exemplary. The skills you learn will last for a lifetime.
good,"- If you like being a busy body or if you're a relaxed person this job is good for you. "
good,Chipotle is great! It’s very flexible with your school schedule. You’ll most definitely like this at a first job I can assure you that. Main thing about this job is being punctual because you have hungry customers that may be on break or in a rush so you have to get that food out as soon as possible.
good,I loved the people at chipotle including the managers! I stayed there for a little over 3 years but sadly the pay had just not gone up. I received  one pay raise in all those years and it was only because I took on another role. Generally for crew members there are no pay raises unless you become a manager and those positions aren’t always readily available this was the one thing that I didn’t like but everyone is amazing!
good,"I loved working at chipotle! Besides the fact that you get free food every day that you work, I loved the work environment and the family-like bonds that we built there. The team members and the memories were beautiful."
good,"I personally love working at chipotle. I have been working here for 9 months and started out as a crew member, and was promoted to certified trainer a couple months ago, and my manager has already been talking to me about becoming a manager. The pay is great, they pay far more hourly than other fast casual restaurants I have worked at. My coworkers are awesome, we all get along together very well and it makes work fun. We had a 4th of July party and plan on carving pumpkins together for Halloween this year. Definitely my favorite job I have had!"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Great atmosphere  I don’t regret working there at all.my manger was very understanding. The crew members will always help you out if help was needed. There is nothing I would change about working there.
good,"I learned that many people can com from many different backgrounds but still unit as one to get the job done. This is the best job I've ever had that's fast paced, friendly work environment, and fun work to do all day."
good,Working on the grill is very fast paced and hot. The compensation could've be more but my former co workers were the best I've ever worked with since I started working. Nice and supportive.
good,"The best company yet that I have worked for in years! I would tell many people to work here! They care, loving it’s like a family of many different cultures"
good,"When I first started working for chipotle I had some experience and was very young  ,as time went by my experience grew so did my skills. I do not regret working for this company because it made me whom today I am."
good,"At first it may seem like a lot but you get the hang of things quickly, coworkers make you feel at home on the first day and the management is outstanding! Customers can get a little rude but that’s to be expected in any job, all around a very fun place to work."
good,"In all my years of working at restauraunts chipotle has the cleanest restaurant I’ve ever seen in the back. Unfortunately, their is a lot of policies and it can be stressful at times with work load, but it’s totally worth it when it comes to working with a great team and management. Everyone is very helpful and their to make you better and more efficient."
good,"I started off as a cook at Chipotle Mexican Grill, not even thinking about the possibilities of one day becoming a Manger. I worked hard for three or four months, when I was offered the Kitchen Manager Position. A few months following shortly after, I was given the Service Manager Position. I loved and enjoyed everything about my job at Chipotle, and I would do it all over again if given the opportunity."
good,"Hard work but it’s extremely fun. I learned a lot about food working here that still stick with me to this day. I made a lot of friends working here, coworkers and customers alike"
good,i built great relationships with the staff and was glad that i got to work there and learn things as i went. There were ups and downs but it was a great learning experience afterall
good,Working for chipotle I learned a lot and learned to work on a team. Team skills are need in most jobs and chipotle shows that best work place overall.
good,"Over all chipotle was a great first job. As a crew member you must be open to learn any positon from cash, line, prep and grill, but must of the time they will keep you in the positon you're best on for months. Managment it could use some work there is a lot of young managers. in my store my gm was 23 years old.  Hardest part of the job, closing a busy store. i was a closer and most of the time i will get out at 11:30pm or 12am."
good,This was my first job working with food directly so I was a little nervous. The management when I was there was super amazing. The environment was also good
good,I love this job it's the first job I been to that has a ton of benefits for a part-timer and they are paying for me to go to school. But you have to be st Chipotle at least a year. I started at $10.00 and in 6 months got a .30 raise which I would get less than that yearly at other companies. I really recommend to college students and highschool students.
good,"Working for chipotle there will always be a stigma surrounding 'fast food' employees. first and foremost, chipotle is NOT fast food. We are much more than that, our quality food, amazing atmosphere, and on-site training of knife handling, preparation, chef experiences are an incredible start to a possible great journey in life and if desired, within chipotle as well!"
good,"Chipotle gave me many opportunities to expand my knowledge of healthy foods, proper ways to marinate, cook, and/or store food, and allowed me to input opinions on what would make our store and employees better at the work we do. I was very fortunate to have worked at Chipotle and with the crew I had worked with."
good,"If someone is looking for a place to work where they’re able to move up in the company, love working with other people, at a quick-pace setting this is the job"
good,They made sure i was take care of and that my schedule and hours for work went well together. They make your work schedule two weeks ahead so its very easy for you to put in days you need off.
good,"You have to be able to pick up skills fast and use these skills fast, if you go slow in the beginning it's ok but speed is really key to being good at this job!  I liked when it got busy but it could be very stressful and anxiety inducing for some people, I didn't have an issue with it but a few people did.  Like-minded coworkers so there was little drama."
good,"Working for chipotle was a challenge but I also learned a lot about myself,  learned that I am able to push myself and work very well with others without breaking and also opened my eyes to management"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Dealing with rude ignorant and disrespectful customers. Team culture is on average really good. FUN people to work with. Huge advancement opportunities if YOU want it.
good,Chipotle is an excellent place to work so long as you have a good GM and field leader. Company sets you up for success and if you work hard you ca move up very quickly
good,I really enjoyed working for the Chipotle Company. Working for the Chipotle will teach you all there is too know about food and the whole restaurant business. I learned a lot from the Top manager to all the crew members its a great experience and i truly encourage all who are into the whole culinary arts and restaurant business to consider Chipotle first on your list.
good,The managers suck downtown very rude cut everyone hours no breaks an sometimes the chicken stinks smells really bad long lines long online orders just sucks
good,Chipotle is a job where you have to be able to learn quick and be able to replicate even quicker. There is a lot of knowledge at Chipotle since they make all the food fresh. If you want something that is challenging in the food industry then Chipotle will be a great job for you.
good,"It was an first excellent job, I recommend for people who like working at a fast pace. I learned a lot about food and I was proud to serve what chipotle had to offer."
good,"I started Chipotle in 2016 with the basic ability to manage simple business operations. Over the last 3.5 years Chipotle has helped me grow beyond the simple daily operations of a business but has taught me how to deliver strategic future business plans as well as fiscal management. "
good,"Honestly, great place to work. Days become fairly predictable so you get into a rhythm and can really affect the store's growth in a positive way once you understand how to deliver on corporate expectations. Staffing can be tough, but that's expected in the food industry. Benefits are pretty standard from what I've seen from where I've previously worked. They are picky on food safety, but I like that they aren't lax on that stuff.  I do wish I had more upward mobility."
good,My review as an Ex-Crew Member at Chipotle Mexican Grill is that they are a great establishment who really care for their workers.  I am very thankful that I had the opportunity to work there & I would love to work at another location.
good,"Chipotle was a great company to work for you can learn so many things from working there, weather it be cooking prepping or even just working the like to get a people connection. Management is very tough there but it’s worth it in the end. They really did care about there employees I always loved going to work, it’s was a very fast pace place to work for, but it made your days go by fast. Once you had worked there so long everyone became like family to you, and it’s great to be able to work in an environment like that where everyone At work got along and could have a good time at work!"
good,"I loved working for Chipotle!! I’ve worked at two different locations and honestly never wanted to leave. Management is phenomenal, hours are flexible and they’re more than willing to work around your life. Everyone is welcoming and diversity is truly celebrated. The only downside is the pay."
good,A day at work can sometimes be easy or stressful depending how which shift does specific things that needed to be done. you learn a lot at chipotle honestly.
good,Chipotle is a very empowering job with employees that will keep you optimistic and motivated to work. They have really good managers who really take the time to care about there employees.

good,I loved working at Chipolte. My manager was awesome. She tought me very well and supported me through the things I was going through in my personal life. The food was so much fun to cook and tasted even better. I would say the only thing that was hard for me personally was moving quickly and getting the line to move fast for customer satisfaction only because I was pregnant during that time.

good,Everyone always says in their interview that they are hard working. Here if you put you time and effort in you will go far. if you take you job and everything that the GM says in our orientation seriously you can move up in the company fast. Chipotle likes to create a pipeline of people in every store so that the people that really want it can and will become managers one day.
good,Chipotle is a great place to work. The team and management that i had when i was there was great. They truly lived the vision and the culture of the restaurant.

My first time eating Chipotle and it was my last. This is not Mexican food. This is gross and in no way, shape or form can this be authentic Mexican food. You definitely missed the mark Chipotle.

good,I do like working there. It is a good job. You should work there. You get paid and its flexible hours. They treat there works fairly. You learn all parts of chipotle
good,"Really enjoyed my time working there and very pleased with the management and coworkers. A typical day at work would consist of preparing food, serving food, attending customers, working as cashier, and cleaning work place. I learned how to provide proper customer service and interact with customers. I really appreciated the opportunity to learn different tasks aside from the tasks the pertained to the cashier which essentially helped me help my other coworkers with their tasks. I really enjoyed interacting with customers and with my coworkers. The hardest part of the job would have to be budgeting your time in order to complete all your tasks by the end of your shift."
good,It is a pretty tough job at chipotle. it's a very nice environment they teach you the skills in a positive and effective manor and they have really high ecpectations for everyone.

good,"I give credit to Chipotle for making me who i am today. I've become someone I've wanted to be for a long time. I have experienced so many good challenges and rough challenges that made me confident in everything i do. If i never had the opportunity to work for this company i feel i wouldn't have the skills today, to work else where."
good,Chipotle has a very fun work environment. Culture plays a large part in the business and it shows. Management does a great job in teaching you new things and not letting you fail.
good,Opening and closing shifts. Development of crew and management. Food orders. Inventory. Business plans. Hiring. Food Safety. Profit and Loss. Invoices.
good,"I enjoyed working here a lot, if you ever wanna work somewhere that will make sure you're getting what you need as much as they are then apply. My managers in the store I worked at were so extremely understanding, I almost lost my job here at one point and it was because I had become homeless and they worked with me. My manager asked me if I wanted to start training as the online specialist because it's higher pay. Enough for me to at least move in with someone and pay rent and I am forever grateful for that."
good,"Overall i can say working at chipotle was a great place to work, I met a lot of amazing people who even became my close friends. A typical day was slow and relaxed with the exception of the two hour rush in the middle of the day but even through that the team would stay relaxed and get the job done. After closing the doors at night we would begin shutting down stations and try to challenge ourselves to beat the record time of getting out which was 10:30. Most nights we would deep clean which means we threw water on the ground and scrubbed the floor until they looked good as new then dried the floor. Some things I learned from working at chipotle is that there is more than one way to get a job done it all depends on which style the person excels with. Another trait I picked up is being open to help, There is nothing wrong with asking for help. We are all one team and although we fail at times we did it together but we hardly did fail because we had the backup."
good,I love working for Chipotle in a little time I  became a takeout specialist  then 3 months later began KMIT I l9ve it there's no words to describe how much I love working here everyone is treated like family

They are fast paced and have high standards. They are on top of cleanliness, That you are performing well and that you have a mind to work. I have no real downsides with them that i can think of! Maybe having to wait in line when you are going to eat or having a short break if the line forms outside!"
good,The team at chipotle never let me down. they were all very close to me and we became a tight family. the company's benefits and compensation were extremely generous. couldn't have asked for a better company to work for.
good,"As an apprentice at Chipotle my responsibilities included training and developing managers, creating works schedules, executing proper cash handling procedures and audits, and maintaining my restaurants business model.

good,"The store I worked at had a very good vibe. All of my coworkers got along with each other, the manager was very understanding and everyone made an effort to make me feel comfortable. The job is demanding though, you spend most if not all of your shift on your feet, always busy with something. There are a lot of things to remember regarding food safety and so on because Chipotle is very strict on that, although they won't chop your head off if you mess up once or twice. You start off at $10.50 an hour with a small raise every 6 months. Plus, free food during every shift you work and 50% off any other time!"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Working at Chipotle is very fast-paced. There is a lot of prep to be done, all while executing food safety and creating an excellent guest experience. Being a leader, I  created a daily deployment chart, letting crew members know what they are prepping and what position they are deployed for the day. The hardest part of the job is the throughput of the long line of customers, while staying on top of prep tasks. I enjoy working with crew members and meeting goals and having fun everyday. I also enjoyed being able to help others and make them more confident in their work."
good,"I Had a Great time and many great memories with Chipotle. I learned so many valuable things about myself such as; Discipline, responsibility, adaptability, confidence, and leadership. But also, business and administrative duties, and equipment repairs."
good,"Working at Chipotle is fun. Everything starts off slow you get ready , you prep your food , you set up , and you wait. Doors open at 10:45am customers coming in at 10:49am. You Take There order and depending on your position the line is the best place to be."

Maintaining a clean environment is very important. My managers were the best and friendly and understanding. The hardest part of the job was none really it is very easy. The most enjoyable was the people I worked with, they made the day go by quick."
good,"Your crew is your family, and Chipotle teaches you communication, and working well together is key to a good work day. The management treats everyone like an equal."

good,I enjoy working at Chipotle Mexican Grill. It’s a really fast paced environment with an amazing staff. The management team is really energetic and are always making an effort to support its crew
good,Overall I liked working for Chipotles but I wasn't given many hours to work and also I was hired to be a cashier. When I started that was what I was scheduled for and little by little I was cooking and cleaning with the last week of work scheduled was for 7 hours for the week.

good,"I absolutely loved working at Chipotle, I thought I would have never left working at Chipotle, but other things come up and better opportunities come up. We had regular customers that came in and a few would always bring us things like candy or Starbucks. I loved my managers they were strict when needed to be and always handled situations correctly and smoothly and were very helpful with outside of work life for all the workers. I was a senior in high school and when I told my manager that school comes first, he completely agreed with me and said he will be as flexible as needed. I cried my last day because it was such a good job and my coworkers become more like family to me. One had a baby, two old managers are getting married next year. I loved it and I would so work there again if given the opportunity."
good,You can work your way all the way up to the top and that’s only if you want it! You decide. Great people culture and the management was always fun. Great company to work for and I would do it all over again!

I love working at chipotle but it is so fast paced and stressful sometimes. i already go to school full time and I want a somewhat easier job so that i can have my hair down, not have to wear a uniform and can come home not smelling like sweat and food. I love this job though because it brought me close to a diverse bunch of people, it taught me a lot of new skills and allowed me to push myself in ways I didnt think i'd be able to. This job really made me realize how strong i am, and how loyal i am. I will never regret working here but I know now that i can do better."

good,Working here was fast paced and challenging. I loved everyone I worked with while I was there. If I could have stayed in that area I would have. I definitely recommend anyone who wants a challenge and work family to work here
good,When I was working there I loved working with all the people that I did. They were super kind and funny. I learned how to empower others around me because that was one our motto's. The culture is super uplifting honestly. I enjoyed joking and laughing with everyone who worked there. The hardest part was when the line for Chipotle would get super long and we had to go super quick paced but with others helping we accomplished the task as a team.
good,I loved working here. It was very stressful but the pay was great and I actually got a decent amount of hours per week.The management was very organized and everyone got along pretty well.
good,"I love working at Chipotle. My managers are super supportive of my life choices and they offer help where they can. I am glad to work for this company and would not trade the time I spent at this job for anything! "
good,"A typical day at work would be serving guest accordingly, sweeping and cleaning off tables in dining area, making sure restrooms are clean, checking out customers"
good,"I loved my time at Chipolte . I started as a crew member and through great management was able to excel and be given opportunities for promotion . Helped me learn how to lead and motivate others . Also , I feel helped me grow as a person gaining great communication skills . Also motivated me to care enough to want to give the guest the best dining  experience possible ."
good,"Worked as a dining room attendant/expo. I cleaned tables, swept floors, washed dishes, restocked napkins/forks/drinks. A very fun environment to work in, you get a free meal after each shift you work but at times it can be very busy."
good,I would recommend working here for people who dont really have a career plan but want to be successful. Chipotle will help you with life plans and help you reach all of your goals.
good,"serving food that was good for people was awesome, management were so close to employees an made sure we each got 1 on 1 time to understand responsibilities and each other so it would be a more friendly working environment"
good,"A safe working environment. I had friendly co workers that wanted each employee to succeed and excel in not only our work ethic, but also in life. Working at Chipotle helps me balance my life."
good,Great atmosphere and good crew.  Always a new day with the simple ingredients challenging you along the way.  Never a late night or an early morning. Still eat there today.
good,This job kept me on my toes and they expect a lot more out of you than any other fast food job would. They also do a good job at moving people up in the industry.

This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,I love the food and all the people that work there! Things to consider is that if you truly believe that you can make a career out of it then you definitely can but you have to sell your soul to the chipotle devil. Other than that have fun and eat a lot.
good,"I love every second I worked there, we are a family. I had to stop working there because I had to come back to Carrollton for school."
good,"Mi evaluación con respeto a chipotle fue bueno y salí de esa empresa por prosperar , aunque si tal ves me"
good,un  dia tipico es preparar todo antes de abrir al cliente se prepara con las mejores ganas completamente sano y limpio luego a atender al cliente con buen animo he aprendido mucho de este empleo
good,The place was fun to work at and the customers were great but the fact that the managers are so young its hard to find structure sometimes they can be easily influenced . on firibg someone because they want to be liked by all.
good,"Work very hard and you will go far with this company. The family atmosphere keeps you here. Employee's care for each other. Don't be afraid to make a mistake, it will benefit you here at Chipotle."
good,"The work environment in the restaurant I had worked was so inviting, welcoming, fun, fast, busy and patient. I'd learned that advancement is very quick here if you so put the effort which isn't very hard. It's only so much departments you can transfer within a fast food restaurant itself, but if you learn quickly and genuinely wish to grow you may have the capability of rising towards restaurant manager and can even relocate to opening a new restaurant where you manage and help hire on new crew elsewhere....Which can be a very fast transition if you so work for that."
good,"I enjoyed the time I was at Chipotle. I learned a lot. The work is hard, but rewarding. The majority of the management team was great. They were always willing to help and train you."
good,Fast paced working environment in a high traffic store. Must move quickly and be able to take constructive criticism. Opportunities to move up in the company are offered and suggested throughout employment.
good,"I loved Chipotle, my favorite job I've had so far. Everybody worked as a team. We all put in a effort and work that was needed to maintain a fun and successful working environment"
good,Working a chipotle was very fun the coworkers was fun people to work with the food was good. When I was working at chipotle I was working 45+ hours a week. we had days where the coworkers would all come together and after work we would go out together. Chipotle was one of my best jobs..
good,each person is always knowledgeable with there job and designated area and encouraged to always become a top performer and your manger will daily ask you questions about your position so that you retain the information that is given
good,"chipotle is a very fast placed job, my only problem with that is  who they decide to let control the store, sometimes bad management can be a reason a store does not succeed, other then that chipotle is very clean and they take care of customers"
good,The people that you work with are what makes the job amazing. Overall an amazing job but it is labor intensive. Management above has their favorites in each store and chose those that they want to help rather than the ones that deserve it.
good,Fast paced job that is demanding.Key to chipotle is bonding with crew while continuing to be a leader and making others around you better.
good,"the environment is really great ,the food its fresh preparted in the morning everything has to be in cut sides manager are perfect motivation to became one of them always been ambistionsto  learn. perfect place to work."

The management is always supportive and genuinely cares about your well being. The crew members are very friendly and there is exceptional team work. The hardest part of the day would be trying to beat the time during opening and closing hours, and the most enjoyable part of the day would be pleasing great customers."
good,The best part about working for the chipotle is the fact that you can really focus on crew development and training. We also all work together to achieve a vision that is lead by the General Manager. My job is to empower my team so that they feel motivated and at liberty to devote there talents to helping me achieve Excellent Restaurant Operations.
good,They teach you new things daily and help you become a better person physically and also mentally. They show you that food with integrity is how to make the people happy.
good,"A typical day at Chipotle is pretty laid back. The food is great, a lot better than usual fast food places. Everything is FRESH, and we have strict procedures to follow daily to keep cleanliness to a 10. Also we get a paid lunch and free food, we eat as much as we like. As oppose of other fast food places where they can actually get to the point where they charge you the cup you are going to drink out of, or they ask you to bring your own cup from home.  The management is great, we all learn on a day to day basis of what we need to improve to become a better store. My co-workers are great, everyone is usually on the same page, and we work together to improve our culture in the store."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"one of the best jobs I have ever had. My coworkers became like family to me. Plenty of teamwork to go around, with room for personal and professional growth."
good,Management is team oriented while the job is easy and fun. A typical work day involved counting the till then heading to the cashier station to ring up the hungry customers. Jump in the service line if things are slow. Food prep can also happen before the restaurant opens; this helps in the manager in training program as a manager should know how to prep and cook all food. You count your till at the end of the shift to account for all cash received. A variety of customers show up and its nice to get to know the regulars.
good,"Considering that working at Chipotle was my first job, I had the best time working there.  A typical day would include seeing one's fellow co-workers that were so easy to get along with, preparing for one's shift, and serving food to the customers.  I learned to prepare the foods, chips, and learned to make quesadillas and rolling burritos.  The management there was easygoing, while simultaneously meeting the standards of the restaurant.  The hardest part of the job was peak time, which were the hours in which the restaurant was the busiest.  Aside from that, the work is a piece of cake."
good,The job in chipotle is very fun and energetic but at the same time you can develop your skills at many platforms. You can learn so much from the people you are working with. Sometimes it's hard work but at the same time you find it very enthusiastic and cool and you are just happy to work there.
good,"I loved working at Chipotle because it's a family based environment and everyone is just super comfortable with one another :) The managers and the crew members were more than just that. They were really a family. While I worked there, I've learned how to become faster and more urgent, but also careful. Chipotle was my first job and I can honestly say that it built up a lot of good qualities in me. The most enjoyable part about the job was it wasn't just a job. It was a place you can come in to and feel at home, a place where you are greeted with enthusiastic smiles, a place where you really feel like you belong. Overall, I would say Chipotle was the best job I've ever had so far."
good,"Great place to work with others. You will learn a lot about cooking and working with others. It's fast paced and you will not be able to stand around, there is always something to do."
good,The environment was healthy and ethical I enjoyed working with my team members and managers. Everyone helped each other with everything the job needed.
good,"chipotle was a very fun work environment, management was great they were professional and utilizes there staff well. hardest part of the job was having to leave and go to college because i really enjoyed working there."
good,"Loved working at the Beavercreek location. The energy was fun, the relationships were real and we had fun with the customer. Shifts can vary between 4 hours or a full 8 hour shift. You learn many micro managing skills if at the correct location and will make some cool friends in the process. If you are not willing to work hard and cheerfully, you will be replaced by unanimous decision of the crew."
good,I only wish it wasn't so much work for so little money. Management was very accommodating and everyone was very friendly.
good,Chipotle definitely has its ups and downs but overall it's amazing company to work for! There's always something to do there to keep you busy and moving around. The relationships you make with some of the customers are amazing.
good,A typical day for me was fighting with myself to do all my scheduled work marinating and finish earlier than last time start washing dishes earlier doing everything faster for me and all the crew could go out at the time we were supposed to.
good,"I learned how to cut chicken and how to work more as a team here. My co-workers where all fun and loving, very nice and caring people. The management was amazing, they where very helpful and nice."
good,"Chipotle is an excellent place to work if you value serving fresh food, interacting with the public, and growing with a team."
good,I get along with most of my co workers there. The only thing I don't like is there isn't a lot of one on one with your manager. I'm a full time student so flexible scheduling is really important to me.
good,"Loved the company overall vision. It was a challenging work which I liked and I was learning new things everytime."
good,"It was a fast passed casual fast dining restaurant."
good,"Great job opportunity for young people or people who enjoy a fast, friendly, and fun environment. They'll cross train which opens the door to more and more opportunities. This isn't your typical restaurant where you wait to become the boss, advance opportunities are always around the corner to anyone who's open and ready to receive them."
good,"In general, I manage the office work, check emails, prepare the money and the employees for the shift. I complete prep work for the shift, then oversee the employees to make sure everyone is accomplishing their tasks and going on break in a timely manner. I handle any customer complaints and oversee the quality of the food in the cooler and the line constantly. I have learned much about how to build a strong culture in a store and achieve the store's vision through diagnosing problem areas in the store and creating a plan to fix the issues and help the employees grow in the company and personally. The hardest part of the job is time management; between getting your own work done, doing audits for oversight, training employees, and developing managers on a daily basis causes you to have to learn quickly how to multi-task constantly. The most enjoyable part of the job is simply when a customer or the spokesperson of a group gives you a genuine thank you for providing a great experience."
good,"Working at Chipotle has been an amazing experience. I wake up everyday glad to go to work. The culture is amazing. We believe in making the people around us better. All of us are working together to achieve our ultimate goal. At times, it can be a little chaotic but we help each other out and prioritize. Its very fast pace and there is no time whatsoever to just stand around. You should always be doing something. My co-workers make me feel cared about and help me become the person I want to be, and in return, I care for all of my coworkers and help them become the best version of themselves that they can be. The hardest part of my job has to be dealing with angry costumers. Every once in awhile we get a costumer who wasn't satisfied with their time at Chipotle. We do all we can to help them and every costumer to give them an extraordinary restaurant experience. Our managers are all amazing people who find time to help each one of us. My team at Chipotle feels like my second family and I hope to take what I have learned here and apply it with everything in my life."
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Any given day working at Chipotle is different with just one common factor: customers want their burrito and they want it fast. It all depends on which position you are scheduled to work, and the only position I was never assigned to work the Grill. I worked the Tortilla station, Salsa Station, Cash register and Food Prep. No one person can do it alone, a team is required to make a day go by smoothly, like a well oiled machine. It starts with the prep person who makes the meat marinade at the begging of the night shift so that it is well seasoned for the next day's burritos. Every morning tomatoes are diced, jalapenos and salad lettuce is cut, cilantro is chopped, cheese is grated and fresh salsa and guacamole is made. Nacho chips are put in the fryer a batch at a time and salted to perfection. Salsa, Guacamole and chips are often made multiple times in one day so that the stock stays fresh. Each crew member needs to know about all of the food products sold so that they can give a customer a description of how everything is made and what it tastes like. Portion sizing is very important a chipotle, not only does it help customers be able to count the calories of how much they are getting in their burrito but it helps reduce waste at the end of the night. It is important that when working on the line a crew member is able to wrap a burrito so that the tortilla doesn't break or the contents later spill out into the customers lap. At the Cash register it is important to smile and give great customer service, this is where the most customer to crew member interaction takes place."

good,Not all Chipotes Restaurants have a great team that you enjoy to work with but my experience in the one I was at was a good one. Having a great leader makes a big difference and I was lucky enough to have a one of a kind General Manager. There for our team was one of a kind had a good experience working for Anzelmo.
good,"Working in Chipotle was tough, but amazing everyday. Chipotle has a fun, ""organic"" feeling to it that lifts your spirits as soon as you enter. It's a real fast-paced restaurant so you're constantly moving, never a dull moment lol. Overall, the management is OK, it could be better, but they try their best to understand you as well as your situation at hand. The pay was amazing! My starting wage was $8.65/hour and my ending pay was $8.80/hour. For a senior in high school and for someone who only worked 4 hours a day was pretty good. I came home with pretty good pay checks."
good,"This was by far my favorite job experience. It was exciting, fun, fast paced, great people, good management, and I was learning new things every single day.

I learned how to work in a fast paced environment while maintaining high quality performance. Multi-tasking over time became very proficient in my skill set due to this job, and the people I worked with were fantastic. "
good,"I have worked for this company for three years now and I've found this company to be an excellent place to work for when your just getting your foot in the door within the business world.

The management team has great expectations for their crew; they train and develop us everyday. The best part of the job is getting a smile and great response from our customers. Our Store has a very high rate of regulars.
good,"I loved working here even though it was for a few shorts months. Everyone on the night shift worked great together. We were one big family, which is encouraged throughout training. Management and trainers wanted you to succeed and be the best you can be which isn't seen at a lot of places. The only down side was that day and night shift worked totally different. The morning crew didn't do much to help us out, to them it was every man for themselves."
good,This company helped me gain experience in mangement with the guidance of the upper management. Depending on the assign schedule were your daily duties. The co-workers were great always followed directions and understood when it was fun time and work time. The hardest part was getting all the work done in one shift and get to learn new things to keep advancing.

good,"Love working for this company , very professional and allows developement for crew members to advance to higiher levels by promoting within, before hiring from outside sources."
good,"I was not expecting as much as I got from this part time job. I learned a lot from the people I worked with. Chipotle really cares about their employees, they constantly gave us a sense of empowerment. After the training period they trust you to make decisions at the drop of a hat. Considering it is a ""fast"" food restaurant they value people who can make a good decision quickly and under pressure. They are also very flexible with schedule needs, as a college student I needed so many hours off and they provided it, understanding that education came first. They are also flexible in the workplace, I was initially hired as a cashier but they soon found potential in me and began training in food preparation. The best part about this job was everyday was something new. Because I was able to work proficiently in many areas of the kitchen, I would never really know where I would end up at the end of the day. It was also very fast pace, which kept me on my toes and ready for the next challenge ahead."
good,"Fast pace..everyone helps everyone and gets to learn anything they set there mind or interest on. I learned how to be more open with guests/customers and how to start conversations with these strangers. Management is excellent they are professional down to earth managers and supervisors. Co-workers are nice. The hardest part of the job is when everyone is telling you how to do something there way,i got 5 people telling me five different ways to do one thing. The most enjoyable part is seeing smiling faces!its never a negative vibe there."
good,"Amazing in most aspects. Paid breaks, free food (they're paying you to eat their food!); THEY PROMOTE FROM WITHIN.. you can move to kitchen manager in a couple months if you're good enough; fast-paced environment.. If you can't handle it, then quit. If you like fast paced work, you're gonna LOVE this job. 8 hour shifts seemed so short. Amazing management - super understanding, know where you're coming from, constructive criticism, amazing co-workers. So much fun."
good,Very open for advancement and opportunity
good,I love all my co-workers and management team. We all work together as a team when you go to work here you don't think of it as work you think of it as going to work with family! Familly time is always the best time !

good,"Chipotle is not only my favorite fast food restaurant but has also became my favorite job to work. Benefits are worth working 30 hours for.

good,My greatest memory working at Chipotle would have to be when it was a fundraiser for a school. Talk about fast food. We probably managed to get out over 100+ orders in a matter of 30min to an hour. How many burritos and bowl do you think that is?!
good,While at Chipotle I learned a lot of techniques that real chefs use and I still use those techniques in my everyday cooking. The organization and cleanliness standards have also been a great trait I have carried away from this company.

I worked there for over a year and to this day (4 years later) I still haven’t gotten tired of their food, it’s my favorite! I’d highly recommend working at Chipotle to anyone who is interested."
good,"Chipotle has changed its vision a few times since I first started working there 3 years ago, but overall it is a great first job if you have a strong work ethic and a desire to learn. If you are lazy/slow you will not fare well and it will feel like a lot of work. Store performance varies based on management and field leaders/team directors. Turnover is generally low due to higher starting pay and amazing benefits compared to similar jobs - benefits from day one, free employee meals, 50% off, tuition reimbursement, paid break, etc. There are plenty of training resources available as well - iPad, recipe cards, videos, side-by-side training. The company is very focused on food safety and guest experience and almost everything is prepped in house daily by hand. Most stores are incredibly organized and crew members work together well. If you are looking to advance in the company it is something very achievable in a short period of time if you have the desire to get ahead. Being all corporate also helps with structure among every store and funding for necessary repairs to be fixed ASAP. Some cons depend on the area— for example working in a wealthy neighborhood results in few new hire applications and self-entitled guests who are not appreciative of the amount of food they get for what they pay. Chipotle does not generally charge for sides so people can take advantage and get a double stacked bowl for the price of one, which hurts food costs in the long run and takes advantage of the company’s generosity."
good,"Great managers. Can be very tricky but awesome place to work for they really do work around your schedule, never had a problem with them. Always friendly and nice, very clean and always very greeting to customers"

good,Chipotle is a place you’ll love. Great staff who are down to earth people and  they make sure they are on top of themselves and other who care how they go about their duties.
good,"I loved working for Chipotle, they offered on the job training, great benefits and trained to promote from within. We tried to interview and make our hiring decisions quickly, meaning if we didn't see the characteristics that we look for in our employees within 5 minutes, we typically wouldn't hire that person."
good,It was a wonderful place to work at and it's a good place to start gaining work experience. The workers are like family and make you feel at home at all times
good,Chipotle truly lives their mission. Very customer focused and employee centered. Management ensures that you are prepared to complete all tasks and do all they can to set each team member up to succeed and excel
good,"Chipotle was very fast paced, always had lines to the door but my team members and I worked together to get through the line with smiles on our faces/"
good,"Our manager held us to a high standard, and the co-workers were very friendly. However, because we were constantly understaffed, there was a high workload involved."

This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipotle was the best jobs I’ve ever worked. They provided a great culture, constant one on one meetings, as well as team building events. They promoted within having most if not all of my managers starting from a crew member position. They recognized great workers and fired unmotivated ones (no call/no shows, slower workers). During my interview I was not only interviewed by a manager but crew members as well immediately showing me that they cared about their crew members. Chipotle is a great place to work also offering benifits that I didn’t take advantage of."
good,"This job was fast paced, but that forced its workers to learn how to maximize their time while still following guidelines that the company has specified. The entire staff always wanted to help eachother out when things got hectic."
good,"I love working at Chipotle, its fun and you always have a great shift even if it's slow or super busy. My coworkers are amazing and I get treated like I'm family. The only reason i'm leaving is because I want to further my career in the medical field and get my foot into the door."

good,"if you want to make some good money and want something that is flexible with your schedule as a college student, then this the perfect job to get. chipotle!!"
good,We give them the empowerment to work as a manager that way we could lead them to a good career.  Teach them to not walk by things and don't correct it or make sure they follow the procedure cards we have.
good,Chipotle is a place where you can easily build yourself from the ground up. You can achieve to be anything in chipotle but only if you are willing to take the time and patience with others. And be on task with everything that is handed to you.
good,"each chipotle is like a unique family. Different stores have different corks. My store uses sarcasm and is fun. Team work makes dream work. We all will help eachother when needed. There is a certain volume of things that need to be cut or done, which can be stressful, but the team has fun with it and we laugh and joke together. Some stores are up tight and little less like this. Different family."

Enjoying who you work with makes a big difference in if you enjoy where you work and my team never came short in making me feel apart of the crew and they were always there to help guide me in the right direction.
good,You get to work around various different people depending on location! You get a free meal everyday you work and the benefits are great! Everyday there is something new and the connections that you build with the customers were amazing.
good,"I loved working at chipotle, it was definitely a great experience, it was very fun and I loved most of my managers and I definitely loved my workers, we all were similar and they were very good people, we always helped each other out"
good,"Chipotle provided me with opportunities to rank up in the food industry and provided me with knowledge about food safety, food quality, kitchen management, cooking food, customer care, running a shift, opening and closing the restaurant."
good,"When I began working at Chipotle, I had no idea what to expect.  Luckily I was greeted and trained fast and easy!  Everyone was welcoming and eager to teach.  I felt like I made a family during my time working at Chipotle.  Although the job can be stressful at times, I made great money and awesome memories.  I would recommend this job to anyone!"
good,"Hands down one of the best companies I have worked for. The crew really works together (including manager). Everyone opinion is considered during hiring process, No one is left out"
good,"This was an excellent part time job. Great benefits, great managers, great culture, and flexible. This job taught me to clearly communicate, always put the customer service as the highest priority. Highly recommend to any high school or college students looking for a part time job."
good,Everyone gets along perfect. Easy hands on training. So many different skills to learn. Great general manger. Excellent way to learn different things about food preparation and using utensils. Very understanding with working around your school or other job schedules.
good,"Coworkers great to work with, usually a great environment. Managers were in disagreement sometimes over what the new ""Chipotle way"" to do things was. Not a store problem but more of a corporate problem for continuously changing things."
good,The manager is clear and concise. The coworkers cooperated with one another. The place is always kept clean. The food is handled with care. Everyone is treated with respect and fairness. I highly recommend working there.
good,"A typical day at work go in make sure you're on your 1 days because every-day is the same technically. Learned how to make everything,  eye positions, and be sanitary.  Everyone got along like famy which made the work place a better place. Hardest part was not following g rules but having customers complain so having to break portions rules to give them more."
good,Always on the go go go very active fast invironment but very friendly coworkers always a team.  Working together and learning from eachother with a great smile and atmosphere.
good,The first thing I do when I arrive is Immediately wash my hands. i then check the prep list and begin to work on everything that needs to be prepared for the night ahead and for the next day. the most enjoyable part of the job is being able to serve quality food with genuine hospitality and be complimented for it. all the managers that work there are extremely firendly and helpful and never put you down but only try to help you improve
good,I was always excited to work because of my amazing coworkers. I loved the management and the job pace. Meeting and greeting customers always put a smile on my face.
good,"I enjoy working at Chipotle. It gets hard because I can only work when I'm from school, I wish I could be with my team while at school but unfortunately my collage is too far away. My typical day consisted of prepping food, serving, and cleaning. I learned time management skills, communication skills with both customers and fellow employees. The workplace culture is very face paced because of the nature of the restaurant, but you get used to it as time goes on. Management is great and I would've loved to be part of the management team but unfortunately because of school this was unachievable. The hardest part of the job is learning to multitask and work your station efficiently. The most enjoyable part of the job is your coworkers"
good,"Easy and stable pay for anyone who needs some consistency. Workers are not consistent, so schedule will change a lot. Easy to make friends and growth opportunities offered."
good,Learned the importance of inspiring those around me. Gained the ability to multi-task an complete each task efficiently. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to meet people from all walks of life
good,Days at Chipotle are long and hard but full of fun. I learned a lot at Chipotle going from crew memeber to General manager. Far as audits and schedules. The culture is upbeat and very friendly. The hardest part of the job is making sure everything is right. I enjoyed mostly everything about my job. A lot of downs but way more ups
good,"This was an excellent job overall. The least enjoyable part of this job was the corporate oversight and lack of notice for one or two corporate decisions that affected the work environment. For the job, compensation was quite decent. Benefits are for ALL employees. The most enjoyable part of this job was the team that I worked with and good communication and teamwork is vital to doing this job well. We dealt with a high volume of customers each day so it was necessary to be level headed and able to keep stress levels down in somewhat stressful situations. I had so much fun at this job and would have kept it or would go back in an instant were it not for my own desire to have a better job in the field and some last minute changes by corporate that flipped the work environment on its head."
good,Workplace is a very positive workplace. Chipotle also has a very unique culture that's about serving quality foods with great customer satisfaction. It's a great place for a first job because it shows you what hard work is and prepares you for future jobs and careers.
good,I genuinley love this job. I have learned a lot about different kinds of deposits and ways to do payment methods and the importance of a customer's total cost of items. Everything is simple to learn however the ladder to climb as far as promotion is very high and hard to reach especially for a full time student studying business and finance.
good,"A typical day at work consists of constant hygiene upkeep (washing your hands absolutely every single time you take off a pair of gloves). It's very sanitary but can get annoying I guess. I worked particularly in an affluent area so the customers were extremely rude and expected service to be a lot faster without accounting for low staff/ high volume. People often forget that this corporation is not a restaurant... and rather a fast-food place, same as Moe's. "
good,"Great people and atmosphere, One of the best places I have ever worked at! Everyone helped each other no matter what their job was.  At the end of the night the manager would even clean the fryer or anything else he could help with."
good,I had a wonderful time at Chipotle. The customers were kind as well as the staff. We all looked out for each other. It was always sociable because everyone worked so close together. Working there was a really fun experience.
good,"*Very fast paced"
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"As an Apprentice, you learn a lot how to manage your business & see the bigger picture. Not necessarily a General Manager, but filling in when they are not there. It is a time consuming & stressful job, but more rewarding if you learn the right way."
good,"Chipotle supports a unique and intelligent work culture, supported full by management and focuses on advancing. They take pride an ownership over each store. It may be quick-paced and stressful, but it is worth every minute."
good,"Great atmosphere through out the restaurant. Can be stressful;l when a large group of people come in during a lunch rush, but calms down and work is pretty simple. Talking and meeting new people is great."
good,Loved working there i consider crew friends and i would never do that but we got really close. loved those guys. The day would always go smoothly. we made sure EVERYTHING got done
good,Everyday it was something that needed to be done! There was always something to do. Overall the experience there was great! They treated everyone with the upmost respect. And you pick up on new things.
good,"It gets busy, mainly depending on your location and the time of the day. I learned a lot of things from chipotle that i even use in my own home. I made the best of friends at chipotle. The managers were cool most of the time but like i said that depends on your location and your experience. I even made great friends with the regulars. The hardest part of the job probably would be dealing with mean customers but those are rare. I can only speak for myself when i say I'm a patient person so i was personally never bothered by it. The benefits are freaking amazing you don't have to be there for a certain amount of time to get them. Plus you get free food whilst on the clock. You can even hook your family up when they come in (depending on your manager)."
good,Working in Chipotle was very good. I loved being able to greet the customers and serve them the delicious burritos and plates they chose.  My responsiblity was to keep the line moving and maintain an organized and clean environment.
good,Chipotle was a wonderful experience for me. I was able to grow in the company and also I'm life situations. They focus on customer service and high quality in the food. Chipotle has extremely high standards to be a fast food restaurant. They also have great people working on the team.
good,"i loved going to work , didnt mind dealing with customers as long as they are happy wih my service. i was able to learn more about team and how working as a team is like family. i learned how foods are made differently i also learned how to cut foods prep and also do grill . some of my managers was the best and trustworthy. hardest part of my job was learning to deal with mistakes you make but trying not to ake the same mistakes again."
good,It was very fast paced. Had to prep for the lunch rush and then help set up for the second shift. I enjoyed working with my coworkers and working for the company
good,"I really enjoyed working at Chipotle because of the wonderful people I got to work with. My main jobs were dishes, chips, dicing onions and cutting green peppers, as well as being on line. I learned to put on a smile even when a customer is being rude, and how you present yourself is important. Management had issues, especially with scheduling. The hardest part of the job was the somewhat mundane tasks that had to be done, but the most enjoyable part was working along side some wonderful people and having the wonderful customers come in and make your day."
good,"I been working at chipotle for about 3 years I became manager 10 months working here. I love my job but I need to find something else. Working here made me have great costumer service, I learned great manager skills and I got to learn a lot about food safety."
good,"Great company, great people, great work culture. Managers are great sometimes the feedback is negative because of the customers might be having a bad day."
good,Good job but can be annoying at times! It all depends on your location. Choose Wisely .. Hate that there is only one register. Food is great. Overall great experience!
good,"A close team of all ages working together to help one another succeed in work and in personal life. Everyone having the has the desire and ability to perform excellent work and who's constant effort  elevates their team, themselves and Chipotle. The hardest part of the job is pleasing everyone at the same time, which is also the most enjoyable part of the job is bringing them all together to achieve goals set for one another."
good,it was a great experience and wonderful place to work at. I enjoyed working there and the relationship I had with my co-workers was an amazing experience.
good,"a very area to work, chipotle is a career building company which take you from zero excellent, i am a living witness to that,trust me at chipotle you all learn the best"
good,It was just an overall good experience with the company. The people were nice and so were the benefits although I didn't use them. Food was good and store was always clean.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,Chipotle offered much growth and developmental opportunity.  Would recommend to anyone interest in the newest way of FAST FOOD.  The management cared about you and always a fun place to work.
good,"A normal day is completing customer orders and cleaning as people come in and out of the store. I've learned all the front end systems and how to keep the job business flowing. With a fun and energetic management and crew everyday is new and exciting. The hardest part about working here was customers that would stay late and throw off our normal closing time which extended out cleaning to that lead to getting out later, but the most enjoyable part was knowing that every customer walked in with a smile and walked out with a smile as well."
good,"I was impress with the culture, the ethic, and management. From the General manager  to Apprentices and a Training Manager that I worked with made all the difference.I have worked in many restaurants and it was my first time on a fast food place. They were passionate about their jobs, and amazed about the opportunity. See a team to help each other was very inspiring. The salary structure is very good too for a fast food chain. They give you an opportunity to grow and a lot of support, your success is their success. The place is fast and you will not get bored. I left because I had to. If you are looking for a fast pace job, and are ambitious to grow  I supper recommend . The only negative is that some people misunderstand the concept of elevating each other to become better, they try to find flaws on you to show off, that is when people complain of micromanagement. But this can be fixed if you address to the Team Leader. My issue was more with the customers, some people are just too rude and take advantage of portions, they want more, more, and more and not pay for."
good,You're able to always go higher from any position you are and soon be able to manage your own Chipotle. It's a great way to build leadership and team player skills.
good,"I really did not like it."
good,"Everyday is usually a fun fast paced work day. I mostly enjoyed working with the people that comes in and out of the restaurant. I always learned new skills and elevated myself from time to time. Especially those around me, I love making my co-workers better."
good,"I enjoy my job very much, my favorite part is to come in a feel a happy vibe in the atmosphere not only on our team but our guest. Creating a relationship with our guest giving them great customer service is what we do, let them know we care about each and every single one of them. I enjoy bringing that kind of service with my team."
good,Great place to work if you want to develop basic kitchen skills. Great Management and the ability to advance is definitely there. Could have better pay though depending on the job title.
good,I was able to gain friendship and being that this was my first job i learned a lot from it and has made me become more independent and stronger as a person
good,"I was in charge of cutting and cleaning the food so it could be prepped for the grill. I learned how to manage the inventory for the restaurant by order proper amount of food so the restaurant was neither overstocked or understocked. Management was fine, they try a little to hard to be your friend when they are suppose to be your boss. Hardest part of the job is to keep everything clean at all times because of random audits everyday. Most enjoyable part of the job is when the whole work shift is on the same page and we serve food efficiently."
good,"Very busy, made the days feel shorter. The managers really care about the employees.  Fun place to work. Alot of opportunities to advance in the workplace."
good,"The team environment is unavoidable. The family dynamic is so real, almost palpable.  You can feel it in the air.  You've gotta be able to learn quickly though. Don't be lazy"
good,Chipotle is a great entry level job. They have systems that if you follow will set you up for success. Great benefits for full-time and part-time workers.
good,"The best place I've ever worked for. I had the best crew, the bosses were amazing. Everyone worked as a team even the boss did as well. Stayed busy but had fun as well. Just all in general it was amazing."
good,fun culture and place to work. I worked in ohio and it was like my second family.  The company definitely expects high expectations but they are worth it and help you grow in the company and as a person.
good,i loved working at Chipotle it was my favorite job i worked at. i would be working there still if i didn't leave wilkes-barre for school in april of 2017
good,"I loved working at chipotle, there were a lot of key things i learned when working there."
good,Chipotle has a great people culture and there is a lot of opportunity to advance one's career. The have a strong focus on promoting management from within.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,"Chipole is known for holding too it high standards, although we were busy and had alot of work to do, we had a good time doing it. Walking in chipotle is like walking into a million dollar competition you know your going to win, were not just co workers, or a team, we get to know one another and become one big family, helping each other out with a smile, taking the extra step to make a customers day."
good,"I love working here, I love the people I work with, and the opportunities at chipotle are great! This company allows one the opportunity move up so quickly while giving you great benefits."
good,Yet very interesting and fun. Great management and coworkers. One of the funnest jobs I've had. It was very fast paste but slow depending on the time of day. Rush hour was the most difficult of all times. The more the customers the more food needed to be produced.
good,"Great place to grow and learn to work effectively and efficiently. Chipotle cares for their crew members. 4-8 hour shifts non stop on the feet, moving type of work. The culture is respectful and intense even from the interview; after interviewing with managers, the interview is conducted by crew members while the managers work the line. Ultimately, crew decides who is hired or not. This made it really difficult to not get along with everyone. I will miss the people here very much."
good,"The typical work day was pretty busy, served over a thousand customers per day. It could get chaotic at times but the savvy of our staff handled the pressure very well."
good,"The job was actually a very good job. All of the team members members were so helpful so the shift would seem to fly by. Chipotle is also very good at making a chief out of you, by teaching you all that you need to know about the basics of kitchen work"
good,"Very enthusiastic, good job to bond with others, great customers. Work consisted of preping, stocking and cleaning. we serve alot of customers on the daily."
good,"Productive, hard-working, team oriented and a fun safe work environment. Chipotle is also a place that stands behind there product and serve healthy choices of food."
good,Really fast paced most of the times but for me that makes time go by faster so i enjoyed it. Advancement opportunities are definitely there.
good,"At Chipotle the work is very fast paced. There was always work to be done and focus was imperative. Each employee worked hard and went above and beyond their own responsibilities. There was very much a team atmosphere and the management was incredibly supportive whilst constantly pushing each crew member to improve. The culture at Chipotle was wonderful, everyone took their work very seriously but everyone was so friendly and it was a joy to work with such fun people. Unlike some jobs, the work was constant and with the exception of a lunch break, there was so down time."
good,"I love chipotle , my co-workers are like family . They help me out with anything I need help with . Plus we get a free lunch ever work shift and 50% off when we don't work ."
good,"Prepping food, cooking in the kitchen, making sure everything is prepared and ready before opening. I've learned to be comfortable where you work and to be yourself because you will achieve more if you actually make mistakes and learn from them. Coming into work and having employees greet and talk to you as if your family. No one was left uneducated and uninformed always promoted for hard work. Challenging part was to keep our peak hour intact and focused to work on our product knowledge and timing. Enjoyable part was the relationship with employees and the feeling of it not just being a  regular 9 to 5 job."
good,"A typical fay at work is very chaotic, you have to stay on your feet because it can get very hectic. Lovely staff. I've learned a whole lot working here, their are some good days and some bad.Overall it's a great place to work, especially if this is your first job. It teaches you a whole lot. I love it !"
good,"Very comfortable work place,great management. Nice hours and good pay. Every day was fairly easy and smooth every one I worked with was very pleasant and it was a good working experience. They tayght me everything I needed to know about the job."
good,"Chipotle is one of the busiest fast food restaurants. The environment is very fast paced and you learn how to do things quickly and to the best of your ability. I learned how to build relationships with coworkers as well as customers. Being part of a team was one of the best parts about the job. One of the hardest parts was keeping up with high food standards while moving so quick. Overall, the customers, employees, and managers made working at Chipotle a great experience."
good,"Chipotle is a healthy food choice and a friendly environment."
good,"A typical day at chipotle would include opening the store including doing any prep for the day, such making the chips. Some of the things I learned how to multitask by doing three or four task at once.I get along with everyone I work well with others."
good,"Excellent place to work. You'll be in an uplifting atmosphere with people around you who are interested in your development, not only in the food industry but also your personal development."
good,"I treat them as family. I can express who I am and what I can contribute. "
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,I enjoy working at Chipotle it is a very fun environment to be apart of. The manager's and worker's are very open to communicate and  help whenever you need it. It is a very good first job for me

good,I really like working at Chipotle it was always busy so I learned how to work really fast under a lot of pressure. All my co-workers were very nice and caring and we always helped one another.
good,"To start off every shift I got a free meal of my choosing. I got to meet some interesting people and serve them the finest fast Mexican food. I would keep the restaurant clean and make sure customers were satisfied. At some points it would be intense like at dinner hour, there would be a rush of people and we would have to work as a team to get the customers to their food fast and happily. If there is one thing I learned from Chipotle it was team work, if we failed as team then we failed the customers. Which I hate doing personally I feel I failed if a customer leaves unsatisfied with their visit."
good,"Chipotle was a very special place to work. At Chipotle we focused on our Restaurateur program, and on finding a strong bench of future leaders who can bring our special people culture and high standards to more restaurants.  This focus paid off in strong operations, increasing sales, and a great unit economic model. It was important that we have all Top Performers. Crews that are Empowered and Confident in their ability and feel motivated and at liberty to fully devote their talents to a purpose.While setting high standards and creating a uniquely extraordinary restaurant experience for everyone of our customers and crew."
good,It was a good experience with the first time being able to really move up from within the company just be prepared for it to always be busy
good,"I've had a few other jobs, but Chipotle definitely has changed me and made an impact on my life, and on others as well. It may sound cliche, but we are like a family. I will always be thankful for the experiences I've had."
good,"a typical day of work consist of constantly moving, always picking up new or faster ways to complete a task. uplifting co-workers"
good,"fast paces, customer centered "
good,"Every day is a beneficial challenge. It stays busy all day, but the staff remains empowered to become better and help each other out. It's a very fun environment all while completing each task to the best of your ability and delivering outstanding customer service."
good,"Get a free meal for lunch. "
good,"Chipotle had a good working environment, I learned a lot about the food quality and the restaurant culture. Chipotle has really high standards and wants the best for their customers. What I enjoyed the most was being able to learn new things everyday."
good,"Chipotle has and continues to create a Culture. They emphasize the development of their employees, as well as their growth within the company. Chipotle cares for their employees and has not only influenced myself in the work place but also in my personal life."
good,It was hectic every day. My job was to keep things flowing and emit any problems arisen. We endured several obstacles but overcame them easily by working as a team.
good,great team and friendly management. My everyday went smooth and efficient until i proceeded looking for a better job opportunity.
good,"Fun workplace where you are dealt with, as a beginner and even seasoned worker with respect and empathy. Even though upholding the utmost excellent of standards is stressed liberally, work still feels fun and fulfilling. There is always something new to be learned and mastered. If there arises a task that proves to be challenging, rather than scold management coaches with a positive undertone. The culture is that of a family rather than ""just business"". Advancement is encouraged and management is ready willing and able to instruct."
good,From my experience a place full of opportunities. All you have to do is want it and work hard for it and you'll get the help you need. First and only job and I am glad that from all the applications they receive I was lucky to get the job.
good,I worked here for the summer and had such a great time. My co-workers were awesome and so fun to be around. The work environment was always fun and laid back and management always made sure to let us know what they expected daily.
good,"I started this job with no experience in the food industry, two years later I advanced from a crew member, to a takeout specialist, to now being a certified trainer. This has been nothing but a learning experience for me. I've how to teach and train others so that they're performing at their greatest potential. "
good,working at chipotle is always a good time dealing with great customers and co workers . the hardest part of my job would be leaving work I like it and it a bummer having to leave.
good,"Chipotle was a cool, clean, well runned business. If I went back to work for them I know i could a move up the charts to becoming  a general manager."
good,"The day to day work is somewhat stressful and fast paced but as far as the work goes it is fairly simple to pick up on even for someone with no experience in the food industry. It is considered a fast food establishment however the pay, benefits, even the teaching and eagerness of the managers and trainers is nothing like I have experienced anywhere else in the food industry. Of course being that it is a business it does have certain standards that they expect of you which is why they are able to use the ""13 characteristics"" as a means of qualifying applicants. Probably the hardest part of the job is actually getting the job, second to that is mainly based on how you are as a person."
good,I have only worked at Chipotle for a short period of time and I have found out that it's a family place and full of people with good vibes and good personalities.
good,"I always worked on the line...then again that's all I did, the customers you have to be patient with, you can move up quik and the benefits are worth it"
good,"It was fun going to work, a typical day consisted of going in with coffee waiting for the crew, some tunes to start out the day and nothing but hard work and dedication for the rest of the day. everyone always got along and it was fun and fast paced; always something to do."
good,"I started to work for Chipotle Mexican grill on may 29, 2014.I managed to master prep and grill in 1 month moving up is pretty easy as they are always promoting people.the culture is really fun great people food is great.Got promoted to kitchen manager in 4 months."
good,On a typical work day you would find each crew member along with the manager on shift working together to complete each task and make sure that each customer is satisfied as they leave the restaurant. Working at Chipotle I am able to come in with a smile & leave with a bigger one because of the fact that my co-workers enjoy making sure that we all are happy while at work.
good,"Considering I have worked here twice in two locations, like my previous review, I would not hesitate to work here again."
good,A fun place to work. The management team is great and really care about the employees. This company promotes from within which is great.
good,"Chipotle teaches you a lot about the culinary field. You learn knife skills, recipes, food safety, etc. I loved my job at chipotle. I loved training and developing others into something more than just a team member. when you work at chipotle you work with a family. The company offers great promotions and development."
good,I really enjoyed working for Chipotle Mexican Grill due to their drive and determination to be the best. It's a competition throughout to company. The company first branched of McDonnell's long time ago and now is one of the leading fast food chains in America and growing. They have a low turn over rate due to them training you to the best of your abilities and pushing you. It was a team effort workplace.
good,"A typical day at work is getting straight to work, being time efficient, and being dedicated to the company. "
good,"This job really pushes you to go above and beyond. They value high standards and want their employees to feel like they all have a valuable spot on the team. The work is very demanding, but that was fine for me because I felt that I was apart of an honest company that really wanted their customers to feel they were getting the best possible service and food. The hardest part of the job is probably remembering all the recipes, but if you enjoy cooking then it isn't so difficult. I got along with all my co-workers and management so well, I honestly didn't feel as if I was going to work half the time. One of the best jobs I've ever had if not THE best!"
good,The place is good and you can advance in no time. They treat their employees with respect and they want you to move up.
good,Management was great always willing to work. Co-workers always cheerful and happy to be there. The hardest part of the Job is keeping things clean everybody knows when you cook messes happen. Most enjoyable part of the job getting positve reviews and feed back from management and customers
good,"I loved working at this job, even til this day the reason they let me go baffles me, but i digress. I mainly worked AM shifts, so around 8 o'clock you'd come in, set your station up, 'mis en place'  as they call it, and knock out prep by 10:15, break til 11, come back- have your peak hour(12-1)- then do what little prep you need to do for the rest of the day, out by 3-4pm. I definitely value the experience involving my knife handling/maintenance skills, and use of gas powered ranges. Management was pretty awesome on a personal level, although they almost werent all on the same page all the time, where you have one manager telling you to do it this way, and another saying doing it this way- they manage to stick together and keep things running as smooth as possible though with little to no-mistakes. I feel I got along well with most of my co-workers, those who I did get to work with on a daily basis, I still am in contact with most of them via social network and texting/calling- some of them even are willing to be my work references as I look for another job, and have been supportive in me finding a new job/career, but somewhere near the end of my employement somebody had a problem with me, and instead of letting me know or addresing the situation when the said issue did occur, they informed a manager, who then told me while filling out my development journal, which I wasn't cleary told what happened why I had been repremanded, just to try and not let it happen again.Their wasn't anything hard about this job, if you loved to be in a kitchen environment, and serve customers-this"
good,"Chipotle Mexican Grill was a great place to work while going through school. It gave me a tremendous about of experience in management and interacting and leading co-workers/team."

The managers are relaxed and understanding people when it comes to family, school, and making sure their employees are comfortable and happy working there.

good,"When there is a group of managers that truly care about driving the mission, I believe this is truly the best job I’ve ever had. The first store I worked at in Houma, LA was the starting point for me which changed my life: I walked in to management that truly cared about the environment and making sure the customers and employees were taken care of. We were a team and we always had talks throughout the day about any updates the store received so we all had the right info. You have to be a team player and put in hard work for this job, but it is beyond rewarding. It will test you some days just like any other place, but the opportunity for advancement is spectacular. I then moved to Baton Rouge where the environment was exactly the same until I had to move to Arkansas where there wasn’t a Chipotle close enough for me to work at. I left as an Apprentice in training making $15 an hour. Tell me that isn’t one of a kind. And I also have forever friends from these 2 places."

This way, an employee will not get bored of working the same position and they can do different tasks on different days. The hardest part of the job is typically handling the customers which is a doable skill but it takes time to learn how to. I am currently learning about management because they want to promote me in the company, the current management is excellent but after a year, I realized that food service is not for me."

I learned food satey management and ""FIFO"" which is related to food safety. I was head of MSDS (material safety data sheet) and held siminars with new employees to go over the dangers of using certain chemicals.

However working with the employees I had made the job seem like a piece of cake."

good,"I was absolutely intrigued with my interview with my General Manager! We discussed rules and regulations, the standard and we really got to know each other. The amount of enthusiasm I received from my boss was priceless."
good,Chipotle has given a chance to experience a ton of responsibility and trust. To be a manager at 19 I am very happy. I get to learn how to manage myself and others in difficult situations. Being trusted with such a big job meams a lot to me

good,"I remember for my very first interview, I wore a dress because this would be my first time EVER being interviewed and I was beyond nervous. I thought I had overdressed but another girl walked in with one on and that eased my nerves. The plan was, I suppose to get the job for the summer but that went down hill. I ended up having three more interviews after that and didn’t officially start working there until school started. Yes, my first official day was on the FIRST day of school and those days already give me a migraine but then I had to go straight to work afterwards and I about died because there was so much going on. I felt like my head was going to explode and I couldn’t fully process all the information my trainer was telling me. After the three days of training, I was a really slow worker and that didn’t help since Chipotle was a fast paced job who was about getting the customer “in and out” and providing excellent customer service. After awhile, I started to get the hang of things and I learned my place. Being part of a restaurant has it’s stressful days and it’s fun days but never forget, that’s what makes life, life."
