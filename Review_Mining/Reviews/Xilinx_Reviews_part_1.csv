rating,review
bad,Nice Building. Nice People. Management practices are not so nice. If you might be a contender for a management position do not pass it up because the person who might be managing you could not know what they are doing.
bad,"do not go to Xilinx"
bad,The company has not invested in the infrastructure needed to meet the XV goals.
bad,"Xilinx used to be a good place to work, but during the past few years new management has dramatically changed the work environment for the worse. Management no longer cares about any kind of work/life balance, employees are now just a commodity, moral is low, and despite meeting goals and objectives the salary increases, promotions and bonus payouts are few and far between. Most of people I know who are still there are worried they will be the next to get laid off."
bad,"A typical day at work involved phone support, email support, walkup support for NT and Solaris issues. The site was woefully understaffed, and I was closing around 40-50 tickets a day in order to try and keep up."
bad,"Mgmt keeps employees in fear of layoff so they work stupid hours. Politics runs rampant, it's all about who you know and who likes you."
bad,"Xilinx is a fairly hard driving, high stress environment. The focus is on top line revenue growth and the approach is aggressive. The work environment is results oriented with no excuses mind set."
bad,"everyday new work is imposed however everything is specific to company's methodologies which pay no worth outside."
good,"Overall strategy is not clear, needs a breakout growth strategy that is clearly communicated and funded. "
good,"Xilinx is committed to continuous expansion of these customer initiatives in future generations of Xilinx’s All Programmable technologies and devices."
good,The culture at Xilinx changed during my time there.  The goal was to move as many jobs as possible to Asia which made it difficult to feel secure in your position.
good,"Xilinx was personally a great work experience for me.  The workweek is 50-60 hrs, with the expectation of electronic/mobile availability after hours and on weekends.  The work environment is intense with a gruesome review process and semi-annual layoffs, yet the pay and benefits were excellent."
good,"It's a good place to work especially for new colledge grads with reasonable compensation and benefits. There are many smart engineers who always put in 100%, though there are tons of red tapes and poor decision making among the top management teams."
good,Established company still growing in new directions. Good product. Lots of unknowns with the new direction of the company. Potential for frequent strategy changes in some areas of business.
good,Typical day: efficiently completing core responsibilities. Co-workers are helpful but median age is very high company-wide.
good,I worked mostly in the lab. Lab work was interesting and fun. Setting up all the equipments and getting the tests done was a good experience. Management and coworkers were friendly.
good,"Highly dependent on the team you are in, some teams give freedom to work, some just micro manage. My team sucks, it's either the directors way or the highway."
good,"Xilinx management provide a good platform to individual to drive their own projects and goals."
good,"Management need work.  Co-workers are Ok to work with. Good Benefit & bonus. Did learn a lot of thing in this company & hopefully I will apply to other company's opportunity,"
good,Met lots of great people motivated to do a great job.  Good sense of comrade. Great products.  Managers should be required to take management training.
good,"I worked there so long ago, this review is outdated. I'm sure everything has changed. It was conveniently close to home and at the time a good place to work. I met some life long friends there."
good,"This is a sweat shop company in the Silicon Valley."
good,"One thing that's good about Xilinx is the diverse line of activities ranging from product marketing, customer interactions, hw, sw, and embedded system design."
good,Great team to work with. Great tehcnology with a very wide multi-marketed customer base.
good,"Xilinx is a very structured company, top down. It does have a stale feel. Everyone’s job"
good,"Good tough place to learn and work. Management is lackadaisical, HR scams you without well researched review/raises. Work pace is not good in some groups, others are cruising."
good,"Xilinx was an excellent place to develop a career."
good,Great people to work with and a professional environment. Also many projects that deal with fundamental compiler technology that makes it very interesting. Typically promotes from within therefore there is growth opportunity.
good,Great company to work for. I will surely recommend to others
good,"Worked here for 7 years.  Over that time I had 4 promotions, annual bonuses and raises, and was often recognized for my contributions.  I truly felt I would stay and retire there is possible, but life took another turn. Overall I would say it was a great company to work for.  I've heard things have changed, but there are many old timers still there."
good,Xilinx is a great company to work for. Their products is for the future. The culture had changed from the top 5 company to work for. The flexibility of FPGA is always the best option for customer. There use to have big number of engineers loved to work so much that the CEO had to remind them to take vacation.
good,"Xilinx is a good company, but of course it has many flaws. The work they do here is great and give decent compensation. About everything else is lacking, little work life balance, low sociability, very old community, they challenge new ways of doing things, poor cooperation and communication, poor programs for training & development, little to no job advancement opportunity."
good,A new culture is being born and the new CEO is not making the shift smoothly...changes are quick and immediate.  Everyone seems to be stepping over each other and poor senior management changes are being made.
good,Was a great company to work for until they moved CEO out and brought in new CEO who started first layoffs in 30 year history...as they moved work to India and Singapore. Resulted in half empty brand new building.
good,"Committed, smart people. Code of Conduct is not enforced in all departments. This can cause a stressful work environment. However, Xilinx had an excellent philanthropy group and wonderful events to support worldwide communities near Xilinx offices."
good,I enjoyed working at Xilinx and I would gladly return.  Corporate culture has changed for the better in my opinion over the last 10 years.  They are poised for additional growth - but it will be slow.
good,"Management is the biggest flaw within this company. I went through multiple managers each with their own ideas of the direction of the program. During my time at the company, just about all of my co workers were extremely professional and easy to work with. The most difficult part of my job was satisfying upper management with endless reports and pointless projects, rather than focusing on the deal and customer support. The highlight of my time at this company was the internal and external customers I supported."
good,"18 years ago when I was hired at Xilinx it was a great place to work. But about 10 years ago Xilinx stopped doing the job that I was hired for (SEM/EDS). They tried to train me to do a different job, but I never really liked that job and I never became really good at it. So when Xilinx offered my a chance to retire and get a nice package, I took advantage of that."
good,"New CEO is making major changes to company corporate strategy and direction, and realigning resources and budgets to match. Time will tell if the new focus is the right one, it certainly is more aggressive and focused than prior management."
good,"Xilinx is a company that has a strong hold on its market. It is one of the two big dogs in its market. I love my team because we did such a good job hiring the right people. Everyone is friendly and works together well. "
good,I really liked working for Xilinx.  However after 17 years in the export and import compliance field there was a re-ord and my position changed.  Until this change I was really happy working for Xilinx.  Now that I have been moved to another group I don't have the opportunities to grow that I previously had.
good,"Very interesting work. Incredibly advanced and complex technology. Smart, diverse, and talented people to work with.  Good intentions, but inexperienced leadership team.  Workplace culture is inconsistent group to group.  Lack of investment in perks and people programs, so limited employee value proposition.  Infrastructure and systems are behind the times - inefficient processes and practices.  Great place to learn and develop skills.  Intense work environment.  Competitive learning programs, compensation and benefits."
good,Depending on what kind of projects you have it could be exciting or boring at times. Learning is fast paced and it is up to you how you want to take your career to the next level. Managers for the most part are encouraging.
good,Xilinx is attempting to make a transition from pure play FPGA to a solutions provider to the data center market.  Unclear if the management and core competency of the company is aligned with making the transition.
good,Good place if you are planning for your retirement.  Pretty much doing the same thing and the project is not that interesting.  Good work and life balance.  Good gym facility and the food are not bad.
good,"Productive, Great team environment, friendly co workers and a great work life balance"
good,"This is a good company to work. The enviroment is nice."
good,The working environment in Xilinx Asia Pacific (XAP) is very comfortable and inviting. Perhaps it's the building structure or layout. The working culture transited from a family-like to a more professional corporate style. Change is a constant in a MNC like Xilinx; mass retrenchment o a shutdown of a department in a certain region can be expected.
good,"Xilinx is a very good company to work at."
good,"Energetic and creative people, good corporate culture."
good,"Good work life balance in the company, co-worker and management are friendly and open to share their experience."
good,"A typical day at work would involve meeting with designers and management to review the progress in verification and to obtain any updates in the design requirements and come back to the cube to work on the Verification Testbench , test cases and debug the design. I have learnt quite a lot about hardware verification . Co-workers are pretty good."
good,"Workplace culture is very important. It impacts the creativity, quality, cross-function team cooperation and  successful personal career path. Sometimes it is more important than salary."
good,"It's a mature company with a startup like culture."
good,"Good place to work. Nice benefit, reduced lunch, soda and bottled water, There is a on-site gym that opens before normal work hours and close late evening."
good,Very involved in community outreach programs that allows employees to build relationships with co workers outside the workplace. Great benefits package.
good,It's a great company to work. However it's a little bit far away from my home. But the good side is that I was against traffic. I missed my many friends there.
good,I have learnt a lot of good things at Xilinx. This is my first company and first exposure to the corporate world. It has the perfect work-life balance.
good,"Great coworkers focused on key areas of expertise, but sometimes the organization can be a bit siloed.  Fluctuates between centralized and decentralized in organization."
good,Overall a decent place to work. I enjoyed working here. I liked my position.
good,Good corporate culture and work-life balance. Encouraging environment to pursue for innovation
good,Complete my job.
good,Laid back yet very professional. Management worked closely with employees and promoted career development.
good,The IT dept is one of the best even if you are a contractor for most of the non-management jobs. The only gap is the lack of ability to move upward or out of being a contractor.
good,I absolutely adored my manager. Xilinx is a successful company on the bleeding edge of technology. Hope the recent change in CEO leads to higher level of employee engagement.
good,"A typical day at work would be brainstorming on a new automation methodology or an automation request from designing team or debugging a design issue or deep delved implementation of any of the above and almost every day at work is challenging and gives a sense of satisfaction as you create some frameworks which the whole of company uses"
good,"I came to Xilinx in 1997 and thought that I would retire there which is what I still wish could have happened. I miss Xilinx, the culture, the people, the management, the direction, benefits. I don't blame Xilinx to a degree for letting me go due to my knowledge base which needed to improve but I didn't take the initiative to take advantage of the opportunity afforded to me. Xilinx is second to non when it comes to employee incentive, reward and recognition."
good,"Great company to work for, I learn a lot It was my first desk job and allowed me to learn skills like customer service, hardware tech, inventory control, machine operator, Quality control, Quality assurance, and Management."
good,Xilinx is a world leader in FPGA products. They work at the cutting edge of technology and develop state of the art products. It is a great company to work in.
good,"Everyday is a challenge.  "
good,Good Company if you're not a contractor. Management is stressed.
good,"Good place to gain knowledge "
good,"leading edge technology, thinking out of the box is always welcomed, excellent managers (in my case) rewards for achieving goals, learning culture, investments at all levels of the organization"
good,Wonderful workplace with a very diverse group of talented individuals. There are a lot of company/community events which really helps to boost morale and really make this an exceptional place to work.
good,good place to work but the pay was below average but the benefits were good.
good,I do my job good and my job is a good memory in my life. I miss that place     very well and want to go back if possible. I leave my job because I need to go aboard for my Ph.D. program.
good,"It was very easy to learn lots of new procedures and product while working here. I moved around in many areas while employee here. I moved from production to management. I also worked in the training department . We wrote new produces for the operators. Trained new employees, test the operators. Great place to work."
good,"Fair amount of autonomy in my position with the right amount of management, interesting and impactful work and learning opportunities. Also productive and fun workplace with ping pong table."
good,"Our day started with a production meeting."
good,"i am uncomfortable answering this question. There is much to learn, great people. there is no typical day. great products. leading edge tools. there are a CA based company, with a local sales office."
good,"Clients and HR Team were of the best caliber possible.  Business leaders were down to earth, focused on doing the right thing, had lots of integrity, and were honest with us as an HR team when things went great, and when they wanted to see improvement, a true gift."
good,"Excellent Customer service to hiring managers. Several reqs that needed to be filled, were filled. Great process and support."
