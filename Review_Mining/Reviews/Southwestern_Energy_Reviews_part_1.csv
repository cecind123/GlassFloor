rating,review
bad,Great pay great benefits.  Extremely poor management   last several years. Very cut throat & management played extreme favorites.  Actual Job was stressful but problem was management.  Great management in first several years but terrible in the end. Always lingering threat of job ending or transferring out of state (which ultimately happened). Great severance package though. Would not go back with current management.
bad,Long gone are the good old days.  IT management changed and not for the better.  Company is firing left and right and soon will be gone.  I would never send anyone to work there.
bad,"The culture in the IT department is horrendous."
bad,"high day rates so no other energy company will hire their drilling company. they use the buddy system to hire these days. i know for one instance they hired a 60 year old man that could barely walk over someone in their 20's who was begging to work...both doing the same entry level job. makes a lot of sense, huh?"
bad,"Very good ole boy operation. If you are not part of the clique you will not survive. First oilfield job and learned a lot about the industry and am grateful for that. Met many great people, Very fast paced and demanding job. On call 24/7/365."
bad,Too many meetings that were poorly managed.
bad,"Pay was good.  Management was NOT!  It was all good at first and then things changed before they moved everything to HQ.  Day and Night shifts rotated, was open 24/7/365. Worked 12 hr shifts. 36 hrs one week, 48 the next."
bad,"Typical bad company culture:  all about who you know.  Idiots are given responsibility and advancement.  Too many chiefs with now, even fewer indians.  The decisions to take the company in the direction it currently is was completely greed driven"
good,Company let a lot of people down with its management decisions. Took on to much debt at the absolute worse time possible in the field. Never recovered when founding CEO left.
good,"This is not a good place to work."
good,THe AR department is horrivble. The manager is horrible and a high turnover rate. The company is great.
good,I’ve been here for a year and a half. I work as a contract employee as a water transfer consultant. They are very safety oriented. Easy to get family time.
good,Management is horrible always telling employees that are frustrated there is someone who will gladly take their spot and to get over their issue. Benefits are about the only good thing there. They told all of us career long jobs and laid off almost our entire area with 10years. Management is completely disconnected and allows middle management to waste a lot of money by doing jobs in a backwards order like spending thousands on production surface equipment and then realizing they can’t set downhole equipment and just removing all the money spent on surface equipment. Would not recommend getting real comfortable with them.
good,"SWN has many talented and good people, unfortunately the upper decision makers are not some of them. You will often find company directives and annual plans that are little more than fancy buzzwords. If there is a question about details and next steps to secure the future, it is met with more buzzwords and a long rhetoric about how great SWN is. I think the executive level actually believe the stuff the say, but everyone that does the work knows spinning bad situations with fancy words and refusing to take responsibility doesnt really do anybody any good."
good,"It is sad what has happened to the oil and gas industry in general and this company specifically. At one time it was an exciting and challenging place to work. It was very team oriented. While the people who work there are wonderful, the corporation was poorly managed and faltered."
good,"SWN used to be a great place to work.  The culture was great.  The leadership listened.  People were paid well.  After the 2016 layoffs all that culture left as well.  The Layoffs were too deep and everyone that was left had too much work for too few employees on miniscule profit margins.  Essentially the culture left and all that was left behind was a humorless, unrewarding, extremely demanding sweatshop."
good,"SWN's upper management is vastly out of touch with the lower levels. Career advancement, especially in IT, is low and very structured. Expect to only hear talk of promotions every 2 years, rigidly."
good,I am thankful for the knowledge gained by working for SWN. I wish them the best of luck in the future as I still hold many shares of company stock. I think the new CEO will do great.
good,"Wonderful job working with competent, experienced staff.  Management was mediocre, micromanaged by upper management for the most part.  Recently, full time employees were replaced by contingent workers and then full-time employees were released, due to reduction in forces."
good,It is a great place to work and gain valuable experiences but not that much support from supervisor. It is a very fast pace and long hours.
good,Work there was good and the expected work ethics are a given. Pay is great for this area. The management does get pay perks that arent handed down to the employees that earned it.
good,Southwestern Energy is no longer fostering growth and advancement. People are not focused on the overall corporate purpose and the spirit is leaving the team.
good,"Fun place to work (good work/life balance), but bad decisions at the top make it a dying company. Two massive layoffs in 2 years make it a risky company to work for"
good,Overall nice place to work. Southwestern grew rapidly and is the second largest natural gas producer in the United States and operates with environmental stewardship.
good,During my time at Southwestern Energy it seemed like there was always worry about stock prices and meeting about budgets and the IT related projects that were in place. Wasn't the best feeling and as a smaller company I really don't see it getting better.
good,It's  a good company and nice work life balance. The management is very considerate and the co-workers have a great attitude. You could take the Kids to work once a year and show them the place and they have a great educational exposure and fun time.
good,Was a good place to work. The job was intense but satisfying. A layoff in January put 1100 people without a job. Awesome co-workers.
good,Really love to work with my co-workers. And being with the company for 10 plus years I have acquired a great deal of friends. I was unfortunately that the company made such bad choices which sent the company down. They say they did what ever they could to keep from laying off but I do not think it was possible to avoid it. I enjoyed my 10 plus years working for Southwestern Energy.
good,"Work load can be heavy since we are supporting a 24 hour operation. Adequate training has been provided which are very useful in our jobs.  Management and co-workers are typical for a company that have seen growth in a short time - pleasant and professional, eager to make their contribution to the company.  Completing projects and seeing it helping the users is the most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"SWN has had 2 major layoffs in the last 2 years. Although the work life balance is terrific at SWN, you are constantly on edge whether you had a job or not the next day."
good,Management was oblivious to many people's talents and drive.  Most of the time my manager didn't even know what my job was.  Everyone was really nice.  The culture is great.  Good people.
good,very good co-workers but the only way to advance is the buddy system
good,"Best job I ever had until the end. I was there for 13 years. I could honestly say the first 8 or so years were the best in my life. It was a wonderful Company to work for. A management team that cared about the employees AND the company. The last 4 years of my tenure I could just feel the Company falling apart. The new Leadership is just riding the roller coaster to the end of the cliff. The writing was on the wall when you saw all of the best and brightest management being ran off by the new CEO. When they start leaving, its only a matter of time. I would have left sooner if I would have seen the light."
good,"Management lacks experience in running a noc and no systems admin background, so this causes problems with managing a Noc with system admins. Also the company lacks communication and direction in the IT dept."
good,Working at SWN allowed me to increase my knowledge and understanding of natural gas measurement. I worked with a talented group of men and women. I was laid off when Flywheel Energy purchased SWN.
good,The hours are long and the work is stressful but the pay and benefits were awesome. It was a great place to work before they got too big. Difficult place to be a woman working in the field.
good,Biggest complaint is Corporates involvement and micromanagement. Field location management is great! Job can be very stressful and demanding of your time.
good,Very good company.  Enjoyed by time there and learned new skills.  The men I worked with were knowledgeable and the workplace offered a good environment to work.
good,"Overall good company, great benefits, safety was a priority. Management was a buddy system, who you know, not qualification."
good,"Installation and Build process"
good,"Has been a good company to work for.  The work was enjoyable and the benefits competitive.  Biggest downside is that the oil and gas business is cyclical and right now, its down."
good,"Check multiple locations, wells, compressors. Fix issues and adjust components. I learned so much about gas production and well problems. Its made me who I am today. The management turned over 4 times while I worked here there for making it hard to prove myself. ultimately its why I left the company. The buddy system is big here. Really did not get along with any immediate co-works in the Artificial lift group I was in. Back stabbing and game playing to get ahead is not my style. Was reprimanded for helping others with out asking. There was not one hard thing about this job. Easiest job I have ever had. The management took away responsibilities ever time it turned over. Kinda like Walmart (more for less).  I enjoyed the paid vacation and sick leave. used ever bit of it."
good,it was a ok job not very diverse though its only downfall!!! I liked the guys I worked with I liked one of my bosses and it was laid back
good,Great company to start with. They are growing fast and expanding
good,"Fast growing company with the growing pains that come with  growth. Offered good jobs/benfits in an area that would not otherwise have good jobs. Pay not competitive, did not pay as well as other oil & gas companies for fieldwork positions. Still great company to work with. Teamwork in the field fueled SWN's growth."
good,"The culture and values of this company are great, I personally think that there are some people who do not like change. so It was a bad experience for me. "
good,I enjoyed working at SWN and would like to work there again someday. My co-workers were great and I had a wonderful boss!
good,"My typical day involves installing gas separators and water tanks, and when we are not doing that we are either helping other crews install flow lines, dump lines, and load lines, or we are out somewhere doing maintenance."
good,"Flexible hours, friendly staff, 9/80 schedule. The new building has a lot of desirable amenities such as a gym, cafeteria, covered parking. The furniture in the offices is rather small. They have standing desks which is convenient."
good,"Some days are busier than others and I have to work long days and sometimes weekends when the job calls for it.  This position requires you to be self managed and responsible to be good at the job.  My co-workers are great, I enjoy working with them."
good,"Daily work on gas wells and maintain location. I was able to be certified in CPR, fall arrest, forklift and other skills and safety programs."
good,Excellent workplace that challenges and promotes staff that deserves such recognition. Current management has made some mistakes that have been recognized by wall street. Stock and lays offs have since been the norm.
good,The building has been moved and the drive is way too difficult for me to make. I love my co-workers but management is not all that great. There isn't much job upward mobility and I am looking for that in this stage in my career. Things have slowed down because gas prices are low.
good,I would rather not give my opinion of the company. I enjoyed learning to operate the equipment and am sure that the experience will be beneficial to me down the road.
good,"Typically a work day is very productive."
good,"This is a great company to work for if you are an engineer or geologist"
good,"I made my rounds daily to check the facilities looking for any problems or issues. Check work orders often and take care of them. Maintain PM schedule, work with vendors to maintain facilities and related equipment and to keep facilities clean and looking good."
good,Great place to work. Lots of opportunity to learn new things. Location was close to home and the work environment was relaxed. I position was contract so there was no opportunity for growth.
good,i am not an essay writer i do not see the point in typeing up more than what i should have to about my everyday work conditions that involve good working conditions one minute and then terrible working conditions the next.
good,I enjoyed my work and would recommend this company.  Division management is talented and innovative.  Opportunities for training and development were frequently available.
good,"Taking on all big projects creating a plan and successfully executing project after project, but then get no financial rewards or gains at the end.  Great company, but they pay very low compensation in return."
good,Southwestern Energy Company currently has a highly skilled current staff and they are very fun to work with. The facility in The Woodlands is also state of the art!
good,SWN has a fantastic company culture that was exemplified by its emphasis on safety and maintaining a work/life balance. One of the major benefits at SWN is the flex schedule that affords employees every other Friday off.
good,"- Employees were often encouraged to share new ideas and management wasn't afraid to implement the best ones."
good,Great company to get a solid engineering basis within their 2 year training program. This company is a great place for new engineers to start. They make sure you develop into a well rounded engineer between the 6 month discipline rotations and the base of talent within the older engineers
good,You can go up some on your own performance but have to know someone to get to advanced positions. Great benefits. Work/Home balance got better once upper management wanted to cut back on overtime.
good,This company rewards hard work.  You get out of it what you put into it.  A major hold back is that they aren't very fond of internal job transfers from one department to another.
good,"Typical day at work,"
good,"SWN was/is a great company to work for. Very relaxed atmosphere and flexible as it relates to work-life balance. If it wasn't for the company buy out, I would still be there!"
good,Always looking to layoff. Good compensation and benefits. Favorites played. No improvement with CEO change. Take on too much debt. 9/80 schedule is great.
good,Great company to work for tell they changed ceo went down hill from their.We had all new equipment to start with new employees new shop and shop equipment nice yard .
good,"Typical day includes project work and end user support. Direct management and leadership is very valuable and always looking to push you further. Overall culture at SWN is very family oriented, people first mentality. Hard to find in growing organizations who are trying to compete with the larger competitors. Enjoy the working relationships that have been built, making that the best part of each day."
good,Overall it was a good place to work except for upper management.The work was fun. Coworkers were awesome. Work was fun. I enjoyed the work wish things would pick up.
good,"Very busy work day overseeing 16 mechanics, keeping job assignments going, dealing with the venders, ordering parts, going to meetings everyday. On the go constantly. Making sure everyone was wearing safety gear and abiding by company policy."
good,"My time at SWN was awesome, I learned a lot, the people were friendly. I was laid off due to low Oil and Gas prices. I would absolutely recommend working at SWN."
good,"SWN was a good company to work for but due to commodity prices, layoffs had to occur. Training at SWN for new hires needs improvement."
good,Longest best job I've worked since being a professional in 2004! A place where you feel like you're wanted and needed to contribute to the company's business formula!
good,"Southwestern Energy had great benefits.  Initially it was a great place to work, then disastrous decisions by upper management doomed the company.  The future of the company is very uncertain."
good,"Good company and benefits. Goal orientated company that treats people fairly. Looking for further advancement in my career, management is great at SWN."
good,"Nice people good environment, great benifits and good pay , lots of driving and wintertime lots of hours , the company sold out and I felt like the management went down hill after wards lots of computer work but not to bad , lots of freedom and good being home every night"
good,"Challenging; Competitive pay and benefits; fast-changing environment; Open to education and career advancement."
good,"A typical workday at Southwestern Energy will include monitoring and controlling the flow, pressure and quality of natural gas utilizing Cygnet SCADA system."
good,"Like all work tied to the oil and gas market, the job depends on the market, which means there can be (and were) massive lay offs. That is how I lost my job. Great compensation and benefits, good people, but risky."
good,This company was the best to work for in the oil and gas industry. Safety came first with them. I'm a single father to a daughter so being away from home was really hard for me.
good,"I was laid off from Southwestern Energy during a down economy. Had it not been for the cutbacks, I would have loved to continue working for SWN. I would highly recommend this company."
good,"No set hours"
good,"A productive Oil and gas company, many good people working together for one goal. just a good place to work. hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"
good,good life work balance. can learn a lot form your peers and they always help. you can learn a lot about different aspect of the business. If you like to learn deeper about a certain section they train you an let you work in that section.
good,"great co-workers"
good,"Excellent company. Open Management. Good benefits. Outstanding people."
good,"Great company, enjoyed the experience and the environment, loved the volunteer opportunities and the company promoted growth and development.."
good,"SWN is a good company to work for, providing many benefits to their employees, including flex fridays."
good,The company culture was extraordinary and everyone supported you in your career. I worked with about 3 different teams on 3 different projects during my internship and throughout the teams I found the company culture of support and caring to be consistent.
good,"great life work balance"
good,"Oversee workover rig changing out tubing or any workover projects needed. I keep safety first and teach all people around me, as I continue learning. Ilove to read to increase my knowledge of my work tacks. Will start taking college online next year. I have learned alot about horizontail wells and new completion techniques.I enjoy working close with management and co-workers. Finding the right contractor's and keeping the best team due to gas prices. At this time not always getting AFE to continue working wells. The most enjoyable part of the job is you can keep learning something new everyday."
good,South Western Energy is a great company to work for. Friendly environment. A great learning experience. Enjoyed working for this company>  Would recommend this company.
good,"The company has a good culture."
good,I worked for three years as contract accountant at GeoSouthern.  I pretty enjoyed the entire time there.  I was involved several projects which gave me a sense of value and belonging.  My work was appreciated and praised.
good,"I very much enjoyed my time with SWN. I was given opportunities to advance my career, and I felt very blessed to work for such a great company. The pay structure was great in comparison to other companies in the area."
good,Already wrote review on company. It was a great company to work for while it lasted. We were very well compensated and had great benefits. The type of shifts and schedules that we worked changed multiple times which was rough on work/home life but for the last few years worked 7days on then 7days off with 12hour work days while on and rotated from days to nights every month.
good,Fun and challenging place to work. Laid back work atmosphere. Got to meet a lot of people and make a lot of friends. Supervisors did not micromanage.
good,I am currently an intern who is eager to learn what Southwestern Energy has to offer. I have learned many valuable tools to assist me when I pursue a career in this industry.
good,"Great company to work for, but in the end having to cut your work force by 45%, you can see where there are issues in the company."
good,"SWN is a great place to work great coworkers really great people"
good,Southwestern Energy is a Great company to work for albeit in an industry that has seen better times.  The management team is supportive and doing its best to weather a poor commodity market.
good,Fantastic company culture that will be difficult to leave behind.  Much emphasis placed on employee's responsibility to their community - with numerous volunteer opportunities for all employees.
good,I learn a new side to the oil and gas industry. My co-workers were very friendly and I still stay in contact with many of them. The hardest part of my job was dealing with people that where a little overbearing and not willing to compromise. Management was good at listening and weighing all options.
good,I've been employed by SWN for 9 years. The work culture is top notch. Safety is always the top priority. The benefits are very competitive. They have a great work incentive program.
good,"Morning meeting and then go to the field with your crew. Fun and enjoyable group of people."
good,"Very laid back culture, got to wear jeans to work every day.  Had every other Friday off.  Teams were very cool and managers were always looking to help you out in any way possible."
good,"I began my career at SWN as an EO 2 but quickly worked my way up to an EO 4 status. While there I learned many things and was able to be trained and certified on each piece of equipment on our pad, including cranes, forklifts and manbaskets and was taught how to maintain and perform preventative maintenance on all. I was also trained on computer programs like Frac Pro and AccuFrac that were vital to our operations.  I was also able to take on a more leadership role by training other employees on equipment, by supervising rig ups and rig downs and by excelling as a treater where as I was in charge of all Frac operations."
good,This is a fast pace company that value their employees. They offer free professional development classes other companies don't. Management believe family is important. Co-workers work together which makes going to work more enjoyable. The on-site gym helps as well.
good,"Great place to work, excellent culture and benefits, had a great career growth and worked with great technology and people."
good,"A typical day at work would start off with the morning safety meeting and recieving work orders. Then off to the parts warehouse to purchase all of the parts we would be needing for that days rig up. Lower management was great, middle and upper management had no clue what it really took to get our jobs done safely and efficiently. The most enjoyable part about this job was that I was the man in charge of my crew once we left the office for the day.l"
good,"Southwestern Energy allowed individuals to develop and work their desk and projects in their own productive process."
good,"Enjoyed working at Southwestern Energy.  Employees are treated like the ""cream of the crop.""  My position in logistics was demanding and kept me on my toes with daily changes in protocol and computer updates.  It was my job to get trucks to and from well sites.  Commodities included water (fresh, hydrant, production, flowback), sand, and mud."
good,"Southwestern Energy allowed  individuals to develop and work their desk and projects in their own productive process."
good,"I learned a lot about the production of natural gas from my management and fellow employees at Southwestern Energy. Its hard to get on but once you do, you feel like part of a big family. For the most part everyone looks after everyone."
good,"Fantastic company that was unfortunately hit hard with the downturn in the Oil and Gas industry."
good,Fun and easy going. Not overworked and well appriciated. Everyone gets along to get the job done accurately and in a timely manner.
good,SWN is a great place to work.  The managers and employees are a tight group of people that take their jobs seriously.  Each group has to work closely with one another to make the work flow take place without a mishap.  Everybody is a top notch worker that is an expert in their field.  We were allowed to improve upon any procedure to help the company and this happened often.  The hardest part of the job was in the early years of the water team having to deal with things 24 hours a day 7 days a week until we got our processes in line.  I really enjoyed the comradery that we all had and the success that we enjoyed day in and day out.  Every job that we completed was a challenge and a win.
good,"SWN was always a team-driven environment, which I'd never really experienced before. Management of all levels was always ready with encouraging words, advice, constructive criticism or anything else to make the individual and the team more effective. Likewise, they found enjoyable team-building activities to break up the monotony, especially after a difficult or time-consuming project. These things made us want to work harder for the company and made our jobs more pleasent."
good,"A typical day at SWN always started with a safety meeting explaining the agenda and operations for the day. Then, we would relieve the other crew shift, getting information on the operations and progress of the drilling rig. Then I and my crew would take over and begin the operations for our shift."
good,"Before the downturn, there was plenty of work to do.  It involved a lot of well information to position and update.  I learned about the onshore division strategy which was completely different from the offshore and international divisions I worked in.  Management was supportive and I appreciate Southwestern for giving me the opportunity to work there.  My co-workers were easy to work with.  So much cooperation and willingness to share their information to advance.  The hardest part was the amount of work to do before the downturn but the most enjoyable part was the effort to give assistance."
good,"I enjoyed working at Southwestern Energy. I had the pleasure of having 3 amazing bosses. The benefits were great, the hours were great and they worked with you if an issue came up."
good,This is an AWESOME company. It is not thriving due to the down turn in the gas industry. Laid back work environment and very family friendly. Insurance plans are great.
good,"Enjoyed my employment with Southwestern and the associated challenges with the position.  Great company to work for with excellent benefits.  The company promotes a healthy work/life balance that includes gym membership with daily workout classes, onsite clinic, onsite cafe with healthy offerings and convenient pick up for dry cleaners, shoe repair, etc."
good,"The job is ok just not enough pay & the hours started getting cut closer to the summer. This is a great environment and the workers are outstanding, but not always fair."
good,"I worked for them before as part of a 3rd party company, they were great then,  and when I found out they were looking for equipment operators I couldn't pass it up. It's a 14 on 14 off schedule, can easily balance work and life.  Great people that make going to work everyday fun. Recommend them to anyone!"
good,"General drilling duties on a super single."
good,"The day-to-day operations for the department with complex travel plans, training, org. charts, pay roll, expense reports, supply orders & routing mail"
good,"I worked 12.5 hours a day"
good,"Love my job and the people that I worked with. This job is fun bc everything changes on a daily basis, keeps things exciting."
good,SWN was my favorite opportunity.  I really enjoyed the culture and the people.  SWN also provided excellent benefits to its employees.  I acquired many degrees and certifications in my 10 years at SWN.  I had a great work life balance and personable supervisors.
good,Honest day's pay for an honest day's work.  Dirty but that is the industry.  Challenging yet rewarding.  Good experience and able to work with a great team.
good,I fully enjoyed my time at Southwestern Energy and was well supported by my peers and management. I wish SWN and its remaining employees the best in the future.
good,"Southwestern Energy's environment was warm and friendly.  A general day consisted of the review and processing of a variety of invoices ranging from completions, productions, drilling, inter-company, fleet etc.  For the most part, the work load was fairly easy.  My initial training took a little longer than expected; but once I got the hang of this I was up and running through invoices.  The most enjoyable part of Southwestern Energy was working under a supervisor whom believed in Jesus.  His beliefs were displayed in his spirit and easy-going personality.  The environment was goal driven and I truly enjoyed working for the company."
good,"SWN is an honorable organization caught in a horrible oil and gas economy. Despite what the investment world has said, SWN continues to be a GREAT employer and will be an industry leader again when commodities pricing recovers."
good,This is a excellent Company to rather be employed or do business with in the energy sector.  The only draw back is layoffs and employee retention.
good,Coordinate new hires. My colleagues are pleasent. The people were the most important. I learned to deal with all level of people.
good,"routine and organized work performing preventative maintenance."
good,"This particular job was a very good one, there was never a dull moment and everyone did their work. I would wake up every morning and go to work knowing that everything that we did, we did as a team. There are many jobs that may tell you that you are a team, but not every job makes you feel that way. SWN made us feel like we were all working TOGETHER and for the same goal, the managers were awesome especially Martin Petty and Chip Boudreaux they kept the energy going and also made sure the work was done."
good,"I have learned that just because you have a higher position than one person, you know have to look down on.  Different management levels were always inviting to other departments.  It wasn't closed off, but a much drama-less place to work"
