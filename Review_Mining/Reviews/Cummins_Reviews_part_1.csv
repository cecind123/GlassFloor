bad,"Very unstable work environment that doesn't work on individuals development and full of non-productivity and hypocrisy. Disguising as a diverse inclusive work place, but has nothing to do with what you'll actually experience. High turn over and lay-off rates. No flexibility or work-life balance."
bad,"Try not to depend on Cummins because they can fire anyone at anytime even if you did really well."
bad,the manger and staff sucks there is no room for growth its like a work place full of babies who get their feelings hurt and run to HR I am so glad to be moving o
bad,"Empresa en caos laboral  seguridad, alta de integridad"
bad,"I wouldn't work there for triple the enormous salary. I learned that money isn't worth your mental health. Management are bent from top to bottom, along with inept, ineffective and snake-like. Everybody was stitching up everybody else for no reward whatsoever. The hardest part was keeping quiet for so long, I should have resigned months before I did. I really enjoyed my last management level meeting, because it exposed the rife incompetency and blatent duplicity at the company. Thank God its over."
bad,"This place is very horrible I would never work in this  hole ever again the management is horrible "
bad,No need the job itself was a joke...training was as you go kind of thing...no order what so ever...work you 7 days a week or let go...even give turkey to bribe you to work holidays
bad,"Cummins would be ok to work if HR would take care of issues between workers. They allow ppl to be rude and very disrespectful without any actions.There was not alot of teamwork,and ppl where more worried about outside issues than getting their jobs done.There was alot of favoritism and you cant move up unless you had a family member or friend to speak for you no matter how hard you work."
bad,They expect you to live there with only giving you 2 days off a month. The HR dept is pitiful and never helpful. Overall its just a job and nothing else.
bad,HR department drags down the the workforce.  HR runs the company without regard to work that needs to be done so company can succeed.  They spend so much money on travel and entertainment for HR functions.  Wasteful.  HR Manager is rude and aloof.
bad,Very blue collar white trash environment that doesn’t care about their employees. Ppl are extremely lazy and only want to get by with doing the bare minimum. Management has no idea what’s going on nor do they care as long as work is done. I wouldn’t not recommend this company to anyone as young ppl are leaving this company all the time. It’s full of Indians and Asians who they under paybc they are on visas
bad,"I worked in a department with extremely poor leadership.  The training was awful.  There was not really any training.  Most of the team that I worked with thought that everything was a competition.  They completely forgot team building and teamwork."
bad,"never work here. management was terrible, not worth the headache."
bad,lack management and leadership skills. too many duties for one person to keep up. moral is nonexistent. hours worked per day changes weekly. no go to person for issues come up. no one wants to take responsibility nor step up and take charge.no raises.reporting insidents or near misses is nonexistent. unorganized and is in disarray. turnover rate is extremely high. safety is not top priority more worried about getting engines out that the safety of the employee. no advancement
bad,not a place to work very stressful and clicky need to kiss managers but to be liked.  would work there for two million dollors. Backward management needs new management.
bad,"The managers are real trouble in the middle east branch, looks like a family business where only management  favorites get away with anything. The HR is spineless and don't support the employees at all. Ethics is just a gimmick don't fall in this trap"
bad,"You might feel my review opposite of some of other experienced associates. "
bad,"HR takes forever to get anything done, always running out of materials. The supervisors all seem to be uneducated and don't train new employees effectively"
bad,The place is full of mean and nasty people. You will break your back for the place and in return they will dump you flat on your face. One guy donated an organ to another worker at Cummins and in return they stopped paying him 3 weeks before Christmas and the man had 3 little kids at home that didn't have a Christmas all because there courageous father wanted to save a life and Cummins wouldn't stand behind him and help. 22 billion dollars a year and they can't take care of one of there own.
bad,They have a high turnover rate do to poor management and lack of compassion for their employees. You never know how long you're going to have to stay.
bad,The two heads of the company are not in the business to help people with cummins products.  They are there to make as much money as they can and then retire.
bad,"After the factory acquired each distributor, the owners were fired and each distributor has a President that came out of the factory with no local knowledge of the customer base and incapable of leading a customer focused business."
bad,"Would not recommend to anyone. To much expected. Plus mandatory overtime at little notice.. Management does not respect the employees."
bad,It sucks. Will fire you if you have medical problems. Plus you can't have a life cause they want you there all the time. Sonif you have kids the better have a good other parent cause you won't be there
bad,Safety culture is high. Management is poor. Overworked daily. Unable to keep stable work for shop. Very short lunch period. Unpaid breaks. 14+ hour work days.
bad,"we needed better supervisors and better trained officers over seeing us.also needed better communication between staff and the workers "
bad,"Very unprofessional and unorganized company. The better you are at your job, the more workload is put on you while others who do nothing advance. If you are looking to be a part of a team where everyone does their fair share this is not the place to be."
bad,I stepped away from my last job to take care of a sick family member and found myself working at a job that i was over qualified for yet very under appreciated for my strong work ethic.
bad,"Very bad place to work at you will be breathing is so many bad things, the entire place is bad for your health and anything could fall on you at anytime, Run Away Fast!"
bad,The office jobs were moved to White Bear Lake Minnesota due to combining distributors.  Terrible organization of transferring information.  Team concept was not effective.
bad,Poor management and they only care about themselves. Don't ever think these people care about and your family because they don't. They will work like and dog and rise you like a horse. I worked there for 10 years and this company is going down. They play favorites so if you don't suck up you don't have a chance.
bad,It is a cut throat environment. They care more about production than the do the employee. Management only cares about the production numbers not the employee.
bad,The company as a while does not communicate well. I worked a day we were suppose to be off but no one told me we had the day off. The company called me yelling about working.
bad,"Company with divers technology foe Engine manufacturing, Power generation. good for learning. good culture. Good for treatment of each other at work.."
bad,Patron imbu de lui même et très feignant j'étais plongeur et me suis retrouvé en plus a travailler a sa place
bad,i worked at this company for a year and i never missed a day there at all. i know all my stations and know how to trouble shoot the machines and everything. i have been tring my best to work and become a permanet there and people who started way after me got a interview and became permanet. i wasted my time and effort to work for this company and they never deserved any of it. if u all looking to work here at cummins i wouldnt recommended it
bad,"Stay away from this place, they don't care about you or paying you for your hard work. Total waist of time. Good luck. Indeed will not allow x employees to write the truth about their experience."
bad,"This company use to be good but in the 80s it all changed and it is full of Cronyism and the good old boy's network.  If you take a job there watch your back, keep your resume up to day and look for your next move because you will not get it here."
bad,"I worked at Cummins for almost 2 years as an Analyst. Unlike most people, I had a really bad work life balance. I ended up working close to 70-80 hours a week and the senior leadership provided no help or even cared about employees work life balance.  They were not at all empathetic. Cummins is a company which will always boast about being ethical and diverse but they can do anything in the name of diversity. They don't treat ethical complaints seriously and will blame you for everything. They also hire college grads for senior roles so that they wont have to pay more to get the same work done and make employees life difficult. Cummins also goes through a layoff cycle every 2 years when they fire more than 2000 people which is a very stressful time for all the employees."
bad,"Management is horrible in this department and when things get tough they lay off their most valuable employees.  Best advice do not go work for this company if you want to make money or advance, no raises in two years and then laid off because they can't make a sale for their generators. And on top of it all the fraternization between married employees that nobody notices or turns their head at.  The favoritism is deplorable here.   This company went from a really good company with excellent benefits to a horrible company, with horrible management that has hour long meetings to tell you how bad you are at your job. Best advice stay clear of this place in Colorado."
bad,"Um ambiente com ótimas pessoas , onde você aprende a importância do trabalho e pessoas dispostas a ajudarem no que for preciso . sempre respeitando as formas de conduta da empresa"
bad,"Agilidade no dia dia"
bad,"Working for Cummins Bridegway in Harmarville was by far the worst career move that I have made to date and I have approximately thirty five years of experience in the industry. The senior management at that location lies and creates confusion among the employees. He's quick to point a finger, as long as he looks good, is all that matters."
bad,Management is very understanding with certain situations and alot of times they could be your enemies. Overall great place to work
bad,"There is very little interface between the customer and the developer. No one wants to talk about the product, they just want it to be made."
bad,"- Check all over admin building, canteen & housekeeping"
bad,"I hired in as a production worker on the main engine line in May of 2011. I worked from May to the end of August and only had 4 days off. Many of the work days were 12 hr shifts and you would never know if you had to work over until about 5 minutes before clocking out. I originally hired in to place the bearing caps and bolts on the underside of the engine blocks before sending them down the line for tooling. The guy that ran the test cell on my shift would come and pull a block off the line before it got to my station. In order to stop the line he would put a shop rag over the sensor to keep the line from sending another block. He would leave the shop rag on the sensor which would shut down the entire line. The lady that ran the CNC cells that fed the blocks to me was supposed to investigate why the line was stopped, she never would so I had to constantly walk over to her area and get the line running again. I later found out that the test cell person would do this on purpose because the lady on the CNC cells did not feel like working and he was interested in dating her so he would try and hep her out. When the line was down for other reasons and I had no blocks to run, I would clean my area. I often received praise and ""Extra Mile"" points from Supervision for showing the initiative to do these things on my own without being told. I would come in the next day after cleaning and organizing my area to find candy wrappers, plastic soda bottles and other food bags just thrown on the floor by the lady that worked my cell on 1st shift. I would clean it up and move on with my regular"
bad,"unfair management, hours upon hours of overtime and no time for a life and they do not care about the life you do have, wrote me up for going to a funeral for my family. all around horrible work place unless you like to smoke pot in the parking lot durring work."
bad,"Management are self center, selfish, only understand their interest."
bad,"Western Cummins Canada, there's been so many turn overs of employees name tags should be required."
bad,Contract was not extended after they realized I was pregnant.
bad,Nothing good to say here.They do not spend enough time training customer service employees.
bad,Management is horrific @ best
bad,Very bad over all company. Not worth the trouble.Nobody understands how to have a proper running business.
bad,Pros
bad,Horrible plant manager at North Memphis plant. All one race and very Ghetto. HR horrible and unprofessional and ignorant. Let the ignorant union reps run the plant.
bad,"They expect you to be a robot and if you don't sign up to overtime it is very frowned upon, they will string you along on a temp contract and work you into the ground. The management only care about produ tion numbers and not about the well being of their staff."
bad,Absolutely the poorest management team in the history of Fleetguard. 2 tier system creates a lower class citizen and a hostile work environment. Always errors in payroll.
bad,"I designed the Conrod's for the hedgehog range of engines and was treated worse than a 19th century pit poney. No one in the tech centre had a clue about design, bar one fantastic engineer who was fired from the project for refusing to authorise the rubbish the engineers came up with. Great company for well dressed, well spoken and we'll groomed engineers. Any failure is put on the back of contractors. A bunch of banana eating Muppets with as much knowledge about engine design as a gooney bird and even less knowledge of draughting."
bad,All they are concerned about is numbers and not the well being of the employees. Too much drama from a fortune 500 company.I would never send a friend
bad,"Worked for Cummins nearly 19 years and let go for “moonlighting”. I helped some people out on my own time. I live nearly 60 miles away from Cummins and I was dismissed for helping my farmer friends and neighbors out. I do farming on my own time and fired for helping friends out cause the company felt they could of made money on the tractors I worked on. When I defended myself it didn’t matter what I had to say. The union was no help because they said Cummins has fired employees for less in the past. Paid into the union all these years and got me nowhere when I needed them. I did a good job for them. Never did anything wrong came to work on time everyday and rarely called in sick. Didn’t count for amything! People from different states came and did an ethics investigation and could care less who I am. The management could care less how we were treated but I continued to work there because I invested most of my adult life working for them. At one time,before The corporation took over, it was a nice family place to work but once corporate took over everyone became just a number. Apparently working 50 plus hours a week and farming part time the company felt I had plenty of time to “moonlight”. If you are interested in working for a company that could care less about you and is only concerned about what you can do for them, them this is the place for you . If you want to be treated with respect and treated like you matter then don’t waste your time!!!"
bad,"Cummins is a great place to work but some people have been given the privilege of management and turn it to discrimination and racism, not willing others to be promoted."
bad,Lots of hours and management doesn't like for you to have time off. Managers do no know how to treat employees with respect. Managers are not helpful.
bad,Bad management and terrible time management skills all the senior employees are really set in there ways and unwilling to change and progress with the company
bad,They rush u on just about every job u do and dont slow down for u. The manager I had was not nice at all. They do stretch every day before u work. There is more meetings than work time
bad,you're constantly moving management is horrible they make u feel unappreciated never let u know they appreciate your hard work all they care about is work not the people
bad,The only thing that was enjoyable was the people I had the pleasure to work with. Management has gone down the gutter. Moral is at an all time low. The benefits are okay but honestly they could provide better health insurance.
bad,"Nice workplace and environment is also good. work culture is healthy and enjoyed a lot working in KPIT, have been working since february 2014 and found it good."
bad,"Double standards, favoritism, very little respect. This place is a pay check and nothing more. New positions are given on favoritism and not skills, experience or tenure. "
bad,I was a security guard there from January 1st 2012 to July 25th 2014 I found it to be steady work I also found it to have way to many call offs which lead to doing 16 hour days.
bad,"It is the only company looking for mechanics so often and so much,why mechanics don't last much in it?,Cummins is not what it used to be years ago,clients have their equipment down for years after they reported their problems,supervisors and managers are not able to be reached by customers,so good customers and contracts are lost,so be very careful before applying to this company,think it twice."
bad,If you are young and don't mind handling rude customers then this is the job for you. On the flip side they are really great at working with their employees schedules and making them feel as comfortable as possible
bad,"Be careful. They fired 2,000 last year and I have three close friends that have left the company in the last 30 days to flee the new upper and middle management.Executives scared to negotiate for business. Huge loss in sales drive and motivation."
bad,Very terrible office to work in. Huge favortism and very sloppy managers. Lots of turn over in this job as its a call center. You have to reach 50 calls every day and are hassled everyday on call quality. I dont recommend this job to anyone
bad,Not a good place for health in a work environment with welders ventilation wasn't adequate. Changing schedules in the manner of lack of hour consistency doesn't provide for a steady pay. Two days after i was hired they were already talking about lay offs.
bad,"Data retrieval, data analysis, problem solving, leading teams for process improvements. Good peer to peer relationships. Poor mentoring or management to employee relationships. Typical work week was 60 hours, but more hours frequently expected. Management not supportive of continuing education."
bad,Not worth the time and trouble! MORE headaches for what its worth
bad,"Very very poor, a very corrupt place to work. Too much favouritism shown. They keep who kiss up to them. Management look down on you. Wage structure is wrong. Would not recommend working there at all if you have any self value."
bad,"Poor work environment, Poor Management, Poorly , long work weeks with overtime and often without any notice which was mandatory, working all holidays."
bad,Company needs to focus on technicians strong points instead of their so called efficiency policies & workmanship policies. I've been a tech for over 30yrs & never have worked for a company with such policies & life work balance is practically nonexistent.
bad,Drama everywhere you turn.  They have a 200 page front and back rule book that you must adhere to.  To go along with that their number one policy is that you must tell on your coworkers and if you don't they will fire you.  They put people in team manager positions that can not handle the position and are people of a high drama nature that will knit pick on every tiny thing and will not cooperate with you.  They like to proclaim that they have work home life balance but when you're there 7 days a week for 10+ hours a day that is not a balance and they will have a fit if you take time off in conjunction with a weekend.  My team manager for an entire year repeatedly brought up the fact that I called one Saturday off because I didn't have a baby sitter for my kids.  Just one Saturday out of the almost every Saturday they made me work.  It then showed up in my review under several different categories and I got a lower raise as a result.  It stated that I refused to work overtime and yet the pay I earned that year was more than double my salary.  That's just a tiny example of how poorly they respect their employees and the drama to be surrounded by while there.
bad,"At the end of my summer internship, multiple figures in management at Cummins, Inc. gave me false hope that I would be invitied to continue with Cummins full-time. They primed me to expect a full-time offer letter that just never came. "
bad,"You will work 8 hours and more if you want. 19 days straight. Management is terrible. A couple of the supervisors are genuinely good people. The rest are all just trying to move up the ladder, no matter who they have to step on to get there. The rules change daily and the machines are poorly maintained. The union is good. I would not recommend this job to anyone that wants to make a career out of it."
bad,Many layers of middle management with conflicting objectives and guidance and little opportunities for technical career advancement. Layer after layer of corporate initiatives which are constantly changing. Highly political office environment with a corporate culture being shoved down your throat. Engineering design and decision making done purely by consensus with little faith in engineering judgement by actual engineers. They claim engineers have equal say or at least some stake in developing or improving products but in reality there are a few people in high positions pulling all the strings with middle management simply obeying whatever is told by their superiors to maintain their job security. Emphasis is more on how you look in front of management and the manner in which you show engineering content rather than the actual merit of the engineering content itself. Career advancement hinges on moving up the layers of management rather than developing solid technical content. Company constantly keeps you on your toes as to job security with everything based on how much schmoozing you do with management. I would not recommend joining Cummins if you are looking to exercise and grow your engineering skillset and having a keen interest in innovation. It is a union Company so plan on never touching a tool.
bad,This was a terrible place to work. I got 4 days training from the guy I was replacing and thats it. The manager avoided the warehouse he was in charge of at all costs. And had no idea how any of the jobs functioned so I had to learn it all on my own.  I was thrown into the weeds with no direction at all. Then drowned and was reprimanded for being overwhelmed. Older employees are allowed to verbally abuse and threaten younger employees with no consequences. Very toxic work environment.
bad,Never work here. Pay is lacking. Management sucks. Supervisors are lazy and highly unskilled. HR is a nightmare. They hire thru a temp agency that packs junkies in the job like sardines.
bad,"Very discriminatory. Depends on who you are and whether supervisor like you. Definitely not a fair place to work."
bad,"HR thinks they can do whatever they want worst experience in my life! No one works as a team unless it's to push you out of the company then they all come together well. I should have contacted corporate, maybe I still will!"
bad,"Cummins has the worst management that I ever had the displeasure of working with.  When trying to leave the area with poor management, it is likely you will be blocked.  Employees are asked to do four jobs, due to reductions in force.  Always wondering when the next layoffs will be."
bad,"No one cares even the owner, Lots of Favouritism, Poorly Managed, No action will be taken against a bad behaviour staff, will not recommend any one to work for Cummins Western Canada, Edmonton, Don't know if other branches are same having bad behaviour staff."
bad,Worst job environment I've ever experienced. It's a union shop full of ghetto minded people. Cut throat co workers. I had to leave. Cutthroat coworkers and incompetent supervisors.
bad,"good environment ,work culture , enjoy working with team,good management team ,feel comfort under work pressure and lovely people working collaboratively in development team as well as architecture team .They treat all employees equally  and open door policy betwen management and employees"
bad,"The Hardest part of the job was the lack of support form your other employer. While your working other sit down socializing and stay on the phone all day. The manager do not comply because seniority is first. A work of two people was for one person. If a costumer came in would have to attend, plus shipping and receiving, plus Inventory control and in taking orders."
bad,"Company is poorly managed.  Every two years you can expect a significant layoff of salary exempt employees, followed by a hiring of recent college graduates.  This is, of course, to minimize operating cost.  Well managed companies have learned that operating in this fashion hurts not only the people being let go, but also the product."
bad,"I am letting the good people know,this company ,fired all of the people over 50-65 .Reason efficiency was below 85%.The company let these men work for them some over 25 years and some trained the leaders that are in place. That did not mean anything to the company.Insurance cost and the almighty pennies are all the company worries about."
bad,Engine testing and analysis. The company has a lot of imbalanvce where some people are loaded with work and some have no work at all
bad,"I learn in cummins company how can do work in industries, safety, behavior, discipline ,creative ,motivated etc."
bad,"Never saw anything like this. Two weeks 1st, two weeks 2nd. ,two weeks 3rd. Every other weekend. You must go back to school!! Good thing is you do not need a home you can sleep in your car in the parking lot!!"
bad,"I say ""seagull"" style because once a year the executives fly into town, dump on the branch, then leave.  If you are promoted into a management role you have 2 years before you will be terminated, historical data backs up this claim.  Executives take no time to learn the people or challenges of territories, they just expect immediate and total compliance.  No support is given to help managers succeed, you are set up to fail, then made an example of once you do fail.  It seems their philosophy is to hire someone new and hope they do a better job rather than invest time in helping managers succeed.  Most service managers have little to no management experience which makes for a miserable place to turn wrenches.  Poor planning, poor execution, and inefficient flow creates excessive overtime and lost weekends.  This was a miserable place to work and I don't recommend anyone apply here.  In my tenure there every branch manager in the company was fired or ""quit."""
bad,Busy hectic.... poor management. but shared good relations with co workers.
bad,"cummins de los andes es una organisaci ordenada y con profesionalismo necesario para cubrir todas las necesidades de sus clientes capas de resolber cualquier situacion que se le presente en sus ambientes de servicios gracias a que su personal es muy bien seleccionado.trabajar en esta compañia fue una esperiencia muy buena ya que logre profesionalisarme mas eso se debe a que el personal es compañerista y le brinda la oportinidad de trabajar en equipo y brindarle la opornidad de hacer las cosas,tambien toca tener en cuneta que cummis cuenta con la academia de tecnicos en donde sus tecnicos se preparan para cubrir las necesidades de los clientes y un mejor servicio."
bad,"Everyday is a Monday. No day is the same. Scheduling is erratic and Delivery is unpredictable. No support from Management. Hero today, Zero tomorrow. Lots of tension and hostility felt by hourly to salary. Management will work hourly employees everyday if possible with little notice. I daily look for a new job. Wish me luck."
bad,"Management bullies people and makes you feel unworthy  "
bad,"Clique city!  Also, fantastic place to work if you are female or a minority.  They are well known for promoting both even if those people have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA what they are doing.  It is to meet quota and make the company look good, they have no care in the world how much it makes their customers suffer and THAT is a shame because they have a superior product."
bad,They hire through a temp agency.  We did get over-time but the structure of the job was very uncertain.  Somedays we were sent home because they were out of work for us to do.  This is very hard when you have a family at home. I enjoyed the work itself and my coworkers.
bad,"Cummins as a whole is a good company. The Portland Service department is poorly run. They promote favoritism and ergonomics and are not always give a voice. If you do a good job they give you more responsibility but your salary will not relate to the added duties. The market in the area for my position is a lot higher, even thru the temporary agencies."
bad,"I worked at Cummins for 10 months on a contract. My contract was extended 3 times, with promise of job security and future hire very likely. I was placed on two different teams at the same time, working both roles. I was never written up nor was I repremanded for anything. But yet I received an email at 6:15 on a Friday night that my contract was terminated. I wasn't given any reason as to why. They do good employees like this all the time."
bad,"Room for improvement from the management "
bad,"A 7 day 8 hour work flows with no days off is a bit much, but what makes it even more hectic is working 12hrs and having to deal with the same non-sense a few hours more, with line Techs who are playing a role as Mgr. But don't actually know how to lead, or speak to employees with common respect due to the postion they hold and suppose to be setting examples of how to maintain their character ""Professionally"" Machines would go down all the time, and 5s... You can only do but so much when you keep cleaning the same thing over and over. "
bad,"I was one of many interns from Nash Community. When I interviewed for the internship I was told by basically the heads of every department that we as interns would be working in different areas of the plant for a short time, then moved to a different location. The Idea being to get a full view of the plants operations, network with the management, find our strengths and weaknesses, and ultimately get our foot in the door to work there as full time employees. Long story short, That didn't happen, we were stuck into various sections of the plant that had absolutely nothing to do with our schooling, and forgotten about. On numerous occasions to all of the interviewers, HR personnel, and our individual management we brought up the promises of the Internship, and constantly got the answer of, ""we'll look into it"". I later found out that my immediate supervisor was lying to upper management In order to retain me in his section. Which I actually can kind of understand, as the mental capacity of the average person there was sub par at best, and I could handle the responsibilities of my job and operate equipment most people cannot.  But it doesn't bode well when you are trying to convince an intern to stay with a company to constantly lie to them, lie about them,and refuse to keep very basic promises that got them to want to work there in the first place."
bad,"i was hired as a parts wicket person but was not giving any proper training "
bad,"Racial discrimination & retaliation are really visible in each corner of the branch in the middle east. all this talk about ethics is not used at the right moments.what a waste !"
bad,"Cummins has a 100% with HRC but actual practice was poor.  I am Transgender with 29 years experience and was let go by my manager of 3 years experience who was vocally conservative, and with who I asked assistance with a management issue."
bad,Company has a good concept but poorly managed. You want a position here then get with the in crowd ASAP. The more you lie about your work history you will be CEO of the place one day.
bad,"Director and higher management have no knowledge of the job they have been assigned. Poor management, no job security, bureaucracy, no career advancement. Company does not have any ethics or morals."
bad,"seus gestores não sabem avaliar os colaboradores.... dão prioridade aos amigos e não aos profissionais, empresa com excesso de horas extras."
bad,A large company with limited intelligence in strategic planning.  Poor management that verbalizes respect and value of employees but yet had some of the worst management practices ever seen.
bad,"The culture at the Customer Assistance Centre was cut throat and if you weren't one of the favourites of the manager you were garbage.  There was gossip, backstabbing, and public humiliation there on a daily basis.  The only good part of the experience was the benefit package."
bad,If you have an MBA and are Mormon you will excel.  Otherwise you will not go far in this company.  Since the takeover this company is poorly ran from the president to HR.
bad,"the employer of the company is direct sale agent , and the total staff was off role no future gurnattee .co-worker is good , and learn how to manage the accounts and documentaions,how to take work with the team"
bad,"phones, phones, phones, customers always unhappy. I learned that they were not open to new ideas to resolve some work/production issues. Management was very unfriendly, therefore, co-workers were always disgruntled. The hardest part of the job was that management was not open to changes, I felt that would benefit and alleviate the workload. The best part of the job would be the new life time friends I have met and still keep in contact with on a regular basis."
bad,"Cummins Southern Plains does not promote based on knowledge or skills, promotions and advancement opportunities are only offered to those that are buddy buddy with  Management and if you are female its even harder. The vacation time and sick time were amazing until the entire program got revamped a year or so ago. Since the benefits changed there is nothing positive about working here other than the great Customers you get to work with."
bad,"I worked for this company for nearly 9 years and it changed dramatically in the last 3/4 years, the management changed and it became a place where if your not best buddies with managers / supervisors your nothing and get spoken to like rubbish."
bad,i will do my job to the best of my ability.and i have went through training classes to help me be a better leader.i am a peoples persons but i like to get the job done.
bad,Bad management in a lot of areas. Certain people could break the rules and others were punished if they did. A lot of floor workers treated like dogs.
bad,Horrible unprofessional gossip in management favoritism forced interaction with Transexual males wanting to be adressed as women fighting security will make you late for no reason even though they see you everyday
bad,"Constant threats from a management and lectures on safety, and proficiency on completion of tasks yet having to utilize all safety and proceures literally makes the allowed time impossible!"
bad,"For 2 years was told when layoff comes no hourly employees would be layed off but then only hourly laid off including me."
bad,"This company started off as family oriented and was great however, after so many transfers of ownership from franchise to corporate it has gone dramatically downhill. "
bad,Most of my issues stemmed from the poor magament team at that location.   Had a few issue with HR as well. After quiting I heard HR manager was fired.
bad,"Positive:"
bad,"It is a manager`s company; very poor work ethics in product engineering team and typically no promotion at work."
bad,"Especially in R&D, the company has one the worst culture and the managers game ratings to favor few, which often leads to racial discrimination. This company is all talk and no substance."
bad,"The company as a whole is great, the problem is the management at the Miami lakes shop. the service supervisor is rude and condescending. she will make situations up so she can pick a fight with you. The lack of work is also a problem. the supervisor has no knowledge of the power gen business and she has no patience to be informed."
bad,"I worked in the ladson HR department. Poor training. No procedures.  Lack of communication, poor moral in overall office. Great company just needs a great leader to come in and organize processes."
bad,"Corporate Managers don't support their staff members at the local level.  Corporate HR team don't make clear decisions to help employees."
bad,"You can definitely make good money here but at the expense of not having a life outside of work. Management is poor almost like criminals, they will lie to you, treat you less than human and don't care that you're forced to work the weekends while they get to go home to their families. This isn't the place I was lead to believe when they told me in orientation that they believe in a good job/life balance... A lot of us have worked 7days for the last year without 1day off except when we use our vacation."
bad,"Real feedback are not welcome from upper management. They lack the will to imbibe ethical behavior and action, only talks no reality."
bad,If you aren't a union employee other employees see that you fail. A mistake made by a temporary employee is magnified compared to that of a union worker. If an employee doesn't gossip about other employees he/she is seen as an outsider and is plotted against.
bad,"There never was a job at the end of the placement. week 2 gave this away, they were interviewing school-leavers for work experience, in a months time."
bad,"This company talks modern management and high level techniques but is contaminated by internal politics, poor management and prima donnas. Most that fit in here have worked with the company for many years and demonstrate little experience or are open to new and fresh ideas from outside their four walls."
bad,"Management show favoritism and some follow protocol, managers feel as well as COT (higher management) feel they can treat people any kind of way especially when you have a voice of fairness. They are a big fan of diversity which is awesome but they dont hold the foreigners accountable to when they treat people on shop floor as if they where still in there country. Safety is never an issue until something happens."
bad,"- answer repetitive email requests"
bad,"nivel de trabajo intenso"
bad,"In the last couple years management has ruined JEP."
bad,"Pro: Pays well, flexible work schedule"
bad,"Workplace could be a little better, pay is not fairly rated. Managers don't manage, they micromanage. Benefits and vacation packages are ok. Real big on diversity."
bad,"Company management did a poor job representing their product in their territory and seeking business from existing and future customers."
bad,"A typical day at cummins is stressful."
bad,liked working with alot of the people but the hours could not stay on a normal pattern due to uper managment and some of the work envierment was very unsafe
bad,"I was lied to about my top out pay and also you get extra pay for ASE certs which they lied about how much they were worth also.  I brought it up to upper management and got yelled at for 5 mins, got hung up on and also threatened.  They didnt have a vehicle for me to drive so I had to drive my own vehicle for a week until I quit.  Not a good place."
bad,"First go in and no one knows what job to go on .Can""t find foreman and when you do he does not know. Some people get to choose what job. Will send you to class after product has been out for over a year. Management are people who have never worked in field before. And does not know how product works. Co- works are good people for the most part , but do not want to work. The hardest part of job is getting parts and management wanting to know it will done. The Job is easy and you only have to work  8 hours a day.. You can work overtime if the union will let you."
bad,Once you climb higher than local branch employees it becomes very difficult to receive any honest answers or feedback in general. Upper leadership and management have no respect for local front end employees. HR runs the company and has been given too much power over simple business decisions. It is extremely difficult to work for this company especially as a woman.
bad,"Les salariés sont exécrables avec les intérimaires et font tout pour les mettre en échec"
bad,Not the best management. Some employees care very little about the job. Service writer ability to quote job times was very minimal. Work facility is dated.
bad,Wasn’t any fair supervisors that really understood some things that wasn’t really in the employees hands .  The managers wasn’t on same page when coming to dates that you may requested off before even hiring .
bad,"Constant lay-offs happening every few years.  If you are a salaried worker, go elsewhere...you will be out of a job no matter how well you perform...."
bad,"Cummins is a very liberal and good ol boy type of company.  That is quite the contrast since most of their customers are conservative and have a completely different viewpoint and belief system than Cummins.  Cummins seemed to be worried about everything, but what was most important and that was the customer."
bad,Unprofessional hiring and HR departments.
bad,I worked there for a month and they were  not organized & didn't have much for me to do.  I played Suduko every day. I felt like I was wasting my time & that is why I left.
bad,Very well organized safety department.  Union employees were very strong.   The safety training program was very well funded.
bad,"I was hired as an Outside Sales Specialist, but that was changed to a delivery driver outside sales after 6 months.  I could not get management to understand what they were doing to discourage customers.  Once you loose a customer it is very hard to get them back."
bad,The pay is okay once hired on. I do not like the fast paced work on the line I work on. I don't like that we are pressured to build fast by management and other employees.
bad,"The job sounded promising , I was sent by the agency with nothing but great praise, we have such a good working relationship with Cummins the young girl would repeat like a mantra. I will just say after 1 week shadowing someone who wasn't interested in teaching but hitting his targets, I was dumped on the line ,my job to run 3 machines, troubleshoot, change and fix machines with no more help. Working with welders i had to ensure they were kept busy at all times, for 10 hours a shift with a small break.This wasn't the worst part the shift supervisor was nothing short of a bully, he expected to hit unrealistic targets with a trainee with no training, He presumed because he had been doing the same repetitive job for over 19 years it was easy and anyone could do it. He was all tattoos and no brains ,a pathetic bully. I complained to the agency and Cummins who said they had a first class HR department but are acually non existent. The agency did not care and Cummins did not care, everyone of the 6 agency lads i started with quit before me, which I think was the objective, to belittle, and breakdown all agency staff. It is my advice that you put down your application and apply for something else you will be miserable and unhappy worked to death with no encouragement from any senior staff they just don't want to know. All Cummins care about is targets, the worst company i have ever had the displeasure to work for. The agency was Cordant people , it was staffed by children who look down their noses at you. . Again stay away they don't care about you, pathetic."
bad,Um local muito com pouca compreensão dos serviços prestados e pouca remuneração que nem chega a um salário mínimo
bad,"The human resource manager is racists. Shes also looking to fire anyone and everyone for reasoning as little as a warning. Shes never in office always ""traveling"" "
bad,"It was a Temp position, 6 month at most. Jobs was moving to India. Management would try to keep the workers from standing out, example i found a 7million dollar mistake yet i got no acknowledgement for it. But the managers sure did."
bad,"No time off"
bad,"If you like being physically threatened and management does zero about it, then you're good. A fellow employee threatened me and management refused to do anything about it."
bad,"I went through the phone screening process.   I was then moved to on-site interview.  The on-site interview was great.  The atmosphere seemed good.  I contacted the HR Recruiter several times following the interview to see what the status of my interview was.  I have not heard back from him.  "
bad,"This is no place for women.  Women are expected to preform the same duties, but not for the same recognition.  Supervisors are not fair in their evaluations."
bad,"Never worked at a place where employees were so unhappy! Company does not want to get their hands dirty, literally. They don't want to fix their engines...would rather just sell them. The shop is all about the reports about the reports about the reports and so on. The mechanics are not allowed to fix anything other than what the trucks came in for...they would be sent back to customer knowing it was going to be right back in shop again!! Cummings didn't care....BECAUSE their report looked good, they want  trucks in and out ASAP..would rather get it out of shop asap then fix it correctly."
bad,"Co-workers are great. Management leaves something to be desired. While the job itself would be easy and enjoyable, managers are so untrusting that you literally can't send an email without two or three people reviewing it prior to sending to ensure email is ""Cummins friendly"" Had a very hard time building a releationship with employees because my manager wanted us to keep everything strictly black and white. Sometimes in HR there is a grey area and you have to be able to show some sort of compassion. Managers come and go as they please but hold you accountable if you miss a day of work. Policy states to do certian things but managers don't follow policy if they feel policy is ""stupid"""
bad,Love the co-workers the Owner very generous with bonuses and free lunch. Hours was perfect and customers kind. VP of both branches was amazing! love !
bad,If you want an easy paycheck and to put in long hours it is a great place to work. Work balance and  management support is lacking. Work environment culture and also physical work conditions are difficult a majority of times. The promise of full time employment and the process from temp to perm changes as much as the business fluctuates.
bad,"Very fast paced. If you are accused of something, they dont need evidence they just fire you. Turn over rate is extremely high so you have to work twice as hard."
bad,"The leaders are focused on their own career advancement and focus al of their activities on reaching the next level, regardless of those of those hurt along the way."
bad,good place to work. Not a good place for a career. This place is all about who you know and not what you know or how well you can do your job. Performance is not really rewarded.
bad,Mostly just stressful trying to be in more than one building at a time. Not enough hours or too many hours. Breaks not properly done. More of just added stress.
bad,Hardly no days off!!! Couldn’t see family... all they care about us producing engines. Not the employee. Will try to fire you over anything. Worst job ever. Over 80 hrs a week.
bad,"Management has no idea what they are doing. HR is doesnt know what they are doing, half the time cant correctly pay you. Work 19 days straight then get 2 days off and do it all again. A lot of drama because there is a union. One of the best paying jobs around for the work though."
bad,"I was disappointed from day one.I was hired for one shift ,started at another shift . Management changed on a regular base. Tell you something one day tell you different the next day ."
bad,"the hours are long, and mandatory. management is a joke. everyone is constantly worried about being fired over nothing because this is and AT RISK EMPLOYER. the healthcare isn't worth it. there's never enough man power during the ramp ups. Most likely have to try and be a temporary worker before getting hired on full time. Most positions are hired from within, by people who have no business attempting to find the right person for a job so it most likely will go to the friend of whoever is doing the hiring."
bad,Blueprints are only right about 40% of the time makes it hard to build confidently not enough working with engineers to fix problems bad management working 56 hours a week for 2 years straight main problem is prints are not right most of the time so u have to deal with a lot of headaches
bad,"I was a inmate at the cummins unit working 7 days a week for no money what so ever and not only that i was a hard worker i was easy to work with although i was an  inmate i did what ever"
bad,"Too many frustrations."
bad,"I have nothing to say about Cummins of Fairmont Sorry but that is where I would like to keep it. It was a nice place and a learning eon xperience. Don't feel like I should have to submit my opinion on this."
bad,"Stay away, by far the worst career move that I have ever made. You're not even a number, the employees aren't treated with respect,especially at the Pittsburgh branch."
bad,There is a noticeable absence of focus on corporate directives
bad,Management didn’t care about certain employees. Line technician picked friendships over work and  when brought to management about treated unfairly nothing happened. It’s like you’re working for people who look and talk down on you.
bad,"Racist organization in the south.  Do your research . . . . many lawsuits have been filed against this company and they have lost almost all of them in regards to race and gender bias.  This may be a good company in the Northern parts of the US, but in Atlanta, they are a nightmare."
bad,"Work life balance none existent, supervisors and management no skills in managing people, more like a prison sentence for 8 to 12 hours a day. Horrible place to work."
bad,"Depends on your location and whos your boss. HR is a joke. Work life balance is jacked up. 12-14 hour days 6-7 days a week. My very obese, lazy, boss had the nerve to say I need to dedicate more time to cummins. Saftey is ridiculous! 20 minutes of paper work to do a 5 minute job."
bad,They will tell you your doing a great job while they are training your replacement. They are downsizing and getting rid of temps on a mass scale. Other then that good place
bad,"The work is fun and always keeps you moving. Great place for anyone mechanically inclined and loves to see something they had a part in driving America. 401k is nice, insurance is worthless. Very high-school-like environment though. Lots of politics and very cliquey. If you don't like drama and just want to work, don't apply."
bad,"work place culture is casual attire , on Friday you may wearing sneakers,  jeans and shirt if you so desire.. while  t-shirt should not  have any other  logo. but company"
bad,"Co workers for the most part great, management poor. Let go without warning just a reduction in the workforce and was oldest person and with the most seniority,don't waste your time. You are just a number and they don't care"
bad,"My day starts at 8:30 in the morning when the whole dept gathers for the daily morning meeting. Then we discuss all the pending issues & start working. We have lunch at 12:30 & my shift ends at 5 in the evening, though most of the days I leave at 6:30-6:45. The best part of Cummins is that here being a female mechanical engineer is totally normal, & we never face any kind of difficulty for that.The hardest part of the job is Iam 2020km away from home."
bad,"Great hours in theory but its expected that you work over every day"
bad,"ok."
bad,"Management is a joke, union representation is absent but you’re forced to pay for it anyways. No one seems to do things that make any sense. Dreadful even getting out of bed to go there"
bad,"Lots of inexperienced children that live with their parents so they’ll accept 17 an hour and work lots of overtime. Maybe one or two competent welders, the rest are fresh out of school and can’t actually weld. Lack of supervision but certain individuals want to play boss. Only work for Cummins if you’re something else, like a diesel mechanic. Endless overtime system abused by everyone, so you can afford to work there and pay bills."
bad,HR is terrible no employee advocacy. People are treated like part of the machinery. Long hours and very little consideration for family life when things are busy. HR is completely inept. Culture promotes poor environment right environment policies do exactly the opposite of intent and create low morale.
bad,A terrible place to work. A lot of back stabbing. Departments work against each other instead of working for a common goal. Upper management would talk down to you in a demeaning manner. The salary is way below industry standards.  Don’t waste your time and career with this company
bad,"Typical day would be to come in rarely anyone acknowledges you,. set up the computer, get coffee and then data entry. People do not speak in the office. Its often refered to as the ""morgue"" "
bad,Cummins Business Services in Stockton is not a great place to work at all.  They do not welcome outsiders.  The managers are not professional and the team I worked in the manager should not have been a manager.  I was alienated and the ring leader was the manager.
bad,"for a diesel mechanic in colorado its pretty hard to make it unless you work 50+ hours a week. For a company who's company goal tree puts employee satisfaction directly under safety they do not follow through. Advancement is a joke if you wish to stay as a technician, advancement from within is an idea from the past instead they choose to hire new techs with previous experience. The working hours are dependent on how much the company can make with no expense to the workers satisfaction or personal lives. Again it  is worth it to bring up the hours vs. wages. For diesel/generator mechanics they are far below the national average starting at $20 or less per hour. they follow the cost of labor method to choose wages which works well in small towns, but can ruin anyone wishing to move to a city. raises amount to 2-3% annually which do not keep up with the cost living. over all could possibly be a good place to work in a small town, but would not recommend for anyone looking to move into a city unless they choose to work an extreme amount of hours for little compensation"
bad,"Empresa que não valoriza novas propostas."
bad,"its a great organization for people who want to have average life.  are able to say yes to managers and do not want to take risks in life."
bad,"The worse place to work for an engineer. They have a turn-over rate that is incredible but will not face the fact that the culture is the reason. Experienced engineers are left without direction from their manager and the pseudo leader kills their career. A person on the same level should never be allowed to determine another persons career."
bad,Horrible place to work 3 1/2 years of empty promises by management. Organized chaos is putting things lightly.  If you don't work and knowledgeable and free spirit then you will be put into management right away!
bad,"very poor management at all levels"
bad,A former product company infected with Harvard MBA's knowing nothing about products or customers that is in decline.  It's hard to see any initiative that can reverse this with the entrenched management.

bad,"They laid me off and moved my job to Mexico, not exactly happy"
bad,Having to be at work from 4 am to 4pm sometimes 5pm. So by the time you get off you have to go right back to bed. No time with family.You will learn that the higher ups do not care what there employees think. You learn alot about there job even tho they dont send you to school or training. The co workers are great best guys to work with very helpful. The hardest part is when the mananger takes a small mistake and makes it into a big deal and then threatens to fire you. Most enjoyable part is when everyone of the managmnet is on vacation not always looking over your shoulder.
bad,"Management only interested in keeping employees ""UNDER their thumb."
bad,There is not good balance between life and work. Though you are exposed to a lot of technical education.
bad,The management was a joke. Never took your side EVER. Honestly got you nothing. The branch manager promised me a raise once I was certified but he backed out on that agreement as soon as I was certified. I have no respect for that man at all.the other employees are awesome. I miss them but not the company at all
bad,"Its only been recently but there have been lots of redundancies and uncertainty of the future . Causing an increased work loads and extra stress ."
bad,"After working there 5 months, was dismissed when a new policy came into fold to have no rings/jewelry. Been married 27 years. Veteran. Wedding band literally could not come off. But they also had policy to wear gloves as well. Gloves on there’s be no issue with band. Superiors lie and mislead constantly. Management CLUELESS about line production and production numbers. Just want MORE and faster. Quality being affected ..."
bad,The company is good to work for and the product they provide is great. The problem is they are too big to know what goes on in each branch. Branch management continuously lies to you. They worry more about their numbers than the happiness of the employees. They preach they want quality work but they continue to tell you to do shotty work. They have more reasons to fire everyone than they do to keep them. It is sad to see such a great team with great potential go to waste due to poor leadership. There is no opportunity for overtime which can make it difficult to make ends meet. There is tons of favoritism. If I knew then what I know now I never would have taken this job.
bad,"Easy jobs, climate controlled, worst management I've ever seen in my life. A company union that will sometimes help with job security but that's about it. You have no idea of weekend overtime mandatory schedule until friday afternoon. Did I mention terrible management?? "
bad,"I worked in the Business Services division. It was a mixed experience. Many of the senior managers need to be retired. Leadership has little knowledge of the harassment and vicious behaviour in this division, though the results are frequent blowouts and discovery of mismanagement and misuse."
bad,"e Cummins Ladson Branch was the worst experience of my career and a downfall fall for HR Professionals. There is no growth and development skills. I was hired for one job and they paid me to do another when I confronted the situations they blamed me. They were disorganized and did not set my position up for Success. Lack of training, Cliques, lots most important not a place for someone who has HR experience.  The individuals in the position had no previous HR experience so your practices that you have will not work because they dont have the experience this is for a person straight of school. Lots of Micromanaging."
bad,This facility has poor upper management and a unhappy workforce.  The employees are over worked and underpaid. Dont think about taking any time off while working here.
bad,"Nepotism was running rampant when I was there.  Just about anyone who was anyone important in that company was related to someone either by blood or by marriage.  If you weren't related, you can forget about any type of advancement."
bad,Cummins Recon is a nice paying job with good benefits. The management skills of the group leaders are very poor.The group leaders have no knowledge of turbos that are supposed to be produced by the company. The group leaders often let employees run  the floor which caused a hostile work environment frequently for other employees on a daily basis.
bad,"team work in that environment is garbage.lazy workers get put on easiest jobs ,the more you are capible of the more they make you do.management is afraid of making people accountable,hr runs the place the people have very few rights"
bad,"No decorrer dos anos os benefícios tem sido cortados.  O bônus nunca chega a 1 salário.  Muitas pessoas tem pedido demissão e há 4 anos a empresa tem tido sucessivos cortes por estar com uma estrutura de liderança pesada e cara. Totalmente dependente de 2 grandes clientes que correspondem cerca de 78% do faturamento da empresa, o que a torna vulnerável."
bad,Night shift bad work quality. They tell you one thing and change there mind the next and you have to start over. Tell you that you are working 40 hrs and come Thursday they tell you that you have to work Friday and Saturday. If you don't show up you get a ding on your record
bad,"I have worked for Cummins Onan of Elkhart for many years now. I can tell you that there is nothing good to really say about this facility. You can come in drunk or high or just be lazy and they will promote you. Work hard and you will be treated poorly. An RV factory like Thor, Forest River, or Jayco will treat you a lot better than here. The leadership team and management are a joke. We can't get good employees to stay because of the way they are treated. The pay is decent and the benefits as well but honestly it's not worth it. If you dead set on working for Cummins, then I would recommend any of the other facilities."
bad,Our life got changed in a instance I hate Cummins for what they did/moved all jobs to mexico Terrible place to work for it sucked
bad,"Typical day at Cummins is very flexible and slow. "
bad,"The up kept of the building assign to just two individuals and one is me. I were responsible for the north side of the building and the mail room. My department were dispense around to 3 different managers within three years. The last consisting of a young man in his early 20's from Arkansas with no experience in the Maintenance Department. He were original hired as the Purchaser of the company. The hardest part of my job were having to deal with someone whom immediately took a dislike for you and readily admitted to you. My constant battle with him in getting me some help especially when the other custodian person was absent for a week and you had to clean the whole building that housed over 350 employees. I could understand why I couldn't get help when the other person was out. But told when I were out the other received help when I were absent."
bad,"This business makes a great product, but, does not value its employees. They have great diversity programs and the appearance of a good culture, however, they don't promote well or pay well. This is a great company for young employees stating out, however, the culture in the organization does not allow employees to have a successful ""long term"" career. Internal politics in the company drives back sliding and creates a poor work environment for floor personnel. On the surface Cummins looks good, however, once inside you realize you need to look for something better."
bad,i learn the basic things required for designing and  building a prototype and i feel it is very exiting experience while doing this.
bad,"Columbus IN. headquarters is a completely different in so many ways.  Rocky Mount is dirty, disorganized and poorly managed.  In Columbus during orientation I believed I was joining a first class operation.  Unfortunately when I joined the Rocky Mount operation it was a totally different atmosphere.  Between the good ol boys who have been in power for a long time and the non- recognized union which has ""underground"" connections giving it a lot more power than should be allowed this operation is corrupt.  Quality is poorly maintained where often machines that are not capable continue to run out of spec. parts.  Safety is not strictly enforced resulting in some serious ""accidents"" recently.  In my opinion this operation is on it's way out--it's just a matter of time."
bad,"The people I worked with were, for the most part, pretty good. Like any workplace there was the usual politics & backstabbing but overall not too bad. Our so called manager never did anything to promote team spirit and actively sought to drive wedges between departments. His lack of leadership & even competence was on display every day."
bad,Involved in meetings throughout the day .
bad,Cummins Northwest was driven by two well educated gentlemen who both retired. They were replaced by two guys that have no management experience at all and the Owner of the company did very little to gain my respect over the years. My employees in Alaska were great and are the reason why I stayed with the company as long as I did.
bad,Most people are ok. Just do your job. There always at least 40 hours available and can usually work as much as you want. Room for advancement is there also
bad,"Good Company, would like to see more from the leaders. More interaction with how they promote a work life balance atmosphere.Leaders could promote more from within the organization."
bad,"This job takes up your entire like no time for anything no days off , having one day off a moth they do pay well but it’s not worth not being able to be with your family"
bad,Cummins corporate has some great people management ideas. Unfortunately these goals and values arn’t communicated down the management structure of the local branches.
bad,"This statement is in reference to the facilities in Indiana, Cummins is a large organization and I do not know how they are run in other states.  "
bad,"Plagued by horrible management. The amount of turnover here is staggering, assembly floor has what I'd estimate to be a 30 to 40 percent turnover. The operations manager spends more time advancing his personal ambitions and railroading people than running the business. If you're not with the ""in crowd"" or part of ""the club"" you are going to have a tough time. A lot of smart, talented people that cared were fired or quit because they didn't fit the mold. On a positive note, it is a day job, pay is ok and health insurance and 401k are top notch. If you are thick skinned and can put up with a lot, it would make a good ""inbetweener"" until you can find something better. Not the kind of place you're going to stay at."
bad,"Horrible manager at Houston Recon Plant. Laid back management style and show off of how smart he is every single day. Not willing to hear any different voices and always love to strike team down. Extremely selfish and materialized. Very surprise Cummins, as 100 years old company, doesn't even have a good management review system. This person is working for that role for about 5 years and cause more than 14 people left the team."
bad,"This is an okay place to work, I work on engines and diagnose in the field. Provide excellent customer service. It has been said in shop tension feels very negative and could be cute with a knife"
bad,"Typical day for my position started 6:30-7:00am. Ended at 5:00pm. Management was always arguing with themselves. Management never listened to employee suggestions. Pay and benefits were above average for the industry, especially the medical insurance. A very high stress job in the parts department. Not much of a chance to move up in the company, raises are very little, and only happen once a year. Bonuses only happen once a year, and unless you're in management, it's not a lot."
bad,"Manage by fear is the culture in Western Canada. Senior leadership and managers talk negatively about each other as well as their staff; extremely low morale. Staff are always on edge regarding their job so finger pointing is the norm. "
bad,"5 out of the 6 years I worked there at Cummins Engine Plant it was 7 days a week 8- 12 hour shifts. job work/life balance there was none. Great Benefits such as 401k, health and Dental insurance, Discounts and vision. They hold company get together's from time to time. They pay pretty well... your first 40 is straight time, after is time and a half and anything after 60 hour is double time and you will hit that by Friday if you work on the manufacturing lines at CEP. Last I knew they were hiring people at $15.50 and hour so you can do the math."
bad,cummins likes to hire underqualified people. and train then but keep there pay low. the turn over is very high........................................................
bad,"For anyone outside of upper management, there was little to no compensation for achievements. High stress work environment with little reward. Compensation did not match workload."
bad,poor management. unwillingness to help you progress or advance. once you have become essential to your role and job and do well they wont help you advance or move up because its to much work to hire in someone to do as good of a job as you do now so its easier to hire in from outside for a position that would be a step up for a long term employee rather than promote from within.
bad,"a bunch of adults who harasses people, pick on you and make fun of you. they have their favorites so if you don't choose to indulge your likely the odd ball ad will be singled out."
bad,Need more people staffed there. it felt so understaffed like we were being over worked. The pay wasnt the greatest. For all that we did it could have been more.
bad,"There is little to love about being a production level employee at Cummins. You can say goodbye to any sort of work/life balance. You will either work 70-80 hours per week or be forced down to 4 days per week. This may happen on consecutive months. Your management is transient and poorly trained, the work is dirty and strenuous. The ""union"" seems to be a company shill that buries grievances and helps to keep employees paid less than industry standards. Expect to use your vacation to cover unplanned shutdown days or weeks."
bad,"Cummins sales and service Calgary Alberta"
bad,"Strategies are implemented with little or no plan, which creates chaos and need to back peddle."
bad,"It was a great experience to work in this organization.in this way i learnt so many things ,faced so many problems ,evary day having work it was a good experience"
bad,"Culture is confused, greedy, political. People who can converse well, and show off will do well. People who can deliver without making noise will not shine."
bad,Hardest part of job was to deal with cunning management and lack of ethical behaviour from management.They lack skills of treating good employees fairly
bad,You can excel in this organization if you just work 8-5 and don't use your brain for anything. You cannot come up with ideas or difference of opinion even its better for the organization.
bad,"I've been a service wrier for ten years and I brought customers and new management did not care. The HR department is a joke..."
bad,"Overall, it's a good place to work for if you aren't looking for a promotion in your career. The managers could do better in holding their CSRs accountable for placing a purchase order number on the invoices, as well as making sure that they are mailed in a timely manner. And more focus should be dedicated to the employees that work hard and show up everyday to get the job done. The salaries are low, and the raises are even .smaller. The people are nice to work with sometimes. That's all I have to say."
bad,"work with Cummins engines, got a lot of engine specific schooling, and certifications. Outgoing manager was helpful, incoming manager was not at all helpful. coworkers were willing to help with any and all questions or if could not answer would help you find the answer. hardest part, working on otr trucks. most enjoyable working o equipment engines."
bad,"Very disorganized upper Management micro manages ALL the subordinates. There is no job security thru out the company constantly people are quitting or being fired for made up or no cause."
bad,Empresa ficada somente no lucro
bad,"Lots of supervisor confusion. Not enough pay,employes back stab. Union ripping off employees."
bad,Nice company specially for female candidates.
bad,"Ruined my social life, blocked me from Overtime. My vehicle was damaged on their property with zero assistance and/or compensation."
bad,"Every 3 years is the same story, there's a down turn coming and we need to let people go.  Its very stressful never knowing if your being investigated for time fraud or some other BS reason."
bad,I had to leave my job due to not having childcare 6-7 days a week 10 hours a day. Keep in mind Cummins- your workers have families. I missed out on too much.
bad,"What I enjoyed was that there was a balance between tactical and strategic work.  No two days were the same.  Initially, I learned a great deal about how manufacturing should work and is managed.  I've had great managers and I've had those that are unpredictable, micro managers, played politics, and had favorite team members.  I've also had great managers that provided coaching instead of dictating, were respectful even when you disagreed, that really cared about one's work life balance, and earned employees' respect.  The workplace culture has gone from exciting, challenging, and fun, to ""watch your back"", unreliable, and untrustworthy.  The hardest part of the job is dealing with the change I mentioned above. There is constant job insecurity because there isn't a logical process to who stays and who will be laid off. The most enjoyable part was when I was part of a cohesive team working to solve difficult issues with a collaborative, data based approach and not be continuously worrying about job security.. I also enjoyed mentoring younger engineers about manufacturing."
bad,"there is no growth opportunity for worker level employee they say you are diploma holder and you are junior manager, so there is no scope for your promotion even though your capable to handle higher-end tasks."
bad,Cummins at RMEP is a plant of Cummins in North Carolina and doesn't represent the Cummins culture that exists in other parts of Cummins (or so I've been told). My whole experience at Cummins has been with RMEP and it has not been a good one. It's a place with a lot of technology and a good source of technical learning but it is a toxic work environment/culture. Very political and has a culture of promoting people to positions they are not capable of and are not trained/prepared for. Terrible advancement opportunity. Poor work culture.
bad,"After many promises by management that our jobs were secure, Cummins informed us 3 weeks before the end of the year that our location was closing, and they offered no other positions in the company to any employees in the parts department. Offered a 4 week compensation and nothing else, lost all contributions to the pension plan also. Felt very betrayed by Cummins and the entire management team."
bad,"La capacidad de crecimiento va ligada a las personas con que te desenvuelves, no esta equilibrada la vida persona y laboral, las politicas de etica son muy buenas, sin embargo en mi caso cuando reporte las condiciones y horarios laborales tuve represalias."
bad,"Cummins is good experience and looks good on your resume early in your career, but they do not appreciate loyalty.   Once you hit 10 years you are on the chopping block for their frequent layoffs.  Does not matter where you are located, how good of a performer you are or your commitment/loyalty to the company.  You can never feel safe.  I enjoyed being able to travel internationally and I loved my job.  The same year executives approached me regarding a key leadership position (in which someone else locally in Columbus, IN was chosen) was the same year I was let go as part of the mass layoff.  I was high potential, multiple awards from the CEO, my work presented in international forums and rave reviews from my colleagues and subordinates.  My direct supervisor was very quiet and not a strong leader."
bad,Start times varied from day to day. I believe the pay is competitive but the management is poor to average at best. Last minute mandatory Saturdays were fairly normal
bad,"Cummins if fine to work at, they are just more of a big company than a shop. More things are dealt with in a big corporate way and individual success are not really monitored"
bad,"The union has no benefits other than great pay. Management doesn't do their job well and blames everything on the techs. You are required to write a story for that work you performed, but nobody reads it. Service manager came in and wanted to replace current techs with his own techs from previous shops. The other techs and parts people are great people. Will fire any office personnel that works well with employees. No communication between managers and other office staff. I enjoyed my time there, until the new service manager came and Cummins Inc took over."
bad,Managers game the annual ratings by ranking younger minorities lower.
bad,"The staff at the branch I worked at was wonderful however, management was very poor. Employees are forced to work overtime and threatened to work overtime or get written up. Poor moral in the overall office due to management. High stress."
bad,"I had about 20 years experience at Ford and General Electric before working at Cummins.  They really had an aversion to adopting outside ideas and relied far to heavily on six sigma.  Because there are very few other engineering opportunities in Columbus IN, they don't feel very compelled to make you happy once you've moved there.  Cummins offers visas and a significant Indian population works there.  These folks have even less little flexibility to work elsewhere.  Because they run the town (newspapers, etc.)  not a lot of complaints make it out into the public."
bad,"The company is stressful and not organized at all. The rules change on a daily basis. They continue to add responsibilities to technicians without allowing more time to do it. The company is more worried about money than its customers. They could care less about the quality of work that's being put out. Management is very hostile, cussing at technicians, etc."
bad,"Cummins is so laden with process controls that it is impossible to innovate.  The ""process"" is so burdensome (and often unnecessary) that many steps are not followed.  Failures are fixed by adding additional process steps.  "
bad,decent pay but management is hard to work with.  a lot of mandatory overtime and not much balance between life and work.  long hours and work almost every day
bad,"Back stabbing, unstable company, yearly lay offs...would not recommend anyone to apply here. Employee moral is not taken into account, management needs to do better at employee motivation."
bad,"visitas, alimentação de relatórios, aprendi toda a rotina em relação a grupos geradores e alguns pontos sobre manutenção e instalação destes equipamentos. A gerência era sempre ausente mas deixava todos bem a vontade para trazer novos negócios. Os colegas de trabalho eram sempre solícitos e dispostos a ajudar. A parte difícil foi começar a trabalhar com algo que nunca tinha trabalhado e aprender a rotina do mesmo. A parte agradável foi aprender sobre algo que não conhecia e ter o prazer de estar desenvolvendo o conhecimento sobre o mesmo."
bad,there is no ownership in the process of management. right now I work with three other tech. and we all have a different manager for our time off and pay. The mangers don't communicate with each other so all could possibly put in for the same day off and it would get approved.
bad,"typical day is fast paced since the product put-away people are dependent on me for their work."
bad,"NPower is a very successful company with a few very good key Managers at corporate that are responsible for its success, mostly the Principle and CFO."
bad,"I learnt alot like soldering,assembling,trouble detectection etc."
bad,"la empresa es individualista y con muy poca seguridad de proyeccion dentro de ella, se aprende mucho si ellos quieren mientras los jefes no se sientan en riesgos ya que si saben que tienes mas conocimiento o tienes una profesion mas alta que ellos te aplazan los cursos entre otras cosas para que no sigas escalando y eso es malo dentro de una empresa ya que si uno aprende mas aporta a la empresa en la cual trabaja."
bad,Work different stations.
bad,"It depends on the work we do overall, i work as a DS and DE spark developer, i would say that it totally has less significance in the long run. sometimes you hate the work environment"
bad,Rigid rules with no opportunity for your own judgement.  You are watched by other employees.     Better to be a contract employee rather than a direct hire. You will be treated better.  Nonunion office workers still punch clock which doesn’t make sense to me when you give freely of your time before and after scheduled shift. There’s no opportunity for advancement. Small company.
bad,"The department was slowly being relocated out of state (causing job loss) and all employees and management were negative, rude and mean all day, every day."
bad,"You can either get a very good manager at Cummins or you can end up with a very bad one. Retaliation for complaints will happen, and management will protect its own. If you see violations of ethics or law make sure to keep a copy of those violations offsite or else you will receive retaliation if you decided to report it. Pay can be very low comparatively, many positions are only posted to comply with H1B requirements after the job has been filled, discussion of wages is forbidden in violation of federal law, and contractors are sometimes subject to abuse and exclusion."
bad,"A great place to work if you like to be micromanaged, from a supervisor that has limited knowledge of what it is like to be a field service tech. If you are looking for a career in Washington State for this company. I would recommend Seattle,Olympia,Pasco or Spokane,were the supervisor stands up for there employees and have good working relationship with them. Washington has most all great personal, all of the techs will help out at any time and are fun to work with. Great pay and benefits. If that sounds like what you are looking for sign up."
bad,"job  sucks company does not supply material needed to do job, they say make do, they go cheap way out on everything.  One employee past out from heat company wouldnt pay medical bill or even ambulance"
bad,Horrible management.  A lot of long time employees just stand around and do not work and just socialize with the team lead of the department.  Pay was very good but benefits were not very good
bad,If the boss did not like you look out you always got the worse jobs. There was a lot of favoritism down there. One thing good about the job coworker were friendly and tried to help each other out.
bad,"Been working here for a few years now, I love the work that I do. But management is somewhat of a joke. The pay is way below average,and they don't like giving raises either. My co-workers were great to work with, but training is also something they lack in, as in they don't really train people. Benefits are horrible now, high deductible plans only. Not worth working there."
bad,High stress with the corresponding high employee turnover.  The company has scheduled layoffs every three years for exempt staff.
bad,The company is has very good work culture but tends to use a hire-fire policy every 3 years. That makes it difficult for an employee to remain committed to the company.
bad,if it were not for lower and upper level service management this would be an excellent place to work. Constantly running behind on time due to shop supervisors second guessing everything you do THEN you will get written up for being behind. Pay is lower than most others in the industry however it's not horrible. Good benefits. Absolutely NO advancement opportunities. Apply for the job you want to stay at your whole career here because thats all you'll get.
bad,Management is very poor and there is a lot of back stabbing within the corporate office.
bad,"The owners of the company are very nice people who care about the well being of the employees. Software engineering is the worst department to work for. If you point out the flaw in Architecture and Design, you will be sidelined and expelled. I was the Project Lead for one of the products. I have been forced to use an Existing Architecture which is flawed and not suitable for the product being developed. In the interest of the company, I brought the problems in the Architecture to the attention of Director and VP of Software Engineering. I was quietly sidelined and eventually fired.  I could have easily kissed up my superiors and came up in the career ladder, but I decided to be truthful to the owners. I have no regrets about getting fired because I have done my duty right."
bad,I have learnt about seibel application.It is nice to work here as environment is very friendly and supportive.
bad,"mauvaise entreprise,ils font tout pour mettre les intérimaires en échec, pas de réel management,pas de patron on se demande si il y en a un ?"
bad,"ok working environment"
bad,The job itself is great... But the management are disrespectful and they have their favorites. The employees that been there the longest will try to tell on everything you do and will start a lot of drama.
bad,district manager retaliated after I called his boss to complain about not having any staff to run service shop after he approved there time off. management at our shop where his friends.
bad,Good place to work good experience working here fun days with fellow coworkers . Its good when the getting is good . Great shop workers always willing to help when you have questions
bad,I really like the company.  They seem to care about their employees and are very understanding in a lot ways.  I'm a temp and this position has been a long term temp position for years with no intention to make it a permanent position.
bad,All the employees really care about each other and help out to reach a common goal.
bad,"great company, decent pay. Too willing to fire people. Easy to get hired, hard too keep the job. NEVER express your true feelings lest you insult someone."
bad,"Good pay, opportunities to advance, faced paced, lots of overtime, management has good and bad depending which department your in, always chance to learn"
bad,"Overall a good place to work, a lot of old machinery, good people. Production lines need help. I enjoyed what I do there, and the people. They have a lot of updating with new machinery but what the have can do the job"
bad,"I worked for Cummins a total of 6 almost 7 year as a temp and as a full time employee. I know a lot has changed since I have been there but trying to work out home life and work was very difficult. Last time I checked they did not have any sick days and you start out with one week of vacation. They have a mediocre health insurance, 401K, and they give you stocks in the company. They do a profit sharing checks usually during tax time and they do company events and try to build moral by creating goals and providing you with a T-shirt or lunch."
bad,I was not treated well there and the demands of everyday were extremely difficult.  Inter-divisional conflict existed and no recognition for all the hard work and dedication
bad,It was a stable company. The work is hard and long hours. Very dirty work. They are big on safety. The management is not very flexible with you and there a lot of rules.
bad,The org tries to make it a great place to work but some managers block employees from growth/development opportunities. I am sure some areas are great to work in but there is no consistency from dept to dept. I pray it gets back to what it once was from all levels of the org
bad,"Originally my job at Cummins was great.  Positive work environment, work/life balance, good supervisor, etc.  I was promoted several times, never applying for jobs.  A lot of development opportunities.  Then annual reviews and constant pushing to change roles and move to Columbus, IN.  Although I was designated a high performer and outstanding reviews, I was laid off after 10 years of service during their usual purge every few years, primarily due to my salary (which I never applied for roles to increase) and my lack of desire to move.  Now I hear my entire department is phasing out and all work is moving overseas.  People in a lot of locations are very unhappy with management, and the way top performers are treated.  They are constantly losing their leadership knowledge.  Upper management is getting less diverse as they are continuing to live in the Columbus, IN bubble.  Although I had some positive experiences at Cummins, in the end they pretty much ruined my career and lost my respect for how they treat their employees.  If the chose to reward mediocrity and let go of those that are loyal and talented, they will continue to go down hill.  I do not recommend you consider making a career here unless you are local to the Columbus, IN area and want to stay there."
bad,"	Extensive experience in configuration, deployment automation with various App Servers like Oracle Weblogic, Web Sphere, JBoss, Webservers like Apache, Tomcat and more modern Web Containers like Nginx etc."
bad,"Le travail ne manque pas car nous sommes toujours de court de personnel, maintenant il na plus de directeur de succursale et de service. Maintenant que la corporation a acheté tout ses distributeur Nord Américain il veulent faire de la micro gestion et ses impossible quand nous devons faire directement avec le client ."
bad,"Company stuck int he past with archaic change control processes. High level management fails to provide the resources necessary for engineers to succeed."
bad,I already reviewed this company. I do not need to do it again. Please let me move on through the upload. Why do you have it set up this way with the same employer?
bad,"A Cummins é uma empresa que paga acima do mercado de trabalho, tem bons benefícios, tem uma metodologia moderna de trabalho, porém você não tem vida social, pois os prazos são abusivos, a empresa é mal administrada e não há treinamentos para a sua rotina de trabalho, por isso demora-se a dominar as tarefas. Há inúmeros treinamentos mandatórios que não são aproveitados e que devem ser realizados dentro do seu horário de trabalho, fazendo com que suas tarefas fiquem acumuladas. Inúmeras reuniões de mais de uma hora, que também se tornam improdutivas. Ambiente competitivo de maneira excessiva."
bad,"Cummins is a good company to work for with good benefits and pay but, Rocky Mountain has a lot to be desired at the branch management level. Management continually fails to schedule work and shows up late on a daily basis. Management takes days off, shows up late and leaves early and doesn't tell anyone leaving techs wondering what to do. The work is fairly easy. The toughest part of working for this company is having to deal with the LACK OF LEADERSHIP and management skills of the people in charge of the branch. I had 7 different managers in my department in a 5 year period. Most were fired, demoted or left the company. I wouldn't depend on this company as along term employer."
bad,"You're either working super hard for hours straight or not at all for hours. Expect to work 50+ hours per week. Expect your schedule to change weekly, if not daily. There's lots of talk from management but not a lot of action. The old timers are detrimental to the improvement of company culture. They will not allow positive change. It's a typical job. Nobody wants to do it, but the pay is hard to turn down."
bad,Cummins is fast pace with full of energy and the people are very friendly. Receive bonuses along with raise every year. Able to apply to different jobs within company to move up the ladder with experience you have within working at Cummins.
bad,"not a good job for anyone looking for a career, it is good when your in high school maybe as a summer job. It is a lot of work and they pay so low you can't afford to make a living off of it."
bad,My line lead was never around. Training lasted a week. No more. No less. My trainer couldn't even answer basic questions I had. Lack of communication amongst employees.
bad,"Worked happily here for well over a year, I was let go due to a shop that wasn’t CNG certified and forced to work on a ISL G WM unit outside during snowfall in the dark. We were required to work 1 hour mandatory overtime starting one hour earlier than usual, my scheduled time was 7am so I had to start at 6am. Asked for a safer environment and was cut for insubordination. I loved my work there and was surprised by the outcome"
bad,"It is a goof company for start, but not after that. It is not a great company to stay for a long time. It was a good learning path fr the intern, But I would not recommend for a full time job."
bad,It was a rough day for the whole time I was there. It wasn't the best place to work but it was a paycheck which is all I needed from there. It was a horrible working environment
bad,This company if very sexist. I did not find it to be a positive working environment and saw little to no investment on their part in their staff. I would not recommend this company.
bad,"Cummins is very traditional manufacturing firm, you will have a good work life balance, company cares a lot about family. But implementation is slow and makes it difficult to learn and grow quickly"
bad,"High turn over for many mid level positions. "
bad,Many opportunity's to improve your health. nice words on the wall that no one is really adhering to. what goes on at the top is quite different than what is going on at shop level. Management is disconnected.
bad,I enjoy working along with my co-workers.  Teamwork and communication are great.  I was certified as a forklift operator about 6 months into the job.
bad,In the time working with this once thought incredible company is not as great as everyone makes it out to be well at least i speak in my  department at Cummins. Management is very carefree. Many of the coworkers come in not so pleasant moods. People with bad moods make the environment non-pleasurable and sometime hostel to work in. I choose to not acknowledge this I arrive to work in a timely manner get my job complete and head home. The hardest part i would have to say would be trying to be aware of which people to speak to which not. My job is not hard being that i am mechanically inclined the job is but a breeze. The most pleasurable part i would have to say would be getting to do what i enjoy most work on engines.
bad,I was a financial analyst intern at Cummins.  They treat you really nice and provide excellent pay (2980 per month as an intern) but really screw you over when it comes to job placement.  Every 3 years they go through giant budget cuts and accounting/finance is always the first place.  No job security in terms of staying in the corporate world.
bad,"Minimal Structure, with high expectations for innovation, however technicians are unrecognized for their own achievements.  Coworkers attitudes continue to decline."
bad,"One of the best engine products on the market. Learned one thing every day, ecellant carrer progression."
bad,Growing company. As small organization so I got good experience.
bad,"As far as people go, Cummins had some of the best; however, they took advantage of people and the number of hours they wanted people to work. I was told to expect a 40-45 hour week, but because I could accomplish more during those 40 hours than other employees were able to, I was given more and more work / responsibility, which turned into 70-80 hours per week. When I discussed this with my manager, they agreed that it was an issue, but did nothing to work with me to resolve it. If you are looking for work / life balance, Cummins is not the place to work."
bad,"the culture is very different here, never seen anything like it. Work depends on incoming stock(for me),season."
bad,"Go in do shipping and receiving, do my admin work, plus do parts, its a typical day its a job I do every day. we have meetings and free lunch sometimes"
bad,Learned alot about car parts. And enjoyed the work inviorment. Wasn't to happy with last minute overtime request.  The employees had great attitudes and helped me learn the full shipping process. Also gave me some good tips on order pulling..
bad,Very happy there working for a privately held distributor. Corporate buyout eroded the business. High turnover resulted in a lot of inexperienced and unqualified people backfilling positions. Too many people can’t or won’t do their job.
bad,"Company is a great, however local management at the time of my tenure was still very bias in certain areas that would be sometimes of obstacles for success"
bad,Cummins was once a great place to work for.  90% of the people have no clue what they are doing.  Lazy people get rewarded for doing nothing and hard working people get nothing.  Great place if you want to get paid well for mindless work if your liked by management.
bad,"Cummins are very big and popular company in world "
good,"Good company over all but the management could be a lot better and show more support for their top workers."
good,"New guys should be warned not to get in trouble with the senior guys because if you are right or wrong, the Senior Tech will always be right for the Management.Branch Management are Pro-customer but harsh to its employees."
good,"No training for me due to the fact I was not liked by management."
good,"I loved working there and enjoyed my job. I hired on with the knowledge that the company would be opening a new supervisor position. The President and VP of power generation said I would be an excellent candidate for the position when it opened. I agreed to come on as a technical advisor until that time. When the position finally opened I was given an interview. I realize that I may not have been the best choice for the job out of those who applied. I can admit that. However, they hired a guy who knew NOTHING about power generation. On top of that I had to teach the new supervisor how to do his job. Once I trained him up some he began to only close the largest tickets, and only after I had checked all the information. This made it look like I wasn't doing my job very well. Was let go over a single infraction in the time sheet ( I mistook a Thursday for a Friday to add my 15 mins I stayed late.) Never had any issues prior to this. Management is terrible. Cummins is great."
good,"Learned plenty of skills, welding, operating machines. The management was poor and town bias, employees were favored for family names not work ethic. However, I enjoyed the work I was doing."
good,Cummins is a fortune 500 company that treat their employees like old school down south  workers with NO RESPECT Cummins HR Dept. & Management Team don`t care for the people.
good,Fast paced work that makes the day go by fast. Most people are friendly and willing to help. Good pay but terrible benefits. Management doesn't do anything to resolve issues.
good,Managers are scares at best. Very little advancement opportunity. only thing good is the pay. People are always looking to get each other fired over little things.
good,"Day Start with full Energy and customer call for complaints."
good,"Perform complete installation of electrical systems for operation of equipment mentioned above. Repair and replace defective parts, as necessary. Able to troubleshoot electrical malfunctions and determine the extent of repairs"
good,Was ok to work there learned to look up parts for engines place had old feeling no training learned on my own.
good,"Don't get me wrong I loved what I did and the people I worked with. Looking back though, working at Cummins you have very little family/personal time. You don't go home until the job is complete that meant working 11-13 hour days. Sure the paychecks were amazing but I lost a lot of time and friends while working there. Your co-workers become the only friends you have. As for me, I unfortunately received backlash for going to HR to report harassment and it cost me my job."
good,"Needed better management. Need to listen to the employees more, to fully understand what's going on in the different teams and plant as a whole. Too many chiefs. Break down on commutation."
good,"Look elsewhere for better employment opportunities.  Cummins tends to over-hire during periods of high performance, only to let many of these new hires go once the economy takes a downturn."
good,"Answering incoming calls"
good,"HR at Nashville Customer Care Center promotes discrimination. "
good,Management does not set clear expectations for employees and there is no sense of team work.  
good,"Management varies from one location to another. The incentive for the local Branch Manager is to take the best accounts for themselves and leave the rest for the sales people to work. My territory was cut after only 60 days on the job and given to another rep. 3 years later they used my lack of sales against me and I was ""thrown under the bus"". If this was the only job out there take it and do the best you can. Begin looking for a new environment and opportunity because they are very limited here."
good,Boa empresa que está em crise junto com o setor automotivo
good,"come in, turn on machines, ovens to get them warmed up, plan out the day's schedule to make sure parts are available for the day.  the hardest part of the job was putting up with the people that complained all the time and you were powerless to help due to supervisor said no, but they still complained to you."
good,"a typical day at work was good, I guess depending on your position. the work is easy. I learned how to use cummin's software, to check receiving, shipping, pulling orders for components, also I advanced some of my fabrication knowledge.  the employees are nice when you get to know them. the hardest part of the job is when you have all of your work done and there is nothing to do.the most enjoyable part of the job for me is the employees."
good,Not worth working here unless you are a direct hire and not a temp. You are worked harder and more expected of you yet the Cummins employees are lazy and slack. You are bounced around to different positions/cells with little training at a position yet expected to have 3-5 defects per month!!
good,In this company only support family members . They don't support other engineer. Like favoritism. They not even taking leave. There do provide correct data on the increament
good,"It is always about next best greatest improvement, and failure is not tolerated.  Has a lot of double speak, talks work life balance, but to meet expectations a person has to work 60+ hours a week. Many managers are good, but key ones are poor."
good,Cummins bought out the distributors and relocated the Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable departments. They are in the mists of consolidating departments
good,"Ik heb daar graag gewerkt maar de laatste maanden is de sfeer er te snijden. Ik begrijp best dat een werkplek geen feestzaal is maar er mag toch af en toe wel eens gelachen worden toch? Dit is wat er mis is bij ons,als je maar even staat te praten dan word je al op je schouder getikt."
good,Good co-workers; concerned with their customers and good relationship with their suppliers. Senior management difficult to talk with.
good,"This Company was a good place to work when there was an owner. When Cummins bought them completely and turned them into a publicly traded company, it went down hill in a hurry."
good,"Typical working style. Six Sigma is major tool for correction."
good,"A typical ""night"" at cummins consisted of not knowing when you were going home, so it was much safer to assume you were going home at shift change. I learned that this company prides itself on a diverse work environment but internally it is as close minded as anywhere else. Management is always changing, you never have a stable management staff. When your manager comes around for meetings they always seem to not know any information to be fact or fiction. In my time at cummins i managed to meet a few people i got along with, but if you are a ""try-hard"" watch your back, it's frowned upon to try and be a team leader, everyone has to ""get their overtime."" The job itself was easy. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the people. The most enjoyable part of the job was finally saying good bye. After being dragged into the middle of an ""HR investigation"" and dealing with a level of incompetence only thought to have existed in a kindergarten class, i needed to cut ties for my health and sanity.  As a word of advice to anyone being hired on as a temp or perm, just stay to yourself (good-luck), do your work, and stay away from the Test department. Try to get into machining or shipping."
good,"Well paid but you do earn it, The benefits do outweigh the negatives which I will not go in to as quite often you get the call back to work which I could not turn down because of the salary"
good,It was  nice experience to work with these company .But my manager was very bad person he can't see good if any lady doing there work promptly he feel very jelous and continuesly  pressurized for work.
good,The management says they want feedback.. but when genuine and honest  feedback is given they don't like it because it calls into question they're practices and procedures. Of which often shows they're inadequate in often inept performance of duty.
good,"Maintenance staff is understaffed, expect long hours and continuous 7 days a week,3 Maintenance Managers within the last 24 months."
good,"Great place to work as very challenging Customers, good exposure. Working hours not limited as you have to complete your job yourself without any excuses even you are overload it doesn't matter for the management as they are approving only to carry out the job as per company policy and expecting 100 percent performance from the employees."
good,"Most of the people that work here are decent."
good,I was at CMEP so I can't speak for all plants. Very toxic workplace. Pay was good. Benefits were okay but not great. The most difficult thing was dealing with the people not necessarily the job itself.
good,"This place could really be a great place of employment. The co workers are a joy for the most part. But the management from Managers down to the supervisors are a mess. If you're not in their circle, you will NOT advance. And if you speak with management about anything, your business will be all over the building before 5pm. If you decide to work here, STAY TO YOURSELF.."
good,"Overall not a terrible place to work other than poor management, the co workers are easy to get along with overtime is available good pay and the bennefits package is pretty good"
good,Come in go to meeting go to work area and start your day.go to board to see what parts you were running that day go get the first part order and start the process.
good,Many work teams working to introduce a lean and better layout for  operators. Many times the line supervisor is not consulted on projects. There was resistance to continual improvement ideas submitted.
good,A parte dos gestores deixam a desejar principalmente na Promoção e crescimento dos PCD's.
good,Great place to work if you arent a single parent or have a family. Not ideal for anyone looking to spend time outside of work. A ton of overtime. Great foremans.
good,great work environment. the work was easy and able to do in a timely manner. the best part of the job was seeing the finished product(turbo) and learning jobs with the company.
good,"Rotina corrida, acúmulo de tarefas de acordo com a capacidade e desempenho. Equipe colaborativa e sempre aberta a explicar e ensinar coisas relativas ao trabalho. A gerência é dedicada a cumprir as metas da empresa e auxílio aos subordinados para cumprimento equilibrado das tarefas."
good,"The idea of this BU is to accelerate growth and become profitable. The extreme conservatism from upper management towards change has put the business behind the competitors. Great people work there, but most of them willing for a career change due to the quastionable leadership from the top."
good,crazy hours not knowing what time you get off people are kind of mean
good,"A day at Cummins was never the same, always wondering who was going to not like you and run to HR and say you did something wrong. My co-workers were great but people around us were not. The hardest part of the job was making management happy the best part of the job was the friends I did have there"
good,i liked the work but the scheduling left little time for family and home
good,"employed for 18 months - promised full itme work - kept getting put off."
good,Elaboração de relatórios técnicos e financeiros para identificação de problemas em projeto e/ou qualidade e soluções junto aos clientes.
good,Cummins Southern Plains is a growing company with minimal employee growth.
good,A good place to work but liked to hold different people to different rules and standards.
good,Ok place to work. But lots of drama. Day to day work wasn't to bad. Management was not very supportive. There was always some type of drama going on in the front office.
good,eliminating a lot of jobs due to the company not profiting enough last year.. I really liked my job and the giving back the company did. We did community service projects to benefit shelters.
good,"A lot of employee's are at their desks and unable to really chat and have that ability to familiarize yourself with others. It is an open space but everyone I stuck on their screens. "
good,"A fast paced environment but at times lack right direction."
good,They company is a good company for someone who does not have kids and husband/wife because you never see them and can plan anything with family and they need to change that because people on the line would love time off as well as the people that work in the office
good,Demasiada presión sobre los puestos de trabajos y algunos jefes no son los adecuados para desempeñarse en este rol. Anteriormente había una rosca con la gente de RH.
good,"Simply put, if you have an opinion I do not recommend working here at the Ladson turbo plant. "
good,"Went to work went home didnt care for the work environment, older techs talk about you if your not part of the click. Learned a lot in 2 years then got let go with out a heads up with 3 other tech's and they kept a kid with no experience who was part of the good ol boys click. But because I did learn a lot I found out that money a way from working for Cummins is a lot better. So thank you for letting me go."
good,"Great co-workers and a lot of fun to be with, but there was zero leadership/management.  I can't speak for other branches, but the Bronx, NY branch is falling down the gutters due to lack of management, unfair expectancies, and lack of compensation and acknowledgement."
good,"Typical work days don't exist at Cummins in the application engineering department.  Some days are 12 hours and some are 10.  Average week is 50+ hours and lots of travel."
good,"They shuffle through people at an alarming rate. Workers are very competitive and not in a good way. Overall the work itself is fine, it’s the personalities that make it bad"
good,no review needed. Our distro center was poorly run. Was directed to fudge production numbers and lie during meeting. too many favorites and employee employee relationships
good,"I started working at Cummins right after graduating from college. At first it was a great place to learn, and the benefits were good for a fresh out college student. However, the lack of career advancement and laid-back culture does not help you to grow after 3-5 years."
good,"Although the company advocates diversity as their core value, there is still a lot of prejudices, bureaucracy and favoritism that makes the work environment not conducive to growth and employee development. There is a lot repressed voices that never get heard."
good,Cummins is a great place to work! The pay is amazing! Bonuses are amazing! Most of the employees are great to work with! But be careful! Some coworkers could care less and have no morals! They're all about drama! Wanna get someone fired? Get someone to say they witnessed another person threatening your life and go to HR! That person will be terminated instantly! No questions asked! HR will never know you lied and the person you don't like will be gone for good and can never be rehired! And no one there cares except for the coworkers that know it didn't happen but are too afraid to speak up as they stand the chance of also losing their job for doing so!
good,My biggest complaint with Cummins is culture. Cummins is a fortune 500 company yet promotions and advancement are only available for those who have a long history in the city of Columbus.
good,"MNC culture but rigid structures "
good,"Great place to work if the role and manager is good."
good,"Its really enjoyable work environment in Cummins. They maintained gender diversity, flexibility & different projects portfolio. I learnt many new skills, interpersonal skill through which I made very number of friends. Management is very aggressive but also very flexible. Hardest part of job is we should maintained good relationship with manager in any circumstances & job security. Most enjoyable part of job is sky is the limit for many new learnings if we desire."
good,Without any reason they will fire you...It all the internal politics. If the manager likes you then he will keep you in the project. Even if you perform well during the restructuring the manager if he doesnot like you will fire you...Many have lost the job....
good,"Cummins really respects and adheres to the importance of work/life balance, which is extremely important to a lot of people. Also, the people that work at Cummins are absolutely wonderful. I absolutely love working with the people I work with each day."
good,"Driving to job site"
good,"Excellent engine company, but lagging behind in IT technologies. Known for diversity and helpful for gaining exposure to the global scene. Focus on sustainability and environmental impacts with a keen sense of corporate responsibility."
good,"Limited opportunity for growth."
good,"Good globally established company to work for."
good,"Cummins hires and hires, then fires in 4th quarter to save cost.  This has created a very hostile environment that I no longer wish to be a part of."
good,"entreprise, malheureusement mal gérée"
good,"long days, no over time, sneaky sales people, low wages, no advancements, to much driving, rushed to get calls done, long hours,"
good,"It is an average place to work. The work is pretty simple and provides valuable packages to oil and gas companies. As this is a small and new facility, very few things are in its place."
good,"The Jackson, Ms branch needs new management. The company starts off good but you will quickly loss motivation to perform your best based on the bad management and poor compensation and raises."
good,I enjoyed working at cummins because of the co workers. my co workers where very helpful when I started working there
good,"Muita correria não conseguindo priorizar as criticidades."
good,company is good but management isn't ok.....co workers is good ........
good,Managing off shore team that didn't performed according to expectations.
good,"This a difficult place to work. In my four years, I had four different supervisors and twelve different co-workers."
good,I work for 9 hours from Monday to friday.
good,"Good attention to meeting customer demands but not loyal to employees. For many years has had a cycle of hire and let go of salaried employees, keeping the loser cost junior employees, instead of keeping most knowledgable people."
good,"Working at this employer was very challenging for me. The workflow was more overwhelming than anticipated, however I took each challenge as a learning experience. On a typical day, 40-50 calls, along with assisting on special projects, managing a special account, and assisting other reps. My day was quite fulfilled in every possible way. As for my co-workers, I think we should've practiced team work more. Nonetheless, we always pulled through together and get the job done. The hardest part of my job was the balance of workload and how to be more professional in my communication. I dont take back any tasks I took on because I wanted to learn the process. So that goes to say that my most enjoyable part of the job was learning a new process. I'm a firm believer, the more you learn the more you understand. I learned that in the workplace, perception is very important. Knowing how to communicate with your fellow co-workers is essential, especially in a call center. So making a team effort to improve requires being more positive and setting an example for others (your co-workers) to look up to."
good,"Their layoff policy is worst, even though you work really hard but one fine day you can be kicked out. Other than that company is good, you get lots of chances to earn and everyone supports you"
good,Schedule is quite busy for system Engineer and tech project lead. Over 9 years there were ample of opportunities to learn specially when working with global teams. Management have implemented good policies however may not be very supportive in day to day work and might find fault with you if things don't happen the way it should have happened. Overall culture is good for 0-5 years experience people but for some middle  and senior roles work life balance can become challenge due to very hectic schedules. Managing multiple stakeholders expectation (local and global) simultaneously is also a challenge.  Most enjoyable part is when working with global cross function and technical team where most of the learnings happen (technical as well soft skills).
good,"The company is an average company, put a lot of focus on shareholder value.  The company can do a better job on diversity and inclusion. The company ranks average compared to other companies."
good,Cummins is a good company to work for but the management is only interested in personal gain and advancement with little to no regard for the lives of the hard working employees.
good,If you don't won't to work your life away this is not the place for you. We all work under the same roof but treatment of others is not followed by everyone.
good,"fast paced but without good long term vision...unrealistic targets and lack of true technical experts (In India)."
good,The Management team in Houston is terrible. They make constant promises that they don't keep. The pay is very low. The facilities are starting to show age and there is no upkeep.
good,"Great people to work with, but due to a recent mass redundancy most of the good guys have gone. a decent company but like everywhere these days, work is going abroad and job security is on the decline."
good,"Good place for some but not me, I was stuck doing most the grunt work because of my age and work ethic. since being bought out by Cummins in the States, Cummins in Canada has gone down hill in terms of taking care of employees."
good,Good benefits. Pay is fair for starting off. Management could use work. Discounts on parts. Shop is nice has heat cool during the summer. Lost of shop tools for special diagnostics.
good,"Culture is very diverse, there is flexibility and I have learned much within the company.  The company understands the hard-work provided and shows appreciation regularly."
good,Cummins was far too focused on left of center political ideology and not focused enough on their core business of building and adequately supporting Diesel engines.
good,"would not go back as long as Cummins LLC owns t"
good,"Initially during the honeymoon phase of the position, work life balance existed.  As of now there is a no such thing. Two days off a month on average, running a 7 day week 6 day week schedule.   Job requirements change daily, having to take up other functions tasks on the fly.  Was initially coined to be only exception circumstances now is a daily norm.  Pay is somewhat competitive, offers tuition reimbursement.  Majority of positions are self-train, due to a ""stars are rewarded"" mentality.  Showing interest in another position in the company gets shrugged off, even with upper management directing them to guide you through daily processes to get you experience."
good,"Great pay for hourly people. Rules can be confusing if you work with mostly Exempt. Rules can also change with each union contract. Managers don't always keep up with hourly rules either, so you are left fending for yourself. It's a pretty stressful place to work, actually. Too much to do, and not enough time, but expected to get it all done or you get a bad review."
good,More emphasis is put on inclusion and diversity than performance. Cummins as a company is a liberal leaning company and  pushes  its views on the employees .  If one is a conservative WASP you are trivialized.
good,"Not a good family/work balance. Constant machine issues and poor training. Mandated overtime due to issues, but does not solve machine issues or lack of resources to produce product."
good,I love working at Cummins easy work to handle the pay worth working at Cummins all you doing is picking up truck muffler putting it on the mechine sending it off that’s all you doing I love.
good,"lots of work to do, but is driven by too many managers. many work within many CFWT. communication between department and shifts are very poor. due to the ML and management team."
good,"We had to strictly adhere to 8 hrs with strict brake and lunch time.  We were non-stop on the phone/computer as customer assistants."
good,We were expected to do more work than we could.  Pay was very good.  Benefits were ok.  No job security because people of any seniority and any rank were laid off.
good,Cummins treat their temp employees like they were permanent employess. The only things that I really didn't like about it was that you could get laid off before your year of being a temp is up.
good,Not a bad place to work but do not expect advancement. The management wants to be in charge without getting input from any of the associates. The managers were all brought in from other parts of the world and they were not easy to work with
good,"I worked for the company and enjoyed what i did and got paid prettt well. There was a lot of perks to worling there but it didnt outweigh the negative things. I worked longer hours then our department manager. He rarely assisted our department when we needed help and claimed to be too busy to assist even to help with call flow but somehow managed to leave on time everyday while me and co-workers stayed to work overtime to catch up for the day. We worked an average of 50hrs a week (sometimes even more) and had to deal with being on call on the weekends. We were expected to multitask in various tasks and were constantly falling behind. If it wasn't for our branch manager, the facilty would fall apart. His management team cannot be trusted and prefer to gossip about other employees instead of doing their expected tasks. They criticize your mistakes instead of helping you better yourself. There is so much negativity that most employees have either transferred or quit."
good,The culture and work-life really changed over the last few years.  However it can still be a good place to work.  Some good people still work there.
good,"I did not like the environment of Cummins Inc.,  The country life style is not for me.  Also, I prefer to live in a more diverse area.  The company itself is lacking in terms of diversity, but it is trying to grow."
good,"One department will have a very experienced manager who is great to work for.  Another department has a college grad who knows nothing of the the work or being a manager.  Cyclical layoffs, poor morale."
good,"One of the key strategies followed by Cummins is ""great place to work"", and because of that the company has strong policies to support diversity and adequate treatment of each other at the work place"
good,"learned management skills , enjoyable at fun activates , typical day is like some cad work with modification & coordination , policies are very good , co-workers are really helpful , hardest part of job are timeline."
good,"Overall not a bad place to work, management is what often determines the quality of the day and that can vary significantly.  There is a conflict of interest between exempt and union workers which is not good for the business, and typically shop floor workers are not viewed in as high of a regard as exempt.  Lots of opportunity for improvement, both personally and for the company, although the ease with which one might pursue those opportunities relies too heavily on image and who you know."
good,"Cummins can be a great place to work and to retire from. Cummins offers a lot of training and there is always opportunity for advancement. Some work their butts off and really care about doing their absolute best while others skate by doing absolutely nothing all day. Those who work the hardest, feel the most heat from management and blamed for things not getting done."
good,Could have been a great job if the supervisors were willing to help out. Poor supervision and lack of concern for my wife and son played a part in me leaving.
good,"7-3:30 work day. No lunch break, misdirection from management occurs on a daily basis. Hardest part of my day, managing my manger."
good,"Plant was closed in 2007, not a very good work environment ,Managers changed often, poor plant personnel, plant was closed to move operations out of usa"
good,Daily assignments are often interrupted by the needs of shop employees. Management could be more organized. Cummins sponsors many events and also works closely with the community.
good,"Good compensation and people, but bad social engineering culture"
good,I loved working there until the job went to Mexico. I did varies job. I advanced to different jobs by showing my different talents. Management had come along ways from the beginning went to team base.
good,"loads of work, very hard work. having physical problems."
good,"learn to make Grr."
good,"To manage availability of equipments like Air conditioning plants, units, chillers, air compressors, cooling towers."
good,"Installation, Training and Repair of coin and currency processing equipment. Shredder, conveyor and paper processing machine repair. "
good,"Work with families at risk, thru school, court, probation and CPS, best part of my job was working with the families helping them learn structure, stability and parenting so they can be successful in daily life."
good,"I do pretty much the same thing everyday it's a fixed job answer calls, transfer & take messages when necessary, I've had the opportunity to learn rascal which allows you to capture & transact customer sales got a bit of banking through the company's procedure. I have very supportive co-worker (admin) though at times other employees from other departmant fail to understand the intensity of the task im expected to bring out when my phone is congested with incoming call which was the hardest part of the job, I personally enjoy interacting with customers and being of good service to them I also enjoyed the fact that i was able to gather skills & information from the different departments."
good,"Everyday is a new and challanging experience. There is always something new to learn, ie process, database etc. High volume of shipment that have to be processed in a timely manner."
good,Cummins is big on safety. lock out tag out is a big one. I saw multiple people that got put on cleanup because they did not lock out a truck properly. In some aspects that was nice. Thats as far as i am going to go i hope they figure out how to run there business.
good,"No job security, permanent contracts go to those who know somebody in the right place. Your efforts are largely unrecognised, you can work twice as hard as the guy next to you and you'll receive equal appraisals because team leaders spend little time on the production line. Good to be trusted to get on with the job, but not so good when you're left feeling undervalued because they fail to award your efforts fairly"
good,I learned from Cummins about how corporate America functions in the real world.  I was allowed to take on projects ad hoc and incorporate them into my role.
good,7 days a week. 8 to 12 hours a day. all mandatory. No family time. Had to hire someone to mow yard never had time to do that. 53 days in a row before i had a day off
good,Company is multinational and name is very big. Good for those who want to start thier career as a fresher with a pseudo brand. Not a good company to move with experience. Lot of girls work over there so it is entertaining to work for them but if you are looking for a decent compensation then it is not your cup of coffee.
good,"From the interview to the start of the job process, Cummins was way more than accommodating; to a graduate fresh out of college, it was a no-brainer to take the offer from Cummins. With said offer however, comes a great pressure to perform."
good,"Buen lugar para trabajar, dependiendo del departamento es la dedicación de tiempo."
good,"I worked for the distributor - Cummins Mid-South before it was taken over by Cummins Inc. to become Cummins Sales and Service.  I preferred the culture and structure of the original distributor.  I understand that after the acquisition the Sales and Service model was trying to find their footing and I do not fault them for that, but they did not utilize their best resources - the people - when trying to find that footing.  Instead of working together with the distributors to find a way that would work best for this new model, they came in and forcefully implemented their own models which, in the end, proved to be unsuccessful and had to be rolled back.  I hope that they have since learned their lesson, but based on my experience during our acquisition, this would not be a company that I would want to work for."
good,I would prefer to keep my comments to myself. On the whole the Company was a good company to work even though many changes were made after Corporate took over.
good,"In Operations, be prepared to work 6-7 days a week. Leadership constantly changes their mind. Don't let change settle and normalize before deciding on the next change. Depends on business unit and role and location, but there is a country club internal promotion structure. Solid pay, but slow pay progression after initial salary."
good,"I t is a pretty structured place to work. Management is sporadic. Too many managers trying to make decisions. Very overworked, if work was low you got sent home."
good,"I was hired to work on projects that would make positive changes in the workplace. Unfortunately, many of these projects were stopped in their tracks. I liked the people I worked with, but have to say it was challenging to do my job."
good,"Cummins is a stable work place.  However I made most of my money on overtime and during these ""high volume periods"" work hours become crucial as to meet customer demand so one can expect to spend many a long day in the production plant."
good,"Decent place to work, a lot of over time and long days. Management could be better. You seem to be reminded you are very replaceable, you will be switched around a lot for shifts and areas that need help."
good,"Because I am a woman I felt singled out a lot. They didn’t have adequate amenities for women. Management sucked, coworkers were amazing! They did have company lunch once a month though."
good,"For months my group was told we were in the process of doing a reorg but definitely, definitely not doing a RIF. Then, a couple of weeks ago, in a suddenly scheduled meeting with HR, I was told its turned into a RIF, my position was eliminated, and I couldn't apply for another job in the company, turn in your computer and badge. "
good,A typical day at work involved being assigned a job and going to work on it. Management is lacking in follow ups. Certain employees are favored more than others.
good,"Most  everyone i spoke to while i worked there said the same thing...""This is just how it is.""   To not address the issues that are VISIBLE and  avoidable seems irresponsible.  those poor people who still work there will be jobless and Neillsville would take a big hit as well."
good,"Most have a strong ability to network, it is very much a who you know company.  Most people have more on their work plan than what can be achieved, so work-life balance can be challenging. Overall not the worst company to work for, especially if you are just starting your career."
good,"Loved the work in the Quality department. No support from anyone, very cutthroat, you are on your on. Great training if you beg and get approved for it."
good,"I thought that a career with Cummins would have been awesome but I think I was at the wrong branch. I started work after I graduated I had to build up my savings so I lived with family for a while In Augusta, Ga.  So I was making a 2 hr one way drive until I moved closer.  After that work load was slow and I was ok but it never picked up.  So I was painting caution parking pole to make hours but I wasn't making 40 hr.  I was about to get kicked out of my apartment but I broke my lease before I got evicted. So move back with family in Augusta and making a 2hr drive to savannah just to get turned around cause no work more than once."
good,"If you are not working in the plants, and are at a non HQ facility, the opportunities for advancement are few and far between. "
good,Laid back culture; room for improvement; political environment; difficult to move up; good work life balance; challenging business partners; policies are manufacturing model
good,"I have nothing additonal to report, I have nothing additional to report and I really don't want to be forced to repond with a minimum of one hundread fifty words.   Really!"
good,"Good company until you get higher paid in your paygrade.  A bit cut throat.  Management is not always honest or transparent and people are not their biggest asset as they proclaim.  Profit is really their only concern and when the going gets tough, they just lay people off who have been there a while instead of looking for other ways to save money or cut costs."
good,It is a good place to work just a lot of lack of communication. I would recommend this place to work for experienced technicians. Work to home life is easily balanced and as soon as you start your benifits start
good,"I was paid very well.  Only problem there, if you are the new guy you won't last long.  The policies in place make it very hard to stay there.   Only people who can make it are the ones who have been there for years already."
good,"I had a mixed experience at the company - worked just a few roles there. One of my managers was just horrible, the others were just OK. The location of the company in rural Indiana makes it hard to access other professional opportunities, especially when Cummins businesses are pretty cyclical."
good,"Cummins was a very interesting company to work at. Very technical great learning experience."
good,"It's a very ok place to work at.. it just depends on what department your in. Also who is your manager. Great benefits, stressful hours.. low pay. Worst part 3rd shift."
good,"bajo salario, baja capacidad de crecimiento, poco desarrollo profesional y  muy pozas posibilidades de moverse de puesto dentro la misma empresa."
good,Management yells and screams at employees. Employees are not respected. Company policies are terrible. People only work there because they need a job.
good,"Pioneer in the indutsry. Hence taking an advantage of its philosophy , Ethics and Knowledge."
good,"Overall this was a good place to work. There are pro's and con's."
good,cummins has a lot of benefits and is a good place for employees starting their carreers.  I need a change in work. The   people are great .  cummins helps the community.
good,Good money when order volume is up plenty of overtime for everyone.  When volumes are down cummins does an excellent job keeping employees at 40 hours per week and creating new and more business.  Employees at the Jamestown Plant are second to none in producing quality engines with short lead times.
good,"Work culture vary within Cummins. Always enough work to do. As long as you market yourself, you're fine. Fair bit of politics like any organization. Cyclic lay-offs - not a good thing, very frustrating."
good,"Cultura empresarial pobre, empresa quadrada e sem perspectivas de fazer o out of the box"
good,"Highly stressful and very poor management at distributor level."
good,"Most days were kept busy with daily tasks, some moreso than others.  Company encourages you to report any wrongdoing by others.  But also when doing that, puts you on the short list for the next RIF (reduction in workforce) "
good,"Love the people I work with, but management does not have a clear direction and seems mostly out of touch with its employees strengths and weaknesses."
good,Work place culture is good but there is always favoritism that happens at work. Lack of decision making and no ownership .The hardest part of the job  was when working at late hours to deliver at next day for inauguration
good,"Great company to work for, but upper management was reluctant to allow service techs with military back rounds to attend V.A appointments even after advanced approval and notice."
good,"To much sress, ask for help n don't get any. Record phone calls of customers cursing you and you the person that who works for Cummins is wrote up. Backstabbing, of co workers. Favoritism."
good,"Overall a great company. You will learn a lot here. Moves at a very fast pace. Most of your day is filled with meeting after meeting. "
good,"Terrible management,all they do is to keep an eye on you but if you need them to solve a technical problem,they do not know what to answer,not well prepared."
good,"Excellent products for a Global company. Local branch needs to improve market strategies to balance PR  trouble economy."
good,"Hier könnte mann einen Roman schreiben."
good,"Empresa de grande potencial porém de gestão falha, com foco em produção e não em serviços."
good,"Okay company to work for, but after a year or two need to move onto something else.  "
good,"average place to work, few resources and not so good management decicions. Technical knowledge is not very well valuated."
good,"Tive diversos aprendizados pois trabalhei em todos os setores possíveis, porém no quesito salário e evolução profissional sempre deixaram a desejar, pois sempre que tinha a oportunidade de crescer era diminuido. Empresa não possui lideres, apenas chefes que só preocupam em mandar e não agregam em conhecimento."
good,"Its very safe for girls to work."
good,"This would a be great place for a recent college grad for employment. You are given a good base. If you're looking to move up fast with good pay, this is not the place to go."
good,"The expectations of the service writers and managers is very high. Even when not on salary i was getting calls at home. Even when not being on call or even after I was let go, i receive calls at home due to lack of organization in upper management and HR. "
good,"Empresa possui grande potencial que infelizmente não é aproveitado."
good,"I enjoyed working with the people there and I loved the accounting aspect of the job, especially accounts payable, entering data, invoicing and mailings. I was sorry to leave the job but they hired someone else permanently."
good,"Very structured environment for advancement. Can be difficult to move between roles that help to grow. Columbus is a nice work location, not a lot to do on the weekends but very comfortable."
good,"My typical work day would be to deal with vendors and people within the company to ensure every process is running on time. Learned about engines, manufacturing processes, lean manufacturing, six sigma etc. Management was nice in responding to our requirements and co- workers were quiet cooperative. Hardest part of job was dealing with outside vendors and people in different departments. Training part was quiet enjoyable and knowledgeable."
good,Its a good environment.. and mingling with the people is good. and to learn the particle knowledge  is very good
good,"Okay place to work, long hours on night shift, management is diverce as well as work force"
good,"Keeping customers updated on repairs events while keeping it on schedule and budget while implementing corporate standards and enforcing them."
good,Short but pleasant learning experience. Got an opportunity to work with experienced lot of people who had been in the system for 10 + years. Left the job owing to academic advancement requirements.
good,"Too much work and  lack of leadership directions."
good,Overall the company is competent. Management is directed from the top down. There is little chance for advancement. Most managers hired from the outside.
good,"Technical team workers are cooperative. "
good,"I work at the RMP Plant, therefore, a typical day at work means being out on the Plant floor supervising the assigned areas with my Training Team."
good,sometimes overtime days seem like they would never end. the best part of the job you could count on everyone doing there job to the fullest.
good,"Most operating level people are easy to get along with and work hard to do a good job. Most would probably say they are frustrated by the infrastructure around their work, and the need to do things like 6 Sigma projects that are not applicable to their work."
good,"Passed over for multiple positions despite better direct skill set and interviews. Promotion required 24 mos working at near Corporate HQ(Ohio)"
good,"Not a bad place to work, practicing inclusive and diverse principles (almost too much), OK worklife balance (still long hours), good pay and bonus plan but managers/ salaried associates are continuously being laid off every 3-4 years despite record profits and cost savings.   Being hourly has its advantages and much more job security at Cummins.  The trucking industry is declining.  Do your homework and be cautious homfroinsCummns"
good,"Um lugar para absolver muitas experiencias."
good,"Long Hours decent pay. Some overtime work. Decent benefits,  don't get hung up on bonuses because they are not guaranteed.   The campus is ok. Long way to walk into plant."
good,"when I first started it was a great place to work, strict but nothing too crazy. Then management changed and began micromanaging things and really did not value employees at all, started taking away little benefits here and there to save a dollar. Took away all overtime, but expected production to increase. Went to work every day worrying about your job security."
good,Overall skill level of associates in the Metrology Gage Lab is poor. Union job security creates a situation where management is restricted and mostly ineffective.
good,Cummings is a nice place with nice people but poor management and no benefits and no way to move up in the career field and the supervisors are disrespectful and rude
good,"The job itself isn’t too hard to do, not really helpful on moving up in the company, stuck doing the same thing everyday. Have to stay on the management about HR and other questions you may have."
good,"The interview was at a time of transition for Cummins."
good,"Highly stressful all depending on manager's mood, you see work family more than real family. The line leaders run the show until 1 of us make a tiny mistake, then all heck would break loose."
good,Management needs some help they are overworked they micromanage everyone excessively and make the work environment unhealthy. The technicians feel they have no support from their managers.
good,"You are only there for other peoples job progression, not your own. Shame really, a lot of good shop floor workers totally switched off. was pleased to be made redundant."
good,"Not the best place for  a finance personal in the beginning of a career."
good,During my time with Cummins.  Quality and customer support was very difficult to obtain internally from the Executive Leadership Team as well as well as the factory.   As the customer facing branch leader I risked to develop processes and mentor our team to execute the best customer support possible.
good,"Everything here is production, not Quality or team work just keep the machine running and hope for the best. Preach 5s but don't practice it. Safety program is a joke. They would rather paint the floor than really fix the machines."
good,"Be punctual. Have good attendance.      "
good,Clarity for Job profile & cummins policies. But Quarterly or six monthly performance review did not happened. Never gave increment as per performance appraisal.
good,"Good Company but lacking in the local Management area.  Camaraderie amongst co-workers is almost non existent, the team work within department seems to have been lost.  Overall Benefits Ok."
good,Your success is determined only by your immediate boss. I have heard many people still here and many that have left say the same thing. And most are not good.
good,"Liked the company and the job, but 2nd shift did not work for my family. Moved from parts department up to service supervisor in a mater of months. Received plenty of job training."
good,"Advancements, Salaries, Job security are pretty solid things at Cummins however, the management especially in the production test area need re-evaluating to see if they actually know what they are doing."
good,Good People poor training and stressful environment. This is a good company I was at a location with poor management. Very great Time off plans though
good,A normal day is 8 hours with 2 breaks and a lunch. Runs like most other factories but in an assembly line form. The people are just as similar at other factories that I have worked. Not much different of a work culture than I am use to.
good,"A typical day at work consists of assembling engines based upon the information on your computer screen. Learned a lot about diesel engines, and how they function. Management is unfair at times, and there is a lot of favoritism toward certain employees. The workplace culture is fairly easy going and helpful. The hardest part of the job is never getting used to the rotating shifts, and sometimes the repetitive work can be hard on your body."
good,"de regula abuena, buen salario en algunas pocisiones."
good,"Good company to work for if you are a graduate on the internal scheme. However, not a corporate company, really slow on development and progression and management hierarchy are usually  internal promotions through favouritism so some appointments are unjustified."
good,"Caring, Customer oriented, Good work culture. A nice place to work would've stayed by but the pay wasn't sufficient. "
good,"High traffic with the forklifts, must pay attention to what you are doing. Loved the people I worked with. The management was fair and understanding. learned how to use a R.F. Scanner."
good,If you get laid off make shure you take the job back if not you will never be able to work for that shop again. Because about a year later I put my application back and they told me they couldn't even set up an interview
good,"To be able to do more than just my daily tasks, like building instruction manuals, or collecting paperwork that needed to be entered in to the computer system. I also enjoyed booking business trips for any employee that needed it."
good,Cummins will always take care of there employees no matter what the stocks are doing.  They go out of there way to promote safety and community service.
good,fast pasted look up parts answer phone make phone calls for parts order parts from factory shipping and receiving put stock order away inventory control
good,"Territory Sales, 6 states, Great Job. Poor Management at local levels. If you can over look those things and stay focus at your task at hand, your rewards a great."
good,"Not a lot of advancement opportunities."
good,"Very Fast Paced, must wear many departmental hats to be successful including technical skills in your commodity area."
good,"A typical day at work is come in and start on your work, get it done and go home.  Very low key atmosphere.  The workplace culture is very diverse and interesting.  I work with people from other countries, learn their cultures and its just interesting to hear about other places.  Cummins also allows employees to take walks on your breaks and encourages overall good health."
good,After takeover by Cummins it was challenging period for both employer and employee. Now I am sure all of that is past and must be consolidating its position in India
good,Cummins likes to give people a lot of work.  There is always too much work actually.  There is a problem with management.  People are promoted who are not ready to manage others.  Benefits are ok.  Payrate was great.  Job security is very low.
good,"The role I had was a bit of an anomaly. The workload was ""luck of the draw"" and I was given a very basic workload for my entire time there. This created a very dull workload next to others who had in depth and complex work, far more suited to my skills."
good,"Pros"
good,As a supervisor you are not really a supervisor. Your a glorified babysitter and if a tech makes a mistake it is assumed to be your fault. As a fortune 500 company they allowed to much of the different standards for different people in the same role to happen. They also kept the wrong people and got rid of good folks.
good,"They are expecting you as an individual to produce a number of packages per hours. I talking about numbers that is impossible to reach. They are willing to send you home if you not reaching production. Workers are standing on their feet for hours and dedicated to the job, but you leads and supervisors wondering why you cannot product 90 boxes of hours and provide little help occasionally to pick up the slack. But, your job security is still on the border line of losing and that's not a good feeling working for Cummins"
good,"In recent years, Company have changed approach from balancing work load to finding new hires and letting go higher salaried employees, and loosing talented folks by not matching industry wide pay. Also Company seems to pays more attention to growing investors value rather than employee satisfaction."
good,"•	Assisted all customers"
good,"I loved my job there. I wish they could have even out the production flow for the assembly workers. Assemblers sent home during the week and then had mandatory overtime on weekends. I loved the fast paced job and the ability to solve inventory, quality and scheduling issues to maintain a even line flow. Enjoyed the diversity of my fellow employees and was always teaching or learning something new."
good,"L''ambiance de travail est pas très bonne, beaucoup de personnes négative,"
good,"Company culture is good but lack of management on senior level."
good,"Great working conditions with great people. Serviced banking equipment such as currency scanners, coin sorters and coin wrappers."
good,I had one manager who was great. She showed appreciation for the work her people did. The other 4 that I had while there all demanded more even if you exceeded production.
good,"Cummins as a whole has many issues. Local distributor management is always scrambling to impress the corporate folks in Columbus. Maybe the buy out will improve the environment, but I'm not holding my breath."
good,"Like the summary says, if you are a very experienced individual in mechanics then this is a great and challenging place to work. However if you lack said experience this environment is very stressful. It's a numbers game and regaurdless of experience if you don't meet the marker prepare for termination. They lack compassion for inexperience and don't really make an effort to train a lesser experienced employee, which withdraws chances for someone like that to grow and become a better technician. Rather management just kind of talks down to you, or answers all questions with distain, until you want to quit. It is the most discouraging position I've ever held. This is just my personal experience with this location. All in all, this is a prestigious and well established company to work for, if you can meet their expectations."
good,"Typical day starts by going right to your building cell and seeing where first shift left off and what rate they hit for the day. Getting ready and starting to build the units right away. Learned how to use power tools and assemble. Management sometimes have unrealistic expectations and don't answer questions about things and have safety meetings about silly things that are almost made up because they are so petty and don't have anything real going on. It's really not a hard job, just have to listen and pay attention so no one gets hurt. Most enjoyable is you get to talk with people and don't have to really put any thought in anything, just do what you need to do."
good,Management was not good at that location.  Several tenured employees left under new management.
good,Good company.  Recognized for results.  Bad financial situation lead to being purchased by out of state company.  They brought in their own management team.
good,"Cummins has good structure and a great product in the market. "
good,"We follow the SPRINT. "
good,"This job provides a good work/life balance.  However, it lacks in other areas, including:"
good,"cummins is a great company, with competitive pay and good benefits."
good,Working in Prototype as an assembler i learned how to build and breakdown turbos by hand
good,"I operate a feild service truck. I repair and maintain Natural gas and Diesel engines. I normally work from 7-6. The management is ok."
good,"Empresa multi nacional com muitas oportunidades internacionais. Excelente pacote de beneficios. Como toda empresa de grande porte existe varias realidades diferentes entre as areas, mas no geral ambiente bom de trabalho."
good,"Socially responsible company with values"
good,"I started off as a onan(generator) technician. After several months worked slowed down I was moved to the R.V. repair section of the shop. Sometimes I worked on Heavy engines of the shop. I used over head cranes, forklifts, grinders, and many other equipment to assist my duties as an all around technician. I enjoyed everyday for I saw something new everyday. Many vehicles I drove and the co-workers were very helpful."
good,"Processed dealer core returns (very high volume)"
good,The most enjoyable was working with co-workers. one of the best management support for work. a time bounded activities needed to be perfformed.
good,"A typical day at work for a conscientious employee is in excess of 10 hours. (minimum) Compliance to project success is a mantra in the company but success comes at a high price. Although the greatest emphasis is on visible metrics it is the invisible metrics that are most telling about this company. For example, although the published safety metrics for injuries experienced on the job are at a near benchmark level in this industry, it is the stress experienced by the leadership that has proven to be overwhelming to most members. I'm afraid there are no verifiable statistics related to the stress that leadership is under. However, medical, FMLA, and short term disability leaves are common. I am not exaggerating when I state that I have seen competent, mature, conscientious leaders cry at the stress level experienced."
good,Seguimiento diaria a la producción de acuerdo a la planeación y reportes a gerencia.
good,"One of the best engineering companies in the world to work for, but also one of the least innovative, thanks to its near-monopolistic domination in some areas."
good,"Overall Cummins- RMEP is a good place to work if your goal oeiented and like to work massive overtime.This company is based on th economy. For example, if there is a demand for diesel engines whether boats, trucks, cars, or specialty products the demand is high and the money is there. This company is not suited for people who dont like to work overtime and swingshifts if your an hourly employee."
good,A typical night at work was generally fun and productive. Each night had its own issue that my team and I had to work through. What I learned during my time at Cummins is that manufacturing is a big part of our economy and when making a product for our customers I have to put myself in their shoes and maintain that customer mentality when building and watching over the production of the product. Associates in the plant are affected by the management and if management are handling things properly the results can be seen in the productivity of the associates. My co-workers are great I have always tried to put out a positive vibe and maintain that cause the well known philosophy is happy people make good products. The hardest part of my job was dealing with a Tech on 1st shift. Everyday she came in there was always something wrong she was never happy and it seemed like certain managers were always on her side so they wouldn't have to hear her complain too much. Other than that I enjoyed my job. The most enjoyable part of my job was leading my own team of people to make a product with the Cummins name.
good,if you work for cummins u will get will get to know what is a culture really was
good,"worked for one year and was let go for calling in sick. they never give raises unless you work there for 10 years. many unhappy employees make some days hard to be there. the managers make good money but the guys doing all the work make a little less than 13 bucks an hour. its a good job if thats all your looking for but other than that, dont expect anything more. oh and the health care is a joke!"
good,I enjoyed working with everyone. The best times was when we had to do inventory the last day in October.
good,"Despite repeated complaints about harassment by management to HR, they still remain employed by the company. There is hypocricy in the company and I am concerned about how management views employees."
good,"good all round,well paid job,plenty of overtime,good canteen,short shifts.well liked colleagues,training ops,good culture,next to Burghley house,very scenic"
good,Cummins has a great safety program in place. Cummins builds quality products for their customers. Cummins employees have to follow strict rules to ensure the quality is met with each build.
good,"Cyclical hiring and firing, plenty of diversity products are good future needs some diversification management is only worried for their next promotion"
good,"Well for me I've learned several skill as soon as I became an employee I"
good,"I learned that there is a wide range of jobs and experiences that can be taken away from life at Cummins.  It all comes down to your manager and how well you can fit into their expectations.  Once you get high enough, it's all about the politics."
good,Cummins is a good company to work for..typical day is good..all like to work for cummins.. cummins love their employees and employees love cummins....
good,It’s ok   Nice coworkers  pay is ok  .  Management needs training and they need to put more effort into keeping good employees and letting them make decisions
good,"Good place to work,  People are very nice to work with.   They are moving the company towards being more of only assembly vs. complete manufacturing company."
good,Empresa boa para trabalhar como todas condições de trabalho
good,"NO COMMENT, I did not find the experience supportive but I did learn something while there. I wish I could have had the help of my manager to expand my learning of medical filing and telephone conversations."
good,"The day started at 5am in the morning and you could be working until 6pm at night due to the work and the customers."
good,"Good Working environment. great opportunity for college campus placed student. "
good,"Cummins is a good company for engineering and supply chain.  The first five years of my career development were very good.  The culture is always changing and differs by business unit, entity and location."
good,Stable company that will invest in your development. I really liked the opportunity to gain a six sigma belt. I also like that they will pay for certifications.
good,Cummins is a great place to work for if you’re looking to improve your financial standings. You work mandatory overtime daily. It starts to seem like you are there more than home. There is room for advancement within the company. Team members are great.
good,"I enjoyed working there, and miss it. I just wish Cummins was in California, and other places. It's always a lot of different changes, which I love. I don't like to be bored."
good,"Worked on a team working on the engines for the Dodge RAM trucks. Unfortunately, these engines are used in trucks that through marketing and poor regulations are sold to the mass market. The ultimate design of the RAM trucks is dangerous to vulnerable road users like people walking or cycling and the huge size of the front further increases the seriousness of crashes. So one can question the ethics of working in such teams."
good,"Rigid structure, well run and efficient business, great experience, but can be low pay unless you climb corporate ladder, but they accelerate youth in management positions. Overall good company, but work hard to succeed."
good,"Expert in Ariba"
good,ok job not much to say about the job other then it was a job.. The people was nice you got incentive check every so often if you did your job correctly
good,Had a good time there. People were good to me and showed me the ins and it’s off how to work there. Management was very helpful to me and made work comfortable for me.
good,"Easy commute from my address at the time of employment."
good,I have been at Cummins for 2 years a lot of changes. Not the same place when I started.  Its a more stressful environment. Changes comes with change. It could be worst.
good,Very fast pace demanding quality control and precision was one of the qualities of the company but not very much advancement of career management could have did a better job o in the house promoting
good,The company is an extremely diverse and included place to work at. This creates a continuing change in everyday life as you meet and deal with all types of cultures and beliefs. This challenges you to adapt to different ways of doing things which ultimately give one more options to resolve challenges.
good,Do not voice your opinion if you disagree with management because it will ruin your career. They will make life miserable for you and you will not be in the Buddy Club Network.
good,Literally only did couple weeks of work experience there. They forgot about me for several hours however. Overall the experience was more or less what I thought it would be.
good,"I got there at 11 pm and worked until 7 am. People mind their own business and the managers were very nice. I was only working there for 3 months, during the summer."
good,good working environment but not the career I want. Decided to go back to school and get into a different career field. Nice managers and other co workers helped.
good,Do not prefer to give a review of Cummins. I do not understand the purpose. Will this be shared with others. I looking for room to grow and move up the ladder
good,"Good atmosphere to work in.Good work and home balance.Management was poor, could have done better there. Union shop with poor representation. would recomend."
good,"The job was not for me, but it has a good working environment. they put a lot of effort into looking after the employees. If the job was right for me I would have stayed."
good,"Good company to work for. Adapted and embraced diversity well. Respectful environment. "
good,"every professional who is destined to continue to expand their knowledge of new sales and products, is limiting their level at success in any thing they do. There are dreamers, and people who know what their doing in life. Which one you choose is only up to you."
good,i love the job just wanted a set shift for my kids sake. those swing shifts was not for me when it came to my kids. i mean it was some friendly and nice people to work with i just couldnt handle the swing shifts...
good,"Overall my typical day would be very busy and flash by & sometimes little time for problem solving & interaction. Although I have learned a great deal about heavy-duty industrial engines & the company processes. The management was OK & left you to your own devices but did lack support at times, which in turn could effect the workplace culture of them & us & different departments. The hardest part was when someone didn't turn in & could be frequent,  & also especially the afternoons which were frequently hectic & you could be hit many large & small requisitions while working against the clock for cutoffs. Of course the most enjoyable is when everything goes well without difficulty while having great rapport with your colleagues."
good,"Fast work pace day went by fast"
good,"Easy to accommodate for family with young kids, but not much if you are with strong ambition to grow your career quickly; a 100 yr old company struggling to keep up with fast change world."
good,"Politics are thick at Cummins, If you dont like dealing with Internal issues all the time i wouldnt suggest this place to anyone. You can make good money but the trade off for personal life i feel wasnt worth it in the end. I will never work for them again"
good,working there was fun. i meet alot of people and they where all very helpful. the place was very shiny and really clean. the bathrooms where well taken care of too.
good,"Old management culture"
good,overall benefit wise it is a good company could use some improvement but the salary is good and the experience opens doors to other jobs in the field of manufactoring
good,"Great pay. A lot of overtime. Based on seniority so if you don’t want to work weekends and someone that has been longer doesn’t either, you’re stuck with working."
good,As receivables I had to make collection calls as well accept or decline credit. I kept track of certain accounts such as coal companies or trucking businesses. The hardest part of the job was having to put accounts on COD if they were past due or decline them credit. The most enjoyable part was not having management looking over your shoulder.
good,"The company provides a lot of training opportunities. "
good,Always busy. Never out of work. A little on the hot side. Mostly men works there. Good environment out of the fact that it gets really hot in the summer. Cool co-workers
good,"If you want to work seven days a week with good benefits, it's for you.  As a temp you work until they say you get off even on weekends you aren't supposed to."
good,"A typical day at Cummins isn't bad in general, but depending on your position, your co-workers, and your manager, is really what makes the difference."
good,"Working at Cummins Emissions Solutions for three months was a new experience. It was mostly friendly staff. There were good and bad times, which is acceptable going into a new area of work."
good,"stressful too many meetings - didn't care for exempt status always worried about your job"
good,Unpredictable unorganized no room for advancement i did learn a skill while i was there but i had to observe and train myself to do the work in my department Quality Inspection the most enjoyable times were the occasional lunches they had catered in.
good,"Working with this business I have a route I do everyday I have to clean a school building at the building I clean restrooms, offices, classrooms, hallways and windows. I love the work I do but the management is horrible I barely have supplies and when I call my manager I never get a response. When I first started I trained with a person who only showed me basic things. The job isn't really hard my detailing just have to be on point and everything must be restocked at all times."
good,"It is a good place to work just a lot of lack of communication"
good,"A Cummins é uma das empresas mais organizadas onde já trabalhei. Mas mesmo com tudo o que ela se propõe no sentido de  plano de carreira, cultura corporativa... ela ainda é um lugar onde pessoas de iniciativa são facilmente bloqueadas por ""carreiristas"". "
good,a typical day at work would be coming in to work clocking in working in your designated work area and cleaning /greeting customers and clocking out etc.....
good,I liked the people that worked there. the work wasn't overwhelming but it was challenging. I did a variety of jobs. there was a lot of advancement opportunities at Cummins.
good,i worked in production. i had to take productive and label and pack the product. It was a fast pace place to work. You must be self motivated and will to work.
good,"Lot of good people, Operations suffers from lack of technical support for engineering division."
good,"Poor management, no functioning teamwork. Boasted in interviews there was extensive room for advancement. This is not accurate for this location. There is not a functioning training program. Managers allow staff to work overly short staffed, and there is no opportunity to make more money via overtime, or advancement."
good,"not smoker friendly, stellar ergonomics and medical care, production losses due to malfunctioning machinery (it pays better to have a machine that works awfully and you patch up with tape and rubber bands than to have a well repaired line), bosses who sit and eat popcorn. abusive hours, very safe working environment. extremely osha compliant. favoritism of direct hire people over temps. beuracracy that shoves company ideals down your throat. super friendly fellow workers, fist bumping and exchange of humour."
good,I honestly think people working here should get paid more. The communication within the shop floor and inside the office is very poorly. Managers and supervisors have a very bad way of communicating with floor employees.
good,Lots of learning about engines and engine components.Engine trouble shooting techniques and engine assembly technique learning good. Very procedural work.
good,"A lot of time gets wasted on fluff projects and making presentations about how great they are. Union and management are always in total disagreement, yet management never follows through with new policies."
good,"It's a good place to work for what it's worth. If you like a fast paced almost chaotic environment and plenty of hours, then you will be right at home. The constant rotating shifts make it hard to adjust and there is a high possibility that you will work 2 weeks straight without any off days, several times."
good,"The company has a pension and if you like assembly line work the MRC is the place for you. Management is driven by reports, metrics and numbers.  Moral was very low when I was there."
good,It is an ok place to work. The pay is fair and the benefits are great.  The environment is competitive which promotes growth among employees.  Cummins is very involved with the community.
good,It can be difficult working for a large company where you do not have control over the fate of the company.   Working with customers can be rewarding.
good,"Very Fast Paced, must wear many departmental hats to be successful."
good,"A typical work day starts at 8:00 am and ends at 5:00 pm.  However, there's flexibility.  Some workers come in as early at 6:00 am and leave at 2:00 pm. "
good,The ceo would send company wide emails against the presidents policies. There is a strong culture of the buddy system.  One employee is well known to not work and leave while still on the clock with many customers so upset they were yelling. Mean while others would be written up because they were busy with one customer and another had to wait until they were done.  A wild mix of people that worked here 30+ years but also have a high turn around rate.... about 20%
good,"Long hours,mandatory overtime weekly.  I would recommend to friends and family.  welding in a factory setting can tend to get a bit hot.  Good people to work around"
good,"Assembly line type of production factory, heavy equipment Diesel engine production. Good pay with opportunity for overtime. Hourly rotation so you don't do the same job your entire shift."
good,Great benefits but the employees at the Neillsville wi plant act like kids in high school and push the good workers to find jobs elsewhere to much high school drama
good,The job was fun and exciting. My boss was a great man and so were my co-workers. It was a team since of accomplishment. Upper management was a joke. It was like be in Junior high again when dealing with them. They made bad calls when it came to customers and had me bail them out one to many times. And the thanks I get for it was being laid off when the economy tanked.
good,Cummins is a manufacturer of diesel engines throughout the world.  Its portfolio consists of both on and off highway engines installed in a wide range of applications.  Because of its global footprint it is a very diverse company in terms of cultures and viewpoints.
good,The Management was sub-par but the people within the department were excellent co-workers.  The culture was good and there that really made a difference.
good,Large global company that values generalists. You do not need to specialize in specific areas. Cummins gives opportunities to those it views with top talent.
good,"Realiza la coordinación de desvare de equipos y apoyo telefónico a los clientes para desvare de equipo de trasporte de carga se realizaba el despacho, logística de la instalación de la plantas eléctricas y la coordinación de personal técnico."
good,"Hay un buen ambiente de trabajo, se promueve la cultura de la diversidad"
good,"best at diesel hw, not so much on SW."
good,It's a great place to work wit student teachers being open minded to solve problems accordingly to make our happy. Moving around and preparing a great school and work place for students and teachers I worked at uc college great atmosphere
good,"It was a great experience shadowing engineers and learn new skills. I definitely enjoyed my time there."
good,"No recognition for a job well done, only negative feedback for mistakes. Line managers unapproachable and unreceptive to suggestions resulting in low moral and negative team environment"
good,They have advertised this position 3 times in less than 3 years. Something is up with that. HSE interviewers did not seem like they were all that skilled.
good,"The hours were long...rotated shifts 1,2,and 3 every two weeks.  Work 13 days on and then have 2 days off.  This made it very hard to keep going."
good,"I would still be there, but due to my training person, she didn't care for me and made it hard to continue working there. So unfortunately I resigned from the company."
good,They need to have continuing working equipment to have a productive day. That was the problem their machines would constant brake down which make low production.
good,I learned something new in the system everyday to help train others. Also ordered parts and answered phone calls to help order and receive parts.
good,"Each day I learned something different whether from management, co-workers, and/or customers. Deadlines are very important. No two days were the same."
good,Cummins was great the 3rd party company had some issues never deliver the promise the tell you good co works to get along with they teach you on the new items you don't know
good,"Manage and develop supply chain capability; work with employees to set goals in training and development, performance, and career planning. Mentor and coach individual and collective talent to develop supply chain capability across the organization. Design, develop, and implement cross Business Unit, enterprise planning, materials, production, inventory and logistics strategies for the supply chains. Champion continuous improvement projects that align with Cummins Operating System and Functional Excellence direction by leveraging common processes, tools and information systems. Partner with internal and external functional stakeholders to maintain strategic and critical supplier relationships. Responsible for $2.5B in revenue annually."
good,The work and life balance is awesome!  This company allows the flexibility for their workers!  But it's going through some internal restructure and many talented people left the company.
good,"Not a place where you should start"
good,"I started as a welder. Mid, tig, and robotic welding was required. Later, I moved into the quality office, where I inspected parts before employees could start producing them. Unloading trucks with a forklift was also one of my duties. I learned how to properly inspect parts, use a CMM machine, do cleanliness testing, and weld. The employees and management were very nice people. The hardest part of the job was getting burnt while welding. The best part was having my own desk and computer."

good,"It is a very good place to start for a college graduate to get exposed to world class automotive industry. Working on customer requests was fast interesting, varied and fast paced. At times, due to the projects being so urgent, individual (self) learning got compromised.It greatly depends on your manager how you are going to feel about your work. Team mates were very helpful and we coordinated tasks a lot. Working on different projects you learn how to prioritize tasks and work with different component teams to deliver a good product to the customer. Dealing with technicians can be hard sometimes but you learn it withe experience."

Worked with Supply Chain Manager to coordinate supply and vendor events as well as placing orders for equipment.  "
good,Provided a good place to work.  Many opportunities do perform different tasks.  Overall view of the company seemed to be a little short sighted.  Business results fluctuate frequently which causes a instability in workforce.
good,Not much of a life outside of Cummins. Seems like the pay was at the bottom of the barrel too. I was making 70% less than the average for welders across the US.

good,Work was always fast paced.I learned how important quality is when making products for our customers. The management was very knowledgeable of the products. My co-workers on my line knew many things about the products we where making. They also were very knowledgeable about how to fix problems with machinery. The hardest part of my job would have to be the physical strain the work did to my body. The most enjoyable part was learning something new everyday. I love to learn and this job was something I have never done before so it definitely was the challenge I was looking for.

good,"I build enclosures for generators, I learned how to Mig (some Tig), I learned how to use a shear and press break, to use a plasma cutter, grind, drill and tap, and to use basic fabrication tools. The hardest part of the job is after you work there 2+ years everything is so repetitive and there is nothing more to learn. The most enjoyable part of the job was the company's culture."
good,"This company is very productive in its work; a very product focused enviornment,"
good,My day starts at 2am with a meeting with supervisor & employes. Doing the job is not hard just ur daily routine of shipping & recieving .The hardest part of my job is management is not on the same page with each other

good,"I was just starting out. I got to learn alot from some very talented people. Some, I'm still friends with today. The only problem was one of the bosses had a drug problem. So, that would complicate matters at times. We would travel from job to job carrying out the daily duties of a professional painter. Most of my co-workers were friends so, it wasn't difficult to go to work each day. There wasn't really anything hard about the job. The best was quitting time when we would all get together and laugh and relax"
good,Learnt Six sigma
good,Work Place or Job was not Satisfactorial Because of So much Conflict Process on here.
good,Cummins was definitely beneficial to my machinery operation foundation.
good,"Cummins is a great company. However, you are required to work so many hours that you rarely have time for self. Working there you're constantly working a 7 day shift with over 12hrs a day which would be considered impossible but it was very much possible. Other than the strenuous hours, its a great company with awesome benefits."
good,"Good working opportunity, better technology and tools, poor, over-judgmental sometimes secretive management. Poor and biased Performance Review process. Great co-workers. Hardest part of work was dealing with senior internal customers and senior managers, Silos mentality. Enjoyable part of the job was job satisfaction and compensation."
good,I learned about welding and to be more skilled with my hands. the co-workers were very laid back.
good,"Cummins has other locations, but this location closed in 1987. Cummins makes engines and has both franchise and company stores in the United States."
good,"For years Cummins-Allison has been the leader in cash services processing technology. As the recession continued on and as the product offerings diminished, the opportunities have become increasingly challenging."
good,Cummins needs to bring technology and new equipment to the manufacturing process. People in general is nice and cooperative but work loads sometimes just overwhelming. Good salary and benefits
good,"Enjoyed my time here, however it does help to know someone here of a higher level to get contacts, better training and keep your job in time of reduncies."
good,They have there lay offs towards the end of each year and pick up again in spring. Job pays well higher than most places paid time off don’t except a lot of call offs
good,"The culture of diversity and inclusion is great - its not just during the onboarding, or on the walls, but you can see it in every day life.  There are lots of people working here who have many years seniority and are still positive, so that says a lot."
good,Cummins was an ok job; although they switched carriers during my time there. The work environment wasn't bad at all and the employees were great to work with.
good,"It’s a pretty chill job, just do your work and make sure your production is always on point. Respect the supervisors, and get your work done like you’re asked."
good,"I liked working there, but did not like 2nd shift hours , and that it was Union , with Dues that we had to pay up front. And was let Go after being ill with doctors excuse"
good,Can't say enough about benefits etc of the company. Houston location is hands down the most toxic work environment I ever dealt with. Gladly left what I had previously considered a dream job.
good,"To many product mixes, high volume production, too many quality issues on products. Exceesive delays in  corrective actions. Frequent hiring and lay offs."
good,La empresa se preocupa por que tengas un buen balance de vida y trabajo.
good,"Very demanding in terms of meeting goals "
good,"I thought the benefits of the company was great. They take great care of their interns. "
good,I was a service technician and the lead techs took me under there wing and taught me a lot...I was given the proper tools and education to be the best service tech possible
good,"Good pay, poor insurance. Do not pay(hourly employees) any more for jobs that have more responsibility. Require a degree for any exempt job even if you do the same equivalent position as a tech. Some jobs are very rewarding and fun while others are very fast paced and physically and emotionally draining. I have enjoyed most of my 10 years there but are a lot of opportunities to move around. Insurance was much better when I started company but quickly became (as local doctors say) the worst in county."
good,"Cummins is the best place to work in Columbus, because they practically own this town. I just wish they cared more about the people who grew up here, and plan to retire here - the ones who are paid hourly and are loyal to the company that most likely employed many of their past family members in the factory. Unfortunately, they are not loyal to them, and when they get the boot they are left with a few companies who don't pay much more than retail. If you want to work in an office 40 hours a week, and get great pay and benefits, I highly recommend Cummins. Just understand that there are different rules for hourly people vs salary people, and most managers don't have a clue. You have to watch out for yourself."
good,Becoming increasingly target driven within customer service/order management team.  Workload ever increasing whilst there seemed to be no signs of appreciation.
good,"Pros -"
good,So big that everyone just kicks their problems down the road to other departments.  Management is too disconnected from the workers and they rotate too often to care.
good,Good company to work for. They are well established with excellent management to guide employees. Day to day busy with new projects always on the horizon
good,"Poor Management, it's like you walking on egg shells there you can easily get wrote up for any little thing  if you`re not one of them that kiss up to management you are as good as gone. They bring you in as a temp work you six months and lay you off when it's close to your hire date,  I use to love going to work the morale is really down in that place. No I wouldn`t recommend anyone to go there!!!"
good,Not such a bad job they just don't care if you have family emergency goin on in your life or not you don't come to work they don't care they will let you go.
good,"The health benefits available to employees were great and employee-portion was reasonable. They also offered on site health screenings, plant nurse, gym and more for all shifts."
good,Cummins is a great company with long history and takes pride in its products. Has good leadership and vision but lacks mid level management that can support and drive the employees. Benefits could be better to keep employee retention high.
good,"Cummins was a decent company to work for. As an employee of the company, I never doubted their interest in community involvement. They go above and beyond to ensure they are good community partners."
good,"I just had the worst time with middle level management which oversaw the direct supervisors which were basically service writers, nothing more. I could not get over the time accountability process which was fraudulent because it was always changed by middle level or the service writers to make certain matrix measures change to get them out of trouble and that just reflects negatively on the hard working technician in the shop grinding out the work in a cramp and hot environment with lots of petty rules. This is the exact reasons why unions were formed back in the day to prevent the management overtaking the work environment and unfairly mistreating the working conditions. It's up to you to want to work in an environment like that because I work with a bunch of country boys who are are hard working 12-14 hour day type dudes and they begin to say dam this ain't right bubba. Well they began to see the plus side to union ways and reasons, just saying my experience from a union city kid from Baltimore. Take care."
good,"Good work life balance, company making progress after organizational changes, good culture, need to be proactive for career advancement,   benefits can be improved"
good,"I enjoyed the work and the pay, the management was decent and most of the coworkers were friendly, however, I didnt't really like the mandatory overtime much at all. I worked upwards of 52 hours every week and, having a child, wasnt able to see my son much at all. if your personal life and time allows, i think cummins is a very good place to work, but unless you really need the money, or are just bored all the time, i would not recommend."
good,Fast paced work and with lots of overtime.  Would work 60 hour weeks about 5-6 months a year.  We did get reviews and raised every year and yearly bonuses.
good,Could be better. The talents could be managed better. Since its a big company people are not paid a lot of attention to their satisfaction of work. Overall a decent Company
good,Its a good place if u need to learn systems at the starting of career. Six Sigma projects is one of the USP if you are associated with this organisation
good,"Great team of engineers and a company that was proud of it's  historically diverse work force. "
good,"good company with nice people ,My partner used  2306 ECM  on 2806 engine but never tell me so its was hard to know, till I hooked up the EST to find out."
good,"People are nice, Insurance is okay. Good hours, global exposure. Cyclical layoffs every year end and every 7 years due to economy downturn."
good,"I like interacting with people from different background and origins, put our different skills and knowledge to reach our respective goals and objectives."
good,"Good Company to work for."
good,"- Good opportunities for career advancement "
good,"Large, global matrixed organization driven by quarterly performance targets as key measure. Long history of quality products. Corporate headquarters in southern Indiana with power generation division based in Minnesota."
good,Two major lay-off operated by the same management. Most people got laid off were international student who would require sponsorship.
good,very good safety record and clean place to work supportive management . The most enjoyable part of the job is working with different type of turbo each day.
good,"Long, grueling hours.Constant flow of work. Coworkers were always willing to help when needed. Extremely warm temps in the summertime."
good,"•	Obtain new sales through bidding of projects, and sales of replacement generators, facility upgrades, etc."
good,the supervisors have there favorites and dont tend to help the ones they dont like. Not enough work for apprentices so they tend to throw you in the deap end and hope you dont mess up.
good,Cummins is a good place to work but can sometimes be very stuck in their ways and not willing to adapt to an innovative culture.
good,Cummins Research and Technology India was an R & D centre for Cummins group s.erving technical help all over world. It is Analysis led design center where most of Design part are analysed through Simulations.
good,"Cummins Southern Plains was a good place to work.  I learned a lot about the service and distribution industry.  The people were great and hardworking, whom I still keep in touch.  Since I have left, Cummins Inc. has taken over the distribution 100%, which was not the case when I worked there."
good,"Asistir al departamento medico para ver si es que se habia presentado algun incidente o accidente durante el segundo turno, en caso de que asi fuera; empezar a hacer la investigacion de como, porque, etc. paso el accidente/incidente."

good,Working with one of the top engines in the industry and leading the way in inovation
good,"A very good work place with excellent Co-workers, has always given first priority to learning. The only down side is the timings & the way they manage it"
good,A lot of on the job training. You can learn to deal with different personalities and time management.
good,Management is focused on their own personal growth and not their employees. Employees are asked to do a lot with little support. Typical weeks is 50 hours plus.
good,"Se genera un buen ambiente laboral. Con un buenas filosofias de trabajo."
good,too many people turning on each other getting people fired for stupid reasons
good,Good place to start career but limited Opportunities for advancement
good,"Even as Cummins grows, the culture is highly dependent on developing work relationships with others. One has to be sufficiently outgoing to reach out to others for information to get his/her job done. On the positive side, it gives a personal element to the work environment. On the down side, it can result in reduced efficiency when people are depending on others for key inputs. "
good,Company is really values its ethics code of conduct and transparency . Its really good for new people like freshers and programs like YMPD is really good.
good,"Working in my dept. of warranty, work is extremely hectic and stressful during the normal course of the day, as would be expected in a warranty call center. The company is a good company to work for in terms of advancement and career growth, if you're willing to settile in the small town of Columbus. Lots of meetings."
good,"I am having 12+ yrs of experience, I was worked with Cummins. I really enjoyed working with them"
good,"Everything is done using some kind of light machinery, for example forklifts and cherry pickers. You are timed on how fast you can get your order picked but your lift will shut off if you go too fast or bump into anything. Whenever I would ask how to get my rate up, nobody would help me especially Management who was more concerned with what was going on at the docks. It was very frustrating."
good,People that had never done the job were instructing us how to do it and they needed a little help. Just because you have been through the Lean training does not make you an expert.
good,"Pays really well and does offer a diverse workplace. Does offer a lot to the community. "
good,Over all it’s a nice job opportunity u get the learning and manufacturing experience That u will need there great benefits and much more to all apply at this job u are doing nothing wrong go for it
good,"Overall Cummins was a great place to work.  They invest in promoting from within, diversity and career planning.  They understand work-life balance better than any other company I have worked for.  Sometimes the wrong people are selected for leadership roles and can delay your individual growth plans."
good,They don't understand when people have disabilities and impossible to work when sugar 500 and 600. When ummm time up they won't even take Dr excuse even when Dr calls them herself.
good,"A great international company, offers a range of exposure and personal development. Right work environment promoted as part of their basic culture and principles"
good,In Cummins employees are empowered to take the decisions in order to achieve the desired target & achieve the Goal. Opportunities for Continuous learning is Very High.

good,"Great Place to work especially in terms of location. You can clearly understand value of people and how employee is focused on. "
good,"Great place to work"
good,"Ótimo salario, porém com pouquíssimas chances de efetivação."
good,"Cummins is a very large organization that has the good intent on always being there for the employees.  However, sometimes it does take a very long time to make ""improvements"" when needed.  For the most part, Cummins employees are enjoyable to work with and are afforded opportunities.  However, many ""hard workers"" sometimes get over looked, because like in a lot of big companies, there are ""politics"" involved."
good,The benefits plus the compensation was awesome. The working environment was fun friendly and great to work in. Always felt like a team member. Great business!
good,"Cummins is very demanding, it is a great place to work but it is important to not forget that your are still just a number, doesn't mater whet you do."
good,Very fast paced job with helping co-workers when they needed help to finish the line of production that they were asigned. Management was less than acceptable with team work
good,Even as a temp at Cummins I was making good money and I liked my employment there. Leads were very helpful along with quality control and Tech help. Production is a priority and just do your job and you will get the production numbers they are asking for. Over all The best company I ever worked at.
good,"Cummins is a very professional workplace and experience from, different people from different countries. Work was hard and stressing because of the task that needs to be done. but i learned a lot how to work under pressure and working with people from different background"
good,"Very nice job just can get hectic at times, some managers are understanding and some are not, very strict on policies but a good paying and beneficial job overall"
good,Overall great place to work with the exception of mandatory OT.  I worked more than 50 hours per week with only one weekend off per month.  If it weren't for that piece - I'd recommend.  Work life balance is non existent at Cummins.  Would have been happy with even and every other weekend schedule.  Way too many hours!!!!!!
good,"The job itself was great the work wasn't hard at all.The people that work there is the hardest thing about working at Cummins,everyone is in everybody's business, and it's alot of competition that goes on out there also and it has nothing to do with the engines smh"
good,Uma empresa que acrescenta muito na carreira devido aos desafios constantes e investimentos em conhecimento aos colaboradores.
good,"Very good place to work specially for female employees."
good,"The talent at Cummins is first rate, some of the most skilled people I've ever worked with.  Additionally, the level of diversity within the organization is tremendous, a real asset."
good,Enjoyed the analytical part of the work. Hard to reach broad conclusions because I do not have a background in engineering/electricity/engines/diesel etc.
good,"The summary says it all. This is an excellent place to work if you are actually hired in by the company, however the only way to get hired in is through a temp service. Alot of people are laid off shortly after being hired regardless of experience or work ethic."
good,"Get daily job assigned to you. Preform repairs, parts list writing, and computer skills. Learned how to work in a environment where there are many challenges and obstacles. Management helps with the directions for work load to be preformed."
good,"The work in the main was ok,I worked with some good people .However the tooling and the fact that the process on a lot of the stages didn't work made the job harder than it should have been .the salary was good but I always felt that redundancies were never far away"
good,Worked on a welding line in an assembly line.  It lacked the management needed to succeed or further get involved for any upcoming openings.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company.  I started as a temp and was there for 6 months before I got a full time position.  After hired full time, I spent another year there, however they let me go after I used an excessive amount of vacation days at the start of the new year.  They informed me that I didn't have the option to use them while on a probationary period."
good,"Days were very busy. Always something new going on.  All my co-workers were very nice, but the lack of training and poor management on some parts made it for a stressful work environment. Lots of policies and procedures to learn, But with a very large company that is to be expected."
good,"Company is growing but losing sight of the people that build the engines, focus is on the engineers and office."
good,"This was a tough job day in and day out."
good,"I work 12 hours everyday in any weather condition"
good,This company has a good management. Management is always in contact with the employees. Work culture is also its plus point
good,"Health and Safety comes first,"
good,"Great place to work. The employees work hard and like to have fun. They even have corn hole boards out in the break area that you can use on your breaks. "
good,It wasn't really the hardest job but the individuals there can make it that way. Without effective communication one can not strive.
good,"A empresa oferece muitos benefícios e possui uma "
good,"Best part of the job was the people skills that I developed. I learned a lot about generators and motors. The management was good at what they did, but didn't follow through with training and the schedule."
good,I enjoyed the position and my time with cummins but it was the job satisfaction that made my decision
good,I enjoyed the position however job satisfaction was not like it was back in Leeton NSW
good,"It is wonderful working at Cummins. The environment is very good and treat each employee with respect. Good culture,meaning full work. Equal oppertunity to women employees."
good,"There are some good processes for more established finance service lines, however, improvement is often slow. Also management is not helpful in developing your career, you have to figure it out yourself."
good,"More than any other aspect of your character, you can be the worst worker as long as everyone likes you’re golden.  It was a child like atmosphere as far as how people interact with one another, quite bizarre.  Good luck."
good,We started off with a meeting everyday for a minimum of 20 minutes to go over the amount of trucks we were expecting. A learned how to operate a forklift.
good,"schedules for work were posted late one day prior. they claim to promote from within, but the do not offer enough money for techs to move to manger so managers with no knowledge of the career field are in charge of techs with years of experience. would get discrepancy write ups for the smallest and easy to fix issues."
good,"There are many pro and cons for working at Cummins, I hate the bi weekly pay but work is not hard at all. Friendly people that  gives back to the community. Usually a 8 hour day but if overtime is needed there is no advance notice, you will be asked or told to stay 20 minutes before leaving time."
good,"I got put with a group who had never had an intern before. They didn't have anything planned for me and I was bored most of the time. It wasn't their fault, they didn't know what they were doing, just like me. All the other interns I met loved their jobs. There were lots of activities for interns, but I was a bit of a loner. I feel like it was my fault that I didn't have as good of a time as everyone else."
good,"If you're looking for a stable place to work and possibly retire, Cummins is great. The company is a good place to work but I believe there is room for improvement in HR related topics and also  compensation. The culture is changing to a more dynamic culture. In general I recommend this company."
good,"The Pay and Benefits are Great. However the overall job is not worth the hours of working 3rd shift. It was too stressful for me to balance my Home/Personal Life, Work Hours and Sleep."
good,Place was a great place for the most part. Friendly faces and attitudes. Was a very fast-pace place and very productive. Some great team work and leadership.
good,"I loved working at Cummins.  The overall environment for the division I was in was great.  There were a lot of good people that worked there in all levels, though there were some snakes in the upper management team."
good,"Its a good company to work for. However, management in my department lack infrastructure and accountability. If you wanna fly under the radar its not hard to do."
good,"Loved the actual job.  Not much room for advancement."
good,I love the job I would just like the management to be done better.  They don't treat employees fair.  I feel that they should have at least three shifts.  When you are on second shift you never know what time you are goin home
good,got screwed over. what can i say. had both supervisors quit because of a certain GM. the next couple days she has me pulled out of the field and sitting in her office. unloaded a extreme amount of BS on me and before i could even defend myself she tell me how she does not care what i have to say and how she doesn't want to hear it. a week later i was fired.
good,Cummins is an overall good company to work for. The hardest thing about the job is trying not to get any customer complaints. One of the best things is the diversity.
good,"Empresa moderna, utilizando as mais modernas tecnologias, ferramentas de gestão e processos, mas no Brasil, há muitas oportunidade de melhoria quando comparado com a matriz."
good,This job interacted with field technicians and customers that were experiencing issues with their engines.  This could start to wear on a person if you did not have a thick skin and realized that you are only hearing about a very small portion of the product in service that you represent.  The position does allow someone to learn a great deal about diesel engines.
good,"i enjoy the job and co-workers but there are not equal employment"
good,I enjoyed working for Cummins. They offer several incentives for different things and a wide range of benefits. One thing I did not like were the swing shifts and the long hours.
good,"Sadly, innovation is just a buzz word. Also, be prepared to do a lot of Six Sigma. The people who work for the company are fantastic. Management is pretty responsive to employees."
good,"Cummins being my 1st company, gave a comfortable environment to work in."
good,"Great learning environment, lots of traing opportunities and encourage leadership and promote innovation"
good,The factory trained tecnicians are highly skilled and ready to tackle any job.
good,"First I Learn here how maintane the reletion of every kind of employee. How manage the Fund of Society and Loan disbursement.etc."
good,"Rigorous learning, team members were helpful, good compensation and benefits"
good,"I enjoyed working there until I got laid off after getting an excellent end of year review. Good company, lots of experience and lots of opportunity. I would still be there enjoying my job if not for the recession."
good,While I was employed at Cummins Power Generation I was the face of Cummins when visitors or vendors would walk into the building the first person they would seen was me and the last person that they seen walking out of the building was me.
good,"Left on good terms. He was a great place to work, the environment and culture where good. A lot of teal players and everybody got along.  People came together as a unit."
good,"TEM seus pontos fortes e fracos. Nada de diferentes das outras empresas que trabalhei, com excessão dos beneficios e salario que eram melhores."
good,All around it has a great culture but the big picture is dollars not quality of work. Great management and good people to work with. Pay sucks and not advancement
good,good job but you gotta have a Harley Davidson bike to be in with the good ole boys or just be way better than anybody but this is a job for people with experience because management has their pics but the the techs and service guys are friendly but if u leave it up to them to certify u and give raises you might as well  be there for the rest of your life
good,"Trabajar con algo de presion debido a la entrega de los resultados en produccion a mi jefe directo"
good,"the office that I worked in was not aware that they were getting help, so they had very little work for me to do and I had to drag it out and take my time to make work."
good,"I was working at Cummins as a school to work employee. I was a datalogging, and instrumentation technician. I was only able to work 19 hours a week, and I could not advance in the company. I decided it was time to pursue a life long passion, and move to heavy equipment operating."
good,"Its a good compny for development. Working time 8 hours. More effective communication. Better security for woman's."
good,"Great people, good benefits. This company has gone through a major senior management transition which was badly needed."
good,"* Great warehouse management"
good,"a good place to start your career, you get to learn a lot and get introduced to different aspects of engineering. After couple of years, things tend to repeat themselves and get boring or tedious."
good,Great company to gain skills. Experience would have been more positive if not for management and HR representatives at the time. Managers can hinder an employee from advancement by blocking access to certification training and applications for other roles. Company is not transparent with business decisions.
good,The company is stable and has a well know product.  There are limited opportunities to advance with the company.
good,"A typical day may include going to service anywhere from 6 to 12 locations including banks, casinos, and armored cars. I have learned how to repair cash and coin counting equipment that I never knew existed and also how to manage time better. The co-workers are a great group of guys who are always helpful in a time of need. The management as far as for the service side is the best that I've ever had. The hardest part of the job is working on equipment that may or may not have problems just from a customer description of what the problem is. The most enjoyable part of the job is to spend time behind the windshield to get to places and also making people smile when the problem is fixed."
good,Most of the time in a work day is spent being reactive to situations rather than proactive. Less than sufficient staffing and low wages lead to poor morale and unnecessary frustration in the workforce. Promotions are taken to obtain a higher salary because annual wage increases are very minimal. Employees with tenure are gradually movng on to other companies for more rewarding opportunities. The most difficult part of the job is maintaining a positive attitude. Diligent and highly productive employees are rewarded with more responsibilities / duties without commensurate compensation. The most enjoyable part of the job is working from home.
good,A lot of focus on strategic goal execution and continuous improvement. Emphasis on six sigma and initiatives to drive KPI based improvements in all pillars of quality
good,"i have a good experience for managing everything,  the staff and the worker are very friendly and appreciate for our task, if we have any kind of mistake thy guide us, and also team work."
good,"Cummins is Very good company for carrier .all work is already defined in sop . given the preference for safety and employee development . Work as team ,we enjoyly done the work .good management ,preference given 1st for women's safety .knowledge improvement , arranged fun activities, games,projects for employees. We easy express our ideas and knowledge in kaizen .Cummins is good place for women's ."
good,"Cummins is a good place to start out at right out of college.  They are a safe conscience place, train their employees well and get you up to speed quickly. However, advancement opportunities can be lacking."
good,"Cummins in 2014 was an excellent place to work, came in, did your job and went home, then all of a sudden corporate cummins takes over, my job went from managing the shop to setting behind my computer doing all the stuff they thought ought to be done in the corporate world, not in western ks!!"
good,"La electromecanica enesta empresa ayuda al crecimiento profesional de quien brinde sus servicios, gran ambiente laboral y de aprendizaje."
good,You will get extensive training on every Cummings engine model and great advice from seasoned mechanic on how to go about making repairs quicker and faster to get great standard repair times.
good,"  I am presently working on engine Crankshaft Structural analysis. My present work profile is listed below."
good,"Cummins has a great, nurturing environment that's perfect for any new graduate."
good,"Some departments have a great work culture and some don't. The company is a big supporter on individual growth, but not every manager cares if you grow or not."
good,Great company to work for. It has a very strong sense of diversity and they make you feel comfortable working there. I was working at a manufacturing facility so working hours were not the best. Minimum 12 hour work days and sometimes had to return at night to complete work. Work-life balance at a manufacturing facility is pretty much non-existent. Salary was great as well as compensation with benefits. I just feel like they could strongly improve on the work-life aspect of the company. If you get placed to work at a facility you are pretty much screwed.
good,"A lot of growth, great company but compensation does not match the level of work and or employee experience."
good,"running parts on the assembly line, I have learned a lot of new station trained on all assembly lines.  We have great management here its a great company to work for.  Co workers are very motivating easy to working.  the hardest part is to stay focus and inspect every part that's on the assembly line.  the most important job is my benefits."
good,.El dia de trabajo es normal
good,"its work culture , its flexible hours, are good about the company. the work culture is in such a way that it helps in work life balance. it is friendly."
good,I didn't have a good experience with my manager in the summer. He was not good to me and even the chief marketing officer noticed that i did not have a good manager
good,"Great learning environment with professional management. Challenging to meet deadlines and to meet  great customer satisfaction, yet the experience is very rewarding."
good,"Great company but local management is impossible to work for. Managers manipulate numbers and have no ethics."
good,Management is not keen to their employees needs. Work goes unappreciated by department leaders and plant management. Projects are followed loosely until they eventually reach completion or until another issue takes priority. Structure is lacking.
good,"This company needs all the supervisors to communicate together. Other than that the company as a whole is good. Need to explain to workers what exactly is their job duties when the are considered a ""Float"""
good,"I am currently handling spares parts sales to key accounts like AMW, tata motors & Volvo eicher. "
good,Many Management Team were not good leadersthey would stab you in the back and would not look twice. Co- workers are very munipulative
good,"Great benefits but work/home balance is not at all considered in some roles. "
good,"work was mostly enjoyable ,and most of the people are great, the culture is quality driven and the workplace is clean but congested,and quite fast paced. The management changes frequently and this causes lack of communication and other issues, including employee turnover. The companys core values and ethics are very inspireing although not followed at the Elkhart facilty the rest of the corporation is a very fine example of the best a company can be"
good,I have been responsible for managing multiple accounts and coordinating with planners to get parts for my distributors while also taking calls from distributors.  The most enjoyable part of this job is being able to help people when they need it most.
good,"I worked as a manager for Cummins. I had a great team that worked for me. My manager was terrible. He was the Material flow manager in Rocky Mount , NC."
good,"slechte werksfeer.."
good,"Cummins hires great people.  They are Management heavy.  The health insurance the company provides has very high deductibles, and the the coverage only covers 80-20 until the 20% equals another high yearly limit.  The dental insurance is adequate. Great retirement benefits"
good,we would go from city to city selling tools was a good place to work just not enough pay
good,"Overall the company is good the problem was  job security issued "
good,"My time at Cummins was a great experience, i learned alot of different things that i could use in my future endeavors. From becoming a certified painter to becoming a licensed forklift operator within the company."
good,"Good workforce, treat well by management, trained to move parts around the factory. all areas of the factory was easy going and friendly. unfortunately, the company closed down."
good,Cummins is a fast paced work environment that expects the highest quality work and customer service from their employees. The expectations for the jobs make for a stressful work day. Management tends to be stressed constantly due to company goals set by upper management teams.
good,to many  inexperience workers first time job workers bused in hard to train and work with at the volume they were coming in at and with them knowing they had no job security
good,"Nice componey I am happy to working with it "
good,"Enjoyed working for CA for the greater part of my first 7 years. Changes within made work more difficult and support was lacking from management. Small mistakes and minor quibbles became crimes of the century. Cummins is an overall great company; the Seattle branch is a ""soup sandwich""."
good,"I worked with this company twice. the first time I changed jobs due to management issues, the second time, they  asked me to come back.  after about a 2 years new management came in .  We were moving into a new building. I coordinated the movement of all of the storeroom parts, helped design the new lay out for the new storeroom, Entered all the new locations in the computer. After all was complete. I was laid off. . "
good,"No reason to get into specifics. I worked hard, did an exemplary job, was paid reasonably well for the level of work performed. For the most part, the people I worked with were fine people and I have enjoyed working with them."
good,A empresa está reduzindo os benefícios para todos os funcionários e a base salarial para os novos funcionários
good,I enjoyed working here the fact it is like 3-5mins drive away from my home. You could have build a career in this workplace but unfortunately I didn't get absorbed in. So they end my assignment after several months of working here.
good,fun job to bad i had to move out of town and find a new job but over all it wasnt bad at all nice people and great benifits as well.
good,This facility has pretty old machines and management's expectation is to make most out of it that makes employee's life miserable.
good,Great work environment. Lots of perks. Fitness room. Flex hours was a plus. Employees were able to take different classes to further their skills.
good,"I was there an OPS engineer."
good,"Job security bad "
good,"When I first started it was a great place to work but as the years went, so did all of the good parts about it. Management was shifted, departments were scrambled and suddenly orders were in high volume. Very stressful."
good,Uma das melhores empresas para se trabalhar na região.
good,Looking for a new job to spend more time living life instead of working every time I wake up and just come home to go to bed and repeat over and over I want to feel like I’m actually doing something for  someone who appreciates it.
good,I was happy at Cummins while the original owner was in charge. They had a customer driven policy which was a positive force as an example to the rest of the company.
good,"i worked at Cummings for a number of years , there was a disconnect between the branch i worked at and home office in Tennessee. for example when we had a major economy issue the automotive department suffered greatly managers where all leaving and they assigned a ceo to assist that ceo never showed up and no one questions anyone it was over looked instead the branch suffered due to the fact that another Tennessee ceo made things worse and had no clue how to operate in the territory we where in .the numbers specifically should trending ..."
good,Production focused
good,"Good Company to Work with . People Friendly Company."
good,"Coming in as an intern now, you will have ample opportunity to advance and grow. Benefits are competitive and so is the culture. Education and community involvement are a major focus."
good,Dynamic working Conditions. Challenging environment. Good Facilities for Employees. But Job Security is almost Nil. Too much Internal politics. Work rotation is good.
good,"Ao decorrer dos ultimos tempo houve muitas mudanças para se ajustar ao mercado, com isso houve uma perda de foco na gestão de pessoas , e unificação de áreas da engenheiro adicionando competência de gestão a pessoas com pouca expertise nesse tipo de desafio."
good,"I have worked here for many years.  It is located an hour away from Indy which is sometimes challenging but the company is a great company that cares about employees, community and environment alike"
good,the daily task were simple however management changes positions every two years and they are always trying to leave thier mark on the company.
good,"Organisation is very good, working in regular shift wise, management is good,but not secure  job in this organisation, salary not growth in this organisation,"
good,Cummins being the first company has taught me loads of things which I will remember through out my life and definitely it will help me to grow.
good,"I witnessed 3 seasons in one day. The sun was shinning then, it rained then, it snow. "
good,"Fullen Dock and Warehouse is a small family owned business.  Enjoyed working there, but no room for advancement.  Accounts Receivable Specialist was very demanding.  Also had to make creditor calls, make sure whole office was cleaned every Wednesday, make the weekly run to Sams for office supplies, toiletries, kitchen things, etc.  Had one c0-worker, she was great.  We got along very well.  two bosses in the office.  Office Manager and the Manager over the ship yard.  Both were nice."
good,"I enjoyed working for Cummins, however I would highly recommend not working for Cummins as a contractor as you are highly expendable and will not be treated equally to exempt employees."
good,Cummins India Limited has a very good culture and gives excellent learning for freshers.
good,"A Good Place to Work. Got to meet alot of nice people, had fun in Coimbatore. I worked for one of the best companies in the world as a safety intern for 3 months this past summer, where I accomplished several different things. I implemented recycling programs that helped save the company money, improve the quality of personal protective equipment for employees, and lower the amount of hand injuries in the plant exponentially. I also reviewed, analyzed, and modified the company policies regarding personal protective equipment, hazardous chemical handling, and hazardous communication. In addition to those accomplishments I frequently observed and helped train new employees for different positions in the company; this included electrical certification training, powered industrial vehicle training, and fit test respirator training."
good,Growth for external candidates.depends only on Boss. No manager feedback. Transparancy is low. It doesn't make what knowledge you carry one representation matters
good,"Lots of overtime available and a great opportunity to make money, but a lot of chaos that seems to be coming from higher up. Not a lot of time off and schedule changes from week to week made it a bit frustrating."
good,Corporate views continuously forced on employees.  Products are pushed out the door instead of developed in a proper amount of time with adequate resources.
good,Cummins was a great company when I started with then in 1999.  Most employees will agree that the culture has declined significantly.  It is not the place to work it used to be.
good,"Cummins is a wonderful company, however, shortly after I began work there, they were purchased by another branch and the old manager was replaced and made a traveling salesman.  New manager was also a new hire but managed a store 1 1/2 hours away in addition to this one.  For over a year the company was in a state of flux and not managed well at all."
good,"Ambiente agradável de trabalhar."
good,Falta d organizacion en servicios d reparacion y garantia.
good,The company is an overall solid company. But management has issues on company direction. Old manaufacturing company needs a major face lift.
good,The workers have fun sometimes cutting jokes with each other. You drive power Equipment up and down ailes picking boxes for orders to put on skids to ship out to customers.
good,"Average pay with an opportunity for lots of overtime. The majority of management is sub par. Benefits are essentially nonexistent. Very Diverse with opportunities for tuition reimbursement, and career advancement."
good,"The job that you were expected to preform was a good one, great training was given to in sure you were doing your job correctly, branch manager at the time and day time shop foreman, had there own personnel click, of people, if you got on there bad side, they had shop meeting on how to get ride on tech, that they decided that they did not like, for what ever reasoning, When management is having these type of meeting, they should really try and make sure it is not heard by other shop employees."
good,"safety is talked about as a value, but production is numbers are more prevalent to management. employees are passionate about their work; many great people to work with."
good,I liked that this employer allowed to to make my way through the plant learning every area to better my ability to be versetile when needed. I was disappointed I was layed off and given no other reasons for this event.
good,"Cummins é uma empresa de grande dinamismo, que visa a produção em larga escala e ainda assim consegue realizar trabalhos sociais para as comunidades que moram em seu entorno."
good,"Company provides great opportunities for individual development. But no clear path for career steps so it is waste of time and resource. Management focusing on measurement (everything is focusing on GREEN-YELLOW-RED) and Regions or LOBs are generally focusing on their own targets, rather than global. Poor driven key organisational changes and on going journey from a Multi-National company to a Global company."
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo."
good,Passionate about managing people and bringing out the best in everyone against tight deliverables. Also enjoyed nurturing business relationships and increasing the customer base.
good,"- Comum foco diário em atividades surpresa com a necessidade de trabalho alem do horário para manter suas atividades sob controle. Muito foco na ocorrência das atividades em detrimento a causa raiz."
good,"Overall very solid company"
good,"I learnt a lot during my two years there, people were very supportive, helpful and friendly."
good,"Worked only part time but, was still laid off, instead they gave my position to the original girl and she in turn was putting in time and the half on Saturdays to complete assignments. Made no sense to me. Overtime???? I was not receiving benefits or insurance or overtime, go figure????"
good,good place to work good benefits pay ins't the best at first but you work up to better. the people that work their are stuck in the past it seems though management is lacking but not as bad as most places would work hear again.
good,"Overall a good company.  Business is very cyclical.  Nice quiet location, in a small town of Columbus, Indiana.  No need to deal with traffic like big cities."
good,"I enjoyed Cummins and was sorry to leave as I never wanted to, good pay and overall good lads to work with. The downside is your team leader has your career in their hands. Great if you know them from outside work or forge a friendship at work. You may be lucky and have a fair one but the chances are you'll see other given contracts, better trained and kept on, who are not deserving."
good,"Most applicants have strong motivation and/or work ethic to start out with. Then when the veil drops, you may find your motivation to suffer from substandard management practices, accountability problems, and the issues related to a primarily liberal-run company, more worried about offending others rather than putting funding into newer technologies ventures to be competitive."
good,"Enjoyed working in Cummins"
good,"There are many good things about this company such as work life balance and allowing employees access to the correct tools for the job, but they change directly very slowly. That includes if there is a bad direction coming down the pipeline."
good,"Great work life balance, focused on internal employee development. Provides growth opportunities and challenging work assignments. Organization is evolving in terms of technical product development."
good,Cummins is a great place to work with strong value systems and involved leadership. The best part of working at Cummins is having very employee friendly policies with safety being the first & foremost priority.
good,Cummins is one of the Best Company in the world. Every technical people are interested to work them and me too. if I get an offer from Cummins India will be lucky.
good,If get an oppurtunity again then will definetly looking forward to join it. More concern about Clean and Safe working environment. They properly follow TQM techniques.
good,"El trabajo no es complicado, se trabaja con estrategias, los compañeros son respetuosos"
good,"Cummins Western Canada is a great place to work. Unfortunately, corporate in the US decided to lay off, and I was a casualty. I would have enjoyed to continue working here had I been given the opportunity."
good,"aprendes mucho continuamente, hay mucha colaboracion entre compa;eros y entre departamentos."
good,"La intención de la cultura de la empresa es buena, sin embargo la gente que trabaja ahí generalmente es gente arrogante, la Gerente de Materiales sumamente intolerante, ponía demasiada presión en su gente."
good,"Only worked there for a short time, but the office environment was very comfortable. Colleagues and management were very polite and helpful. Were just starting to build the ITC program in India though, which was strange for a company that had been long established in India."
good,Lo que más me gustó de la empresa es en ámbito laboral la experiencia que gane y los buenos trabajadores que me ayudaron a surgir y mirar la mecánica de otro puto de viste con sudor y ganas me gusta la mecánica cada día mas
good,"This place is very good money, but you are working around the clock sometimes two weeks straight without a day off so you see them more than you see your family."
good,"The days went by fast due to staying busy.I always had something to do thats what I liked about it.  My supervisor was the coolest he joked with the employees, But when it was time to get the work done we got it done."
good,"Good company to work for although management at times leaves much to be desired. If employees would take the time to learn their jobs and safety procedures, it would make all jobs much easier. Taking time away from my job to help fellow employees, at times, really hurt my production."
good,"A reasonable place to work , could be dangerous with over head travelling cranes moving heavy engines up and down the line .other wise a good place to work ,I enjoyed working there . overall rating would be eight out of ten ."
good,great place to work I hate reviews that require you to submit a certain amount of words. this should not be a requirement to continue my submission. fix this
good,"Productive place of work. Well run. Hours were good, very clean work environment,  temperature was always cool, safety first was a huge commitment on their part."
good,"The company is one of the best places to work. diversity and inclusion , team work, volunteer service to help the community and other good experiences make this company the best place to work."
good,Empresa boa mais os funcionários sem reconhecimento profissional.
good,"The over all Experience we great I loved the people I worked with, the only think I didn’t like about this place was things were not  organized everything was all over the place."
good,This is a job that could also be a considered as a career. Cummins certifies employees on various PIT machines (stand up and sit down forklifts). There’s also multiple positions available here to learn and grow with.
good,There was a major lack of training for the job and the employers promised promotions that they will not help one obtain. The health safety and environment team seemed to be more concerned with there certifications and safety training then actual safety issues.
good,"Cummins was a good job ,it just appeared to us that there was a lot of internal issues with upper management ,to many bosses . at my time of employment it was Cummins mid south and there was always issues within the group ."
good,"Job trainning was good,good saftey,and people were friendly,I held over 60 jobs in a 30 year  period,alot of layoffs and cut backs,contract changes made it better working conditions and more room for advancement."
good,good money just long hours. I really did enjoy working there but you just work too much. You hardly ever get to see your kids and mine are still somewhat small.
good,Employee engagement level is high. Good place to work. Encourages participation and learning. Team work is appreciated. Diverse culture is encouraged.
good,Implementation of company's policies were not in consistant with the stated policies. Too much travel and and frequent re-location. Very poor  product support net work.
good,A good company for work for because of their reputation in the industry and offered a conducive work environment. You get to work with people of diverse backgrounds and race.
good,"I only worked at Cummins one summer as an intern, however the employees that I worked with were very smart and eager to help you learn and further your career."
good,"Love my job, but leadership is poor, we could overloaded with units needing work but not allowing overtime to get jobs done and satisfy the customer.  Large worldwide company but price of the healthcare does not reflect it."
good,Relaxed and comfortable culture.  Very high margins which made for a less stressful workplace.  Clean and organized work place with some very nice people
good,International work culture.  You will get the chance to interact with many foreign delegates. Platform to judge yourself in huge organisation with multiple entities.
good,I was welding at cumins and the factory was so hot they wouldn't even let me get water! i was in hospital 2x a week of dehydration. if you are thinking of applying here i would get in production or assembly.
good,"My typical work day at Cummins is when I would get my assignment for the day and I would just get to work.  My fellow workers were fun to work with and I was able to get along with them.  It was like a family setting.  We worked real well together and were to the work seem easy, we had fun and it wasn't stressful at the job."
good,"Manage multiple scrum teams  belongs to the ART (Agile Release Train)."
good,great place to work and nice co workers to be around. We had company sorts games and awards to cerebrate our hard work. I had a fun and great experience while i was at the facility in Arlington
good,Overall the people are easy to get along with but some of the do push your buttons but the job is easy to learn and a good place to work if you like alot of over time
good,"Since I have not worked there in over 23 years, it is difficult to review my employment @ Cummins. But as I recall, I did like the job and enjoyed my time working there"
good,Very good work culture with good work life balance.
good,"Great place to work. Have made many friends that I enjoy hobbies with outside of work. Hours are good, work most every weekend in my area but the work is fairly easy. Management is too many Indians, not enough chiefs."
good,Working here gave me extra experience in customer service and satisfaction. It help me to become extremely organized and to always keep myself on top of my tasks.
good,"Not a huge fan of micromanagement, but things get crazy quickly."
good,"Cummins culture is very relationship based. The people - even very top executives - are approachable and always willing to help. Grabbing lunch with a president of the company is very common place is not frowned upon as favor-seeking. Overall, Cummins is a great place to work."
good,"Fast pace warehouse, strong flow of profuct, goals to meet and strong company values. Enjoy working with a team and having everyone help one another to meet goals."
good,Good place to work. Good Hours and good people. there benefits weren't bad. the jobs were easy and easy to learn. very clean and always getting new equipment.
good,It was a good company to work for.  I had a bad experience from having a previous injury cause me to be able to do the requirements for the job but I know many people who have enjoyed working there for a long time.
good,"You can manage many tools and learn a lot. "
good,"Experienced business professional working for a global multi billion dollar organization. Highly motivated, creative and analytical thinker with varied experience in Engineering, Business Development and Sales roles."
good,"They pride themselves on career advancement and diversity. With the right leadership in place, career advancement and development is possible. Most employees love their job, but dealing with leadership makes it impossible to stay long-term. "
good,"A typical day at work, I would arrive, be briefed and take my position."
good,"If one would get to work and start right away at an accurate manner, the hands on working status of the day would be finished very quick and the rest of the day would be  very relaxed."
good,"I was employed through Manpower to work at Cummins. I enjoyed getting paid every-week but employees of Manpower, I felt wasn't treated like a Cummins hired employees. They had paid time-off, were as we, had to work a constituent 90 days to earn only 1 day off which was unpaid. Also at the end of the year Cummins employees get paid for the absence of the Christmas break, while Manpower didn't."
good,"Company was a great place to work, but was in constant transition. My job duties were changed on a month to month basis. I had 5 different supervisors/managers."
good,You come across pockets of technical expertise which you can enjoy.  Corporate culture is nice. Nicely developed quality system for all phases of projects in new product introduction.
good,"A departmental restructure forced myself and six other colleagues of mine into a layoff/severance.  I was at Cummins for less an one year before HR gave me a severance letter stating my last day with the company would be December 31st.  However, they did provide a two month severance package which was generous but did not keep my job.  I was hoping to advance my career at Cummins, unfortunately it did not work out as I hoped.  Very disappointing."
good,very busy most of the time with friendly people lots of work to do every day very clean learn alot of different machines and alot of quality and safety
good,"Not being micromanaged, it gives me the opportunity to be as creative in my work as possible."
good,"Good experience at a pretty good company.  No complaints.  Salary starting out of college was decent, but yearly raises based off performance made it very competitive over my 6.5 year career."
good,"Excellent process driven organisation, world class business process, employee caring, posing ample growth learning enhancement opportunities."
good,"I haven't worked here in 6 years so hard to say if the culture has changed, but very quickly went from a family feel type company to a corporate feel very quickly."
good,"I really enjoyed working at Cummins and was very sad to leave due to redundancy. The people are what made it very enjoyable, even at the busiest and stressful times. I loved the variety of work I had within my role and I have gained a lot of knowledge in the 14 years I worked there."
good,Work at Cummins was repetitious and never changed. We did the same job every day for the same time over and over again with very little fulfillment in the work day and zero pleasure in the work as well.
good,"A typical work day at Cummins Pacific involved opening and closing work orders, filing warranty claims, dispatching field service technicians, renting Cummins generators, and updating customers on their vehicles in the shop. I learned about the Cummins Power Generation product line, Cummins engines and different points of failure while filing warranty claims, and the parts ordering process while working with technicians to get the job cpompleted in a timelt manner. Management was alwats supportive and there to provide assistance. The most difficult part of the job was working after hours to get the customer taken care of. The best part of the job was seeing the customer leave thje facility happy with their Cummins product working like new."

good,"I really enjoyed working for Cummins. I learned a lot about the company's dedication to making first class products. The intense testing and follow-up on defects was overwhelming. The roughest part was working 10 to 14 hours a day preparing reports and attending meetings between suppliers, analysis labs, and applications engineers. The protocol for changing drawings and specifications was very demanding but necessary. The nitrogen oxide sensor that I worked on was supplied by a company that was  truly dedicated to solving the many problems that seemed to plague this product. It was enjoyable to work with this supplier."

In addition to those accomplishments I frequently observed and helped train new employees for different positions in the company; this included electrical certification training, powered industrial vehicle training, and fit test respirator training."
good,"Overall a good company in terms of management, but can be hit or miss. Stability is marginal at best 3 major layoffs in last 5 years. Culture is friendly but group mentality is working less than 10-12 hrs a day is slacking. Lots of bureaucracy which means stacks of paper work for small changes. Good opportunities to move up or to another roll. Locations are less than ideal. Compensation is average, and benefits are nothing special."
good,Great place to work until new leadership came in and started making changes to the workforce and the environment
good,The most enjoyable part of my job is the people I work with. There isnt anythng hard about my job there.

good,"Fast paced work environment with plenty to learn, problem solve, and train along with daily activities. I can't even to begin to tell you what I have learned other than a ton....I achieved my BSBA, worked with engineering extensively. Most people are great to work with with an open mind and willing to help and most all areas of Cummins provides excellent training. Probably the most difficult part of all of the positions I have held is that each entity operates under its own set of cultures and values and which does not flow consistently through the organization. Some areas have very well thought out training plans whiles others you have to search for information to do your job effectively. Training others and meeting new people was very enjoyable. I felt much gratification in finding a weak area and developing it into a first class functioning area/department."
good,Uma experiencia boa de agregar novos conhecimentos

good,For the most part good place to work.
good,I will always look back at my experience working at Cummins as a fond one. Though my personal life was a train-wreck at that time I could never complain about my job. I went further in one year than many employees before me had excelled in 3 years it was all about timing. That's not to say that cummins provides room for growth and to move up the ladder in a variety of fields. When working with Cummins I always looked forward to going to work each day!
good,Cummins is a good place to work. The are soo many learning opportunites for growth. Leaders and managers are always willing to help their subordinates succeed in whatever they are doing.
good,The company is a great company to be a part of however the people that work for the fuel systems is another thing.  There is too much of the good ole boy mentality.  So when trying to hold people accountable can be a challenge and can be detrimental to your job security.
good,"It has been a while since I worked there. A review would be out dated."
good,"A typical day at work. What I learned. Management. Workplace culture, safety, safety, safety. The hardest part of the job. The most enjoyable part of the job."
good,"En la parte donde trabajaba, era un lugar cerrado y quemaba residuos y no tenía buen sistema de ventiliación"
good,"Work on call 24/7 for two weeks then completely off for a week. The two weeks on were very demanding and could range from working 20-80+ hours depending on the work load. Lots of travel over long distances at anytime of day/night  and occasional out of the country trips. Mostly work in very hot engine rooms and is very physically demanding. The people are great, the pay is pretty good and having every third week off is awesome. If you don't mind sacrificing work-life balance for two weeks, can physically deal with the job and work with minimal supervision then go for it."
good,3rd shift starts at 11pm. We have a nightly team meeting. We get our assignments and go to our stations. That maybe end of line or loading trucks or tugging.
good,"It is a manufacturing company and Data Science is not a primary focus. Lot of management issues and work culture is not as smooth. However, benefits and freedom to choose work is good in mid-west area"
good,"Great culture, a lot of development opportunities and cross functional experience.  Only down side is there is a '2 year' no movement rule, where you can't move to another position within 2 years.  There are ways around this but in the end it is down to your manager."
good,"It is a pretty good place to work if you want to live in the or near the Twin Cities.  You come to work, perform your duties and then go home. I really enjoyed the people that worked with and for the most part it was a pretty good job.  The local managers all seemed great and you felt like they cared about you but in the long run you are just a number to the Cummins Corporation."
good,"A good experience ,it was like other places you take the good with the bad and hope the good outweight thebad .the employee was great , had a blast , went to work for myself."
good,En esta empresa solo dure 3 meses ya que fue cerrada por momentos que paso de crisis.
good,"Every day I enjoyed my time at work and had nice co-workers and a reasonable workload. I was working as a contractor under Aerotek, and was paid very fairly every Wednesday. They trained me for what I needed to do and let me work at my own pace. The only downside is that my contract ended abruptly and without warning. which caused significant financial strain."
good,good company lots for employees the only real negative issue was management. plant manager's year and no one keep there word lots of broken promises and way too much favoritism
good,"Cummins is a decent place to work. The pay and benefits are fair. The people are cool. Everyone on the shop floor is united in their hatred of management and an antiquated, rigid business model."
good,"Através da Cummins conquistei várias certificações, principalmente como de Black Belt em 6Sigma."
good,"Work environment was great among co workers, management could of been better. Favoritism was a problem with management which led me to eventually leave. I was there for four years and was denied four promotions."
good,"Great company with poor management. The branch I worked for was small so versatility was key. I did power generation, high horsepower, OTR, etc. Fast paced but the management was just that a boss not a mentor."
good,"Very long hours required for certain projects so hard work,  also fun and a great place to work and develop. Plenty of scope to progress within the management team."
good,"for the amount of work, pay could be better."
good,This department was very organized and structured. My two supervisors were very smart and I can't remember a time in which I was steered wrong or given incorrect information as it related to the job I was performing.
good,"Every company has pros and cons. Cummins is a very strong and stable company to work for. Job opportunities are out there but it is hard to get noticed for headquarter's jobs if you are at another location. Some work place locations are family oriented and genuinely care, some are not."
good,Great company with relatively fair work life balance. Big on diversity and international expansion. Compensation was at or slightly above industry average.
good,"Work at Cummins is always challenging and company promotes work life balance also in the mean time.  "
good,Overall good company not very sure about my branch doing alot of work that u are not hired to do been a service advisor for 10+ years and never did some of the things I was asked to here cleaning daily safety reports monthly saftey aduits overall love the company not so much my branch

good,"Productive, Cummins Business System, Management was fair. Work place culture was different depending on what area you worked. No hard part of the job just staying busy for the entire shift.The most enjoyable part of the job was customer satisfaction."
good,"Boa empresa para se trabalhar. Boa estrutura, ambiente agradavel."

good,Cummins is a good company to work for where a wide scope of opportunities are available to grow as technical expert or administration. Continuous education program help employees to learn and widen skill sets.
good,I have a job that requires a lot of skill in my department. I use tools to extract pieces from parts. I also make sure parts are identified correctly.
good,"Relacionamento entre colaboradores bom;"
good,"At first it was great to work with this company as it was kind of smaller at the time.  All business was conducted within a certain mile radius but whenever they transitioned to a more regional outlook, things went downhill for me anyway.  It was not fun having to tell customers they didn't get the parts they ordered because the warehouse couldn't keep up with the demand.  Also when I had first started management was very understanding and a family first type atmosphere.  Management changed and also the atmosphere of family first.  Management was the number one determining factor on why I left the company."
good,This was a Temp position and my second time at this employer. Staff is very friendly and positive to work with. The global aspect of the company was the best part
good,"A empresa tem uma rotina agitada, aprendi muito sobre motores e geradores a diesel, ótima relação com os colegas."

good,"It hardcore R&D work."
good,I was let go from Cummins in November of 2015.  I was always rated as a good employee.  Cummins management needs some help as far as how to handle the ups and downs of business as they lay people off and hire new people at the same time incuring separation cost and hiring costs at the same time instead of just redeploying these people into the areas were they are needed.
good,Over all management is good. I have learnt so many things in company. at cummins health safety and environment culture is very good for employee. they are maintaining regional and gender diversity.
good,Cummins is a great place to work and a place where volunteering is allowed to help the community. It was a great place to work and would work there again.
good,"It was nice working culture,"
good,Management was good to its employees. workdays were long and workload was a little high. Healthcare plan was not very good. Most enjoyable part of the job was the cool engines you were around.

good,"Cummins is a very good company to work. Specially for female employees, it gives extra attention to all female employees."
good,The learning through experience helps not only the employees to grow and gain working knowledge of various fields but also ensures 100% utilization of talent to extract benefits for the company. Such a mutual relation that is established is advantageous to the organization and employees alike.
good,"Great culture, but HR has a very heavy grasp on engineering affairs. Quite a bit of bureaucracy. Co-workers are great, pay and benefits are ok."
good,We can learn new things daily and used to work on lot of technologies which provides insights of business. Helping customers in fixing the issues and apply security implementations of code.Code changes and upgrade to done with proper approvals and standardizing the process.

good,"Pro: Fantastic onboarding and training processses"
good,Need better pay and work fewer hours. I currently only get 3 or 4 days off a month. The culture there is wonderfully diverse. Potential for growth is there. Aid to go back to college is there.

good,Cummins has been a great place to work. I have learned so much there about there on highway product. Love the people I work with. The only down fall is they don't pay you what your worth. I think it's only the branch I work at is like this. Over all a great place to work.

good,"dit bedrijf is zeer goed al krijg je na enkele jaren wel de delfde problemen te zien die je in elk bedrijf tegenkomt: eentonigheid, vriendjespolitiek, te politiek correct tot op het punt dat het storend begint te worden."
good,it was a pretty nice job to work sometimes it would be kind of slow but other than that energy was great majority of the time people treated you with respect no matter what
good,"Seemed fair and impartial.  Several interviewers, rotating questions across a wide range of topics, including safety, teamwork, motivation and experiences."
good,Good company but no room for advancement.Those that are in higher level positions do not move around and leaves very few opportunities to move in to a higher level position.
good,My time Matter time it commas was exciting with with allow the up's and down's not own our pause it but company. The management wasn't always great tbut upper management was better at times but a lot of times they did make the company feels like they actually didn't care about the floor employees.
good,"Nice place to work, great office space, friendly and team oriented employees. Company has strong values and attributes. Very well structured. Overall very reputable company to work with."
good,"I was given an opportunity to work as a CO-OP for Cummins after my first year of college. It gave me a good idea what to expect in the real world. I was given typical low level job tasks, but I was also exposed to a corporate environment and how it functions."
good,GM had some issues with follow through. Personnel were stand-offish and too self protective at my location. Great job but personnel sucked...…………………………………………….
good,"Very good job, good teaches, easy to drive the forklift with big spaces and good tools to make the job."
good,"A cultura organizacional é boa, é um bom lugar para se trabalhar se você tiver a sorte de ter um bom líder."
good,"se lleva un ambiente ameno, aun que no relajado para la realizacion de las actividades en conjunto"
good,"There was upheaval in the way the Sales and Service division was managed and organized.  This was not intentional and a result of Cummins trying to grow the business. During this time there were a lot of stressful changes that veterans of the company resisted. That made it difficult for people, like myself, who were asked to lead some of these changes."
good,"I worked at Cummins for 26 years and I enjoyed most of the time with the people and company. Cummins made me the manager I'm now."
good,Empresa muito dinâmica com muita exigência e urgência nos resultados.
good,"I liked it when I worked there. I learned so much with the position that I had and the training that was provided to me. Wish I could have stayed there,"
good,"Good work life balance."
good,"Company always had plenty of work, almost always worked more than forty hours.  Union Job.  Co-workers were great, management not so much.  Have worked other places where workers not treated as fair as this company."
good,"Cummins offers plenty of opportunities to continue learning new things and further developing yourself.  "
good,"Overall a very light mood and a happy place to work. The job can become stressful at times but it's manageable. A lot of meetings, but also a lot of human touch."
good,"Great plus but the manager was not a good person to work for. We did our jobs and went home. The supervisor was great, nobody liked the branch manager."
good,"I loved my time there.  Most everyone was nice, however, you had to watch your back as full time people, as well as some temps, tend to be nice to you, but will turn around and talk about you.  That is about the only downside there was and it was stressful as a temp due to that.  Good pay, in my opinion, and the job was easy.  I worked on multiple lines throughout the plant and they switched me to a different shift overnight.  Which I personally got used to pretty quick because I enjoyed the job.  I would have stayed as long as I could if I had the chance.  It was my favorite place to work, but being a temp there seems unfair at times.  I would definitely come back if given the chance to."
good,Excellent place to work except for the pay and benefits.  When hired in we were promised that we could transfer to the production side if we worked in Security for 2 years.  Of course this never happened and it was time to move on.
good,"The work place is good . There are plenty of opportunities to grow and learn more roles. The focus on safety is fantastic and the work atmosphere is very good for the most part. The hours in assembly can be brutally long. The biggest negative i have about Cummins is the lack of value they have for their employees. I have seen many people leave because Cummins does not pay employees what they are worth. The pay scale goes by years experience in plant, not by skill. So an assembly operator working at the plant for 10 years makes the same as a Quality technician with 10 years experience. This is the biggest downfall of the plant, and until they fix it they will continually loose people who give a lot to their job and work but don't get anything back."
good,"Cummins provides a diverse work environment.  Great place to go if you are ready to travel the world.  The engineering world is wonderful to be a part of.  Great people, and lots of class!"
good,The work place was dirty and some employees were cheating with each other but HR and manager did not about the situation. Employees were not enjoyable at work. Upper management did no listen to what employees had to say.
good,The company was a great company to work for but he management at the shop i was at was not the best. The bosses in the shop were great but up front they didn't understand what we had to get done and the best way for us to do it.
good,"Good platform to learn each and every thing."
good,"I am thankful for the opportunities of personal growth and comfortable financial living that working for Cummins allowed, however the personal versus work life balance just wasn't compatible for me"
good,I enjoyed working at Cummins. I had a lazy boss which was hard to compensate for. On daily basis he would order wrong parts and forget parts also give wrong info about jobs.
good,"There is a mutual respect between my coworkers and myself.  The department I work in can be challenging some days but we try to make it as fun as we can. Our team lead does not seem to be very engaged with us."
good,"Great place to work with annual raises plus cost of living raise. Opportunity for advancement, and plenty of room to grow. Never a boring day, and plenty of benefits including on site gym, cafeteria, and nurse."
good,Cummins is a good work place but no good benefits ive been working at Cummins through Insource Performance Solution for three years and still havent got hired permanent. I feel i work too hard for the pay that im making.
good,"I loved working at Cummins but at the location I worked at, the management was poor.  The people I met from other locations were treated so much different."
good,"I was fortunate to work with talented and experienced people at the Elko, Nevada branch store.  The people were very dedicated to Cummins Rocky Mountain"
good,"Overall, Cummins was a great place to work at for me. Just that as a junior in college, the location was not the most exciting place to live in."
good,"Typical day at work, fast paced."
good,The position was a summer internship while I was still enrolled in my undergraduate degree.  I was exposed to the company culture and found it to be stimulating.
good,Several technical support to delight costumers in application engineering and the sales force. Many meetings for new product or current product support. Several meeting to align with other teams and new professional as results of the contend workforce structure changes. Very good company to work in many different areas
good,"Great place to work. Life/work balance can be difficult. Rotating shifts, 10+ hours per day for managers. Very steady, willing workforce. Perfect place to start your career or finish it out."
good,Great company to work with for campus hire. For lateral hire it is good experience and exposure but responsibilities handled do not justify salary. good company for Working mother. We get shocks when manager get promotions because of task done by you. CFT team have typical attitude as government office. there is different image in reality than actual work environment.
good,"Cummins has a corporate culture which demands nearly round-the-clock availability, nearly unconditional commitment to the company, and a willingness to make sacrifices in your own life to meet company demands. That said, the work is always in demand and challenging and I was never bored. Many development opportunities were available and my managers were more than happy to help me reach development goals and work on new and interesting projects."
good,"It was great working on our Final year engineering project on design modification, strength analysis and cost analysis of Skid at Cummins India Ltd. Pune plant."
good,"The project was my first opportunity to work with the end client on implementation of Oracle for large business segment for MDM."

good,worked for La department of corrections while I was attending school for diesel mechanics it worked with my schedule.  Winn Dixie I was there for 23 years and enjoyed the job.  Management was not stable and the company was always being sold
good,"I have a gift for being well rounded and working to best of my ability and always  help in other area but one thing that continues to be an issue in this industry is people whom are in a higher position that are power struck and tend to be little employees under there supervision."
good,"Good company to work for.  Fosters team environment, and overall growth and sustainability for workforce. Management will look for long term growth opportunities to ensure businesses are in tact."
good,"Mainly visiting customers , discussing their inquiries or compalaints"

good,"Cummins is a good company for learning."
good,"Good work life balance,work culture best for ladies ,most enjoyable part of job is we are allowed to put forward our thoughts."

Next I review my emails and respond to any question and or issues.

good,I was in a CPE role for 4.5 years. There is great talent and people are really friendly. I have gained a lot of technical experience working here.
good,"Days were not long.  Management at the time was good.  Some very poor supervisors.  Poor people skills.  Co-workers were great, and job satisfaction depended on the department you were in and the supervisor."

good,"typical work day is pretty normal for an engineer."
good,"Working with Cummins was a great experience over all. I left with great leadership skills and team building skills. The hours of operation were perfect with my family life style. I worked a 7am to 330pm shift, with a 45min. lunch. I enjoyed working with helpful co-workers who shared team player mentality with work."
good,The projects at Cummins are typically 18 to 24 months long which though puts a lot of knowledge in your basket but doesn't have the challenges everyday. Probably a well suited company to work for before retirement.

good,I have worked for Cummins for over 8 years and i have enjoyed every moment. Met some really nice helpful people. Cummins looks after its staff and customers also. They are a very honest genuine company to work for. Until i started working for Cummins i did not realise how big of a company Cummins is. I enjoy the firendly environment and the relationship i have built with my customers over the years.
good,"It is the challenging job because while i go to the site for customer complaint so gain confidence to solve the problem which is very interesting."
good,Really great HR group to work with. worked on a contract basis but overall really good experience. They are willing to invest in the training and development of their employees

good,"My everyday work with cummins was full of challenges. Ive learned"
good,"Cummins was a great company to be a part of, however working as  contractor was really tough. Going into a job and expected to already know how the organization without being able to really learn the company was hard."
good,Cummins is a great place for women to work. It has great balance of gender diversity. One is free to talk to senior management or keep their views in front of them. A lot of forums to discuss any small issue. A great organisation to create a platform for one's career.

good,Normal 7a.m. start check stock levels for production lines ensure enough for days work.
good,High core values.
good,"As an International Student Product Engineer, I worked with the engineers at our many international facilities to help faciliate testing and product validation. As our company moved production lines to other locations, I overlooked the validation process, and during the process was exposed to many industry testing standards and procedures. The interactions with the engineers in other countries was by far the most enjoyable part of my job, as I was exposed to many different cultures and ideas. Overall, it is a good place to work, especially for the opportunity to be employed while still attending school. However, like many larger corporations the upper management is rather distant to many of the employees. Also, as often occurs in the automotive industry during down periods of the economy, the company went throught a series of layoffs during my term of employment."

I really liked and trusted most of the people I worked with. During my time with Cummins I was trained and payed very well. I would go back in a second  if things were different. If you are thinking of working here the only advice I will offer is watch out for the general manager and if you ever leave the will blame you for every problem they ever had
good,"The company is very diverse in culture and in business segments. As any other company the working pace is fast and demanding. The workplace culture is based and supported on a code of conduct policy that clearly established to treat everyone with respect. In the Factory environment as any other one the work is extremely demanding, had to be flexible to work overtime or during weekends depending on the current demand.  What I learned and enjoy a lot was working with people from different countries, cultures, working styles. And I got the chance to learn new skills and/or enrich the ones that I had already had."
good,"Great learning experience for supply chain graduates as the supply chain management is not very robust and has a lot of scope for improvement. Therefore, a lot of avenues to make changes and be innovative."

good,Provides great challenge for people to advance in their career.  Leadership has a lot of emphasis on the company culture and values.  Management team is very stable which is a strength and as well a weakness in terms of driving major changes.  Lots of opportunities if you are willing to relocate or move.
good,Cummins is a good place to work however you must make sure you find good management to support you and your journey if you want to succeed. I have learned a lot at Cummins and everyone is willing to help you.
good,The company is very community involved. My role also allows for flexibility. They try to empower their employees through various programs. I've enjoyed most of my management.

In this job I saw how many engines that Cummins have made and what vehicle they go into. the manger was showing us around Cummins seeing how engines go into a car also to see exactly what vehicle the engines fit in what car. They had engines for many vehicles for example construction, defence (army), mining underground and several other things. After all this we could to fit an engine into a car but where supervised if anything went wrong then the supervisor will tell me."

good,There is always something to complain about but I have stayed because while there where hire paying jobs the schedule and environment of Cummins exceeded the pay difference.
good,"Never worked a job with so much indecisiveness about promised time off. Pre-printed  on an annual calender and then take it back. That's not caring about the safety of your employees.  We become exhausted, start making errors on 13 to 20 days straight work weeks."

good,"Great company to work for as the culture embraces open communication and collaboration. People are very nice and the work is complex, so it can be very rewarding. The only problem is that there can be a lot of bureaucracy involved which can delay progress on specific projects. The company should drive to become more customer driven."

good,People at my location were very good to work with. The management team had great training process that you go with to help better understand what you will be doing.
good,Started my PIV and RF Scanner for location picks. Picker order and return to designated location. I learned the function of the warehouse. Hardest part was hours and enjoyable part was my coworkers.
good,"Empresa excelente para inicio de carreira com desafios importantes para o crescimento profissional. Entretanto, apresenta um alto volume de lideranças e muitos sem conhecimento para atuar como líder, sem a devida preparação para atuação, já que de todas as lideranças que tive (total de 5), apenas uma delas foi positiva e todas as outras não agregaram nada de forma positiva.. Apesar de todos esses pontos, uma empresa que me ensinou bastante, ampliou minha visão já que eu tinha uma atuação com interação em todas as áreas, elevando o meu conhecimento."
good,"The typical day at Cummins for me was to get my weld gear on, get in my spot on the line, and then weld up the parts then send them to the next person.Taught me how to weld. The management was very good always there to ask any questions that you had. The work place culture was very safe and friendly. The pace was extremely fast and hard to keep up depending on what you did. The most enjoyable part was the people that I worked with."
good,"Work on anything with a Cummins engine from a asphalt roller to a wood chipper, good hours and pay as long as you keep your efficiency up. The managers were fair and would take everything into consideration if you missed the allotted time."

good,Excellent company with great culture and engaged workforce; product are being well defined through the entire lifecycle; good service support with global footprint
good,"Overall, I was satisfied with my time at Cummins.  I wish they had more IT offerings in the US, but the company does great with benefits packages, specially retirement!  If I was looking for a large company to work for, I would definitely have Cummins on my list.  Some locations had more perks (better lunch rooms, nice coffee selections, etc), but some perks had just good people that you could always rely on."
good,"Good friendly people who work there management is ok but the wrong  decisions have been made, there is a lack of progression with in the company all tho is not impossible"
good,"I was thrilled working for Cummins; as a global company, it is a great feeling to be part of them."
good,"Cummins has a great benefit package and an excellent career advancement program. Cummins promotes diversity and inclusiveness. The company also provides a great tuition reimbursement program. However, the growth opportunity is at slow pace."
good,I enjoyed the challenges that every day had and meeting those challenges was very rewarding to me as a person. Every day was a little different. I worked in many different areas and departments and I enjoyed learning all the aspects needed to get the job done proficiently.
good,"Great Company to work for. Manager was not the ideal manager.Performs routine maintenance, facilitates customization and changes to, and ensures system disaster recovery for systems. Leads new employee technology setup, including computer setup and delivery and system access. Resolves issues not readily evident and performs authorized changes and upgrades to existing systems."

good,"Bom ambiente de trabalho, com respeito as todas as culturas e diversidades."
good,I love their diversity in the work place.  They paid their employees very well with great benefits.  It's a very fast paced environment and a lot of potential for career growth.
good,Overall company values are to be proud of. Many affinity groups are sponsored and the company takes an active role in global well-being. More recent leadership changes and company strategies reduced upward opportunities at a personal level.
good,"Management has changed over recent years, however the direction of the new leadership is exciting. Most floor employees do a good job and do well handling customer demands."
good,Lots of opportunity to change desired career path.  Effective leadership but sometimes slow to change direction even when change is needed.  Would recommend working here but be wary of location.

good,"Cummins is a great place to work, great people who always will to help make your work easy. great training program. one thing that need to improve is balancing work with personal life."

good,Empresa com cultura e valores muito fortes e presentes durante todo o tempo. Existem muitas oportunidades de aprendizado com cursos complementares fornecidos pela empresa e o cotidiano é uma aula a parte.
good,"The job is challenging and rewarding, but is never close to done - I felt like I could never leave, even when arriving early and leaving late - so work / life balance is an area of opportunity for improvement for Cummins.  Great people and good challenges and materials needed to get the work done - on an individual basis."
good,"I enjoyed my years there. Every few years they have a reduction in force, so get ready for that. Salary is good, as are benefits. Managers are better than most. Good product training available."
good,Nthng specific...but culture is good. Divorsity is very good part in cummins. Nice to work with diffirent peoples. But some points was tgere tht i didnt like..overall experience was good with cummins.
good,"I enjoy working at Cummins.  I am building engines at this time and I am looking to change my career."
good,"it was ok for the job that it was, but no security in hours or job. It could have been cleaner and ran better, but anyone that had a good idea was trumped by those that had seniority."
good,I got the opportunity to learn about plans and specifications designed by engineers and then configure power systems based on those requirements.  Management was relaxed and allowed creativity and independent thinking.  I enjoyed my colleagues.  The hardest part of the job was the commute into the office.  My favorite part of the job was visiting job sites to oversee installation premises.
good,"Creative, curious, adventurous but fickle company. Technological advance is quick and decisive but technological expertise is lost just as fast as new knowledge is acquired. The constant churning will be a joy for new young engineers, until they realize that this never stops, even if the technology is past mature."
good,"I worked for Cummins for over 20 years, loved every minute of it.  However things change with new ownership.  It's a face paced, customer oriented company.  Customers are the business!!!  Management empowered all employees to make the right decision for the customer."
good,"I was placed in a crucial role at the start meeting internal and external customer needs. Giving instruction and tools to do the job and was left alone. The hardest part of the job was that I was the only person working in the area, if I was out, I had to play catch up once I returned."

good,"Le travail est de qualité , les avantages aussi. L'ergonomie est en constante évolution."
good,i assisted with the cleaning of whirlpool to keep the building and restrooms clean. For the most part everyone got along but sometimes the conversation could get away and some things that were said could be taken wrong and could be used for harassement so I think they need to know when to tone it down a bit
good,"Great company to work for and good advancement opportunities. Benefits are typical.  Management is good.  Depending on your position, there could be a lot of travel."
good,"Got chance to handle 15+ team to manage.."

For test services a typical day included trying to figure out why something was failing in the field and then try to re-create it to try and fix the problem.  All of the people are with are very nice and are willing to do anything to get you on your feet and to hit the ground running.  All the technicians are very willing to teach you the ropes so that you are more familiar with how things work within the engine as well as how your degree is actually applied to real world applications.  The hardest part is whenever its crunch time and everybody is tense in trying to finish their portion of the project.  The most enjoyable part is learning all the different things that go into making a great engine as well as what it takes to run a great company.
good,Very busy throughout day. Overtime has ups and downs but steady. Overall a good place to work. Very Clean and people are friendly. I would recommend applying. Columbus is also a great city.

That being said, I enjoy the job I do. Receiving and billing customers and entering inventory into the system. Most people don't like sitting at a computer all day, but I don't mind it at all.

I have learned the importance of satisfying and keeping customers happy."

There are 4 rotations which last about 2hrs and 30min followed by a 30 min lunch break. I have learned how to mask and damask engines that get painted by robots.

I increased employee participation from 30% To 60% in year 1 and have increased on that total year on year. My 3 year secondment is due to come to an end in late summer. However, I really enjoy the Corporate Responsibility role and would like to continue this at another comapny. Cummins have offered me a role back in Finance, but I would see that as a backward step as the development opportunities in that area are limited. "

good,"A typical day at work is very busy. We are primarily an engine shop, but the lack of population leaves us open for a bulk of bumper to bumper work. The increasing after treatment systems to meet epa standards keep us occupied most of the time. This is only my second year in the industry and being at this location has been a great benefit to my learning. I get my hands on about 3 different trucks a day so that has aided my experience at a rapid rate. My co-workers are wonderful. My management is very supportive and knowledgeable. I love the day to day challenges of being a mechanic. I thoroughly enjoy the Cummins engine and product line. The hardest part of this job is the work load. I am one of two technicians in a ten bay shop and I am significantly younger than the other mechanic, so a lot of the work load is placed on my shoulders because my work pace is faster. However the more trucks I get my hands on the more I learn, so I cant complain too much."

good,"As a mechanical design engineer in a small team you would work 56 hours a week which includes working to communicate with overseas JV's and suppliers yet management would grade your work on how they feel about you after the first time they see you. One guy on our team worked only for 8 months and was laid off for no other reason but that management didn't like him. This is a fun place to work if you are on the right team, however from my experiance with the implemantation of the grading system which every year 10% of the company is laid off shows just how much the management looks out for their friends."

Management struggles in communicating down the chain. The guys I work with make the day go by quick. I consistently work with the same group of guys and when called upon to work with others, appreciate the safety and work rate shown by the group. The hardest part of my job is dealing with sudden deadlines or going up the chain with parts orders that aren't followed through on. I enjoy the chances I get to work outdoors, work with cranes and teamwork shared with safety and work rate conscious people."

good,"This is a great company to work for. Unfortunately, it only takes one person to make it unpleasant and stressful. Like everywhere else these days its who you know not what you know. The pay is very unfair. I'm doing the same work and am more knowledgeable / qualified than some techs getting paid $4-6 more. Most of the guys are great to work with. We stick together with the exception of a couple bad apples, again, that's everywhere these days. Management of course is like most places, deceitful, unfair and are only looking out for themselves.

There we mentor ship programs available for those who shown ability and skill. Overtime was a mainstay and not to be complained about. My co-workers we the most amazing part of the job: we were a well-oiled machine that didn't require management intervention to do our daily functions.

If there was something you had problems with, there was always another analyst more than willing to help you out. At the local level the managers are great. They treat their employees with respect.
