rating,review
bad,"This company is highly toxic and will remain so until the current CEO is replaced."
bad,"aucune collaboration "
bad,"Under paid and over worked. They don't appreciate their employees and management is horrible and doesn't appreciate "
bad,"Management changed constantly and there was too much unnecessary administrative work.  I had to drive up to 300 miles per day to do bearings and was ordered to do phone hearings on the side of the freeway and in parking lots.  I’d get assigned phone hearings from the east coast the same morning as I’m waking up, with no prior prep with the employer and witnesses, often the documents weren’t even given to the judge as required.  What a mess!"
bad,"Terrible team leader, terrible place to work, I wouldnt recommend this work environment to dog let alone a friend. Your treated like an alien. Then pain like Burger King."
bad,Poor upper management. Do not care about employees. Doing an excellent job means nothing to them. The new Equifax is wrose than the old one. do not care about teamwork at all!
bad,This company employs the most shady management I've ever seen.  They are corrupt as they come.  Run far far away from this company.  This is where careers go to die.
bad,"Culture needs to be improved, benefit needs to be improved. Senior leadership should pay more attention on employee benefits rather than constant reorganization."
bad,"Extremly poor place to work . Run for your Life. The job is not what they tell you at all. Very poor leadership its like they are all in some kind of cult."
bad,"Worst company ever. Stupid choices, arrogant, incompetent. Poor management. No solution focus. workplace culture is back stabbing. They are to stupid to recognize real talent."
bad,"Very poor culture. Poor management from Senior leadership and slow to adapt to any changes.They wordsmith every document despite there not being a need. A member of Senior Leadership (VP) told me I didn't fit into their culture."
bad,"Everything is very fake, from the plants to the work environment everything is fake. Managers literally yell at you via email, because thats a good way to motivate your employees!"
bad,I felt the invironment was not very friendly there at Equifax however Portico Staffing is a wonderful Staffing Agency to work for. People were not very friendly ther nor were they willing to help if requested. I would not recommend Equifax for anyone however Portico Staffing is a wonderful Staffing agency with friendly staff I would work for them again and again
bad,Moderately paced call center. There are different branches for Equifax. Supervisor did not want to be spoken to until he spoke first. Workplace culture was poor.
bad,You never know what day will be your last. There is quite a bit of turmoil since the breach. It is a very cut throat place and your boss will throw you under the bus in a heartbeat.
bad,Equifax is not the greatest of place to work for. One of the leads does not do a very good job at what he is supposed to do and often lets some people get away with things that are not work appropriate. There is a big lack in praising people who work hard and a big lack of the hard work that other people have.
bad,"Never accept a temporary position with Equifax. They will not eventually hire you as a permanent employee. They may extend your stay, however it continues to be without benefits and they can let you go at any time. I met some people who had been there over four years as temporary employees."
bad,"To much favoritism and employee are never recognize for their hard work and dedication. Computers are always crashing, no help everything we have to get done on our own even if it is an technical problem"
bad,"This company is a complete joke. This is a layover job, while trying to seek full-time work at a real job. They just want calls answered. I've never seen so much foolishness at one company. I felt like I was sitting a room full of children who behaved worst than my 19 year old and her friends. Do not waste your time with this company,unless you just need a couple of quick checks."
bad,the wrok environment was great. They had an amazing break room which was basically like a gas station. The reasons I didn't like it was because my lead at the time picked favorites. I was also sent home early a lot only making so much an hour and I couldn't afford to not get a whole 40 hour week.
bad,"Horrible leads and management, would not recommend to anyone. Turn over rate is super high as well, temps would come in and be gone within 2-3 days. Used to be a fun work environment and not anymore."
bad,Not a glamourous job just answered calls for lost and stolen credit cards. But it was a great place to gain call center experience. Actually went back there when I needed some extra cash part time.
bad,"See thru leggings, lazy supervisors, dirty restrooms, inappropriate attire, low wages, yelling, extreme profanity, middle school mentality, terrible benefits, never hire their temps"
bad,There is nothing positive to say about Equifax. The only positive is meeting a few genuine people. There is no job growth unless you know upper management. You get treated like you aren't human and you are a lesser person than everyone else.
bad,Equifax's total priority is there definition of lean which overburdens the employees to do numerous jobs without a clear emphasis to the overall goal.
bad,"Turn over is tremendous. A contract call center that runs about 85% temps with the rest being made up as Equifax management / workers."
bad,"They were every inconsiderate of my pregnancy. I had many doctor appointments as i was sick during the beginning of my pregnancy. it consumed a good part of my life as i would go in early and late some days, many days. the hardest part of the job was that it was day and night it seemed. the most enjoyable was my coworkers."
bad,"I started here in the transcription pool, eventually became the assistant transcription pool manager, and then went on to systems administrator for the office.  In that capacity I was responsible for maintaining all office equipment and their repair if necessary, running daily reports for field agents and/or managers, and assisting the office manager in daily functions.  I left here to pursue a job with an insurance agency, which paid more and was a new challenge for me in relatively the same field."
bad,Equifax was a great start for me . I am a people person and i had the opportunity to serve many customer around the country.The internal customer were great to serve and work with.
bad,"I worked there as a Temporary, and have seen them get rid of people for some things such as tardiness, and absenteeism. I saw other Permanent Employees and temporary employees were doing the same and still have their jobs. I was promised Training and never received, as a result I lost my job due to numbers? that was not true, and the system inappropriately reported my numbers when I checked them and the next the day on the report, they were way off."
bad,physical security operations has bad leadership. The supervisor uses his authority to get friends hired. Nepotism. There is no room for advancement. policies are not followed
bad,Lack of diversity in leadership positions a major concern. The company environment was one of Male entitlement. Goals and expectations weren't clear which led to low morale and high turnover.
bad,"Do not work here, period. Amen. End of story. You deserve better, you can find better. Pass this place up and do not look back. Management is absolutely horrid, systems constantly go down, most of the people that process the lender information are illiterate and can't spell or use proper grammar on official documents. If you ever need help, don't bother asking, nobody will respond. You will be singled out for the most miniscule mistakes, all the supervisors are young adults who get off on bossing around people below them."
bad,"This company is not believe in team work or being one company culture.  Everyone is micromanaged, the workflow/lean processes are not existent, however, they want you to think that both are in place and in play.  NOT.  I would NEVER recommend anyone to work for this company.  They don't pay well and than you get treated like a child."
bad,"I worked for Equifax as a Project Manager, unfortunately, I left because my director was condescending on numerous occasions, and she did not understand the overall program requirements. The management team is clearly disorganized, they provided inaccurate information on numerous occasions, which revealed a major issue - the management team doesn't understand their own clients project requirements!"
bad,Awful on all accounts .Never in a month of Sundays should anyone consider applying to this company. They have poor people skills and no one has any value . The  management do not respect their staff in any way . I will go so  far as saying  certain  directors were evil nasty  and snotty and had little regards for the opposite gender other that play things. Totally stuck in the past old boys school mentality .
bad,"Typical day I would come to work and log on and be on the phones for 8 hours a day. Wanted to advance and make a career here and surely enough there is no communication at all I applied for couple jobs and said I was still interested and never got a response back. Very poor communication. Supervisors are never around and play a lot of favoritisms, don’t get paid enough."
bad,"Management could be better, they micromanage, don't allow employee's to return after major surgery.  I learned that this company only see's their employee's as numbers, they don't take into consideration how well you do your job.  They do not care about their clients, always pushing for increases when they should focus on the client and their concerns first."
bad,I was excited when I got hired on full time here. I like my team lead and thought there would be opportunity for advancement. I was wrong. Favoritism and nepotism run rampant. People are fake and petty. Advancement is based on popularity instead of merit. Seniority has no value. It's like being back in high school. I have never been so disappointed by an employment situation in my life.
bad,"The company has lost miles of growth as the result of poor decisions and poor managment all employees suffered."
bad,"The managerial staff didn't ever really seem to know what they were talking about, no one was ever on the same page. You get cross trained pretty quickly, but the pay doesn't match what they expect out of you, especially if you are have multiple task."
bad,"I only worked for a very brief time, I thought of Equifax as a verification of employment, but this was just something really dumb.  Low pay, and all I could do was read from a script.  In the training, they said ""it is ok to lie to them.""  I only took the job because I had already been unemployed for long enough, but just pretend they dont exist.  Basically managers were not helping but they pretended to be there the whole time.  For one they did not really know what was going on, they were just making things up."
bad,Pay is low for the amount of work you do. Managers make work more difficult than it should be. It is really a micromanage environment depending on whose team you are on. Contractors are treated with no respect and told constantly that you are just a contractor not an employee. Just too much kids play and not enough real true leaders. Petty Pams is at an all time high in that place and could use a shake up around that place. Customer service level is low. Very.
bad,"Equifax is a good company to work for. However, management and top leaders are poor at producing good leaders and offering up career advancement. Everything is based on Politics and who you know."
bad,"Management is non-existent.  Unable to communicate.  Never knew when any changes happened until after the fact.  Feel very used.  They take what they need from you, then toss you aside like a piece of trash.  No room for advancement.  Very ""clicky""."
bad,"Equifax salaries are commensurate with experience. "
bad,"Mission and procedures are unclear and difficult for most to understand. Job security is non-existent with threat of layoffs ever-present. People are nice, but that is all."
bad,"Hard to follow leadership direction as it changes daily. Management focused on managing perception and political capital.  Leadership is driven by fear which is what they display down to their subordinates.  Limited trust and ability to clearly know your ranking as betrayal is a daily occurrence even among ""strongest alliances"". Lack of training of any kind, with constantly changing expectations. Revenue focused and driven only, with minimal regards for human decency, compassion or diversity."
bad,"There are a lot of politics and you can only advance if you know the right  people, lots of work to do for very uncompetitive wage, unrealistic KPIs, very stressful place."
bad,"I had a stellar manager, and then a horrible manager. My last manager had unreasonable expectations and was impossible to work with. I think everyone who worked for him last left his group or the company by now. Lift is too short to deal with idiots in charge..."
bad,I called out to employers everyday that I needed to verify if the customer who is applying for loan is actually employed there. I exceeded the goals each hour to complete and make the out bound calls to.
bad,"This was by far the worst place I’ve ever worked. Management allows employees to cultivate a hostile work environment. Constant system issues with no regard for this when metrics come into play. No recourse from HR with complaints from multiple employees on a team about the same manager or employee. Absolute horrid communication between management and team. If I could say one good thing about Equifax, it is that they pretty much let you wear what you want and do whatever with hair colors. That’s it."
bad,"This place will only drain you dry. There is black mold in the ceilings that was being covered up by a panel ""remodeling"". Thousands of dollars are spent on food for president visits and break room refrigerators but not on employee benefits or wages. Management would interfere with call queue functions for hare-brained attempts at increasing production line output when in reality, only served to diminish productivity further due to a lack of understanding how the call agents' responsibilities are organized. This employer will only ever attempt to offset the negativity and suffering inflicted on the agents daily by hosting potlucks or free lunches every 4-6 months or so. Mandatory overtime dominated over half a year for this former employee. Pay grade is not increased by becoming trained in multiple responsibilities, even if responsibilities increase to significant workplace-affecting levels."
bad,"I would not work at Equifax again.  It is slow to change, so focused on quarterly results that decisions that sub-optimize the business are made and the employees are not valued.  I had 7 managers over 6 years and only one of them was any good.  They tolerate bad behavior among executives."
bad,"Sure, it looks great at first, but when you come across the goals they want you to keep up with, it's no wonder they're bringing in people often. The turnover is horrible."
bad,"This place is the worst place to work, you are treated like trash. Anyone is replaceable and they make it very clear."
bad,"I strongly recommend you avoid Equifax.  Why?  Deep culture of managing outsourced work, which means the payroll has all managers and no skills.  Ridiculous politics.  Decision come from people that have no idea what you do or how you do it.  Just a miserable company to work for."
bad,"Pros:"
bad,"Great company, a lot of pros, cons however out weigh the pros."
bad,"Management needs a more structure."
bad,"I worked as a Fulfillment Associate in an Equifax call center doing verifications of employment and income. I do not recommend it unless you have a very high tolerance for stress. I burnt out after 1 year (for comparison, it took me 3 years to burn out in fast food)."
bad,"took inbound call to assist customers with concerns about their credit reports, process credit report disputes, contact creditors to verify credit report disputes and made corrections to the credit reports."
bad,"A lot of politics going on internally. "
bad,"Company would have us call employers to verify employee employment. Most of the time banks would call employers first, causing the employers to be irritated with us. "
bad,"Worked for just 1 month"
bad,"on phone all day, very easy. did VOE's its an ok place to work but you will be tired"
bad,"Jefaturas malas, sin valor real y despreocupadas de las personas y sus necesidades."
bad,"Poor culture.  Poor management from Senior leadership,  slow to adapt to any changes. Low motivation among staff. Impossible to find parking after 9am so you must arrive early.  Able to work remotely"
bad,Senior manager focused on metrics and not revenue. No understanding of business verticals. Focused on number of phone calls vs. bringing in new logo customers.
bad,"Typical day included non-stop making / taking calls and replying to banks via email all at the same time. "
bad,"1. Lots of employee churn"
bad,"No free lunch, no drinks, party with coffee lol. No job security, anybody can be fired anyone, only 1 week notice period, management is worst. QA should be well informed from day one of product meeting"
bad,"Agents are asked to say things that are not true in order to keep the callers happy. The rules change all the time. The work are is very secure, to the point of feeling like a prison."
bad,"Managers were almost never present, and when they were were not much help. No training materials were provided for any of the work I did, and almost all employees were required to do mandatory overtime (but were not made aware of it until that day). It was almost impossible to plan around this job because some days you would be required to work 10 hours, and some days the workload was too light for the amount of staff so they sent people home after 5 hours. Employees that learned specialty queues were rewarded with no pay increase, but an extra hour of mandatory overtime when it was assigned. "
bad,"I would not recommend this job to anyone the management team is unfair employees are not appreciated, they would rather get work that comes from india that is not accurate than American workers. They have poor training and no policy or procedures"
bad,My work at Equifax involved collection calls in the company's call center. A typical day at this job involved sitting on an electronic dialing system that automatically called individuals that were behind in the payments for various companies.
bad,"Equifax sounds like a great company to work for, but it really is a lot of confusion on what they do. They are always trying to talk people into doing new things."
bad,New management doesn’t care about employees. It’s more about the numbers only. Managers don’t have career discussions with you.  It’s 100% about the numbers and the company’s image. Employees are definitely not first.
bad,No transparency in company's vision. Employees are not treated as assets. Salary rate is quite low and managers do not care about employee's aspirations. They treat them as just robots who are doing the job. Even if you have a genuine reason to work from home they will decline the request.
bad,Good fit job . Happy with long hours work. Enjoyable pace environment. Computer watch job . Sitting position to work with client. Same thing doing again.
bad,"If you are coming to Equifax to work in Analytics or Production, this is your place. If however you are coming here for administrative work, please safe yourself some heartache. I have learned much working here, including you cannot always trust HR and you should always watch your back. I also learned that while the office workers are the backbone of life here we are not valued, at all. In fact we are the first to have to justify our existence here."
bad,Rules change arbitrarily and management will contradict itself endlessly. Your performance does not matter in any way as the same management that contradicts it's own changes and orders will then find a way to blame you and terminate you. Ever the revolving door as the same face will not be in the same spot for longer than 2 weeks to 3 months.
bad,I have been a temp here for 3 years. My coworkers are tattle tails and everyone that has been here for a few years feels that they are superior when they are no more than you. Their position is to run and complain on you every chance they get. Most of the people working here is temps with no chances of becoming full time. Overall this is a great job for a student. Just don't stay after you receive your degree. Its a waste of time.
bad,Confusing work environment. Known for passing clients through a number of departments without addressing the client's question. Not a good company.
bad,"Want to watch your career go down the drain, or to work till retirement with no pressure to advance, well you've come to the right place."
bad,you punch in onto a laptop and start your day. badge yourself inside the room where all the computers and cubicles reside. you take a seat where ever you would like and answer phones all day
bad,"The company is ok , the leadership in departments could use a lot of help. You have leadership that do not know the know their jobs. They seem as if they were just giving roles to have a position . The work life balance is horrible in the department I work in. If you have kids you will pretty much be a weekend only parent ."
bad,"Constant reorganizations, long hours, high turnover, fire drills on a weekly basis, and the employees have no faith in their leadership.  There are better places to work."
bad,Entry level call center. Not for anybody who wants to advance in their career. Not a professional place to work they just shovel people in shovel them out no background check at all.
bad,"Daily deadlines, stressful environment, and rare occasions for advancement. High turnover of new employees and long term employees include 10 plus years. Hardly any employees have less than 10 years."
bad,"Management is not knowledgeable on anything, and no one can help you with anything, or if they do, they have an attitude about it. There are no reviews, no meetings with you, training was disorganized. overall a very unprofessional place to work for a company that claims to be professional."
bad,"The company as a whole has little concern for its employees. The systems are antiquated and employees are reprimanded for ""not having a shining attitude"" in the face of flagrant verbal abuse."
bad,"Culture is one of ""do as I say, not as I do"".  Found it very hypocritical.  Poor treatment of customers.  Makes one's job all the harder to do let alone enjoy.  Overly ""cross matrix"", too many leaders all moving in their own direction."
bad,"Equifax was a tremendous place to work, grow and acquire skills. Since 2015, the sales culture has degraded signficantly. Great people, poor culture.."
bad,Just a typical work environment. I liked my co-workers and some of the management was nice. I was working through a temp service would have like to got hired on.
bad,"Read a Dilbert cartoon you will know how it is to work there, except WORSE."
bad,The Job is enjoyable and interesting. However; the environment is not a great one. Management is rude! They talk to employees as if they are children. If you wanna job where you feel like you don't matter....this would be the place.
bad,Work/life balance here is the best I've ever had. Benefits are decent. Coworkers are a pleasure to work with. Building facilities are excellent. Positive work environment. Management seems to care a lot about employees.
bad,"El problema es que la cultura de la empresa es chilena, siendo que es una empresa de matriz USA."
bad,"It was a very good place to work a long time ago, before Equifax bought them out.  After the take over, employee morale totally tanked worse than ever before and management did not care.  Very stressful work environment.  Most of the co-workers were very good to work with but management from front-line on up were horrible."
bad,"We work in chaos everyday.  Poor technology.  No Africa  American senior leadership members.   RED FLAG"
bad,Company has very poor leadership and direction.  Worked in IT for a few years and it was extremely hard to pinpoint where they were trying to take the company.  Information from leadership did not always disseminate to lower levels.  Very immature process and leadership for an industry leader.
bad,"Their expectations of you are not realistic compared to the compensation afforded you. Metrics are VERY stringent. But, although they have metrics for QUANTITY and QUALITY, it appears that quantity WAY outweighs quality. In other words, if you meet or exceed the number of calls/hour, the quality of your calls can be below average, causing the SAME call to have to be repeated 2-3 more times in order to close it out, you will still excel. Apparently, being thorough and providing outstanding Customer Service means NOTHING, and will actually do harm to your numbers! So, if you are lazy and don’t want to follow their script or guidelines about what you must do to satisfy the customer’s needs, but are “quick on the draw,” this is the job for you. Don't worry, if your calls/hour meet or exceed they will NEVER monitor your calls to see if you are ALSO meeting the quality metrics! They also promote people to management/supervisory/lead positions who have no idea how to perform in that type of role, NOR can they speak, read and/or write proper English. Very discouraging for a subordinate who is average to above-average intelligence, as you are subjected to these ""people of power"" that can't even spell! To me, that is a basic skill that EVERYONE working in a professional white-collar environment should possess. Where are the metrics for that particular skill?? In addition, it seems these same higher-ups constantly appear to be doing nothing but attending incessant no-results meetings, chit-chatting with their cronies/friends - in person or MOST OFTEN on their cellphones, chain-smoking"
bad,"One of the only places I've been where toxic managers aren't rooted out. Some managers are decent people, but toxic management should never be tolerated."
bad,"Since the data breach, working for Equifax has changed dramatically. It had a major impact on the organisation culture despite the incident being in the US."
bad,"No phones, keys, e-cigs, cigs, cups(without lids), or food of any kind. All of the headsets are cheap and breaking and most are missing the cushions so one spends hours with plastic digging into their ears. Their a many rules and stipulations that limit ones own actions and can be worse or better depending on your supervisor. Also they will not contact you outside of work unless ones supervisor feels like it. Was let go because they failed to train me or even let me know while i was in school."
bad,Great work life balance as used to be able to work remotely as often as I wanted. No advancement opportunities in my location.  Pay not competitive at all. Constant employee turnover.
bad,"Not the best place to work for, compensation does not reflect the level of stress and effort put forth."
bad,"I started at Equifax Workforce Solutions in St. Louis, MO, and loved my job.  Little did I know, that wouldn't last long.  The department (Late and Missing Data/Data Currency) that I worked in had what I thought were adults working together.  Everyone was mid 30s to late 40s.  They all were like school kids talking about you behind your back, running to management to tattle on you almost daily...it was pathetic.  The manager was the worst, running to HR if she overheard something she didn't like.  It, too, was almost daily."
bad,The career advancement opportunities are limited and the work life-balance was not satisfactory.
bad,"a typical day would include being scheduled for anywhere between 8 and 10 hrs of work and everyone being sent home sometimes in as little as 2hrs .management was okay very helpful with the work load ,but not very understanding about scheduling complaints the most enjoyable part of the job was the $10.00 a hr pay rate starting out and potential to make up to $16.00 hr in as little as 30 days"
bad,The external view of Equifax is one of a competent company whose customer-facing employees excel in consulting and product support.
bad,I joined at a time when significant changes were being made to the management styles within the company. This caused the overall work environment to become somewhat stressful and political.
bad,"Since the 2017 Breach, this company has been spiraling out of control and there's no end in sight.  There's no accountability and the next disaster is just around the corner."
bad,"Your typical 8-5 job. Terrible training, surrounded by co-workers with only high school diplomas. Management keeps you in the dark. Culture of company is lost, primary focus is on wrong priorities. HR division is absolutely terrible, slow and makes it almost impossible to promote within. Overall this company is your typical corporation, if you’re ok  staying in the same role for years with no advancement, apply."
bad,"Overall fair enough experience. "
bad,"I don't understand how Equifax has so many great reviews, this company is a multi billion dollar company that does not value nor have respect for their employees. They mostly have temps working there which makes it harder for anyone to advance to a higher position or even getting hired permanently, management has favoritism towards some, so having the chance to advance is not possible, unless you like to kiss a**."
bad,I quit because they took my bathroom breaks away and were starting to get mean towards me and would always tell me that I was not doing the right thing on calls. Nothing you do there is ever a correct decision.
bad,They are closing our location. I love the people that work here. Hard and determined people that had to pull weights from the other location that doesn't know what they are doing or care about customer service. Here they care and try to make everything right and are problem solvers to make sure the customer is satisfied.
bad,Good company but not for sales/ Sales tactics are backwards and focus is on wrong thing. There is no training and culture is horrible. I wouldnt recommend it to anyone.
bad,"I had a great team and manager I worked with who were very knowledgeable.  Upper management seemed to have no clear direction and changed direction frequently.  They seemed to not know. in regards to technology, where product lines were at and what direction they needed to go in."
bad,"Its good environment with mutual growth. Project schedule goes with exact plan without any deviation , by putting  proper co-ordination from everyone."
bad,Hardly any room for advancement if you're entry level. Very dry office and the heat is always a problem. Lack of communication from higher ups to entry level staff.
bad,"Equifax is a decent place to work for. The job itself is pretty easy, the pay is not very good. I feel the pay could be better. Bank of america is the best to work for."
bad,All the team leads care about is the production of work and not the worker's.The team leads notice one or two mistakes but does not recognize all the hard work you put in.
bad,"Muy opresivo, la gente se enfocaba en lo suyo y no hablaba mucho y no había una conexión"
bad,It was interesting working with Equifax. I learned a lot about the credit reporting industry.
bad,I joined their internship program as a sophomore in college and was perhaps one of the best corporate internship programs available to students at the time but I would say the company needed to focus on retaining interns more than anything else. Their university relations department really doesn't do a good enough job on retaining interns or providing opportunities for them to come back full time. They choose favorites for big name universities but there are plenty of talented individuals who can deliver results from tier 2 schools as well.
bad,"This job was very strict with there time. Such as lunch break, 10 minute breaks and clocking in and out times. If you were 1 second late then u were late from lunch or any other break."
good,"This workplace is just ""ok"". Whilst balanced with hours they are no very flexible. Very process and KPI driven, whilst this is a good thing it is too focussed on this and not work/life balance and more importantly culture. You are disposable at this workplace!!!!"
good,"The company is going through a transformation; it's slow due to bureaucracy and red tape. And the biggest change has to be culture of automation and productivity."
good,placed outgoing calls to creditors and loan applicants about a dispute over a reported credit score.  used automated systems when available to help update a credit score and/or rating
good,"Outbound calls to employers to verify employment of people that had taken loans out through a bank. Team lead was fantastic, but has since left. Easy task, but attention to details needed."
good,"Equifax started as a great job, but it eventually declined due to management that ignored problems. A typical day at work began anywhere from 6:00am to 8:00am, and ended once 8 hours were completed."
good,"Mediocre, not to much to say. Average benefits, average people, lots of organization changes very fast. The opportunity to work from home. Finding parking is tough."
good,Equifax is a company in transitioning.  The hardest part of the job is procedures and processes are never clear from department to department.  Overall the people I had the privilege of working with were great.
good,No job security.  Participation in meetings are limited to upper management.  Lack of information from management. Not a great place to work since the breach.
good,"It wasn't really bad I guess, just beyond easy. Business Casual dress code. No down time except for breaks. Basically everyone in that office is through a staffing agency and next to no one get hired on full time."
good,"• Telephone customer service: orientation, support and follow-up of cancellation processes; "
good,This job pays well enough to afford rent and allows you to have independence but those are the only positive notes I have. Management is poor and ignores employees daily. You are almost required to go around your supervisors in order to receive help. After asking for assistance multiple times from my team leads I was left with no other option to formally complain to the manager of our whole office about their negligence. Perfect job if you don't like talking to co-workers or enjoy being told you're wrong.
good,"I have no comment about Equifax. I was only there 3 months via an Agency's request. I developed a very bad cold that resulted in Laringitis and because I missed so much, including my voice, they let me go."
good,"They pay well, and project a customer friendly culture.  In reality everything is oriented around making quarterly profit goals.  Luckily the flexible work environment makes it palpable."
good,"• $3.7MM YOY savings achieved by identifying an opportunity to perform a Marketing Customer Experience RFP, replacing the incumbent supplier and negotiating reduced rates for like services"
good,The work wasn't extreme and the team that I worked with was really good. Several managers were overseeing the project and some managers were better than others. The job ended and I had to replace this job with another type of employment.
good,Company overall is ok. The work life balance is good in most cases. However totally depends on team . The opportunities to learn and grow hasn't been very good
good,"Its and Ok place to work, HQ is in Atlanta so no room for growth in Saint Louis. Great manager to work under but being a command center its a very high tense fast paced position. If you made a bad call on something your job was on the line."
good,This was a temporary assignment and sadly there were many changes taking place to the company. I do not feel that i got a very accurate view of the company.
good,Transcribe information from tape translated by physicians and underwriters.  It was a part-time position and I was able to work my own hours.  There was no supervisor at the time that I was working there so I was able to concentrate with no disturbance.
good,"Management was supportive and smart at helping out learning the job load, seems like a good starting company for an entry level career. Job opportunity and growth is a plus for working with this company, a lot of areas for growing."
good,"The ratio of developers to testers was 5:1 on some teams, worse on others."
good,the job was enjoyable management was horrible other than that great job was only a temp job would work again if they hired new management
good,Your position is not safe. There is JOB change overs every quarter. I was told by my manager that someday I will be fired due to being in Sales. I always feared when that day would come. Allot of pressure and change every year.
good,"I loved Equifax when I first started and was empowered to get it done.  After time and leadership change, they brought in all their friends and tried to change things in all the wrong ways."
good,Company wants to be customer focused but some positions that used to be relationship focused have turned to sales based. Many positions are no longer accepting remote employees and lately they have been hiring outsiders instead of promoting from within.
good,"When I started with Equifax 8 years ago, it was with a company that they had recently bought out called TALX. I started with a part time position and had better and more affordable health insurance than I have now as a full-time employee. The overall benefits are being reduced every year and the burden is being transitioned to the employees. Following the 2017 security hack, the company brought in new senior leadership who wanted to impose sweeping changes (which were obviously needed). The new leadership started bringing in their friends who were all terminated from Bank of America at the same time. They started bringing in all of their buddies to fill positions that they are unfamiliar and unqualified for. Anyone that didn't fall into line were summarily fired. There are ongoing waves of firings that include some of the best and most qualified employees. The current management doesn't have a clue how things functioned before them, only that they get credit for anything that sounds like a good idea. We've lost a lot of people because management keeps getting rid of people, wants more work to be done, but doesn't hire more people to do it. The work/life balance was terrible before, but at least you didn't have the threat of being summarily terminated hanging over your head. "
good,"This job can be very busy and overwhelming. Things change a lot around there. Great job if you're used to sitting, talking on phones and doing repetitive work on the computer."
good,Culture is a significant issue. Rules only apply to some people. No one knows what the org chart really looks like. There is not a single way to get anything done. Departments fight over who gets what resources in an aggressive and damaging way.
good,my manager is great optional overtime was great pay is very low> They are now going to outsource so there is no more opportunity for me here I was working her on temp to possible full time employment but now they are not offering full time employment it is going to be outsourced. Therefore I will not be working for Equifax any longer than the 10th of August 2018
good,"At first it was an easy, fun job but further in you were required to dress professionally which seems a bit much for being in a call center. Was pretty run down 4 months into the work."
good,"High turnover. Different department  do not communicate on the same wave length, this is created by the fact that they use different software that don't speak to each other most of the time.Hence they will always have a problem with the integrity of information while it is  being transferred to another platform unless they decide to fix that.The weird thing is that even though there is a very high turnover as far as lower level employees, most of the Managers have been there for more that 10 years!"
good,"In light of recent events, it is interesting that anything would be able to happen considering this company prides themselves in security and goes to great lengths to ensure their data is secure.  I did not fit into the culture because it felt like we were there to strictly mine data, not focus on the consulting I was hired and developed for."
good,"Work there 10 years and went from a great family company to a cut throat international company.  All the fun went away.  Very high pressure for production in most jobs.  My job was contracted out, so I was laid off."
good,"I'm a contractor here, a typical day at work is sitting for eight hours taking inbound phone calls, management is alright to much of their work is out off onto others"
good,"I enjoyed my job there. "
good,"During my work at Equifax, I was able to improve my phone communication skills, multi-tasking ability, and increase my attention to detail."
good,Work was what you made it. I learned computer skills. Management was ok. Co-workers were pretty good. Hardest part living on minimum wage at the time. Most enjoyable part working with minimal supervision.
good,I am choosing not to provide a review at this time.  This particular section will not let me move forward until I have typed a minimum of 150 characters.
good,Traditional working culture and environment. Work life balance needs to be improved. Stable working culture and very limited resources for training overall.
good,"From when I worked there at that time, there really wasn't much for job advancement in the West Des Moines Equifax office. The pay is at minimum wage unless you come in as a temp."
good,"Worst place I've ever worked at. I worked at Workforce Solution in St. Louis with my supervisor and rest of the team in Atlanta. Job was very difficult to do because of poor communication, poor culture and horrible leadership. I've been gone for a year now and six out of eight people in the department I worked in are gone. The pay was good, but the stress and BS isn't worth it."
good,This was a tough time for this company as they had a created a taskforce to help with organising refunds for customers that were mislead. Everything seemed rushed and disorganised.
good,At times the demand for project delivery superseded well planned and executed approach. A number of the IT teams consisted of a number high skilled resources that worked diligently meet all project timelines.
good,"The benefits makes up for the low compensation. The SARC department for Equifax you want to stay away from very stressful. Management is very rude, inconsistent, and does not follow through with what they say. this department is highly stressful."
good,"Busy with hourly deadlines"
good,"The usual story, big VP gets brought in from an outside company to serve as hatchet man, lays off countless long-time employees, takes golden parachute exit after a few years.  Sound familiar?"
good,Needs to work with management how to treat people. So hard to walk in to this company to do the job. Knowing the stress on the phone. Select superiors that know what the company is about.
good,"I enjoy challenges, but too many executives changes and now all higher management positions are in Toronto.  No place to move forward in the organization other than moving."
good,"Flexible work environment, most positions for advancement are in Atlanta"
good,"Company paid below market rates, but was a decent place to work. Equifax wants to pretend it is a tech company, but employees are reminded everyday that the company is over 100 years old."
good,Great company management not so great. Definitely a lesson learned about corporate America.
good,"good place to work, make your own hours, travel within 100 miles of home, no weekends"
good,It's an ok place to work if you don't care about advancing your career and want to work long hours with no chance to advance...
good,Mon travail consistait à faire l'entrée des factures fournisseurs. Le travail était correct mais le directeur n'avait aucune expérience de gérance et ça paraissait!
good,"Nice place to work, help full co workers, get busy and hectic at times. "
good,"Due to frequent changes in leadership over the past few years, the expectations for the sales and service organization have changed drastically, leading to a large amount of turn-over.  Due to the resultant turnover at the account management level, our clientele is no longer being serviced by people that have detailed knowledge about our product offerings."
good,"Equifax is a great company and has a fantastic upside. They have great technology and an overwhelming amount of data. However, there has been a tremendous amount of turnover and multiple ""restructuring"" in the last 2 years that have made it difficult to gain long term traction with product and market share gain in multiple verticals."
good,Management and job Advancement your either in the click or your out unfair and unjust but with them bringing in fresh blood appear to be turning things around.
good,Daily tasks and expectations for customer facing positions continue to increase with additional responsibilities every few weeks.  Lots of paperwork (electronic) - there is an extensive form to be completed for every task.  Difficult to manage workload.
good,Office was a production environment with repetitive data entry tasks and inbound/outbound phone calls.  At  times very stressful due to high work demand or due to lack of work.
good,Teaches something new. A good team for supporting and improving your communication skills and leadership qualities. They also have team outing and get-togethers which increases the bond as a team.
good,Stressful employer to work for because company was always reorganizing. I had a new manager every six months on average. Tenure of my first boss was the longest at one year. Tenure of every subsequent manager was well under a year.
good,Equifax is a steady work environment but the benefits are not as competitive as they could be. Some communication issues as well but for the most part the office is laid back and willing to work with you if you have minor issues that pop up and need to leave work early.
good,"I have learned a lot while at Equifax, especially since it was a career change for me.  However management in competency issues have arisen along with the fact that they pay, especially in my division, below the minimum average for any positions."
good,company has outstanding products however it takes a long time from conception to production or if for internal purposes employee usage
good,"Equifax is fun place to work. Days can go by fast and they provide ""fun"" days where they provide snacks and other things. the only down fall would be getting hired on. I'm working there through a temp. agency right now, and would love nothing more than to be hired on. I don't know if that will happen or not which is more than nerve grinding. I believe that once I get hired on, I will have a lot of opportunities to advance in the company."
good,"What i've learned through out my life is that i enjoy working.  I especially enjoy working with the public and general customer service.  I've been fortunate to have had great managers in my past jobs.  Men and women that were willing to help me succeed on the job.  However, i am looking for a job that i can make a career.  I would like to get with a company that i can grow with and remain there for the years to come.This company is not where i want to stay for long because of the pay and management is not healthy in my opinion."
good,"Equifax allows for a great environment for people who are both parents and Career driven, where the company is very flexible on that level and provide possibility to work from home when required."
good,"Job was boring. Wasn't any room for advancement."
good,A fair place to work and the people were friendly. All computer and phone based work. communication with customers and third parties were a must.
good,Equifax was an unchallenging place to work. I was not challenged and my technical skill set did not advance while working there.
good,It does what the summary says. It doesn't offer much more beyond that. 
good,"I would Key in the information from a 4506T form from Loan officers to verify that the Form was keyed in correctly. I would then Submit it to the IRS and wait for the results. I would process about 700-1,000 forms a day."
good,This company finds it very important that their customers are extremely satisfied with their services. They make sure they the address any issues that the customers have in a timely mater and they strive to make the necessary changes.
good,The company is going through a number of changes following the breach a few years back.  The transformation is ongoing and I would expect this to continue through 2020.
good,La empresa no exige niveles de inglés altos por lo que hay muchos usuarios que presentan problemas. El salario no es muy competitivo y los beneficios que brinda la empresa tampoco son los mejores al compararlos con otros Callcenters o por lo menos así lo fue en el 2015.
good,"The company is good, and learn the technology. Every company has pros  and cons. The culture is to focus on what we need to do. I learned end to end functionality."
good,"Would be great as a stepping stone to get experience. I would not recommend staying long term unless you're reaching retirement. However, the work and life balance is horrible."
good,Great company but there is a lot of transformation going on and the senior leadership is confused and unorganized.  Life/work balance is good but ineffective leadership is starting to erode this company attribute.
good,Nice managers. Typical call center. Contract position. No tolerance for missed work due to sickness. If you can show up daily on time you have a job. Pay is based on experience. Some agents made 12 while some made 17 an hour doing the same job. You had to work either every weekend both days or evening shift.
good,A typical day at work was always busy and the most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers.  They were always available to assist a fellow teammate when needed.  There was a great since of camaraderie.
good,Was a stable company to work for in the past.  Management changes and culture changes have created an unstable workplace in many departments recently.
good,"I worked with a great team of people at Equifax and learned a great deal of new skills to help advance my career. Job security and advancement at this firm is severely lacking. After several rounds of seemingly random and unannounced workforce reductions, my coworkers no longer feel they can trust senior management. Evidence of this loss of trust and job security can be found in the number of talented workers quickly fleeing the company. Overall, short term gains are all that matter to the senior leadership at Equifax, and they would gladly sell you and their mothers to achieve such gains (and fail at it anyway)"
good,Constructing W2's for Fortune 500 companies to their employees. The training was sporadic from management. The hardest part was the changeover from shift to shift. The most enjoyable part is talking to the customers that you serve.
good,This was the stepping stone into the credit environment. Loved the challenges and opportunity that came from succeeding throughout my career with Equifax.
good,"Equifax is going through a transformative re-invention of itself, post data breach.  The executive management chain is all new, with new mid level managers being brought in as well.  Many of the changes being implemented have been long overdue, but the transformation is not going to happen without some bumps in the road."
good,I don't feel it is appropriate to provide a review for a company I worked for so long ago. I am only typing as the system will not let me bypass this section
good,"The culture is still very much exists in silos which prevents meaningful changes. Some departments may have better experiences but my experience was challenging. Systems that are inefficient, gaps in process documentation, sporadic decision-making and a lack of clear and obtainable objectives are just some of the areas that are problematic within this organization. In some areas, performance measures are arbitrary and can be based on superficial standards. There are good people there but the organization is in  desperate need of a cultural overhaul."
good,"Great company with new leadership.  Excellent opportunities for new hires.  There is an an air of fear and lack of opportunity for others, which is understandable to some extent as the company is rebuilding following a rough couple of years."
good,"""There is so much flexibility with work/life balance that it makes it easy to come into work in the morning"" (in 62 reviews)"
good,I have no complaints about my time spent with the company. I started with very little experience in HR and can say that I learned a lot about HR that I had no idea of the day to day operation.
good,I started through a temp agency and was hired on full time about 4 month later and after being hired on full time for 6 months my job was eliminated.  They have very poor communication between management/supervisor and regular employees.  No two people give you the same answer when you ask a question.  If you are wanting an easy job where all you have to do is read a script this would work for you.
good,"Equifax is undergoing a huge amount of change and transformation due to the data breach a year ago. "
good,Inbound/outbound calls all day.  Most contacts are courteous and professional. Overall it is good company to work for.  Success is dependent upon the responsiveness of outside parties to complete paperwork.
good,Working a data vision was ok. They like to hire young people and pay very little for the amount of work and responsibility they put on a employee. The job is fairy easy but they are not too flexible when it comes to family emergency and time off work. Management is great they are very down to earth and helpful always
good,The position at Equifax was fulfilling and I excelled at the daily tasks but I was laid off because the department closed. They offered challenging tasks but I was not able to reach my full potential within the company.
good,Management was supportive in all aspects of the job.  Great learning opportunity regarding the multiple products available to sell/consult with for assigned client base.
good,Nice position for someone looking for a flexible working environment. Lots of freedom to get wok completed on your own schedule. Ability to  make as much money as you want depending on how hard you want to work.
good,A good place to work if you like talking on the telephone and working in Audit and Transcribing information.  Everyone worked well as a team together.  Will understand if you need time off
good,Collections jobs are not easy to do on a Government contract. I called people all day long. The job was was the same day in and day out. I honestly did not like it.
good,"Once you become hired for the position there is not training , you will not have full knowledge of the job until 6 months to a year later . When you do ask for assistance it can get confusing and not helpful"
good,"Security breach has changed a lot of priorities and not all are defined yet.  Future litigation could create additional growth challenges."
good,"I was comfortable and learned a lot.. I met lots of talented people. I developed better customer service skills and gained more  technology knowledge, I was sad to have my job end."
good,Its a good place if you land up in right team. There is lot of internal changes happening and hence many people have left the company including senior management.
good,Very good team environment with cooperation with teammates in departments across the company. Training and assistance are available. Professional office appearance.
good,I generally liked working there. I learned more about how to deal with difficult people on the phone. My job was mostly talking on the phone making outbound calls all day. I had worked non call duties at times but mostly made phone calls all day.
good,"They didn't even really interview just took down my pertinent information,  When advised to meet at their office on the first day of the contract date and we'd all walk to the site together, They just directed me to the company's site."
good,Id work there again. Hours were convenient an the secured entrance was awesome. Very poor communication skills happening but very much enjoyed what I did
good,"Great company, great people. My only critique is that being new to the company it can be difficult to understand all the products they provide. Can be confusing."
good,"Equifax has a good work life balance.  Product management is an exciting and challenging field, and never a dull moment.  I've been able to implement multiple ideas for operational efficiency, as well as better client & employee engagement."
good,Equifax has a lot of stability and a long corporate history.  Business Units are run independently which is both a pro and con.  Management is hit or miss depending on whether your chain of command understand your technology stack and/or value.  Can be frustrating to pivot on work objectives 2-4 times per year.
good,Work in a hardworking friendly atmosphere. Focussing on the customer service with internal and external customers. Fantastic opportunity for internal development and promotion.
good,Equifax is the right company for the right person.  It is better to have the background that is needed to be successful.  There are a lot of moving parts and transitions taking place.
good,"Equifax has developed clicks that keep certain people from moving up in the company. It's not a good thing when you have great people working for you.  It's like they really don't want you to be a leader, only a follower."
good,"Good ole boy club -- 1000 dollar suits and Starbucks runs are the only way to progress here. "
good,"good job/life balance but no much opportunity to grow if you want to advance."
good,Equifax is a good place to work.  The atmosphere is upbeat and productive. Every call is different and knowing how to adapt to each request is a challange.
good,"buen ambiente, empresa lidere en su sector."
good,A typical day at work was ok. No stimulation other than making outbound phone calls to verify employment. No understanding of family.
good,"This company is great. I love my managers and my team. They have a direct interest in my well being with the company."
good,"My first high school job, everybody wanted to be the manager so you really didn't know who to go talk to. I loved assisting customers with things, I loved my hours and the pay. The hardest part was doing another team member job if they fell to come through so you were really multi tasking on these job."
good,"I learned how to work at a fast pace, working with others and putting a smile on customers face when they receive there food."
good,"Nice places to work; the typical work day, updating credit reports for banks, and credit union. Part of the work will be researching information, talking on the phone with the creditors and the  borrower."
good,"7 am to 4 pm"
good,"Some days are more productive than others. Have to follow orders from Wells Fargo, which is very frustrating and ridiculous. Co-workers and managment are very friendly and helpful."
good,On the phone how to talk to people in a clam matter. people was nice to work with
good,"Nice co-workers and management tries to make work fun, however my job was very repetitive."
good,Large stable company with great benefits.  Consistent revenue flow and marketability
good,Great place to work.  So far the culture is okay.  I find that work-life balance depends on who you work for.  The people are very nice and friendly.
good,"How to provide Brokers consultative selling solutions for their client's Direct Marketing needs.  "
good,"Losing significant personal IP to work force reductions and replacing with lower expense, less experienced personnel"
good,I loved going to work everyday and being with my co-workers. Great first job out of college.
good,"Establish productive, professional relationships with key personnel for assigned strategic accounts, support sales team by creating new accounts set up, pricing, and product activation. Customer training, problem resolution and first level support to new and existing clients. Act as first point of contact for external customers for all business related needs. Responsible for creating monthly reports for external customers, providing credit and revenue data. Provide post-sales assistance support including product introductions, product migration, documentation, and distribution of technical materials. Effectively communicate with internal and external customers via email and phone. Coordinate training on products and services for both internal and external customers."
good,"hated HR and the favoritism management played, liked the long breaks we got, the work was easy and didn't get paid enough for it"
good,I enjoyed with the different variety of people I worked with everyday.
good,A very fast paced job that was very detailed to specific companies and state specific rules.. I learned alot about unemployment and state specific deadlines. Liked my co-workers and they were willing to help if you needed it. Hardest part was learn all the state specific details. Liked the fast pace of the job as it made the day go by fast.
good,Good industry. Very good industry.I like it a lot. Very good.
good,made collection calls & arranged payment.
good,"This is a great place to work, unfortunatly it does not have much room for advancement."
good,It was a pleasure assisting customers with credit inquiry disputes. While there a short period of time on a contract position I was able to not only assist with inquiries but I also gained knowledge of the credit reporting industry.
good,"I work for Equifax through a contract their company is great I think for their main employees. However, dealing with them through the contract can sometimes be tedious."
good,"pay is good, but the culture isn't that great. "
good,"I was able to move up quickly and used this job as leverage to relocate.  As a remote employee, you do not get a lot of culture, but if you do work hard, it can be rewarded."
good,always trained employees with new programs and the benefits were good but reduced at certain point. the salaries were decent and there was not flex time.
good,"The workplace culture needs to be better established to promote career advancement and inclusion of diverse opinions in decision making."
good,"Productive and friendly work environment. Very reasonable rate of pay and benefits package. Good client relations. Multi-tasking makes the work day go quick,  Mid-Management and Management are suspect at times."
good,"Informative Environment, Departmentally Diverse, Flexible with work life balance. Allows for continued  learning throughout the organization. Forever growing"
good,job is not challenging- role changing drastically and becoming task based and elementary many unhappy employees very little direction and unobtainable goals
good,I enjoyed my time and i owe them to obtaining alot of my new experience but there isn't much room to advance in the long term of things.
good,Good company. Made great friends. Work environments can sometimes feel micromanaged.
good,Need to have the manager out more to encourage her team employees more. And talk to them once in awhile individually to fin DC out if things are going ok on the job and at home. Just take the time to know your team individually. Show more co.passuon at times to the team and person.
good,"Pretty good work environment. I would recommend for learning a whole lot . There is also work life balance somehow . i personally enjoyed, but it depends on which department you are in."
good,"In the relatively short time I've been there, Equifax has changed a lot. In another to years, I imagine parts of Equifax will be a completely different company. "
good,Enjoyed working there. Lots of work with no proper prioritization. Too much change at one time with no proper communication. Lots of great professional people. Well paid but lots of hours. Expected to check email 24x7x365
good,it is a good company to work for if you get the right supervisor it is fast paced and a lot of drama hardest part is having people complain about the calls they have to make its a call center
good,There was a great deal of culture change in the 9 years I was there.  Some for the better some not.  Colleagues were great to work with. Always a lot of work with offshore (awesome people)
good,Equifax is a great company for someone going to school. They are very flexible.
good,"Fast passed position, type of work could become repetitive."
good,"Great team of people, a really great manager, insufficient compensation.  There was an ice machine, a ping pong table, and three refrigerators in the break room.  The coffee was sub-par."
good,"I got the opportunity to work on new technologies and products. Management was supportive and gave due credit for the work I did. The team size is small, so every individual gets to contribute and feel a sense of responsibility."
good,productive day at work was making sure customers was happy meeting my goal for the day learning different task etc. Love the people I worked with very nice environment really had no hard parts the most enjoyable part of the day just knowing I did my job goals and no complains
good,Job is extremely stressful and fast paced. Work/life balance isn't so great. Co-workers are simply the best and helpful.
good,"Equifax trained in every area, so you don't have to worry about being blind about your job. There were always opportunities to advance."
good,Very Little room for growth. Been with the company for 4 years.
good,"Empresa internacional  prestigiosa con una vision de inovacion constante que permite desafios constantes , pero de pocas libertad de decisiones locales , totalmente dependiente de los lineamentos entregados por parte de casa matriz en Usa."
good,"I very much enjoyed working at Equifax.  Enjoyed the people, management, and benefits.  They decided to close our office out of the blue, and that is why I am leaving."
good,"Company very flexible. No clear career path.  HR very busy, but people don't feel movement. No learning and development programs to build skills and enhance performance.  It is very important that this be a top down approach where management makes it priority."
good,"•	Take inbound and outbound calls"
good,"El ambiente laboral muy agradable con todas las comodidades, un jefe directo ,respetuoso, muy responsable."
good,"Excelente, empresa excelente para trabalhar, mas a empresa foi extinta."
good,"Assisting businesses to make more informed marketing, credit and collection decisions by using the Equifax suite of products developed around its core hub of unique business and consumer data."
good,"A typical day at Equifax was easy going and organized ,I learned how to adjust to change on a consistent basis. Management was well organized  but the hardest part of the job was working at a extremely fast pace which I started to enjoy because it made the work day go by fast as well"
good,"I was hired as a contract worker.  My original contract says one year temp-to-hire. I've been there over a year now and there's still no sign of a permanent position.  There was a high turnover happening when I first started.  Within my first 7 or 8 months there I saw close to 10 employees from my team let go/leave for various reasons.  The original manager I had was replace by our team lead as well.  Again, the workload is agreeable, but the morale has taking a bad hit."
good,and that's unfortunate.  typical day is working on projects.  servicenow builds.  firewall implementation.  office response.  not a good upper management structure.
good,The company I worked for was an arm of the Equifax Enabling Technologies department. That company has since been sold at least two other times. It was a good place to work. Nice coworkers.
good,Great place and matrix organization. Plenty of career growth opportunities for development when you remain focused and sort thru obstacles. Being able to have a level influence will also assist in personal career advancement.
good,"Equifax was a great company to work for, paid training and great people to work with. Canada operations went to the US, and closed jobs here in Halifax."
good,"The culture within my department is very professional and the development of programs, initiatives and personnel are accelerated.  The growth in the maturity of the program and its responsibilities require a strong work ethic.  The demands of the job frequently extend beyond normal work hours and require an average of 50-60 hours per week."
good,"The job was easy and day to day was pretty routine but meeting their quota every day was beyond reach most days, as the quotas were so high. The job was too demanding."
good,Productive and fun working place.   Tasks are assigned by product owner.  Need to complete the work within fixed time duration.  One has the flexibility to choose task.
good,The workplace environment is so laid back. Team leads are very helpful and attentive. Easy Training. Great snack selections in the break room. Well organized.
good,"As a fulfillment analyst, the typical day began and ended the same way, processing large batches of credit data through IBM or Linux systems, generating visualizations of trended data, and returning this data to the clients. There was plenty of support from your coworkers, team leads, and management, and the work was challenging. However, there was a lot of pressure from the sales force to deliver data using systems and models that were not ready for production based on promises made to clients that were wholly unrealistic. If the data returned was erroneous because the models had not been properly validated by another department that was unwilling to communicate with the outside, the FA could and would be held at fault. Fortunately, this was not a common occurrence, as QC and QA procedures were very tight across the whole organization. Institutional inertia could be challenging because there was pressure to migrate programs to newer platforms while maintaining timetables. Often because of the effort required to migrate, the sentiment was to not fix was wasn't broken, but migration was a component of job responsibility."
good,Typical day of work is very busy and on the go. Management and co-workers are great! Very flexible with work from home option if needed.
good,"I receive and make outbound calls to different employers to verify employment for one of their employees who may have applied for a mortgage or refinance through a mortgage lending institution. I audit documents that are received from employers and reach out to the employer if they have completed the form incorrectly and guide them or provide feedback so that the form can be correct for the underwriter. I have learned about different lending institutions, how to audit a document for any errors. I enjoy working and helping others I would have to say the hardest part of my job is trying to explain to an angry caller that we are not the bank directly but a 3rd party verifier."
good,"I loved working for this company, they relocated to Alanta Ga and closed the modesto calif, met alot of good friends there we are still friends. But compensation is very low was 8.00 hr."
good,Lá é gostoso trabalhar
good,I worked for Equifax and do not want to provide a review.  It's like any other company.  Some people enjoy working there and other people do not enjoy working there.
good,"Mission: Equifax is a global data, analytics, and technology company. We believe knowledge drives progress. We blend unique data, analytics, and technology with a passion for serving customers globally, to create insights that power decisions to move people forward."
good,I liked working with the company. Benefits were good but pay could have been better. Room for advancement not very actualized. Flexibility to work from home was appreciated.
good,This was a very stressful job but at least I was able to work from home.  The company is not very client friendly unless it is a client that will bring a lot of money.
good,The hardest part of the job is managing development and addressing production issues. Management does a good job of staying consistently with the business model.
good,"Great people undertaking significant change.  Good culture and work / life balance.  Recommend as a good place to work in Canada."
good,"Equifax was fun, however it was a high it was fast paced and very goal oriented. There was not much time to get to know co-workers. Job stability was up and down with the housing market."
good,"Great platforms, intelligent personal, accessible tools to make you successful, great education portal to advance your career. Access to personal coaching to assure your success."
good,"Great work environment, good culture.  Company was innovative in its market.  It's unfortunate that the company didn't have strict enough process and procedures and didn't invest enough in security to allow a data breach."
good,At this time I am not at liberty to disclose any information about this employer. I am unable to give a review about this company due to confidentiality agreement
good,Management have to change a bit and think about the employee satisfaction rather than only business. Work from home option should be present at least.
good,Multinacional sometida a los continuos cambios de la globalización.
good,"Fun to work here.  "
good,"Overall the job was great, advancement was quick, very fun stress free place at times fast paced, provided training and since it was call center, provided tea and coffee."
good,"This job is definitely taxing: both physically and mentally. Sitting for long hours and dealing with a plethora of personalities can be cumbersome at times. But, the coworkers and leaders were great people to work with."
good,"They are using new Tech but new to Agile and they didn't really pay high. Good company to work, nice people. And a lot of thing can be learned from here"
good,Equifax has strong financial performance and good leadership.  Being an oligopoly makes the business strong as well.  There are challenges there like any other company especially to differentiate themselves from their main competition.  The work life balance is very good.  Opportunities for advancement get more difficult for senior level employees.
good,A productive overall quiet workplace.  You couldn't talk or move around at all.  It was a flexible job when it came to family emergencies.
good,"A job fit for those that are quick. The requirements are not high. It's a good job, you are able to talk with others during work, take breaks, and it's not too high demanding."
good,"Fulfill projects; check your deliverables and timelines; coding, testing and implementation; peer, manager and project manager interaction"
good,"Great people to work with and learn from, however management had a tendency to change the culture.  More opportunity for advancement would make Equifax an ideal place to work for an indefinite time."
good,"I offer strong organizational abilities, finely tuned communication skills (appropriate to instruction and educational areas) and a laser focus with respect to continuation of my career goals. I have complete confidence in my ability to master this new career.  My dedication to the task at hand is absolute. I always give 100% effort toward every assignment. I thoroughly enjoy my chosen field and pay special attention to meeting rigid quality standards"
good,"Variety of day to day activities depending on your role. "
good,"good working environment"
good,"Roles and responsibilities:"
good,"investigative work very interesting"
good,In the middle as far as business settings. Mix of business and casual enviroment
good,"Team environment, stayed busy, ability to choose shift, learned right-faxing, unemployment insurance, worked with employers and state consultants, made many friends through co-workers.  Once every three months, a group of us would get up really early and go have breakfast at the Cracker Barrel before work.  Birthdays and anniversaries were always celebrated at work.  The company had a ""Fish Committee"" which created treasure hunt games, etc., to make the workplace fun."
good,"Very demanding work environment, but great learning opportunities and great leaders to work with and learn from."
good,Nice and friendly co workers. Helpful managers that help you succeed.
good,Strong leadership team.  Values employees.  Good co-workers.
good,"En los ultimos 12 meses todos, a excepcion de solo una persona, en el equipo de Recursos Humanos se han ido de la empresa. Caras nuevas llegan, caras relativamente antiguas se van, y esto ocurre en promedio cada 4 a 6 meses. No parece haber estabilidad en dicha area y lo que es peor aun, es justamente el area que deberia mostrar union y motivacion a los empleados de una organizacion."
good,I learned a lot from the company Equifax. This is where I got my start in the mortgage industry
good,Evaluated insurance policies for one of the top insurance companies. Reviewing and auditing policy. Evaluate job application for potential new employees and training them once hired. This was a great job experience and I enjoyed working here.
good,"Learned much with EMS and further expanded my career into the world of commercial collections. Learn much from the sales staff, my direct manager, and account receivables department."
good,"It's a nice place to work with good people in the company. "
good,Great Management. Very Approachable. Strong technical leads who help you guiding your career. Open to various tools and technologies.Work can be hectic at times.
good,"I had 3 different supervisor within 6 months, which meant that expectations changed a lot. Within a 4 month period, we had 5 new QA for a 3 person team."
good,You work with many different technology vendors so you get to learn many of the platforms that are in demand in the workforce. The company's size is a pro and a con with the typical pros and cons of any other multi billion dollar company. The hardest part of the job was lack of enough staff due to a myriad of reasons so unfortunately sometimes you do work some crazy hours but that's the norm depending on your position.
good,"The work environment is good, management is eager to see you growth if you put forth the effort. The monetary compensation is fair, not great. Work life balance is great if you have access to work from home or live a short distance from your office."
good,"I answered a high volume of inbound calls within the call center. Helping customers reset passwords,  getting profile and demographic information for Equifax.  Very high security within the system and customers information. I made changes or updated information that was as needed. I was very peasant and cordial at all times even when some of the customers went off on me for not becoming biligerent or nasty to them as they were to me."
good,"I started as a temp for Equifax. I performed very well in every department or task I was given. I was compensated fairly per my salary, but I was not given benefits."
good,"Empresa para permanecer un tiempo, de transito ya que no contratan a su personal externo aunque hagan su trabajo mucho mejor que los de planta."
good,I was able to gain more experience in data entry and the job was pretty good. They were relocating at the time and their was no public transportation so I didn't go.
good,Management was not investing in new solutions.  Innovative products were needed to grow the business towards high-value offerings.  Clients were demanding thought-leadership and this was lacking.
good,"Don't have any direct feedback since I was a consultant and far removed from management levels. From an outside perspective however, I saw this as a positive workplace."
good,"Rotina tranquila no dia a dia, a atividade requer total concentração e atenção, treinamentos eram regulares, a gerência nos passava confiança, feedback era frequente, tive a oportunidade de acompanhar a evolução da empresa no momento da alta da tecnologia, isso foi algo que me motivou muito profissionalmente."
good,Data Entry and Customer Service.  I learned to broaden my Administrative skills.  Management was pleasant to work with and fare.  This was a team environment.  The hardest part of the job was the compensation.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the work schedule and the location.
good,"Equifax is a great entry level job for customer service. Great hours, very laid back environment and the people are really nice and helpful."
good,"Mucha actividad, he aprendido y desarrollado nuevos Skills, mis colegas y los colaboradores en General son muy nobles y se adaptan a los cambios."
good,"Had 3 managers in 14 months, two of them offsite in Atlanta (as opposed to Dallas) and didn't understand what our team was doing.  Very quiet office, some support of birthdays/weddings.  However, when people left, sometimes there was a big party and sometimes it was nothing.  Had long term contractors working that were not acknowledged.  However, they were very lenient about needing to leave for doctors appointments and such"
good,"Preping the chicken to be cooked, cooking the chicken.  Cleaning the kitchen and eating areas after work hours and keeping it clean through out the day.  Enjoyed management as well as my co-workers.  Lunch and dinner rush hours were the hardest but we always seemed to get through them."
good,O ambiente é agradável e as pessoas que eu conheci também são legais e competentes.
good,Calculated. Finance moves slowly. Management. Great. Trying to grow the systems. People
good,"Log in enjoy your work"
good,"This company does important work, and has transformed quickly into a high-tech collector and analyzer of data. The people are great to work with, the work environment is generally good. Still recovering from a massive data breach in 2017, but the future generally looks good in light of significant new investments."
good,"Pros"
good,"Enjoy the remote work, enjoy speaking with different people. The work will be different from day to day depending on the kinds of clients you service."
good,"Expectations do tend to communicated on a regular and concise basis, but there were often changes which could render it confusing when it came to following current guidelines. It's been a year and a half since I was employed there, so it's very possible that the environment is not as dynamic as it was when I was experiencing it."
good,"Good incentives and high end cx Satisfaction was delivered by the compny ."
good,"Equifax is a nice place to work in.  A lot of opportunities to learn new skills. Work culture is really nice, everyone is very helpful. The only negative point is no WFH for contractors."
good,"Stable, growing company with opportunity for advancement. Overall, great people, solid management. Culture of meritocracy. Competitive benefits. A global company with presence in 24 countries."
good,"ya pasaron años, agudizo mi aprendizaje que todo es posible si se maneja la información en tiempo y forma"
good,"Excelente ambiente laboral, donde tu equipo se apoyara a si mismo."
good,Learned a lot of new technologies and had a great supportive team to work with. Had to spend long hours initially to get the project in flight and the effort paid off with good job satisfaction.
good,Es un ambiente laboral competitivo debido a los agentes sin embargo el esfuerzo no es reconocido por los superiores.
good,This was a Cubicle style office with different departments all working on different aspects of the company.  The culture was pretty nice but as with any office there were groups.
good,enjoyed contact with the customers as well as finding solutions for credit inquiries. the environment was very relaxed however we were located in the midst of spaghetti junction a very busy place throughout the day; traffic always bad.
good,Learned a lot on the job.  Had some very good training opportunities and I had the benefit of working with some exceptional people.  Over time the company itself took a tougher corporate hold on our smaller office and the culture was shifting to a more corporate texture instead of the more familiar culture that was there.
good,Everyone is very approachable to answer any questions.  The company is very conservative and the culture could use a little more energy and strategy.  Very difficult to get things done at times by being such a large organization.  Very stable company but could use some formal training programs for those looking to advance their careers and can benefit from a little more transparency from upper management.
good,"Bien, Aprendi mucho, fue en la genrecia de finanza, "
good,"A typical day at work for myself includes coming in and identifying what needs to be actioned as a priority and share with the team and my manager what my day will be like as per the work load. I will then communicate with other colleagues in and around the business. The workplace culture at Equifax is good, people look out for one another and are able to identify whether someone needs help or not. The hardest part of my job would be when we have a lack of information provided by the Sales Managers but I turn this around by putting an e-mail together of what I think they are requesting from me and this turns out to be what the Sales Managers are wanting. The most enjoyable part of my role is that my manager often allows me put my view forward if I can see something that could be changed to better a process we are currently working by."
good,"Being a member of the ""Advance Delivery System"" team is a privilege. I have worked among great individuals who value not only the support and the service we offer to our members, but also emphasize on teamwork."
good,"the people around you are nice and  they are very helpful. "
good,"Great company with lots of opportunity to advance your career. Great leadership and strategy for future growth and have people to execute against that strategy. "
good,"enjoyed my time there.  Great people to work with and work for ,lots to learn in a short amount of time . long days during tax season."
good,Many remote offices and business units. HQ in Atlanta and second location for centralized operations is St. Louis. Very progressive management with high expectations and accountability.
good,With Equifax I would make outbound calls to employers and HR departments to verify past or present employments for home mortgages
good,"Es un lugar donde puedes crecer y desarrollar tuspotencialidades si asi lo deseas, Porque aun tiene mucho camino por acvanzar."
good,No real complaints other than depending on the business unit you work in exposure to newer technology is limited.  Most management maintains an open door policy and for the most part the company operates based off a meritocracy.
good,"During the time that I worked here, It was unclear to me what the expectations for the job actually were, my job role changed 3 times in the course of a year and a half.  However, I did learn a lot and the training that was provided was good. My stay there was short."
good,Learned alot of the different unemployment laws with different states.
good,overall the job was laid back no real serious hard work. just wish it wasn't a temporary position
good,"Good company to work for.  Good benefits, long hours...good people to work with."
good,"Reuniones diarias de tareas realizadas durante jornada anterior, posibles problematicas surgidas para buscar solucion y tares consideradas para el dia.(SCRUM). Estas reuniones podian ser con gente en Chile o USA. por lo tanto el nivel de ingles era muy importante."
good,"I was proud and enjoyed being an employee at Equifax. I worked with several teams which allowed me continued success. I was able to learn many new and challenging items in the financial and credit industry. There was some difficult and challenging times, when projects were changed due to reorganization within the company which at times impacted there completion."
good,Decent place to work we have benefits and PTO (Paid time off) we also have 2 week paternity leave for men unfortunately we have expensive health care.
good,"Job security was the biggest problem. Management constantly shuffled resources like the guy you see with the three cups and a pea hidden under one. It was a nice place in the sense that other employees were generally nice and respectful. However, none of the projects seemed to make it off the ground or were quite often cancelled just before launching. It got to be a bit frustrating, but also a running joke with employees. Then they started to lay off people in droves and eventually your number got called."
good,"Large company atmosphere.  The company intranet is large and comprehensive.  (Lots of information).  Equifax keeps employees well informed about the direction of the company"
good,As with any company there were ups and downs. I worked  with a great bunch of dedicated and hard working people who were always willing to help each other out.
good,"Great place to work, good learning opportunities, average work life balance, good management, great cafeteria. "
good,"My role was very busy, never a dull day!  I really liked my team and my Leader.  I thought I'd always be at Equifax, but some things change that you can't do anything about."
good,"Buen lugar de trabajo, se practica el trabajo en equipo."
good,Professional but competitive environment. Pay was base + commission. Constantly on the phone.  Day and evening hours but consistant. Management was very involved and helpful.
good,I think it has its pros and cons but overall a healthy company to work for. The management is great and encourages a diverse workplace. I would recommend to others.
good,Equifax really cares about its people and is adept to change. Management recognizes and rewards those that work hard and make a difference. The environment is relaxed and very collaborative! It is growing quickly and supports those that want to make improvements!
good,"A typical workday involved managing a team in St. Louis, Des Moines, and Costa Rica. Unfortunately due to the remote locations communication was a chore but we did so effectively. Management who did not have direct contact with these teams would take trips to visit the teams however the direct managers would have been more effective. "
good,"They really work with you and try their best to make working their a good place and good environment. Co-workers are really nice and laid back if they've been there for awhile. The only problem is that the work can be very repetitive and if you have a night shift...then work days are really long. Pay isn't entirely the best, but you have multiple opportunities to get a full time position."
good,"Overall a great company to work for especially if you are starting your career and want to advance. If you like a challenge, are analytical and intelligent, it is a great place."
good,"Empresa de Servicios Financieros muy dinámica en constante crecimiento, posibilidades de movilidad a otras regiones donde se ubica la compañía."
good,Ce fut une belle expérience  de travailler chez equifax belle ambiance de travail
good,"This is a good place to work but just keep in mind that title means everything here.  A developer here is essentially a resource to be used by other members on the team.  You will own nothing.  Your ideas and opinions are not welcome unless you are of a high enough title.  Some companies will want you to own and be responsible for your design work as a software engineer.  Here, you are expected to implement someone else's design instead and have little to no say on the design, the processes, or any kind of business decisions.  I feel more like a contractor here rather than a full-time employee despite full-time status."
good,"Very supportive management with a vested interest in employee development.  Large company feel, lots of resources, appropriate recognition, politics,and  red tape.  Organization composed of a matrix of silo's.  One of the biggest challenges is navigating inside the company."
good,"Everyday I received a lot of people with different kinds of financial problems and I learned many ways to solve them and advise them."
good,"1. worked collection file while managing groups that varied in size from 12 to 20 FTE"
good,Equifax has been a great opportunity for me. Great work/life balance and job security. Management is very supportive and encourage professional advancement.
good,"A Equifax me possibilitou crescer muito, amadurecer como profissional, aprender bastante e confiou bastante no meu trabalho, me possibilitando e apoiando novas iniciativas."
good,For the short time we were under the Equifax umbrella the company was very to us in the situation we were put in.
good,"Equifax is a great company to work for. Equifax is a caring company and is willing to work with everyone's schedule, which is part of the reason I like working for this company. This company has helped me get my foot in the door, but now I am looking for a career."
good,"This was a good career start, good benefits, retirement and matching funds."
good,"The people I worked with were all excellent professionals and a pleasure to work with. There was mostly a sense of shared success, and willingness to do what was needed to succeed"
good,"Young and vibrant workforce with great ideas and thoughts being shared.  On the local level (Charleston, SC), a genuine feeling that the local leaders care about the workforce.  One action that speaks louder than words was the evaluation of the impacts of increasing commute times on the workforce due to increasing traffic volume in the area.  Leadership conducted a study and implemented a policy of allowing 2 days per week that each employee could work from home.  This is one example of a  meaningful response by leadership to a problem expressed by the workforce.  Great work."
good,"Great culture, commute to Mid-Town was a challenge when most everyone preferred to work from the Alpharetta, GA location.  Great working conditions in the various facilities."
good,"Equifax is a great company to work for because they hire from within."
good,"Lot of inexperienced people, interns and rookies making it a fun place to work. Good products. Good AIP payout, insurance. Flexibiity and cool place to work."

good,Great place to work and advance career. Offers options to work in different groups. Provides great customer service to all customers. Focus on building applications with the latest technologies.
good,"Back in the day this place used to be great, then all the worked got laid off and all the work went to Costa Rica. By the end they didn't care about their workers or even the fact that most of them were at their pension age and no other company would hire them after being laid off."
good,"There are lots of opportunities to learn new products and enhance knowledge, participate in company saving projects, and improve all processes for current products."
good,Role definitions need to improve.  Potential organizational restructure and align is needed to be more efficient to improve the culture. The company is embracing Agile but is in the early adoption stages.
good,"It's a good place to work."
good,"It has been 22 years since I worked at Equifax so I can only give my perspective of working there in the early 90's.  I enjoyed my time at Equifax, the fellow employees where great to work with. Management was good and treated everyone fairly.  Overall a good place to work and start my professional career."
good,"Loved working there , co workers were very nice and the office was drama free which is a great plus ! We Handle employment verification so it was pretty easy for the lost part"
good,The department is a fast paced environment because of the change in strategy for the business division. Loads to learn!!

good,customer service
good,I really enjoyed working there during the duration of my time. I was able to advance greatly in my accuracy of my data entry skill. My coworkers were fun and easy to get along with. The only thing I didn't like was at lunch there was only one phone to use that we all had to share during that hour.
good,"As being one of the three largest credit rating organizations, it is a very good place to work within the Metro Detroit area."
good,Unremarkable.  Daily work was highly stressful.  Minimal education opportunities. Culture was who you know not what you know. Hardest part of job was resentment from management
good,"The company is experiencing quite a lot of changes on IT side. As contractor worked in short period of time, my overall experience was good, but the changes impact me by their funding. It's not very stable if you work as contractor like me."
good,"Building a workplace culture that prioritizes belonging and inclusion is the best way to attract diverse and talented people, create a sustainable workforce, and—most importantly—make employees feel supported."
good,I liked working at Equifax. I worked on my way up to become a supervisor and then manager.  I commited to this job from a day one. I am a fast learner and loyal to Equifax. I always go extra mile to get works done and willing to work under presssure.
good,Good starting experience with ability to move up quickly. Quick turn around rate due to  employees who just want a paycheck without actually wanting to work for it.
good,"Excelente empresa. Con oportunidades de crecimiento, muy buen trato entre los compañeros, facilidad de adaptacion a los cargos laborales"
good,"Enjoyed working here.  I actually loved the work I did as well as the team.  Unfortunately, company was hit hard with layoffs after the breach.  Would recommend."

good,The most difficult part of this job is keeping up with the pace of change within the company. Equifax is focused on reclaiming the trust of the public and doing what it takes to do so and this results in a lot of changes and a dynamic environment.
good,"Fast pace from beginning to the end of the thee   day .Need to listen to why the deputy is calling and if the information has not been provided, let the deputy know it needs to be requested and the time frame given to obtain the information. Make sure I give the date the request should be back my name, asking if there is anything else I can assist with.  I love help assisting the deputy so they can get the job done."
good,"I learned a lot working for Equifax.  The opportunities I had there positioned me for my career advancements in the workforce.  As expected, the culture here is very corporate.  However, during my time there, it was a little more laid back and family friendly."

good,"The management is very helpful to get you through tough situations when you are under pressure. Workplace environment is friendly. You can also work you way up to different roles in the company. Overall, its suitable company to work."
good,Daily meeting with management. Log into my computer look over reports from the previous day . Check to see if any documents have been faxed or mailed back to me regarding the information I requested. Then begin my day qc reports from investigators. What I learned most from my job is dealing with people when you have to return a report with an error he/she has made. The most enjoyable part of my job is since I'm a senior so that means  I can work any type of credit report that is presented to me and every file is not the same so I get to work on something different file every day
good,"Outbound calls had to be made correctly , any mistake was reported and informed to us which made the job difficult for me . The only mistakes i made was the the employers we talk to did not want to cooperate with us and affected my score . I gained experience on performing outbound calls and experience in data entry , which had to be done together making multitasking a greater strength for me ."

good,Equifax is a great place to work. You work hard with your team and a lot is learned during the projects. You are encouraged to spend time with your family so that your life is balanced.
good,"In my previous review for the same company, Equifax was a great employer to me for close to nine years.  I met a number of lifetime friends, and treasure the years I spent there."
good,My concern is the recent breach and our ability to execute and survive.--but a great company that I would be happy to stay with assuming we can rebound!
good,We were to call former employers to verify employment for our partner companies. not real stressful. sometimes had to wait for call backs from former employers. Some did not give information for legal reasons.
good,"Came into work everyday and had my own desk to make calls verifying employment on behalf of Wells Fargo. The work was very easy to complete but could be stressful at times. Learned skills on the computer and how to upload documentations. Management was very nice and kind, but wasn't always there for help on the floor. Company had lots of pot lucks and events for employees to interact with."
good,This is where I really was able to learn and grow in a corp world. I learned how to manage and how to balance meeting production and employee needs. I was put into a position where I could learn and grow in that setting.
good,It was a good company although i wanted something different I didn't like how it was just seasonal and not for long term and I feel they need to work more on making it not seasonal
good,"There are different departments and different teams. But each person is assigned to work at a good pace and get job done. The job is to make calls all day to verify employment. It easy and smooth especially being around others trying to get the job done as well,"

Internal structure and departments are clearly defined. Inter-deparmental interactions are encouraged through appropriate channels to participate in improving the culture and company performance. People are diverse and respectful. New, young employees can make a great start, as the company is seeking new, fresh talent but should have experience in the markets they serve."
good,"I held a number of jobs working at Equifax. I started out as a scheduler, then moved to scheduler supervisor and then on to a couple of other positions. All of the positions I held I worked with either running production jobs, setting up criteria the customer ask for in order to send credit mailings to approved people. I worked also automating processes so that it was pretty much hands off. "

It was a part-time position, and I got to meet several people from all walks of life and learn from them.  I was a full-time student during the day while I worked at Equifax.  If one of us was about to fall asleep behind the computer, the others would nudge that person.  Most part-time workers at Equifax worked at other jobs or attended school during the day.  It was my second job in Canada and my first office job experience.  The hardest part was staying awake at the computers past 8:30 p.m.  I drank coffee to stay awake.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the jokes that some data entry clerks would give.  We also made each other laugh if they were beginning to get sleepy.  We worked as a team.

Started out in the steno pool, transcribing reports for insurance companies.   Was made Steno Supervisor within two years and was in charge of 25+ stenos.   I learned to transcribe reports, how to deal with various personalities with fellow employees.   Management was great, they were strict, but as long as you did your job, you had no problems.   The co-workers and field reps were all great and we eventually became like family and several are still good friends.   The hardest part of the job was letting someone go(on Managers orders) because they weren't  typing their quota. The most enjoyable part of the job was having time to enjoy having fun with your co-workers, Halloween party, picnics, Christmas party.
