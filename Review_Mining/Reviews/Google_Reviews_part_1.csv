rating,review
bad,"Bad management,,,,  no leadership .... no guidance ... impossible expectations. They expect a person to read the mind of the manager ... the manager needed to clone himself and do the job himself."
bad,Its fun to work there but remember you will lose the sense of your belongings outside of google. No work life balance.  Over all not recommended with people with family.
bad,"I do not work for Google, I work for Allied Universal. Google is Allied's client. Google chose security companies that they want to work in their building. Allied Universal was selected by Google. Allied Universal hires the security officers to work in the Google building."
bad,"The conditions were not safe management was a joke.  OSHA was call and they cut our hrs, and trying to get relocated for more hours they refused to even try to work with us"
bad,"Management at Google has very low regard for anyone who comes in as a contractor. Very low percentages of people will get converted into a direct position, regardless of the quality of your work. "
bad,"Hated working here. "
bad,"Dangles conversion promises in front of you to work you to the bone. Never follows through with conversion promise. A revolving door for temps, vendors and contractors."
bad,"It is amazing to me that a multi billion dollar company has zero control over its employees. They are rude, and act like they can treat consumers how ever they want - which is usually like a arrogant immature employee - or a hacker that could care less about others because they have never interacted with others in society - because they are so consumer with being on a computer, hacking, or playing video games. AKA no personality, no class, no soul. This is the world online and tech has grown. I cant imagine what will happen to the world in the years to come - when every employee that works at a tech company can treat consumers without respect."
bad,"Complete and utter bias, toxic, I would avoid, pays little, works you 60 hours a week with constant corporate propaganda. No respect for the individual, all about teh agenda."
bad,"don't care about the employees, only their numbers of reaching goals and what not. wouldn't recommend anyone to join google if you guys are interested."
bad,Workload wasn't that much but was pushed on the shoulders of few coworkers and the others sat around and did nothing. All the work and ideas that were given were credited to the wrong people.
bad,"Work anywhere but Google;"
bad,"There is no work life balance. The benefits were good, free food and insurance. They have shuttle buses and free  food. Managers show favoritism and co workers gossip and backstab"
bad,By far the worst company i ever worked for. I was employed through a sub contractor who just one night packed up and left state with all the money. They left 15 employees stranded in texas with no money no way home and without any reason.
bad,"Working in Same Day Delivery/Google Express was a nightmare. Employees and Managers were too rowdy, Too much independent work for 1 person, Not enough lunch breaks & the payroll will cut weekly pay most of the time."
bad,"Adecco doesn't look out for their employees. They don't treat their employees good. They don't care if you do a good job, but if you make one mistake they give you a warning."
bad,"Managers have full reign to steer you in one direction, then turn around and criticize you when they change course. Co-workers are competitive and cut throat and will also try to manipulate situations.  HR does not help you.  Managers are able to tell their employees to threaten their staff and HR and Senior managers do nothing. The company hires under work permits so they don't have to pay double tax. This means you're not entitled to unemployment and cobra health care.  Google is the new Microsoft and the technology is dead."
bad,Took a huge pay cut throughout company which made a lot of people leave the team. Call center was the worse. They would be from other states in the country so they wouldn't understand the traffic patterns around this area and would get frustrated with the couriers when we wouldn't get to certain places at certain times.
bad,A job I started working straight out of college. The job may be terminated. A great learning experience and fun atmosphere.
bad,Dont bother. they fire and raise people all the time and you will waste your time. Goolge tells them what to do and they have no control over anything.
bad,"It was a job, that is really all it was.  Low pay, next to no benefits."
bad,This could be a good job but the company is too busy chasing the contract
bad,Working for the manager was a little hit and miss I was called twice to hand put leaflets but never received payment the second time. I could hand out the leaflets in my own time but the pay was very poor
bad,all levels of management do not have a clue what they're doing
bad,"Don't get me wrong. Most of the people I met and worked with and around were very nice. ALL WERE TERRIBLY SMART!"
bad,"There is no job security, after training and job performance they laid off half of the employees"
bad,"I did not like this job at all, all the windows were taped up so we didn't receive any sun light during a work day. They fired clusters of people daily for simple mistakes. Most of the supervisors treated you horribly."
bad,I have been working here for the past six months and my work was totally in Sourcing new clients for the company and into core recruitment
bad,Very bad managers. Those on work visa are only interested in getting GC by trampling on other co-workers. No clarity of project goals. Racial nepotism in full swing.
bad,"This job has very poor working conditions, unrealistic expectations, very poor salary and benefits, lack of advancement, poor managers and I could not recommend it to anyone."
bad,Company is full of know it alls that know nothing. Like working in a high school cliche situation. If you are friends then you advance. If you have a brain you are shamed.
bad,"Google has become a gigantic companies where every employee is just a number on the books. Management care more about promoting themselves vs. growing talents to achieve org and company goals.  "
bad,"Unless you want to become a modern day slave, run far away from Bon Appetite at Google. Working there was the worst professional experience of my life. I was hit on by chefs, treating very badly during my pregnancy there, and went weeks without being paid. I was lied to on numerous occasions, and retaliated against. When I asked for help when I was 8 months pregnant, I was told no."
bad,VERY bad diversity managerment from manager / NO training / wasted time in useless Stand up meetings / language barrier /  manager not available for help  /
bad,"I had my first job out of college here, and even though the offices are amazing, with all the perks you could ever want or expect, you work so much that this is basically no need for it, as me and most people in my team were working closer to 50-60 hours a lot of weeks than the 45 originally suggested in the contract. "
bad,"The experience here varies from team to team, however, a lot people are unhappy.  "
bad,"Working for Google is wonderful, but when you have a middle man such as Adecco it makes things very difficult in your work. Google is a great company and this opportunity is one to always remember."
bad,"Great perks and benefits. Terrible people management."
bad,Cool seeing new technology but stressful because of the hours.
bad,Google has a lot of perks and compensation is good.  Environment is cult like.  No diversity and inclusion.  They talk about it but dont know how to deliver.  The company hires a bunch of college grads and they grow up at google with no other experience.  They are all worried about their perf and miss focusing on customer need or efficiency.  If you are a college grad this is a good place to go.  If you are a experienced professional be prepared for a challenge
bad,"The department I was brought in to work for was dysfunctional at best, I was there as an expert in my field, but the resource did not utilize nor leverage my skills.  The resource had insecurity issues and stress attacks about their job.  Not a good experience with my direct reporting manager; however the other departments in our area seem to run better.  I had excellent feedback from the departments I worked with when I was able to work without a micro-manager so constricted by their own stress brought on totally by themselves or corporate goal that was too aggressive for them - totally bad experience."
bad,"Lots of perks at Google, but your experience will vary significantly depending on your team, manager and role.  Choose very carefully before making the leap."
bad,"Lavoro sedentario, monotono, ripetitivo e senza scatti di crescita"
bad,"Little to no benefits, treated as disposable, No autonomy, no room for advancement, no recognition for good work, management will throw you under the bus to spare their own ego"
bad,"typical day- involves doing investigations for gmail account claims"
bad,"Desks were taken away after the team was there for four days and manager was fired, we were told he was sick.  bad company. not worth working at."
bad,"Google Express was a startup - one month after relocating for my dream job, I was told that Google Express might be enduring layoffs. The next year was the worst layoff experience of my professional career. All of my resentment stems from the layoff of Google Express and the staffing agency that they hired and not of Google itself."
bad,"On the plus side they have 2 restaurants on site in Kirkland, WA. On the down side job expectations are extremely poorly defined so advancement is solely based on who you know. The methodology and quality control are mediocre at best."
bad,"Work could have been great, management was terrible.  The constant politics, favoritism and advancement opportunities for only the favored employees was unfair and the reason I left."
bad,"My manager was incompetent and possibly discriminatory towards people who had families. She had chosen not to have children and regularly gave team members who did have kids a sour face when they needed to work from home to take care of sick children.  She expected people to be on from morning until evening, and set goals that were impossible to reach without 80-hour workweeks. "
bad,"Worked there two years.  Two of the most miserable years I spent.  Job was boring, management was hostile and culture was very self absorbed and arrogant.  But hey they had great insurance and free lunches.  So, you are healthy and get 1 hour reprieve from the boredom."
bad,"If you're a Googler, Mazel Tov.  If you're not, it's a great place to work for one year.  They give you broad latitude to do whatever you want, so you can do nothing, you can find a real job or you can do something truly amazing to put on your resume.  Then, you've essentially become an expert in that area and you can use it to find a real job."
bad,"Poor management and leadership.  Little to no advancement possibilities.  Juvenile work environment with favoritism and cliques.  Good place to build agency, but not a job for a professional sales person looking for a career."
bad,"As a store operations lead, there is a lot of busy work to be done, but our voice is not heard. We are looking through a glass ceiling, never able to really advance, but still have exposure to what the higher ups in the company do on a daily basis. The hardest part of the job is managing the team, who is hired by recruiters through an easy hiring process. Most of our peers (co store leads) are amazing, and access to the Google campus is a huge plus as well."
bad,An area where I worked have a very bad management because they only do know about their staff not on people don't have a college degree or less.  They don't know how to manage their work load through out  the week.  For some who don't have a degree work a lots than people who earned a college degree.
bad,I really enjoy working at Google it don't feel like you are at work its a home feeling with good team work and helping and understanding management. there is always scope for growth and learning.
bad,"If your political views aren't in agreement with management, you'll be treated badly.  They will not let up until you leave.  It's all about politics."
bad,"For me the work environment is fun , with a cooperative colleague at work place. But , the management is sucks when they giving you 0 benefits to their staff."
bad,"Highly  professional. Very organized  . and excellent team members"
bad,I was a contractor for Google Maps. There was no path to becoming a Google employee. I was paid in experience instead of money and had to leave because I couldn't afford to work there any longer. I hear direct employees do quite well.
bad,"Its a very fun work place solely because of the awesome co-works , however the work you do is absolutely draining, this company has no training whatsoever, they have you shadow people who've barley even started. Its all mentally exhausting, you're cold calling, talking to business owners who get this phone call literally 10 times a day, so by the time you reach them they're irritated an annoyed . You're lucky if they hang up on you mid pitch, otherwise they'll verbally abuse you over the phone. The management isn't the greatest here either, maybe because its a new-ish company . The guy who's supposed to oversea the entire sales floor is only concerned on your Talk Time and Call Numbers ; YES you have a minimum # of calls you have to make by the end of the day. 90 calls 2:30 hrs of talk time, Sounds easy right? Except for the fact that half of the # you dial are blocked and everyone hangs up on you. So if you can handle a migraine for 8 hours a day, 5 days a week than this is the Job for you!"
bad,I never worked for this company so I do not have an opinion about the working conditions. Google seems to be a very progressive company and will likely continue to thrive.
bad,I was highly disappointed by the Revana system They were an Outsource system for Google. They would steal clients in  my opinion and send them over to other divisions they outsourced for or the reps would take Google account. Very poor module for Google.
bad,my family was financially not able to provide me proper education.i worked in google communication as a computer sales and repair agent so that i could collect some amount for my further education regarding CCIE (r&s).  REALLY i was suffering a lot at that time n literally i was going through hardest days.i even gave door to door service for computer sales and repair.
bad,"Fantastic job, fantastic project, fantastic people... management and leadership were sorely lacking. The move to California left many people in the lurch. Contractors were not offered positions there even though their jobs were needed."
bad,"Cognizant is our vendor and is the worst ever company I ever worked for, not recommended at all to anyone to work for a vendor, Google chooses this vendor to enslave the people"
bad,"terrible,its like going back to highschool. and management is the worst ,rude......the workers are rude young disrespectful and management doesnt say anything to anyone .............................................................................."
bad,"Took over my life. No time for anything, underpaid for 12 hour days. heavy work. no benefits. You would have to walk around egg shells with them to avoid getting fired."
bad,"The environment feels like being in high-school. The only thing missing is the bell ringing at the end of the day."
bad,Hands on motivated with quota objective met. Interaction with minorities enjoyable and a learning experience.
bad,The subcontractor we were employed under took a wonderful standing Google customer support center and burned it down to the ground. Constant threats about not meeting client goals to awful & discrimination from managment drove employees out the door. No opportunity for raises. Shut down due to subcontractor not standing by the employees.
bad,"Learned being part of team . however, it was a very unsatisfying and a not enjoyable job. Supervisors and leads were very under-qualified and did not perform a good job"
bad,Poorly ran both from Google and Adecco.  Treated horribly by higher level Google management.  The simple but unfortunate reality is you're a number.  That's it.  Period.
bad,"Completely disrespectful environment, the management for my vendor company, HCL, was extremely lazy, non-communicative, underpaying, and lacked knowledge of how to run a successful office. Leaving this place was one of the best things I could have done. Don't waste your time in one of Google's off-site vendor offices, they are toxic and you will feel like a line on a spreadsheet."
bad,The manger of the project didn't know what he was doing. the building was way too hot 90 degrees in the summer and 40 in the winter bad for electronics and working
bad,"contractor's not treated as same as employee, no chance of hire"
bad,"Google's management structure consists of a caste of managers whom freely rotate from project to project irrespective of their past performance or experience.  One of the 6 managers I had while I worked there (a period of 5 months) told us that 5/6 of his previous projects had been failures.  That's fine for him, but it's likely that all his employees in that department were laid off.  It's also likely that they were low-paid contractors.  I discovered that a large number of workers at Google were contractors being paid in the $10-14 per hour range.  Many of these contractors were also denied the famous free meals, bus service, and facilities of Google.  And they were reprimanded for riding the Google bikes, which are also famous for having a 50% theft rate, yet contractors couldn't use them..."
bad,"All that glitters is not gold! Hit the floor working non-stop from 9 am until 6 pm w/1/2 hr lunch. Small, non-diverse team. Almost non-existent and inexperienced upper management along with little documentation for the job. Rollouts of FTEs and TVCs, to budget for more engineers. No integration with other Google teams. Happy hour at 4 pm Thursday, the highpoint for many. Low work ethic. Frequent callouts. Constant meetings with little actual work done by few. Fit to team culture most important. Key players often out sick or on vacation. Chaos."
bad,"The marketing culture (not the engineering culture, mind you) is toxic and getting worse. New managers are brought in and pretend to be kind and genuinely care about your personal growth as long as their probation lasts. When their probation ends, you quickly realize that yelling and humiliating in public are the only management tools that they intend to keep. And they will keep yelling and humiliating until your projects hit a dead end and have to give up and leave your job so that there's more room left for new hires, also known as ""my people"" new hires."
bad,"If you ever join Google, BE VERY CAREFUL OF WHICH TEAM YOU JOIN. I was a part of the Android team and it was the worst. Culture was awful. Management was poor. Communication was the biggest problem with all the Indian people."
bad,"I was on the Google Play contract with Xerox for two years. The pay was less than stellar, the benefits were below par, and the work environment was a few card tables in a poorly ventilated room for the first few months I worked there."
bad,Bad structure and poor management. Nothing ever makes any sense. They have lied about its compensation in the beginning and snese then the pay structure still doenst add up.
bad,A good place to work if you are an overachiever and a self starter. There is not a lot of training available so you need to find the way yourself. The company does support good employees and will help out if your project ends.
bad,"I enjoy working with clients to create strategic advertising campaigns that will help them achieve his/her business goals. Occasionally, a client will take the time to write a letter of appreciation for my assistance and guidance."
bad,Didn't like this place. Everyone who worked here was on a two year contract. Co workers were cool
bad,"There was hope but one had to be employed by the original sub contractor above NCS, Red Rock."
bad,Was able to almost visibly see the difference in treatment between contractors and direct hired workers. Management will ask a lot of you with no explanations.
bad,"Management training is extremely poor. When Managers do not know what the next indicated step is, the work around is claiming ""ambiguous environment."""
bad,I like the job very much. I did what was ask of me. I learn a lot. but the management have a problem keep good workers.I am a eager family working man. I am a fast worker. I enjoy working for Google. So far it has been the best job I have every had.
bad,"the work place and culture is nice ."
bad,"no type of management whatsoever, so you may be confused as to who to call your superior. pretty simple and straightforward. you can request help whenever you feel like a job is too hard. good workout because sometimes you have huge packages and deliveries that require a lot of muscle strength. if you finish your job early, you have a lot of downtime."
bad,"It is just good for the new starters but not for professionals. There is no company culture, any benefits, any opportunities and so on. If you are ok to come at 8am and leave at 5pm by doing exactly same things and having 15 mins breaks (2 times a day) then come."
bad,"cons: Inconsistent scheduling, poor work/life balance, works outside in harsh weather conditions, management needs improvement, no commission, no consecutive days off, unorganized"
bad,"I was in a process of upselling the existing Google clients on their adwords account.  every day used to be a typical day at work because the responsibility was very high as google's 98% of income is from our process. I learned how to tackle clients in a professional manner and not just to maintain them in our business but also keep them always highly motivated. there was a mixed management and frankly speaking there was huge confusion of hierarchy. example for leave we had to contact our HR person, for incentive one manager, for process clarification training person, for escalation floor walker etc.  Indeed my co-workers are fine people to work with.  the hardest part of job is to be on one single call for more than 50 mins, however most enjoyable part was also the same as the customers used to be very interactive and professional.  overall the experience was good, however I decided to for forward in my career on the finance domain i selected.  And hence i decided to do SAP and explore my innovative thoughts in SAP industry."
bad,"A day at work would usually start at 6am at my location and wouldn't deal with customers but get things set up for orders."
bad,"Two different messages given to employees.  Upper management give you the idea they want you to have fun and enjoy the experience.  Lower management gives no encouragement, no regards to contractors, and does nothing to help the moral.  Burn and churn!"
bad,Expect to work 80 - 90 hours a week if you want a decent perf. Management changes frequently and not always in a good way. Job assignments are vague and perf is torture.
bad,"I cannot give a honest review of Google, the reason is because the culture of Google in the US is not the same as it is oversea. For example, I felt sick three months after working with Google/ C Squared in Liberia and I had to come back to the US for medical treatment, I insurance was cancelled before  I left with out my knowledge."
bad,Google will use you up and suck you dry and then dump your bum out on the street. The pace is frantic. You are expected to work all the time. If you hate your team there are tons of places where you can go to work alone and get away from them. The wholw concept of Leaning In is a crock. The free food is really good. The hardest part of the job was being a cog in a wheel. Not a good place for an independent thinker. You must work inside the box at Google.
bad,"Lack of training and a 'Trainer' who only showed up a few times. Unfair 'scoring process' on calls; if both survey questions weren't answered at the end of the call, you didn't receive credit for positive feedback on first question. If a customer was upset because they hadn't had their Google Fiber installed yet, and they said they weren't happy with the company on the Survey, it counted as a 'FAIL' for me."
bad,"A young, talented and motivated individual seeking a challenging environment where my talents can bring real value. Experienced with working with people from all over the world, and attention to detail like no other. I have open availability and seeking FT/PT positions. Employer satisfaction is guaranteed!"
bad,My time at Google was very enjoyable. I worked as the Google Express Chicago/ Midwest Warehouse Team Lead. Google Express was created to be the competitor for Amazon Prime
bad,"Management is not professional."
bad,"The people who worked with me were all amazing, the only thing is that there was no real job security and no benefits. They keep changing their processes so as soon as you get used to something they seem to change it for the sake of change."
bad,"I started in this company as engineer in practices, where I had the opportunity to learn how to design electrical projects."
bad,"Operations Team Lead"
bad,"This happens to be my first job."
bad,"Google is a great training ground, but not the best moral ground."
bad,Adecco is an overly complicated bureaucracy that stands in between the actual contract and employees. Pay is always an issue and support from Adecco is poor. Actual support comes from the company and Adecco steps in and interferes with progressing the actual project. I will not work for Adecco in the future.
bad,"The management at Google, at least in the technical area, are ICs that reached their peak technically so they are 'promoted' to manager regardless of skills in leadership, people management, team growth, etc."
bad,The startup was small but awesome to work with. I would come back here but only as a full-time employee. the benefits were nice but I wish there were more ways to move up.
bad,"I almost never knew the ""greater picture"" of where my team was headed, because the entire department seemed to have no clue. I would be told something by someone on my team who heard it in passing from our manager, and then the exact opposite would happen in two weeks. Even when that manager quit, the same things kept happening, and even when I switched teams (within the same department), so I believe the entire department was rotting from the head."
bad,"Dont waste your time with TVC jobs at google, great company for full-time workers, a nightmare for contractors. I dont know what else to say until I reach 150 characters."
bad,"Fun workplace but really bad salary"
bad,"There is no transparency maintained by manager while giving the feedback."
bad,My contract was terminated with no notice and a vague message was left for my agency saying it was due to performance. I was 2 months in and never had any inclination I was not performing well.
bad,"Made to believe that music experience would be relevant, but whenever it came up, was shut down in favor of ""following the guidelines."" Was made to believe that there would be health benefits: NOPE. The prices are identical to the marketplace."
bad,Google is rife with corporate politics.  It's truly sad and disgusting that people with Napoleon complex are allowed and enabled to make other people's lives miserable simply because their managers are sick and twisted.  Google is very bad about exiting these types of people.  It's a true shame.
bad,I don't agree with Google's hiring practices of hiring many contractors and letting go many. I don't agree with the method of development of their people while at Google. I believe they should have more faith in their contractors to allow them to not only setup the equipment physically but to also set up the equipment using software. Hardware will not work without software.
bad,"Go in sit at assigned station, proceed to start dialing making sales calls one after another selling ad space over phone across the country while being critiqued by management. Co workers were great!"
bad,"You will be hired to become a part of a machine that is worked efficiently, will be constantly cut in hours, and greatly micromanaged. Used to be fun and creative, until new management strategy came in."
bad,"A typical day as a contract worker at Google wasn't always the best. You just sat in front of a computer all day working on whatever projects the they have you working on. They had leads watch over you constantly, so there was limitless conversation. Basically, being micro-managed. Terrible way to work. Ugh! So glad that I left that place. I don't know how it was that I managed to work there for as long as I did. I guess to gain work experience, which wasn't much. I wouldn't say that there was much of management because they had a recruiting agency on sight she wasn't very nice. Too serious, like, ""dude, chill out!"" As for the leads, there were some good ones. The hardest part of the job was having to sit at my seat all day! What a horrible experience! And the most enjoyable part of the job was going on breaks and actually feeling human and being able to have some kind of human reaction. NEVER AGAIN!"
bad,"Completely different from the movie, perks are exciting at first but it is it. Poor management and very strict with do and don't do"
bad,"There's a lot of excitement and innovation in the engineering groups. More oversight could be helpful; otherwise, it was a good experience."
bad,"40 hour work week. 8 hours in front of a computer. Typeset and format e-books. That's about all there is to it. day in, day out."
bad,"Google might be a great opportunity if you're full time, but if you're a contractor (like with any job) don't hold your breath that it will become long-term. Don't expect the company to treat you with respect either. You're just a warm body hired to do the most mundane tasks that the real employees are too good to do themselves. Sure, you might work hard and meet metric goals but it won't be enough for them to offer  you a full time job or give you an opportunity to network. Plus the HR were bullies and harassed employees until they left"
bad,made outbound calls to companies that market their business on googles network. Assisted with creating ads to showcase businesses not only through google bu our partners websites as well. I lived learned so much about marketing that i would  have probably never gotten the chance to know if i didn't take it up as a career. management wasn't always the best they pretty much looked out for themselves at the expense of others.workplace culture was okay as far as the people i've met. the hardest part of the job was making commission. the most enjoyable was the free snacks.
bad,"Just to clarify I worked for ttec on the Local Service by Google campaign all I can say is don't work here that are horrible. The commission is horrible, the is no run to advance in the company due to the BPO status, and lead quality is sub-par at best."
bad,"Google are a great organisation to work for if you are prepared to give them your life however if you intend to go home at a reasonable time, say the end of your shift, then forget it!"
bad,"Google refuses to accept that it is now a very large, and corporate, company. As a result of this, their response to corporate politics and gaming of their peer review process is to (a) ignore it, and (b) punish those who report it."
bad,The people you work with are nice as well as the leads but the management in the office are quite inconsiderate towards their employees. Has potential to be better.
bad,"This google job is not something for a person who has a life and kids/family. Its so inconsistent and no benefits, management has favorites with the certain workers and no holidays or paid time off."
bad,"I worked as a contractor less than a year "
bad,"Even though they mentioned in the interview that they were a family oriented company, it was not true. The perks are really only for the single Engineers. The carpool buses hour do not accommodate parents who have to pick kids up from school."
bad,"*When taking a contract position, you are hired as a second class citizen and will be treated as such. This is a way for Google to avoid headcount issues and still get people to do the work."
bad,"The work culture has changed so that there is a lot of politics, management is unwilling to step in and resolve issues, so engineers are left with the burden."
bad,"SMX poor management"
bad,"Pros"
bad,Staff suck won't help you get anywhere or ahead will step on you to keep there name good  too much backstabbing they have great food great environment
bad,It is most likely a great place to work full time. I personally was in a contract position and did not feel respected or that my skills were properly used.
bad,"I worked as a Contractor at Google and the experience was not good at all. Management discriminate Contractors you feel like a second class citizen. I do not recommend  to anybody to work as a contractor. This was in 2006, they may have changed since then. Very poor vision from management (at least the ones I saw) for the bad treatment of contractors."
bad,"Lots of perks, great pay but designed to keep you working 24/7.   The culture varies by department.  If you are lucky enough to get a great boss, you will be happy as can be."
bad,"The company is definitely over hyped. While things look gloomy from the outside, the roles are very manual and doesn't require many skills. Would refrain from applying at least to India Offices"
bad,"A typical day at work was great, great hours and always overtime when needed. The work wasn't hard but always keep you movie and busy with something to do."
bad,I was working in Catering Mk team as a Catering assistant. My typical day started at 7 am for morning shift and 12 am for the afternoon shift.
bad,Red Badge doesn't mean much when your income and benefits are below average. Being at Google doesn't mean much once you contract for them then you'll know.
bad,My trainer for the position i was filling was not very knowledgeable. Kept changing the policy. Casual attire not business was allowed in the office. The free food was great.
bad,Loved learning.Had a terrible manager made it difficult for me 2 njoy all Google had to offer. Wish I had a different manager.He ruined my experience.
bad,"Can be stress free if you are used to working at call centers, and it would be better to work full time because otherwise all the policies are slightly stricter on you for be there only part time since you wont be there as long as everyone else and will get alot less calls overall than those who are full time. You have to know what you are doing because just one call can make it or break in terms of your customer satisfaction score."
bad,Its a job. You go in and do your work and then go home. The commute is reallyt far. I dont know how i got baited into filling this out. Thanks indeed!
bad,This was a boiler room of sales reps that were petty and used scripted pitcheds to sell services to the public that were shady at best. I have to type in something to fill the balnk space so this is all i want to say.
bad,"a pressurizing day"
bad,"Its a good Place to work, I enjoyed my time there, I made a lot of friends and I got a lot of flexibility."
bad,I would come in early to our first pulls where we would organize all the parcels for the day. The pulls were consistent and then we had to pick all the parcels for the windows that were going out for the day
bad,"Google maps worked on tools like Atlas, Terrashop which is tool for editting pictures in obliques view"
bad,"The good:"
bad,The job was very easy to do but the way the system worked and was not honest with employees. I found myself putting out fires developed by lies. My manager was pretty great and genuine. I was thankful for that.
good,"•	Provides delivery services by ensuring prompt and accurate distribution of packages with customer demand and the requirements of the assigned route."
good,"Longest sales cycle,  after starving out most if not all of the top reps they keep the commissions after everybody leaves. "
good,Not good atmosphere to work nothing such to tell overall ok types not good no benefits from there employees u have to be in good position to survive in company no job security there
good,"It's changing a lot and loosing some of it's uniqueness. "
good,"You may have seen movies about working at Google, they don't show the tension that is felt there sometimes. It can be a great first step, there are better sales environments for seasoned salespeople"
good,"good place to work for software. Software teams are well balanced, have great leadership, and seem to be very happy at work. Perks are great and can help make up for the work/life balance."
good,"While I was working at google, 19 members of my team were laid off to be replaced by working in the Philippines. Clearly contractors are not valued and neither is good work."
good,It was good because I could work from home and I could choose my schedule with a minimum of 10 hours and maximum of 30 hours a week.
good,"Terrible management. No work life balance,  I was monitored for and questioned about ever getting up from the desk as a customer service rep. I got a kidney infection from this and was refused to be allowed to leave work. Almost ended up in A&E as a result. Had to get an emergency medical appointment at the weekend."
good,"I worked as a contractor for Google Maps, working to collect location data to improve the quality of the service. "
good,"I have had many corporate jobs, and this is by far one of the better. But it is worth noting that Google in the Data Center is completely different than Google elsewhere."
good,"I'm sure working at Google as a full-time employee is a great experience (if you enjoy being a cog in the larger machine), but working a temp/contract/vendor role is a darker, unseen side of the business, one with incredibly capable people, but far-from-secure work environment."
good,"During my time at Google I have learned how to use new software that is exclusive to that company. I have received a fair workload, I normally prepare daily and weekly reports about the business unit I work for."
good,"The platform was good, though they are not having any good culture there were much politics then team orientation and new sales & marketing strategies."
good,"There is a strong divide between working as a contractor for Google vs being an employee. It was like being at the fence of the garden of Eden, looking in at happy Googlers, while sitting just out of reach. Being a Google employee, a ""white badger"", is great. Being a contractor (or TVC as Google calls us) can range from honestly very great, to terrible. If you're a developer who is a contractor, or a manager, life is pretty good. But if you're a worker bee, it's rough. The maps people possibly have the worst of it."
good,It is truly a temporary position and you are aware of it the entire time. 
good,"You have the opportunity to be tested every minute. "
good,"Work culture isnt the same for a full timer vs a contractor. "
good,"I worked with Google Express under SMX as an Independent Contractor. It was not a bad job. I left because my contract was up and there was not much of job advancement. I would recommend this job to people who are just stepping their foot into the workforce or people who need extra cash. I enjoyed the bond I made with fellow coworkers, there were a great bunch of people on the team. One negative aspect is that the contract is only a year and after 3 months you are eligible to reapply. Another one is that you are not informed about exactly when your contract is close to being up so you can prepare yourself to look for another job. However, overall the job is not that bad for the one year you're allowed to work there."
good,"I was a contractor with Vaco at Google for 2 years. I was promised a long term contract, but never received that opportunity due to poor management. Our team lead was the worst person I ever had to deal with professionally."
good,"Busy days and nights reviewing online files. Postings were uploaded internationally, no translations provided. High volume, which often overloaded file servers"
good,Nothing to say about this company. There is no insurance and no job security.
good,"Google is a big company - absolutely massive. Just like other large companies when things aren't quite right, it becomes difficult to navigate internal red tape in the hope you can lobby for yourself. "
good,Working at google is tiring. A typical day is busy. A lot of people get hired all of the time. There is not enough space for everyone to work. Costco workers are annoying.
good,"The company is SMX a staffing agency, not Google.  Not much room for growth because it's a contract job.  we did have access to the Google building and the food was free but if you didn't have a position within the building itself, they really didn't like you in the building"
good,"Empresa não fornecia muitas oportunidades, contrato de apenas um ano"
good,New management has come in and the management has turned over  every year with no clear direction.  Benefits and elimination of 401K was not well recived.
good,"This review does not accurately represent Google since I am a vendor. I work under Accenture/VACO. As a vendor, you are not a ""real"" Googler and you are treated like an afterthought and the real Googlers are embarrassed by you."
good,"Full time employees and contractors are two different kinds of people and are treated as such here. It made working here really stressful, difficult, and caused a lot of tension amongst our team."
good,"Although working at Google might be great, as a TVC you aren't a true employee and you truly feel it."
good,"This position is incredibly simple, it's essentially shopping... Well, it is shopping. The caveat comes in when you consider just how many bosses you have to answer to regularly and all of the bureaucracy involved in having a single thing approved."
good,"Employees are fun to work with. Management isn't that great. Managers aren't as professional as they should be. A very physical job, the hardest part was lifting 50 pound boxes."
good,A good job while getting through school. Contracted. No guarantee you will be rehired once contract is up. Good pay. Good hours. Steady schedule. Cool people
good,very boring cant really do much but sit their. Its just like taking a test you have to sit their to the job complete and cant talk to no one. The pay was good.
good,Enjoyed it as a first corporate company environment. Best part travel and food .  Targets were reachable initially but every now and then policy changes made it sort of difficult plus many new rules started to come up. But over all a good place to work.
good,"As with most call centers the work can be stressful. The employees and management here worked hard to make the work enjoyable with regular competitions and events."
good,Everything at Google is great -- except management and culture.
good,"A typical day I do my job, report on doing my job, show someone how I do my job, then meet about a new job that needs doing. I go over my co-worker's work, then research some Google stuff. The hardest part is being less interested in making money, and more interested in providing superfluous value for information consumers."
good,Co workers are fun and very helpful to work with although management needs some improvement.
good,There's a reason why people leave. Perks are great but useless when work is unfulfilling and management is terrible.
good,"Environment of the work place is very fun loving and friendly without having any pressure for work, But i dont like such kind of freedom in my initial steps of my career. I would like to work in extreme pressure and wants to learn rather than working in cool environment."
good,The culture was the best part of the job. I had great co-workers. Employees had a lot of pressure from the supervisors when you were on the phone for longer than they liked even when you needed more time to fix the problem.
good,"Mileage will vary as a contractor at Google. Not every team is the same but there are those teams where the segregation between a full time employee and a TVC (temporary-vendor-contractor) is felt. Staff on such poisonous teams will make TVC's feel less-than even though our work is very important to pushing things forward.  Again, this is a team dependent situation and I was on such a team."
good,"worked as a contractor - they tried to mimic the google culture, but vastly underachieved"
good,Its fast past but easy going. People are very nice and are extremely busy on any given day. Able to work at your own pace with minimum supervision. Able to be off to take care of personal business if need to.
good,"If you are a TVC (Temporary Vendor Contractor) you're an outsider. You can enjoy some perks, however. Food, free parking, free electric car charging... Hiring or moving around for a TVC is next to impossible. Most resources on the intraweb are not accessible. Odd hiring policies. Some groups have bad managers. I happened to be in one. This is not only my opinion."
good,I had a helper and we would pick up our car for the day and we would go on our route. i would drive and the helper would deliver the material. we would pick up material from stores and deliver them to customers
good,Most Google Managers do not have the experience in the field to provide leadership. They do not know what questions to ask or the challenges that face IDs. They need to have someone older than 30 in management positions who know the field and are emotionally mature. I did not have a good experience at Google because the manager was more interested in flirting that understanding her job or trying to understand the field.
good,I'm not going to provide a review. I'm not providing a review. This isn't why I signed up for this site. Mandatory reviews are not a thing I'm going to do.
good,It was a cool place to work the pay was not great but it was nice not being micromanaged . The company closed with giving employees a two week notice and it was right before the holidays. They offered 100$ for inconvenience which didn't help at all. The manager was very cool and helpful
good,"I worked at Google as a contractor for a year and a half. "
good,it was a very productive experience for me. i got to interact with a lot of customers and employees on a very professional level. i learned a lot while using electronic devices as well to help assist us in our daily tasks.
good,"Typical day at work:"
good,"I have worked on street view imageries and to work on those high resolution images is simply superb. Specifically our team worked on the street view imageries of The United States. We have successfully launched the street view imageries of Switzerland in January2015, the toughest part of the job is that we spend hours together for launching street view imageries before the dead line assigned by our Project Manager."
good,"A lot of very smart people, with great ideas and the drive to innovate and make an impact."
good,"Google express is a place where there is majority set operation work. My duty was to monitor almost 20 staff on a daily basis. I build great relationship with my employees. Where they were comfortable and enjoyed getting the work done on a daily. Unfortunately google is a temporary position, and in due time we all would have to seek further employment."
good,"I learned a lot about Austria an the other German speaking countries and their geo data. Before I started to work for Google I thought this big companies are all professionals but HR or management skills are not too professional. My co-workers were from around the world which was very unique and wonderful - to hear and learn all these languages and cultures!"
good,"The Google side of things are awesome. "
good,"A typical work day consisted of first, logging into a given Android device, picking the orders shown, paying for them with a given Google credit card, and packing the purchased items securely for take off by the GSX Hub drivers. I learned how to think quickly on solutions to speed up our production, as we had to meet a set amount of pack cut off times for same-day deliveries. This was very challenging at least 80% of the time due to either poor connectivity with androids, packing printers, and low amounts of packing supplies at our workstations. I learned how to better have an adaptive working-style, whether I am placed alone at a vendor location or with a GSX team. We were to contact or ""reach out"" to management via email using our android phones if problems arose. Most of the time it would take a while to get a response, so problem-solving on your own or with your team was definitely a must. Mostly ALL of my co-workers were really great to work with. To be the most productive, it took great communication and jumping in where needed regardless of our set role that day, and we mastered that work flow. This to me, was the most enjoyable part of the job, an awesome crew. The hardest part of the job would have to be trying to make cut offs on time when the equipment given to us malfunctioned, and having to wait on email responses when reaching out about low packing supplies or other hiccups of the day. I would say that our management would sometimes bypass/miss our concerns all together by not thoroughly reading emails."
good,This job was really great from training all the way on to production. It taught me alot about troubleshooting hardware and also on how to talk to people and resolve their issues in a timely manner.
good,"Make 10-20 calls a day. Learned how to provide expert customer service as well as fulfill client needs and sales quota."
good,"I have a career in processing data, from data entry of checks for customer payments, to data entry of clients receiving such information. Time management."
good,"I have had very bad management experiences here"
good,"On average the workdays are fine but upper management lacked any willingness to work with existing staff to improve the general attitude and culture. Beyond this, the pay was nice to start out at and is evaluated on a regular basis."
good,"I worked at Google on a seasonal contract for three months to assist with recruiting experiences for candidates coming onsite for interviews. I scheduled and assisted recruiters, candidates, and interviewers during interview processes."
good,"In general, people are very cooperative and approachable. However, working as a contractor or vendor discrimination is quite evident. "
good,"Working at Google Express was great in my first year, They had given so many incentives that would simply encourage you to work more to gain that incentives. However, the just is just contractual. They may re-hire you based on your performance. On my second year they promoted me to be the lead, which for me is basically the same as an operator with just added responsibilities. On my second year, they changed the incentive to a mediocre incentive, that ran for four months until they dissolve the incentive."
good,"I depend on the team that you are on that determines your success there. Management is all over the place. Leadership is never consistent across the board and the messages get lost in translation. High-stress job and when I asked to get paid for my overtime, my manager told me I have to get 4 flags a week in order to get paid extra. (I'm a recruiter) Which is completely illegal. You have to pay your employees no matter what. "
good,"Google is still trying to figure out what ""Enterprise"" means. Fantastic products and services, weak approach to enterprise customers. Not geared to someone who is over 40. Inexperienced management."
good,"While Google's culture is terrific, the predominance of temp workers, and the lower regard for them, makes the working environment less pleasant than their reputations suggests."
good,"empresa no geral boa de se trabalhar , porem não havia flexibilidade de horario"
good,"I do not want to construct a review of a company that I only worked at for a total of 4 months. This is unnecessary, stupid, and very boring. The mini"
good,"I was brought in by an acquisition. Most of the employees left within a year.  I stayed longer but ultimately was offered a job to go with the head of product marketing to a nw company, Quantcast to head up Trade Marketing. It was a great opportunity to lead a new group there under a boss I respected, so I took it!"
good,"The company is productive and challenges your skills, it is very exciting if you are a go getter and you like to push yourself. You must be strong willed and not fall into to outside drama."
good,I have been working at Google full-time (Less than a year) but Work life balance not good. Change management and frequent re-org's is a draw back. Google provides awesome perks but whats the use when you dont have mental peace ?
good,It's a very tough place to grow as an individual given; their Quota promotional system throughout the organization from so many departments. Limited Scope to move around various teams.
good,Spending around 7 hours in car. Need to learn different software programs before able to drive autonomous. The workplace culture is relaxed. Hardest part of the job is being in a car the only goes 25mph.
good,"Job security was based on projects success. 100% travel for some, 75% travel for most. Too many positions that put people in power, very little people willing to do regular tasks day to day."
good,Fun place but work life balance is missing. Need to improve more on the openness and culture. Need to have a good onboarding program.
good,"The company that I work for is Infinity Contact. We are contracted by Google so we do not actually work for Google. We are in the atmosphere however, we do not experience any of the Google benefits."
good,"All communication was thruout emails, and for all time working there, I did not know who is my supervisor, and I had only list of general impersonal emails to contact in the case, you have nobody to ask, you cannot know if you're doing well or not, but in general the work was interesting and well-paid for temporary job."
good,this is a fast paced environment with a great deal of employees. about 140 employees work for the company. its a warehouse environment. the one on one interaction with employees and some management is questionable.
good,Needs a little more structure in the work place. Good environment to work in. Have the ability to gain knowledge and experience.
good,"Every day when i work , i move to Mountain View and receive items from the HUB and deliver it to customers using apps in phone. "
good,"It was a good experience of my life."
good,"Very friendly, enjoyable relaxing enviorment. great co workers"
good,"typical day at work ""Monday""."
good,"Pros"
good,TelePerformance was a great company until they laid everyone off and closed down
good,"Learned about pressure handling, reaching client deadlines. Team work."
good,"A typical day at work consists of high volume outbound cold calling mixed in with listening to music and a couple matches of ping pong. I really learned how to be efficient and effective throughout an entire sales cycle throughout my time at the company. Management could be more hands on, right now the company is growing so the managers are very busy focusing on a lot more then just their employees. The hardest part of the job was getting through long days without deals coming through but if you can not handle that, than sales is not for you. The most enjoyable part about the job was the young atmosphere of the company. I really enjoyed the motivational competitions such as whoever scores the most points wins a happy hour. Overall, I would recommend Signpost to anybody looking to start a sales career."
good,"Company doesn't care about work ethic and hustle but more about not making sure you don't ""offend"" anyone. Everyone there looks into what you mean to say in your communications then what you are actually saying."
good,The culture is dying.  The corporate policies do not allow for connecting with others.  HR allows employees to make unfounded claims on managers and takes action without proper investigation.
good,Google was a great place to work and I felt like they cared about the employees. Contractors on the other hand not so much. I would return to Google and think it's all in who you work for at Google.
good,"Best thing at Google is about work/life balance and compensation. Also the people here are super clever."
good,"Google provided many perks for their employees however the expectation is to work many overtime hours including weekends and holidays.  Working at Google was like working on a college campus.  Being 40+ years old, I was definitely considered old work there."
good,"Everything structured to keep you on campus - food, activities, services, and stack ranking to pit you against your teammates."
good,"As a contract food service worker, we are not valued and there is no work life balance. There are high expectations and no support to get it all done in the allotted time. If you push back or complain they are quick to remind you how indispensable you are."
good,"The problem with Google is that if you are a contractor, as most employees are, the costs far exceed the benefits.  The job culture is fantastic.  But in most cases, the work is very thankless.  You don't get much enjoyment out of completing a task."
good,Can't say much since I'm new and hope to make the best of my contractor position to learn and grown withing the organization. Keep my fingers crossed to be a full time employee in the near future.
good,"A day at google as a store operator was very consistent, not much changed, I learned to move at a very fast pace (timing was everything), how to work in the warehouse field, packaging and shipment. There wasn't much management due to the fact, we all pretty much did the same thing, there was no one higher up than you can go too besides a lead and they knew just as much as the store operators did, maybe a little more. The workplace varied depending on what store you were stationed at for the day or week, which could change at any given day/time. The hardest part of the job was trying to meet our delivery window when orders were flowing in, basically like a rush hour, and not being able to communicate with a boss or someone who should be over the whole store operators, not just leads. I enjoyed traveling to different places, different stores, meeting lots of new people, at Google you never really knew who you were going to be working with for the day or if things changed from the day before or not."
good,"The company is technologically innovative but supports a very left wing liberal environment that does not allow people outside of that political spectrum to feel uncomfortable. Additionally, there are too many politically correct initiatives that often roadblock opportunities for persons not meeting the criteria."
good,"My summary has been:"
good,"Many great perks, workplace culture was fun but the contract was short and temporary. "
good,The environment can be very demotivating. There is a lot of drama that goes on and limitations to advance in your career.  Training could be greatly enhanced.
good,Working in the metro always poses more challenges considering the distance of the workplace and the compensation the company provides.  Another point to consider are the bills and expenses you have to cover each month.
good,"Choose management that are creative, yet responsible. So many of my managers were fun and creative, yet immature. Either that, or they were too strict/ bossy with little creativity, and it makes a huge difference for the sales associates."
good,"This position allows you to travel and have more interests but each project might terminate unexpectedly."
good,"Temporary type of job, not long term. The company was pretty new so there where lots of differnt types of changes, some that I liked and others that I did not. Lots of peope came in and out of the job."
good,"Drove from SF to Mountain View, 1.5 hours each way, to avoid travel sickness on the shuttle (which costs $1.50 for contractors). Lots of free food everywhere and lots of nice places to hang out outdoors or in a cafe or in a nook. Generally quiet atmosphere indoors. Everyone looks happy. Very casual and diverse."
good,"Based on Projects requirement ,work pressure is observed"
good,Not so friendly towards education while working. But good working environment. Encouraging and beneficiary management.
good,"Casual Job involved assisting on corporate events in Google offices."
good,"I worked for the Google Technical Consumer Support (gTech). While Google promotes several laudable characteristics - support for the individual, encouraging innovation and independent thinking - I did not witness this in my environment. There was much in-fighting - often erupting in open fights and crying. It was a very stressful and unpleasant work environment."
good,"Receiving listing, reviewing if everything is correct following a workflow then going to the next one"
good,"Google Express is hands down one of my favorite jobs to work at. I made a lot of good friends and met a lot of nice people working there. The company overall was fantastic. Would refer it to anyone."
good,"The management of contractors seems poor. Adecco seems to have high turnover and the new employees do not know how to manage people. "
good,"I liked the company, but did not like that when you are contractor, even though your performance is excellent for a few years to get permanent you need to have interview"
good,"come in, access the flow for the day, start picking orders to get them prepped for pay and packing. After all order are completed we move the parcels to our pass off location where couriers come in order to pick up their parcels."
good,"As part of my role I have to "
good,Poor Structure and management. Good pay and benefits. Hearsay is too much of a valid feedback.
good,"I currently work with Google Maps and I  am looking for a job change."
good,"My experience working as a contract employee in a Google office was primarily positive. There were flex hours, free lunches, pool tables and massage chairs and many other creature comforts. The pay was reasonable considering the level of work assigned to us and there were often incentives for going above and beyond goals, in addition to voluntary overtime if one were so inclined to pursue that. Unfortunately the office culture was not that of a Google office, and tended to cater to a lower average than I expected. After completing a one year contract and half way through my second, I decided to move on to find something more challenging and rewarding."
good,"Google is a good place to work at but most employees seem to be contracted and there is a lot of internal churn all the time, which sometimes causes unneeded confusion."
good,"Overall, it is a great company to work with.  The  true experience will be varied based on your position and your group. Everyone's experience is different."
good,"The recruiting process is far too long, most engineers wait 2 to 3 months for an offer and the technical questions asked are intended to trick candidates."
good,"diverse environment great tools and technologies, valuable learning experience. Relaxed and forward thinking great spaces for creatives. progression is slow bt oppurtunity to learn is great"
good,"Great company."
good,"One of the main benefits of this job was being able to pick hours that fitted with my personal schedule. As a college student, I was not inconvenienced by the available hours."
good,"I was part of a team that did trouble shooting/answered questions for users of Google applications. It became repetitive after a while. Management seemed to be unclear and inconsistent with the metrics at the time which caused ambiguity. The coworkers were always great, helpful, kind, and empowering."
good,"I worked for a third party SEM company that handled existing Google AdWord customers and their accounts. The management in the third party corporation is NOT Google and they treat employees like numbers. The manager who fired me had never met me and cared very little about my extenuating circumstances leading to my APPROVED time off. Why would management approve time off and then terminate based upon this instance? She looked at my sales goals not being met against a full month; in which I was not present due to, again, approved time off. Then terminated my employment based upon this. She is no longer manager or working for the company."
good,"The regular employees were of course mostly happy there. The multiple cafetria and food choices are very popular."
good,"It was a great priviledge to have worked at Google. I really value my time there. However, the culture is only based on sales and that demoralizes the workforce to some extent and the management is very hierarchical and that creates friction."
good,Great company for engineers and PM's. Not too good for driven sales professionals. The company treats engineers differently and in addition the sales teams are not quite set up for success. Google is an engineering company not a sales company.
good,"It depends on your situation but I would say Google overall is not a great place to work as a vendor or contractor.  They blur the lines so much between full-time employment, vendors and contractors that it can create a poisoned and resentful work environment."
good,"Following good Culture. Management not good. Existing employees not getting good saary hike. Internal politics. Partiality. "
good,"I was young when I was brought on to the digital marketing team but I wasn't given much freedom to use my abilities in the way that worked best. "
good,"A typical day at google would be you clock in and get straight to either picking,packing or paying for items. the queue would be anywhere from 1000-2000 items."
good,Was able to work from home and at office and had free lunch and snakes and standing desks and balance boards and access to video equipment and sound stages...
good,"The pay wasn't too bad, the job wasn't too hard, and the co-workers are pretty cool. If you're into micro-management, then this place will work for you. It's contract work, so don't expect PTO or holiday pay. However, there's unlimited overtime."
good,"Smart colleagues and amazing tools and great perks, but moves too fast and has such high turnover / internal move rate that the codebase (payments stack) was out of control. Too many layers of detritus -> too much time was required to understand what the heck was going, and by that time it had changed, and/or the whole group had been re-seated and re-assigned. Consequence: more movement, lower morale, unloved code. Continual distractions: email stream, meetings, internal news, internal research questionnaires, compulsory Unconscious Bias training etc. Great food, though, great compensation + benefits. Must be sociable!"
good,"Google is great for Engineers. For managers of product, process, projects or of people you often have to ""create your job"", and maintain a high-performance image. You are told to do this by building your internal resume. And you should, always noting your ""impact"". You need to define your role and make sure your manager and your stakeholders understand it and agree.  You may think hear you have the charter to blaze a new trail, but you need to be careful, there is a lot of coopetition, and some people would like to see you fail. Some people are guarding their territory and they don't think they need to align with your new process or whatever - and they don't . It's a tough place for a new ""expert"" type who's charter involves change. Do a lot of listening, and find ways to align with people and pick their brain. Ask questions. And travel to meet remote people you need to work with, in person, with an agenda. The Compensation/Benefits are good. Some positions and in some teams you need to be politically adept. The culture in many teams is not exactly friendly, especially if some external perceptions of the team are negative - it can feel a bit paranoid. Don't give in to that, and be positive, find the right goals to lend your support to  and then help achieve them. Make an impact!"
good,Fun place to work.  People were good and helpful.  There was a lot to learn and the people were helpful regarding being available as resources to guide you where you look for information.
good,Contractors are treated unprofessionally and disrespectfully.  Contracts cancelled in turf wars between FTE trying to stop teh top perfroming contractors from being converted because that makes competition for the next promotion.  Total bs.
good,"yes the company is a subset of the main company. they work three shifts and sometimes on saturday"
good,I rated google search pages for relevancy to the search query.  The better it met the query the higher the rating.  Pages with multiple annoying ads or spam would be rated lower.
good,"i don't know what to say, it's a contract job, i can't really say anything good or bad, because i was never a google employee. which was sad, i really wanted to work for google."
good,"If you can turn a blind eye to all of the dishonesty around you and focus on your job you will be very happy. Typical with large sales organizations, they look away from those that lack integrity as long as they produce numbers. It can be very cut throat but also the best training and learning experience you will get at any job. Treat it as a privilege to learn and go ""all-in"" and you will have a long and prosperous career. Not the culture for an honest contrarian. Long hours but excellent payout."
good,Its a easy job. You just go from place to place and make sure that Google's products are advertised right and that the employees know everything about the products they sale.
good,"It was a temp job, I was always worried to lose my job the same day. I had to work I wouldn't tecommendand stayed focus for 10 hours straight if I wanted to keep my job."
good,"Great place to start out. They train you for everything you need to know. Good free food everyday. Nice break rooms with lots to do, and a one year contact that can turn into a second year one as long as your a good employee."
good,"Ambiente lavorativo molto giovane e alla mano, grandi opportunità di carriera."
good,Being a TVC is financially rewarding but that is about it.  If you are used to and want feedback and guidance this is not the job for you.
good,"Google is full of smart people, and they know it. The compensation and the perks (on-site meals, gym, etc) are amazing, but I think it's the only thing keeping people here because most of your coworkers are jerks."
good,"Ensamble de mueble de oficinas,atencion al cliente . buen trato y crecimiento laboral."
good,I learnt how to troubleshoot google shopping issues based on analyzed of larga data coded in XML. It was very pleasant to have the chance to see your job shown in Google Shopping interface.
good,"Working for Google Express is an opportunity to work at a newly developed business form, same day delivery. It is an interesting experience for anyone who has never been into the delivery field. The work, the people, and the workplace all provides a challenging environment for learning and growth. However, as a business, it does have red tapes, and politics involved. Personal growth still depends on managing a good images throughout the business."
good,"I would just say this be very aware that, no job is promised and with google. They can end your job as quick as they hired you. LAY OFF"
good,"Working at Google sounds like one of the best jobs you could find, but it really isn't as great as some might imagine. Your day consists of sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day doing the same monotonous job all day and every day. The good thing was that you are able to listen to music or watch films while you work but you have to reach an awfully high quota every day. Our managers want to call us a team, but you do not get that sense of team when everyone is too busy working on their computers trying to reach their quotas. It can be very stressing and I always tried to relieve my stress by going to the weight room or playing basketball during my lunch break."
good,"Here I had a tons of experience where it lead my career into a successful path, taught me the real life experience and shown me the team management"
good,Made kits for different parts of the company. When a department called it was my responsibility to pull and take the correct kits to the department as soon as possible. While also doing daily inventory check and helping contract workers with the inventory they
good,"My job is to figure out how we can do things more efficiently, test, run impact analysis, develop and manage process rollouts. "
good,"Overview: Working for Google Express has been a great learning experience.  I have grown in many ways with a lot of different people.  I learned how to lead a team and plan a successful work day, as well as input my previous experiences from other jobs into this one which helped me excel into the position I am currently in.  "
good,"I found that Google Express isn't a great place to set yourself up for a  lasting job. The compensation is pretty good but the expectations in relation to the actual work that is possible is outrageous and I found a frightening lack of diversity in the management staff. No Fleads i met were people of color or diverse backgrounds. I found that many of them were also from the same college and or similar backgrounds, all of which were placed in management positions without any prior experience ground level in relation to what the workload was actually like."
good,I was able to move up into a management position within a year but just as the same in another year my project was shut down and moved out of state. They also mistreated the contractors that work there which I never liked at all
good,"nice perks at the office, Google bus transportation is great to have in the heavy-traffic Bay Area, the scale of the whole operation is truly impressive, Google is hiring like crazy and employees are packed-in like sardines now.  sometimes you will read the news about privacy concerns and wonder to yourself about what the company is doing with user data"
good,"The Google campus itself is amazing! All amenities are free of charge and the facilities are very well maintained. Management could use some brush up on interpersonal skills and how to effectively manage a team- and moreover, take the time to manage and develop a team."
good,"people were great, very unorganized, pay was decent, was contract position but did not renew after 2 years for some unknown reason."
good,"Espirito de equipe com integridade, respeito e profissionalismo entre todos que integram o departamento."
good,decent among the least I really cant describe it too you how bad it was to work for a company that is small in stature. it really wasn't that nice and it really was adverage
good,"very analytical, felt like i was feeding the machine with information so one day the robots will take your job, very repetitive. nice people and management if you do the work correctly you will not have a problem"
good,It was a very good opportunity . But I didn't get a fair chance to work there . I think there management sucked and they didn't play fair. They had alot of good hands on but the pple that had lead were so inexperienced . They were young kids trying to play boss but the we're r real lly lazy and didn't do work they thought they didn't have to I guess
good,"difficult environment to grow. They wanted to keep people at 13$/hr and there was no option to move into the offices, or move up. It seemed to be a good starting position for a young adult, or possibly a part time student."
good,Je n'ai rien à ajouter sur le travail chez google.
good,"Work and life balance depends on your team and is definitely different if you are a contractor. "
good,"* Perks are too much really, and I would feel guilty complaining about any of them.  However, I'd much rather give up all my perks for the opportunity to work from home instead."
good,Working as contractor means give up on work laws. The intensity of work is not linear with the pay rate. they use international students for their own benefits
good,"Depending on which campus you work at, it's really great but they hire contractors for a lot of roles and so there ends up being a level of separation between the work force, especially when it comes time for cool events or gifts/bonuses."
good,"I was fortunate enough to be involved in the massive plan to scan every single book in the world.  It was the job of a lifetime.  Not repeatable now, I imagine."
good,Over all it has a buzz that is motivating. But it also has more of a robotic feel for your job. I can work much faster in a Start-up environment. I would have liked to have been able to show my work style.
good,S.M.X was under Google express. The job itself was ok but the people weren't always as pleasant. all-round it was and an ok job at the time because of the salary it was 16 an hour.
good,"You must find your swim lane quickly at Google or you'll find yourself behind the eight ball right off the bat. Also it's important to be in one of the major markets if you hope to have a career, not just a job."
good,"Google shouldn't participate in project Dragonfly."

good,Filled with smart people looking to make a difference.  Lots of opportunity to work on new and exciting projects.  Management is less innovative then other places.
good,"After working on the Google campus in Mountain View for a few years, I've learn that there are always opportunities for growth available on campus. All it takes is passion and drive."
good,"It is hard to give a review on google .Especially contractors, TVC's"

good,Everyday I get to learn new stuff. I am really happy to work for this company. It has a very diverse culture. I would love to continue working in the company.
good,"essentially you are a personal shopper located at whatever store the assign you across Brooklyn, queens, and Manhattan. You get orders through a phone they give you and you have to go to the main store floor, find the items, buy the items, bring them back to your station, pack them neatly, and wait for someone to come pick them up. there are 3 intervals of time when someone picks them up so all orders must be ready and organized before those times. culture of workplace depends on store and you have to work with your coworkers and the employees of the actual store (target, PetSmart, Northface, and many more)."
good,There are many internal google tools that is benefits to everyone. I learn a lot of from the colleague and other people.  The tools are very helpful and benefits to my projects.
good,"It’s a fast-paced, high-intensity work envirnoment without opportunity for advancement. They have fixed schedule without room for overtime or PTO. There’s no opportunitt for self- starter to work independently. I am great at working independently. On one hand , this guarantees autonomy, which is my dream to avoid micromanaging bosses like plague. I like to have an opportunity to take ownership of a project , run it and resolve unexpected problems. I try to make sure I don’t run into a situation I can’t fend for myself."
good,"Great for your resume, but not so great for your personal and family life. If you're in the right circles, career development can happen with hard work and strategic movement."
good,"Very busy environment with lots of meetings"
good,"I was working at Google Employment for 6 month as a part time employee.  No benefits and very low pay.  The job was repetition  and all you do is look at books and page books on title pages, table of contents, bookmark pages. index pages."
good,"I like the flexibility, but not good for advancement.  The food is good. The management is good. There are opportunities to grow. You learn a lot. Role is tiring."
good,Google hires a lot of contractors and few become employees. I wish they would hire most people as permanent employees and develop their people to grow.
good,"I spent 2 years at Google and was very happy to leave it."
good,"This review is based on my time as a contractor with Google.  If I w as permanent, I believe I would have been much more satisfied."
good,"Working in Google is so fun because they have all the things you want when you are not working like recreation rooms, wifi connections, and most of all free food from breakfast to midnight snack."
good,"A lot of Manual work."
good,"i worked there for as temporary the problem there its only temporary, not for family needs, this job is only for singles, I was not totally 100% happy work there because thers alot of gossip, all i know was work,& wait for my pay check"
good,"Since I would only have my internships on Friday evenings, I never really got to spend a whole ton of time in the building. What I did learn at my internship at Google was working with money, like being a sales person and how to attract customers."
good,working here was alright. it was a contract position. you got free lunch and parking. the google full time employees were all condescending towards contractors. typical stuff.
good,"Responsible for troubleshooting technical issues with the Google Play Books UI"
good,"typical day at work is always busy,witch is good by me. because by me staying busy? IT SEEMS TO make the time go by much faster.AND THE more i work? The more i learn, because each day is a learning exprience . which makes the job more exciting. The hardest part is when some people slack in their work assigment. But thats when i have to work extra hard. just to make sure that the job is done correct. The fun part of the job is getting may pay check ."
good,I am a fresher want to experience the world a more and more thr is so much to be found i look foward to work with joy and wisdom i hope my mistakes will be neglected.
good,"buen ambiente laboral, convivencia entre los distintos equipos y departamentos, respeto entre los respectivos cargos, comunicación fluida..."
good,There are really great perks and you feel like you are part of a large company but I found that the full-time employees treat you differently. Like you are less. It makes it hard to feel like you are valued.
good,"Worked on quality control of scanned documents using a computer programs through google. Not much supervision, quick turnover requested, didn't listen to employees, supervisor listened to music all day and didn't assist colleagues"
good,"Google is a phenomenal place to work, there is no doubt about it. The management is nothing but supportive, but due to the caliber of folks they bring on for non-mangement roles, be ready to compete as a small fish in a big pond."
good,Ambiente dinámico pero la marcada diferencia entre el empleado de Google y el empleado de consultora genera un malestar importante en la dinámica del grupo.
good,"""Google was not a start-up environment by the time I left. The same office politics. It was easy to get promoted if you worked on the right projects and projected your work in the right way."""
good,"Top 12 things I like "
good,"Working as a contractor at Google, the demands were high and the pay was mediocre.  They did have free food which was nice.  I made about half of what the non-contractors were making.  Maybe less."
good,Este trabajo me ha ayudado a expandir me vocabulario en Ingles y en Español. Las traducciones me hacían cuestionar y aprender muchas cosas en los dos idiomas.
good,"Benefits were good and it felt nice to say, ""I work for Google."" But outside of that, I didn't really like my time there. The problem was mainly management. I had a good manager at first, but as per usual, that changed and I had to deal with the team lead directly. We didn't get along too well, so I only worked there a year and I'm not really sure what I have to show for it."
good,Lindos productos buenos colegas. Mal sistema de calificación del trabajo del empleado. Muy competitiva
good,"Es una empresa emocionante con buen ambiente laboral en general. Demasiado competitivo, crecer es my dificil y el sistema de calificación interna no es el mejor. Latinoamérica tiene pésimo nivel de management"
good,Great. Lots of different roles to choose from. Lots of team to work in. The company is massive in terms of locations to work. You will get the latest google technology to play with
good,"I attended several courses in creative writing, journalism, photography and layout and graphics, my training is constantly updated to better meet the challenges of a changing world."
good,Excellent place to work at but its very hard to advance. It's extremely competitive. This is coming from someone who loves competition. You learn a whole lot though which is always good thing!
good,A rewarding challenge every day.  There were many new ideas and views on how to tackle the challenges of building a fiber network.  I am glad I took on the challenge.  It helped me to grow professionally.
good,"A typical day at work in the company is fast paced.  There are always different things to do like installing new phones or fixing them, client support."
good,"You learn a lot, and you work a lot harder!"
good,"its ok to work with arvato google. the people are lovely, but there is a lack of manangement, which also always seems to be changing."
good,"Pre-sales inbound qualification on G Suite and other Google entreprise products & services. Structured environment with little room for own autonomy and growth, but a good place to enter sales area. "
good,"Usually the name Google is synonymous with a fun, creative work environment. That is not the case when it comes to my time at Google Nest. As a trainer in a Google facility, we could not rearrange classroom seating as we saw fit without corporate approval. We could not even change the clocks to account for daylight savings time or even for better time accuracy without corporate approval. Google has their own security staff which is nice to an extent, however, should you dim the lights or bring in a visitor, you will be on their bad side. The pay was decent, but not decent enough to stay. The regulations of this facility really inhibited work flow."
good,"-led people in projects and maintenance"
good,you had  to pay attention to detail in or to have the best quality of part and also best fast enough to reach the daily goal even while sometime having multiple parts
good,I enjoy meeting the Google clients around the Kansas City area and the ability to work outdoors makes the work pleasant .
good,I'll just say that the glass is half full. Many products are successful and great. All the perks are wonderful. Too much of the management is incompetent.
good,Google has been an okay employer so far. Some people can take themselves a bit too seriously but others are nice. The commute to work from the city is vert jarring and gets old really quickly.
good,A reliable company to work for. Great experience to gain. Also a great way to connect with different experienced challenges.
good,"Pro's:  "
good,Helped me learn to work independently but was also very supportive and attentive in training me to succeed in store on a day to day basis.
good,"To acquire a challenging position in an organization, to put my skill-set to use, enhance my knowledge and contribute to the development and growth of that organization"
good,"The job is loaded with great perks, but it's very high stress. Management is very poorly trained and often doesn't know how to act or manage. On my team, moving up is very difficult and takes people considerably longer than the company average. This can be very frustrating."
good,"this place is not so well, they are not well organized. they fire people for no reason"
good,"Great Company enjoyed learning new procedures, very helpful in learning new departments, not enough hours or advanced notice on work week"
good,"Great work-life balance, perks, and benefits"
good,everybody was friendly. management was also understaning of situation.
good,"A typical day would consists of the following: "
good,"Cool benefits, but big company problems. Seems that everyone is doing their work with the end goal of being a manager or being promoted, without actually caring about quality."
good,"Fun work environment and great co-workers."
good,Starts with research and developing new fancy app using Google App engine
good,Typical day starts with testing new builds provided by client
good,the typical day work was so tiresome.i learnt to handle different types of people.management was good and co-workers were fun to be with.hardest part was to introduce a new product in the market and convincing customers to use it.most enjoyable part is when am able to convince the customer.
good,"Few opportunity to advance"
good,travail qui ne me convenait pas pour des raisons de management et personnels
good,work was really fun comfortable able to work individually. my job was to scan books page by page and all kinds of books even magazines. My co-workers were fun and friendly. The hardest part was trying not to rip a page because some books were so old and hard not to rip or make any blurry pages either.
good,"Quality Control of the project at google, very tedious work. Hardest part of the day was staying awake."
good,"i want to do work in google job. because iam interested in google job. i confidently work with my knowledge. i am promising you, i will work with sincerely."
good,Start-up company contracting Google's New Product. Great product. Saturated market due to Google's prior launch in the New England Market.
good,"I volunteered to receive online training from Google, in order to help small businesses put their business on the internet. These businesses received a month subscription for a free website from Google. I presented about ten different businesses information on what internet users preferred and trusted on web pages, and offered ideas about how to market and conduct their business online."
good,"Free lunch, but at a cost."
good,"The work space is very nice, friendly people, clean and hygienic place."
good,"Responsible for evaluating the accuracy of data, with specific task of identifying patterns in data and using judgment to take decisions on data quality."
good,This was an excellent learnign experience and challenged me with technical responsibilities as well as mapping skills. Enjoyed working for the company and enjoyed my job task as I am now a very skilled experienced driver with lots of knowledge in the Cape Breton area.
good,"Good company with security in your job, pay is decent but there are no cost of living increases. Management is good, and they like to have events for the employees"
good,"1) The position requires to work in and out of the office."
good,"It was a wonderful and productive environment but no mobility in position or input in current projects. Positions had very specific tasks with no breadth, only depth in your area."
good,"Google is a nice place to work if you’re a liberal. If you disagree, you will get fired. Also if you offend the sensibilities of any employee for any reason you will get written up or fired. Do not hold doors for anyone, do not express you’re own opinion or you might offend someone. Also, all offices are glass so you feel like you’re constant being watched while you work. No privacy at your desk. Open environment. Pros:  Dogs allowed in workplace, games, free lunches and breakfasts, ice cream, pleasant place to work. Mostly nice people. "
good,The company is very large now. Not so easy to navigate.  Constant re-orgs makes it extremely difficult to understand impact and landscape. Beware of switching to other competitor companies.
good,"Not a bad place to work, even if temporary.   "
good,"Teaching classes were only tough for me regarding the fact that everyone was always so busy, or preoccupied with meetings, or, even having to ""make the bus"" to get home... that it made attendance very random."
good,"Parts of Google can be incredibly beneficial and new and exciting. You will meet intelligent, driven people who will truly open your mind and help you to push yourself forward. You will also meet plenty of ruthless, political types interested purely in their own ladder climbing. The culture must maintain the illusion of a utopia, so be prepared for lots of behind the back dealings, disingenuous words, and passive aggression. Use this company as a means towards an end. Get experience and build the resume, but never forget that Google is a giant corporation, just like ANY other in the world. Stay alert and grounded."
good,The google campus I worked at was a decent place to work with a good and friendly environment wherein I learned a number of useful job skills and had  had great co-workers and training. The management was easy to get along with and personable and the workload was fair and relatively un-stressful. The biggest issue I had with it was that contractors took on the huge majority of th work load and were offered very little in the way of proper compensation or potential chances to grow and find a more secure position within the company.
good,Work is ok ; but the pay is flexed; new people come in making more than the current employee; but The people and environment is great ; game room and free pop
good,It was physically demanding especially with large orders. Management does not take into consideration the heavy lifting according to your capabilities
good,"Pay is good. I am able to work from home. Not a very mentally challenging position--the position has become a bit boring. There is no position to move into, so I'm looking for something else."
good,Very cost driven which is typical at any company. Great place to learn how to work with international cross-functional teams. Always leverage data to align stakeholders.
good,"Reviewing from day 1, I learned a lot in this 4 month tenure. Being A fresher, This job will always be a cherish able experience since I got to know deep down What my capabilities are. The hardest part of the job being the targets set by Google which were to be achieved on regular basis. The most enjoyable part were the sessions conducted by google to get a better insight of what ""Google Ad word and YouTube channel""  marketing is."
good,Google is a good place to work. You will get to interact with people across geography and can take up different projects. Competition is stiff and you have to regularly upgrade your skills to keep up with other employees.
good,"working here is a good experience "
good,"The most amazing workplace ever.  Great food, workout room, laundry facilities, arcades, unlimited food and snacks.  Great people, a truly unique work experience."
good,"there is virtually no human interaction even though there are about 25 people in our department. Can't talk at all, must meet accuracy and productivity numbers of 97.5%, and when break or lunchtime come, everyone runs outside (no phones allowed in the building) to use their phones. Few stay for the 2-year assignment. I am not a young person so maybe those 25 years old would be ok. They seem to like the free snacks and cereal"
good,The work is extremely easy intellectually for I have learned the main primary SOP (standard operating procedures) but it is tiresome on the body after consecutively lifting bulks of items. I think the best part of this position is getting to see customers and communicating with them.
good,"First the obvious freebies for all employees and contractors: free breakfast, lunch, and snacks, access to Google gym and fitness classes, and a genuinely great office and facilities (most employees can chose a Macbook, Chromebook, or Windows laptop and many get supplied with the latest Google phones and tablets depending on the team). People are very friendly, motivated, and interesting and it is a genuinely fun workplace with lots of buzz and challenges."
good,"Free food, games, rides, everything!  Exciting atmosphere.  Surrounded by other really smart people.  Lots of opportunity/budget to experiment.  Very much feels like a start-up with all good and bad associated with that type of situation."
good,"Wish I was an actual Googler as they do not treat their vendors with much respect."
good,"Cons:"
good,"Great Company to work for with good work/ life balance, fun and exciting atmosphere with friendly people. contract expired so it was timer to move on."
good,I could learn a lot out there and it was very informative. The management was awesome.The most enjoyable part of the job was the environment of the workplace.
good,"My experience at Google was OK, OK. I learned how to behave with the co-workers and how to maintain rapport with the manager. Also learned how to make more productivity without compromising at quality."
good,"Great Working Environment .."
good,"The culture is great for those who are young and without families. However, as you get older, work/life balance becomes increasingly important and doesn't exist here. Google treats employees very well. Since there's little room for advancement in the company, the culture is very competitive and it's not unheard of having colleagues throw you under the bus to get a one-up on promotions."
good,"* my type of work is flexible , i can work in both outdoor and indoor"
good,"Google is a workplace that every employee dreams of. It has almost all the amenities that a 5 star hotel can provide: delicious food, gym, spa, massage, games rooms, open work environment."
good,Great co-workers. Temp agency with no real room/plans for career advancement. Minuscule benefit options.
good,"This job was fairly satisfying. The culture and people made it a more workable environment. I learned working as a team here and aligning yourself among others will put you in a better situation. On a daily basis, your focus is on completing tasks constantly for 8 hours. I think that was the hardest part of seeing the same thing over and over. Beside that, the job can easily be adapted to,"
good,Working at the company was very beneficial due to the perks.  Access to the Google campus was amazing.  The management at my position at the time was good as well. The only cons were the incompetence of higher up communication and rules.
good,"Good company to work for, I've learnt a lot in the 10 years I've spent there."
good,"Excellent technical software engineering personnel."
good,"Its good if you need to work asap, but contract term is 6 months, so you don't get benefits. Might be changed now but I have not looked into it. Easy job, needs improvement. YOU DO NOT WORK FOR GOOGLE, you work for STAFF MANAGEMENT. "
good,"It's a fun place to work with a lot of young excited people wanting to drink from the Google kool-aid if you will. The problem is the contractor vs Full Time Employee (FTE) discrimination. As a contractor, I was over worked with little to no recognition and the management takes credit for all the work the contractors do."
good,"Nothing other than good."
good,In store lead at Google Shopping Express. Learned the importance of managing a team for an e-commerce logisitics retail company.
good,"Middle management is burdened heavily with lots of work and does not really have time to hand hold all the employees, Lot of fun and events keep happening all year round."
good,"I am working on Elance before 2 years & I am enjoying my work ,"
good,"There are worse jobs you could have."
good,"The best part of working at Google is not the perks, but the people. Googlers are smart, dependable, and innovative. These characteristics are great for the company because it is expected that you work quite a bit. It is not atypical to receive late-night emails and working overtime is an accepted norm. Google is always striving to break new ground and improve itself, which requires long days."
good,"A typical day at work would be taking calls and helping customers with technical problems related to their carrier."
good,"On a typical day of work, my tasks are quite varied. I'm responsible for the overall management of operations and automation for the Americas and Global/Central for Google Enterprise."
good,"Google lives to the hype in everything but transparency. The food is excellent and free, its fun, but your managers will not tell you if you need to move or if your not performing well. You can lose your job quickly if you aren't aware of what they think about you."
good,"My first day at office was typical day,"
good,"This was a five month contract position. My day started at 6am and was working till 9pm. I learned google mail, learned to use the internal google applications. From managing calendars, expenses, planning meeting, booking conference rooms was all done on google apps, which was completely different from using ms outlook, ms office products. There was a challenging part of the job at first and that was learning the google product, since I never received an administrative assistant training and orientation in the beginning as everyone does, I didn't know what the expectations were but I held my own and learned very quickly in the first 3 weeks. The most enjoyable part of working at google was planning Thursday's social event every week. I met some really smart and nice people at google."
good,"Google job securities is near zero. If you have a stable job then I wouldn't"
good,"I enjoyed working at google, but the people where very self motivated, to make them selfs look good. If they would had people inside company that would have had in field experience , this would have been a great place to secede."
good,"I worked as a contractor at Google X.  Working there was great.  I enjoyed working with the other engineers very much.  Lunch was good.  Everyone was accommodating.  That said, two things stood out as a problem.  Contractors are treated differently in terms of security and processing.  It took weeks to get my credentials figured out so I could use email and to use the build system.  Security is tight there, and slow.  My access to the building took two or more weeks to clear.  I was not able to access all of the code I needed to do my job."
good,Work culture is focused on the employee but only when the employee is in the same political environment as management. Downtown parking and traffic is difficult.
good,"Fun environment. Sucky attendance policy - don't be late or absent. Its all very serious. Great managers, for the most part, there's always one, ya know? Decent customers."
good,"This review is for my role/situation only."
good,Se si possiedono buone capacità porta profitti ma nessun tipo di crescita nell'azienda
good,"Cool and secure work environment"
good,"While they do a great job at providing a ton of things to make employees happy. There is a lot of bureaucracy and office politics do play a large factor in advancing your roll. My cowokers started dating within the company to help ensure their contracts were converted to full time...I was on the outside looking in, despite helping a team hit all of our quarterly goals."
good,"Cool job and team."
good,"Great benefits, great pay, incredibly smart coworkers, but lacking in direction. Many similar products overlapping, no clear focus. Great opportunities for movement and/or advancement."
good,"The company attracts top talent and truly the possibilities are endless. The highering process is a nightmare and costs them talent. Employees review each other, which is great, until you have no one to review you bc temps/contract workers aren't allowed to participate in the reviews, and yet over half the workforce seems to be a temp or contract worker. When going through the hiring process you may be asked to interview up to five times with 5 different interviewers, or not at all. It's inconsistent. You must be approved by a hiring committee, most of whom you've never met and who may not fully understand your job role."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Typical day at work was fast Paced"
good,"I make my own hours, work whenever and wherever I want.  Pay is good for a work at home opportunity -- In fact, the best on the internet."
good,"There is room for advancement -- if you look like everyone in the office. The culture is impure on the east coast. Color and uniformity yield higher opportunities."
good,"Great supportive team. Learning more in 13 months than at any other job over the years. Great atmosphere, very business and project oriented."
good,Not very challenging. But very good atmosphere to work with. Hopefully this should be the last company of the carrier.
good,This was a contract position that was offered to me. The work tedious and unrewarding. The perks as what really got me to stay as long as I did.
good,I was hired by Aerotek to do tech support for Google Fiber. The company is new and it is growing. so far so good.
good,"Job was good, but the management was not that great. Work culture is awesome but work timings were bad. Colleagues were good, I've learnt about the corporate life."
good,"Never be afraid to encounter different circumstances, they will only make you who you are. As master of our art we must encounter all sorts of situations, i have learned along the way that being postive, and open to hearing goes  further  than resisting."
good,"amazing place to work as a whole! However, work happiness is directly related to the team you join and the culture of that team and it's role in the business."
good,"Easy and straightforward tasks. "
good,"Wszystko było by fajnie gdyby nie to że praca była załatwiana przez pośrednika(Adecco), zapewne oni zabierali lwią część wynagrodzenia. Po za tym praca miła,prestiżowa, wymagająca dużej koncentracji przez cały czas."
good,Google is an incredible company to work for and has a strong culture that helps employees succeed in being their very best within their careers and beyond. I learned a lot from my managers on how to be a better sales person and team member through projects I designed.
good,Nice place to work if u have no carrer options left or u dont aspire one....cant work for more than  2yr....no grouth....no proper hike...join only if u wnt to have a relaxed work enviorment....free food....pick and drop...apart from this there is nothing good
good,"Beyond (at Google) was a great home for me for the year I was there. Wonderful people, great benefits, and respect for work, life balance. Management was the best I'd ever worked with."
good,"I will save all the world, becouse Im superman. Im very stronger, i have a big power. I am very kind, sympathetic, cool, creative, energetic,communicative"
good,as this was my first job. Great place to work. All the leads and supportive colleagues are very much supportive. highly motivating environment.
good,It is very unorganized .They dont appreciate there employees .They take advandge of people .They have a shuttle service that brings us to and from work because they cant expand there parking .There is also a uniform you have to purchase.
good,"I have learnt a lot when i worked in google.. like how is the corporate culture, and how to work in pressure situations and how we have to manage things.. much more..."
good,"Work pressure Managable,Managers and co-workers were helpful,"
good,I do search terms for google as l see what is easiest to find  for people looking for a career with a top100 company culture is great. Google have a lot of services and I find them to be really good.
good,"from my experience i learned how to manage a team, how to be a productive day , but most importantly how to deal with difficult situations"
good,"I loved the job just not the temp agency. I've learned how to work with deadlines, big requirements, and under pressure. The hardest part of the job is missing the que due to high volume it is very hectic when a lot of costumers is ordering. The most enjoyable part was meeting new people and learning about their software and company"
good,This company is really great. Excellent team of people. I really enjoyed working for them. Sad the closed there doors in Fredericksburg. They are a fair company even if they lay you off.
good,"Have enjoyed my Work"
good,It is good to work here.The environment  provided here is awesome.It is very safe to work here.Every one should work here atleast once in their life time
good,"Fast pace"
good,"A typical day at work was busy and very involved. I learned how to handle customers from all aspects and how to use all of Google products with an extended amount of knowledge. The management of the company itself was a little unorganized because things were constantly changing and the employees were never informed. My co-workers were all hard working individuals as we were trained to be. The hardest part of the job was the administrative figures never could keep the employees in the loop of what was going on with the company because they barely knew themselves. The most enjoyable part was working for a company that Google considered to be the voice for Michigan, also learning about the Google products and brand was a very amazing thing."
good,Mejora de políticas dentro de la empresa para con los colaboradores externos.
good,"my dad raymond mccracking is the owner of google.it.ltd "
good,"I Enjoy the work here,"
good,I have a financial problems facing by me and my family just want a little job to run my family well and full fill their wishes... I'm still a student but I have little experience so if you need any type of employee just remember me I'll be there
good,Google is a great company to work for you have great benefits unique great people the atmosphere is very Lacks great gourmet food and overall it's a great experience you get to buy Google swag for you and your family so overall is the great place to work
good,The company is Good the work Culture needs to improve a lot. The Working style and hours need to be look again to improve the paramount potential employee.
good,Productive workplace fast always busy. Need to finish orders in a timely order. It was like shopping for a customer making sure you had all orders complete and correct. You where timed on how fast you shop pack and ship all the items and how many mistakes you had
good,"One could work as much or as little as one desired.  However, there was no phone number to call to speak to anyone at the head office.  All correspondence - including hiring interviews - were done over the internet in writing or test-taking format.  There was no advancement, no job security, no way to speak to management, and culture was the environment created in your own home.  Identities of other raters were kept confidential, so there was no co-worker interaction at all."
good,"The workplace culture within the office has a very unique atmosphere. Not everyone there is preforming the same tasks. You have the software engineers that know various coding languages , the sales team that handles Googles advertisements and marketing strategies, and lastly the vendors and contractors that are employed for various projects and also work in Office Management."
good,"The Evolution is going back words, supporting a premium google product, Accenture is getting back to the terms of chat from email and soon I can see days where they are going to make it as a call center"
good,"Google provides a variable culture and this makes work an amazing experience."
good,"Pathetic work environment, not at all employee centric place. Food quality is not upto the standard. No chances for growth. Management has not control over quality of work"
good,"Je ne serais pas demeurée plus de 7 ans si je n'appréciais pas le travail. L'environnement a toujours été agréable et chaleureux. le rapport avec les clients respectueux et intime, sans la pression de performer pour vendre un produit à n'importe quel prix. Bien souvent je passe plusieurs dizaines de minutes avec un seul client, l,aidant à faire un choix, lui racontant mes coups de cœur littéraire. La vente se fait par intérêt du livre et non pour forcer une vente! J'aime l'idée de contribuer également au succès d'un auteur anonyme qui n'est pas populaire auprès des médias sociaux. "
good,Google has been a fun place to work at. It has its perks such as free food and being in a relaxed environment. The pay is good compared to other jobs in the field.
good,Ask upon request  otherwise strong company. Tons of stress and high demands everyday it could be your last or the best day of your life . Overall amazing company with high expectations
good,"Working remotely from 3000 miles away from the office can be both a blessing and a curse. I knew id never recieve emails in the middle of the night but, depending on who you ""Ops-Lead"" is, They may either take forever to reply or not reply at all. However that aside, I love driving and i like being by myself. I was perfect for the job, but i can definitely see not everyone being able to handle it."
good,No room to advance. Travel is fun but excessive. The program could have been made better but it ended due to poor management. Outsource project with google.
good,Google is all about the bottom line and you feel it in the culture. It is a high-pressure company with a high expectation of results. They provide a lot but they expect a lot
good,"Google great company....Adecco not so much a good company. Work/ Life balance is not the best, adecco could treat its employees a little better and not as robots."
good,Working for google listings was relevdntly easy as i got two sales the first hour i stepped on the floor. However i feel the job was a scam becuase they were charging people alot extra and my salary was not revised by a proper amount compared to the amount recieved.
good,"The people are friendly and talented."
good,"La gente que he conocido allí vale oro. Las tengo como amigas hasta hoy. El día a día me ha enseñado mucho de cómo tratar al cliente como un rey y también ser lo asertivo suficiente para que todo fluya mejor. Otra cosa muy importante fue aprender a no salir de tu zona de apoyo, de tus habilidades."
good,Working in a fast paced work environment that constantly keeps you on your toes and having to adapt to constant changes within the company and Google ecosystem.
good,This place helped my custormer skills develop and it was really enjoyable to work with my co-workers. My typical day would start by coming to a location and calling my dispatch that I'm here.
good,Great place to work if you are a software engineer. Just like any other large company if you are not. The benefits are great but don't make up for some of the poor management practices.
good,"Starting out I loved going to work everyday but as time went on it became stressful and i begin dreading going to work. Changes and manuals came after 4 moths being there hours begin to decrease drastically to the point where one day your schedule said 40 hours and within a day you receive a email stating that you would only be getting 25 due to a lack of work and sometimes even 12 or 15 hours a week."
good,"I currently work for a small digital marketing company based in north Jersey. The pros about the job are that I cybercommute every day from my apt and i know the owner of the company on a personal level, so my interaction and communication with my boss is pleasant and typically business casual. The cons are the inconsistent hours that I am scheduled every week and the lack of benefits, perks, or opportunity for any advancement. I am eager to grow my career, rather than continue in the same cycle indefinitely. The work is relatively simple as i have a predilection for the job requirements, and I would welcome an opportunity in a similar field. To clarify, I am not displeased with my current employment in any way, I am simply searching for a way to advance my personal career."
good,Great experience in fast moving global organization. Great perks such as free food and free gym. High pressure and highly competitive work environment. Hard to get work-life-balance.
good,Did not feel welcome I was a value to the company. Was not allowed to enjoy the perks that Full Time Employees enjoyed and the hours were very varied in terms of the position that I was supporting.
good,Good company - My manager was weak but I know many people there who had great managers. The work is interesting but there are too many meetings or crazy projects that get in the way of true priorities.
good,"Google is an amazing company, with lots of amazing perks... If you are a FTE or ""Googler"" If you are a TVC ""contractor"" then none of that applies to you. You are paid almost nothing and expected to do the same, sometimes maybe even more work than full time Google employees are expected to do. You may be given a day off because Google is off, but some of us don't get paid for those days. When you are working on a budget that is really hard some days (especially near the holidays) Work is very stressful at times and instead of finding ways to improve our work environment, they take more things away.  But there are incredible benefits too like free food, snacks and drinks as well as full featured gyms and pools., and very flexible hours."
good,I had a fantastic experience at Google overall. Middle Management is notoriously incompetent but there are plenty of avenues to learn and grow one's career.
good,"Interesting place to play in. As a contractor, though, don't get settled. Use your time to grab all the skills development and tech awareness you can. Network through side activities - go on hikes! Above all, be cheery and ethical no matter what, to everyone. Probably good general practice anyway."
good,"Challenging, but boring every days work. I learned the courteous way of serving employees through valet parking. Pro Park company manages well with the customers' parking organization. I found Google employees are very courteous people. Valet parking is a tough job whenever there is a big company events. The best enjoyable part of the job of taking care of other people's car in the parking area is when they are satisfied and appreciated the services of valet parking and driving them from every buildings in the campus for free. I love Google's all-free food perks."
good,"Working on the Google Campus is an awesome experience. Working here I learned how to work hard, and have fun while doing it. I learned how important communication and team morale is."
good,This job was very demanding in sales. The goals were set at reasonable standards and the environment was fun and upbeat. There were both individual and team goals.
good,Provided quality service to guests of the restaurant to ensure company goals and customer satisfaction
good,"The Involvement of work wiil be more weather that be a small work need to be involved from the higher level associates  "
good,I was hired through a recruiting company so my experience is through a contracters experience. It is hard to transfer over as FTE. But i do say now that I have been gone for over a year. Google has taught me alot and ive gained soo much knowledge that I dont think I would have learned anywhere else. They are well advanced in framework and processes compared to other companies and It makes sense why they are one of the top companies in the world.
good,Google is a great company and still #1 focused on the ads business. Cloud is still behind in the enterprise but can catch if they focus more on cloud which represents a small % of the revenue coming in.
good,"As a contractor, I did not have much structure around me. I was expected to be a go-getter and put my work out there. I was expected to push for visibility for my work. "
good,the role is quite micro managed and has a policy for everything. People are great
good,"I have enjoyed my time at Google. "
good,"I enjoyed working at Google. Very fast paced and busy environment. My days would go by so quickly. There is always plenty to do. Everyone is so nice and will to help in any aspect. I learned alot about the Google culture and its expectations for the staff there. Work attire is very casual. It's more of what you can do not what you can wear.A typical day included meetings, lots of meetings. trouble shooting situations for my staff and a little time at the end for a fun activity with my team. The hardest part was keeping up with an intense calendar schedule. You are pulled in many different directions. High expectations for everyone."
good,"Friendly working environment with lack of management. HUGE need of minorities: Black, Hispanic, Women, Elderly!!! You barely get to see people older than 40 years old :("
good,"Google is a very big company, which in some ways can actually feel like several different companies working together. Change is a constant in the workplace and benefits are great."
good,"New kind of Work flow,with the young crowd around,Always a chance to learn new things and keep myself updated.New Work process at regular period of time. A great place to work without pressure as long as focussed and dedicated."
good,It's a great place to work and the projects I handle are amazing .I am very ambitious to work for development side where i can showcase my knowledge and I love to complete my tasks before deadlines .
good,"Pay is good, paid weekly, make your own hours. Benefits aren't great due to expense of them. Easy job, don't really see supervisors or coworkers. All in all great job"
good,"Aside from working on a project with over 100 new graduates, this was a fantastic environment and a one of a kind project. Management for operations desperately needs to develop people management skills to add to their project management environment."
good,"Obviously working at Google has perks such as free food, shuttles to and from work, etc..  "
good,"Trabajo a tiempo parcial, freelance desde casa, fantástico para administrar tiempo."
good,"Correcteur des données sur Google Maps le travail est assez répétitif  si vous n'êtes pas assigné à un projet."
good,"Executed daily shopping tasks and inventory validation checks, using a range of mobile devices."
good,"Working for Google shopping express was an adventure in the beginning , working at different retail locations every other week. it was fun working with different co-works and also working with different in store retail employees and in store management, but that also was the hard part cause you never knew who you was gonna be working with that day personality wise, so as a lead i had to make sure the daily operations ran smooth no matter who was on my team for that day, Google shopping express was my first start up and E-Commerce job so i learned a lot."
good,"If you are hired as a employee, that would be best. Treats contractors like second class citizens. Managers who are contractors have no idea how to manage a team the majority of the time. A very segregated feeling if you have a red badge and not the normal google badge. Great food and swag. Definitely a place to try and work at and hopefully converted."
good,- Phone based job mainly oriented on acquisition of new customer
good,I recently did work on Google Fiber in Kansas City. It was a very fun and exciting job for a while but then when rally was over.
good,"fun work environment. generally good work life balance. typical day includes managing projects, eating in cafes, and going to work out"
good,"Job perks are great but can't work from home. Job is interesting, people are nice, not much career advancement in my field. There's a relaxed atmosphere. Great food too."
good,The terms and conditions for content creators on YouTube are always changing and often make it harder to monetize your content. I feel like they rarely listen to what their creators want. Overall a good job if you're willing to put in work to get where you want to be as you have to do that entirely on your own.
good,"Very good workplace culture."
good,"The pay was great--and even better when the pager bonus (which was not mentioned in the offer) is counted."
good,Location in Ann Arbor was great with a brand new office. Work environment was very laid back and overall culture was great. Contract was up hence moving on from position.
good,"Fun and productive workplace. "
good,A typical day at google was largely self managed.  You control who and when to make calls and are not micromanaged by superiors.  However you must have good organization skill to be able to manage customer time expectations and manage existing accounts
good,"A typical day at work would be out in the field, doing survey scans on businesses/companies. This involved going to the locations, and completing a quick data scan on a cell phone(s). Two of the other main projects involved bluetooth beacon installations and maintenance, and a GPS location accuracy test project among several model phones. I learned that technology is becoming more and more intertwined in our lives, in ways we don't even know yet- the future both excites me and terrifies me. The hardest part of the job would be maintaining the relationships in your life- on average, 2 weeks of every month were spent working out of state. The most enjoyable parts of the job were probably in how autonomous you were out in the field, and being on the forefront of technology developments worldwide."
good,"The Google Classes really changed how most of the students and the professor, thought about and approached programming and data science.  I believe that the approach that Google took with these classes was very good, however they way that they delivered this information was lacking."
good,"Bom ambiente de trabalhar ,benefícios em dia ....."
good,I learned a very good amount of information in a very reasonable amount of time. The Google Ads certification was informative & efficient. If you need a good place to work google is the place to go!
good,"The first few years were great. Great culture, my first manager was the best manager I've ever met. The second, one of the worst. I learned a lot from experienced engineers and techs. I had the opportunity to work on many different projects. One of the very first issues I had was I came up with a new platform design, taught myself auto-cad and created a working 3D model. Submitted an official proposal to have it reviewed. Ended up speaking with some of the heads of the design department but they said there were already too many irons in the fire and we'd have to revisit it later. A year later my design was released by someone who came across the public proposal while searching random docs. I mentioned it to my manager and after a few days of back and forth, he basically said ""too bad""."
good,Good teams to work with. Managers are effective but could be supported more with better direction by SVPs. Great atmosphere and culture. Hours are okay but the downside is they will usually not let you work remotely.
good,"Colleghi disponibili, postazione visibile al pubblico e attività interessante."
good,fun place to work.  The traffic is the only downfall.  Takes too long to get to the campus so the one hour of teaching did not outweigh the travel challenges posed at Google.
good,"As a contractor you are treated a lot differently than an employee.  Very competitive environment where the full timers take your ideas and run with it as their own.  As a contractor you don’t get all the great benefits that the employees do, Making a culture clash between FTEs and Contractors.  However the work was easy and pay was good.  Too many MBAs With little to no work experience makes it hard to really make impact.  I felt like some things were truly innovative while others they were trying to recreate the wheel.  It was a great experience overalls"
good,You work with great people and in a fluid environment.  There's a saying there where you have to 'thrive in ambiguity' which sums up the environment well.
good,MSP was not treated as fairly as they should have for a vendor at Google.  The perks Google provides were nice and helped provide more time to focus on work.
good,"Fun and inviting environment with game rooms, free snacks/drinks, etc. "
good,"Enjoyed my time at google and was a good place to be."
good,ok i like d it it was very nice and I thought it was good and it was good and everything was nice and they looked after me well and I thought it was a go
good,"Work with difficult people even if they don't like you. Be kind. Smile. Stay later. Even if you don't want to. Help people with bad attitudes. "
good,"I learned so much during my time at Google.  It's definitely not what I expected.  We had a nice cafe with great food, a game room, everyone was usually friendly.  I was not a full-timer though, I was under contract.  I didn't get ALL of the benefits but I got to enjoy some."
good,"Great place to work!  good work life balance and collabrative culture, you have the opportunity to work with the best talent and Google has amazing benefits and perks."
good,"Everyone I work with is willing to help when you when you need it, give you advice, support, and overall super friendly. The company provides you with a ton of resources, benefits, and I have heard many stories of them helping employees beyond what normal companies would do in special circumstances that shows how much they value you. It is a very transparent workplace that offers employees the ability to speak up and voice their opinions"
good,"Great place to work. Rapid and constant growth, so make sure you're ready to keep up. Absolutely amazing food. So grateful for it, since it was the only time I'd leave my desk."
good,très bonne investissement des responsables auprès des salariés
good,"Penso che sarebbe ottimo lavorare per Google, credo sia una grande azienda"
good,"Esperienza professionale formante e stimolante, orario flessibile, personale disponibile."
good,"Shortly after starting at the company I was moved into a completely new department that had very little direction, structure or planning. This may have been a better match if I had been with the company for a year or two and knew how to navigate the company getter, but it was disastrous for my career at Google. Many many employees love Google for good reasons. My case was exceptional."
good,"40 hour work week, contracted by HCL to work for Google maps. No room for advancement. Job requires focus and attention to detail. Pleasant atmosphere to work in."
good,"Enjoyed working here, met good people but no room for advancement. Environment was nice, and the benefits were good for how low-level the job was. Would recommend."
good,"Lot of benefits "
good,"I came on as a contractor to work a project. I didn't keep the job because I couldn't get through the training portion well enough. I was only there for about 1.5 weeks, not a long enough time to make a fair assessment of the company."
good,"Typical day at work:  Analyzing spreadsheets; referencing client contracts/terms; collecting marketing data from systems; etc."
good,Interessante realtà internazionale in perenne evoluzione
good,"2-12-2014"
good,"I didn't work with Google directly, but through an agency, so the possibility of moving up or sideways in Google was impossible. Still, I enjoyed the technology and the trendy uniform, which I get to keep."
good,"Working here has been a great opportunity for me.  I've enjoyed my coworkers positive and creative attitudes and have been inspired while here.  Management has challenges in consistency and follow through, though all are very nice people."
good,"good place to work different events and its always a different day at the job. They provide free food, beverage, dry cleaning. Get to meet a lot of new people."
good,Google was in my experience one of the best places that I ever worked. They had very flexible hours and accommodated to their staffs needs. I enjoyed how sometimes the work environment was fast paced and other times it was laid back.
good,"Not a fun workplace"
good,"A lot of fun to work for Google - as a contractor, however, there is little room for advancement and reaching a desirable salary.  It's a hard place to leave."
good,"Overall Great experience working with wonderful, intelligent people.Compensation could be better and advancement within specific roles is minimum....."
good,Good company anyone would want to join. Great growth opportunities. The management is also very supportive and great learning opportunities. Work culture is also good.
good,Lots and lots of digging for information and conveying that to sales reps. Can be difficult sometimes as they fight over account ownership and commision.
good,Great work enviorenmet. People were really helpful and friendly. The CEO was very supporting. Management was pretty good. It was an awesome place to work.
good,"rebuilt motherboards and also put and adjust chips for every computers we made or had rebuilt, fast paced, also had to rebuilt or take apart system units for desktop computers and change or replace chips."
good,"Provides flexible working hours to spend time with family, as well as Summer Fridays. The salary is good too, but the health benefits could be better."
good,"working with many people that form from different places, and different cultures. "
good,"Working for one of the lead search engines, my engagement at this organization was limited to remote work. It was exciting to see the tools which were utilized to assess the technology in the early stages of the company's life."
good,"Management is very unorganized with no potential for growth. Co-workers are nice generally. Processes change almost weekly, but it's nothing too bad. The job is fairly easy overall."
good,"Worked as a Digital marketing executive, in the company called web krea technologies  and having a very good experience in the seo,smm,adwords,google analytics."
good,Fun workplace and safe environment although I was only a consultant. Employees were pleasant and easy to work with. I would definitely recommend employment to others.
good,I enjoy working for google Express it's fast and really helps you get hands on training and helps learn more about the company. It makes me a better person because I love helping customers
good,"Favortism for full time employees...great perks"
good,Always new challenges to work as the company is growing and there is a culture of doing things that are important to the company.
good,A typical day at work was completing orders and shopping on the salesfloor. spent a lot of time traveling from store to store to help. hardest part of the job was trying to get time off from work and starting early.
good,"Not always the fun loving, awesome place you read about in media. Things have changed with size. Your career depends on your project and your team. Peer reviews and ratings are often gamed."
good,"Not much interaction with the contracting agency as the position is managed by Google."
good,"I run a team of 6 with 5 buildings, I have learned how to manage a team effectively. I enjoy progressing with my co-workers and learning new skills. The thing I enjoy most about working at Google is the chilled environment in which you somehow you seem get more things done."
good,Constantes recordatorios para cumplimiento de metas. Soporte para gente que inicia su carrera.
good,Rapid learning of technology based information. I feel I learned an amazing amount of information in a very short time. It was a brand new call center and we were not allowed to tell our phone customers where we were located. The best part of my job was speaking to customers from all over the world.
good,Working as a team is most important at working place because I gain experience from the ones I work with. And following the right procedures helps to stay on track
good,"I've given my best. the work place is friendly, knowledgeable."
good,"Work  anytime ,no one will question what time you login or logout,make sure work is complete"
good,This job was a unique opportunity to learn in a start up within a start up environment. There is no typical day on the job. Every day brings new challenges and tests your ability to roll with the punches. I learned a lot from the amazing people who work on the project and from our merchant partners who have so much experience in retail operations. This project is powered by a significant number of temps/contractors (as opposed to full staffed with Googlers) and would benefit from increasing their focus on retaining their talent/tribal knowledge by promoting within.
good,"It is a renowned company with great culture. In recent years, google has grown too much in size which makes management less efficient and low. Still a top place to work for."
good,Trabalho com a criação de canais de entretenimento. Mas o grande desafio é ser inovador. Muitas vezes temos que seguir as regras e lutar contra pessoas mal intencionadas que podem vir a copiarsuas idéias.
good,"É um ambiente agradável de se trabalhar, possui bons funcionários. É uma empresa que te dá liberdade para expressar suas ideias e desta forma aprendi e exerci muito bem as atividades relacionadas ao marketing."

good,Google Shopping Express with Adecco was a good place to work. I had good learning experiences but it was a contract job maximum 2 years.
good,"Highly motivated, Strong work ethics, effective leader, strong communication skill with positive approach & innovate ideas & have an invaluable strength essential to qualify performance on job."
good,Typical work place that is driven by data. Overall it is a nice place to work. Not much room for development unless you are in a leadership role.
good,"Amazing place to work, and as a lead i have learnt a lot and the growth has been amazing. I am on third party rolls so no job satisfaction."
good,"São realmente as pessoas que fazem do Google o tipo de empresa que ele é. Contrata pessoas que são inteligentes e determinadas, e preferi  a capacidade em vez da experiência.muito boa de trabalhar."
good,Constant iteration of processes to perfect the process of same day delivery. Fast paced environment and constantly learning as you go.
good,"It was an enjoyable workplace with many young, intelligent minds. My co-workers were all passionate and capable people and the work was enjoyable. Cannot discuss further, thank you."
good,"During my time at Google I have learned many valuable skills such as working with Google Drive, Spreadsheets and cross-trained within different platforms. I have had the opportunity to train new hires, as well as create docs used on a daily basis. My team is very bright and fun, and we have a very positive team dynamic. I have been in my current role for almost a year. Although I've learned immensely, I want to grow and progress further. With that being said, I feel as if I have learned all I could and excelled in this role, and I'd like to implement the skills learned here, as well as continue being challenged."
good,"This job allows you to work from home at your convenience. The hours are flexible as long as you commit to a minimum of 10 hours per week and a maximum of 20. You are an independent contractor, therefore you don't receive employee benefits which is expected. Overall, this is a wonderful job if you have children, like to travel or are in need of additional income."
good,Google has provided me with a platform to make creative and beautiful websites for it's publishers. It also has given me the ability to provide fresh content and designs for my clients on a regular basis.

good,"This is an amazing place with amazing people. They all support, love, and encourage you to strive harder! On a day to day basis, it was a relaxed job that had personal quotas. The job in general is a great work place! Any body would be lucky to work here, it either works for you or it doesn't."
good,My Typical day at work is to check the business are processed correctly or not. If they are not meeting the standards we should send them back to the people to make the changes and send them to Verification queue to send the process live. I used to learn lot of things from France and other french speaking countries because i was hired for that specific language process.My Team and job was also very good
good,"Great company and people, with a fantastic campus, food, and other perks. Good work environment and workflow. If it wasn't for the long commute on the gBus, this would be an ideal place to work."
good,"Work culture was very flexible, work atmosphere was like working from home at the same time we had reached the given targets."
good,the position was not challenging yet very detail oriented. co-workers were quiet and nice. all daily goals were attainable.
good,"This is a very cool idea that Google is offering businesses throughout the globe, but business owners are still shy of understanding the importance."
good,As an on-site vendor at Google you are treated the same way as an actual full time Google employee. You are given the same respect and tasks as your fellow Googlers. Teams are always supportive and mangers are always willing to help.
good,"Google ne recrute pas directement ses employés pour Google Maps, mais prende bien soin des employés."
good,good working environment. proud enough to work at Google organisation.
good,"follow up instruction from Eng. rework on PCB, optical  such as unpack and install mechanical, solder remove or replace part,bonding glue, FVT test. Since I work at Google I have a chance to learn a lot of thing from difference of department: Goolge glass, Coating room, Clean room Optical, Baloon etc... The only thing it hard for me is project in process keep changing instruction and rushing time.  I enjoy the view,snack and lunch at work"
good,"As Google champion at Waitrose Saltash, I was expected to work my normal section and took the additional role as Google champion. I went to many training sessions and learnt more about the businesses than was probably required."
good,"My day 's work was done between calls to customers already acquired and calls to prospective customers. We'd also in contact with the media centers and agents for the management of the customer. Also, it was in my management throughout the operational part of the construction and optimization campaign."
good,"A consultancy project for Google turned out to be an amazing work experience. I had the chance to put the foot in a company that never stops surprising for its openness and innovation. Smart, collaborative people, and nice environment."
good,This was the beginning of my experience with Google Adwords.  I found the role extremely fascinating.
good,"- Typical days consist of new outreach in the AM and Account management in the PM."
good,"Worked with high-impression web-content. Curated high volumes of product catalogs, ensured user friendly experience on Google Shopping."
good,"Inbound technical calls regarding customer's Google account. Anything from e-mail, their pin marker not showing on Google maps, 2 or more pin markers showing on maps. FAQ's on how to get higher in the rankings when people search for services. I would also respond via cases which are in an e-mail form if there were no calls coming in."
good,At Google you can expect to play hard as well as work hard! My days are spent speaking to clients on the phone and following up with them on later days.
good,"I learned about the importance of organization, attention to detail and ability to work as a team player. A typical day would consist of processing 50-100 orders every morning. I worked with a team of 8-9 people who had a specific role to ensure a smooth day. I had great co-workers. Everyone had put in their team effort and we all communicated very well with each other. The most difficult part of the job was when we would have server errors which delayed processing orders. The most enjoyable part of the job was mastering all roles in the warehouse such as: picking, paying and packing. I enjoyed learning more about my work ethic and feeling accomplished when I kept busy all day."
good,"Le quotidien: démarchage des TPE-PME locales pour les aider à se mettre sur internet et particulièrement avec les outils Google, notamment Google Adwords Express. Très bon accueil de la part des pros, le projet est encore jeune: les évolutions de carrières peuvent être importantes. Le management se cherche encore étant donné que beaucoup de changements interviennent à cause de la jeunesse du projet. L'équipe des coachs étaient jeunes et dynamiques, en seconde famille."
good,"Enjoyed everyday."
good,This is a great place to work but takes a lot of time. You spend most of your days at work and since you are working on a global project there is a high level of stress.
good,"The workplace was relaxed and easy going which made it fun to go into work.  The work could be repetitive at times, but fellow colleagues made it an enjoyable experience working there."
good,Great management and fun work place. challenging work environment

good,"Different place to work. Can be enjoyable, but very strict policies (understandable)."
good,"In qualità di team-leader di un gruppi di studenti, ho partecipato a questo concorso (a livello mondiale) indetto da Google."
good,"Great company, great training, great facilities. The position was commission based so not ideal for long term sustainability."
good,"Lots of work and long hours, but Google tries to soften the blow with lots of activities, free good food and drinks and a pretty open work schedule. "
good,"Loud"
good,"Great place to work at for anyone looking to be challenged. It clearly is the go-to company if you're up for a challenge, fancy constant change and are willing to push through situations not everything is certain and you need to make decisions in spite of lack of clarity on processes or guidelines because they change so often. Quite a varied set of tasks to attend to with good salary. Could probably pay better given the fact you're doing a job of two or three people really. Still quite fun. :)"
good,"Great work environment, but hard to advance. Lots of competition and people get stuck all at the same level. Also work/life balance can be difficult with the expectations."
good,"If you like driving and going to new places this is a great job, paid diet and room if needed while traveling, the tevh behing google street view was fun to learn"
good,"Was a wonderful experience just wasn't for me. I was the 1 of 2 Black Males that were in a technical position, the only others were in the kitchen which I didn't like."
good,They want to know what makes you tick & where your weakness's are. You will go thru several interviews in increasing dificulty & whether or not you will be hired is left to a group of people that have gained the Google interviewing skill.
good,Great company depending on the team and executive.  Great benefits for the folks wanting to stay on campus for many of them and the culture very much promotes creativity.
good,Nice but I don't have time to share all this information right now. Thank you for asking though. I'm just filling the 150 character requirement here...
good,"I was a student ambassador so I was not directly a google Staff. "
good,"I learned that a job does not define a person. It took leaving the job to reach that conclusion, but work/life balance issues and the culture did not fit my idea of psychological safety."
good,"It a good and cool place to work."
good,New and exciting environment with a heavy customer service base.Work culture is different in a good way and had a very welcoming vibe to those who were new.
good,A job that is adequate to sustain a life until capable of moving onto a better experience. Working as a security guard made things easier for my life as I needed a better job and an increase in pay. This gave me those things amongst other benefits as well.
good,I enjoyed my experience there. I met plenty of people that went on to do well I their careers. Morale was very high and the environment was very competitive.
good,"You do not actually work for Google.  You work as a subcontractor of a contractor for Google.  You get bad pay, bad benefits, and Google definitely lets you know you are not one of them. It can be frustrating but the team is awesome and the people you work with are great."
good,"I like the culture as an employee, not the contractor.  As an contractor, we are not treated as the same as an employee.  There are great people overall and great food."
good,"Needs better management, overall good place to work would recommend to someone who wants to learn more about customer service and technical support with training"
good,Lots of opportunities for advancements and sharing ideas and exploring different options. 
good,"It is a challenge describing a typical work day at google Fiber, the rewards were matched fairly with the cooperative efforts of all my team members. I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to share my practical work experience with my coworkers."
good,"Enjoyed the year I spent there. No real structure.  As long as the minimum amount of hours were put in by the end of the week, you could work whenever you wanted."
good,"Amazing offices around the world, excellent restaurants and great equipment."
good,"This was a very fun place to work, they did lots of activities to keep people fresh and engaged. I really enjoyed it, unfortunately my position was a contract with an end date. So unless you could figure out something else to do that was needed to further the project then you were done."
good,Remarkable company with incredible transparency from leadership. Exciting to be involved with so many cutting edge products and working with very talented people.
good,"The job itself is fine, but the upper management don't necessarily appreciate their employees. They don't replace workers after turnover so work just builds on existing staff."
good,"Working here is ok, the benefits like 'free' food or the MK staff, who are fantastic. However, be assured you run the risk of becoming so sucked into this Google world that you forget what it was like to be on the outside. Some Googlers become over-privileged and some are great people. The company is huge now and feels as such."
good,I was contracted on a project at Google by Adecco.  I was a remote worker and travelled 75% of the time.  Its only a two year contract so it doesn't leave a lot of room to grow.  The project I was under seemed very disorganized and not at a level I would have expected from a company like Google.  This may be due to the fact that many of the moving parts are contracted but I witnessed a lot of issues due to poor communication and management.  I enjoyed my time there for the most part.  The job was very basic and monotonous but the pay was decent plus extras.
good,"Die Arbeit ist für Accenture für Google Adwords. Die Stelle wird nicht langweilig. Am Anfang ist man etwas überlaufen, aber das legt sich schnell. Man hat täglich neue Fälle und Herausforderungen."
good,A regular day for me is mostly busy ... receiving putting accessories into camp and Guts tickets . I'm on my feet 80% of the day due to Inventory as well as prepping task tickets. Management is pretty good no one over your back to micro manage. I have a hard working team . We work together and get the job done. The hardest part of my day i would say would be receiving pallets and putting them into google camp at the same time..
good,The aspects of the job was fine but management was horrible. They did not know what they was doing. co workers were great. hardest part was being able to keep in contact with management and trying to talk to them about things about the job we didnt like
good,"I spent my days researching digital marketing, curating content, creating/managing social media ad campaigns, and building social media fan base. It was my first position in the field and the owner was very understanding of this. I had the freedom to research and explore, but the opportunity for advancement was limited due to being a remote position."
good,Nessa empresa você tem oportunidade de aprender processos e coisas sobre a plataforma que nunca imagina e sempre tem atualizações.
good,"NOTE: the company is not GOOGLE, but REVEVOL a Google Premier Partner."
good,working with Google was really a good experience i can share with my friends. Co-workers were good. Work culture was good. Achievable   Goals.
good,"los ingresos son muy variables dependiendo del volumen de trabajo que ofrezcan, haciendo dificil poder tener unos ingresos consantes. Tardan muchisimo en pagar, y es facil que sin motivo realmente claro puedan restringir el volumen de trabajo. La unica opcion es darse de alta como autonomo par apoder cotizar. "
good,"At the time i was there it was a youthful environment full of strategic minded people thinking of the best way to make something out of an idea, which is what all great things grow from. "
good,"The hardest part of the job is staying ahead of the curve. Everyone working here is smarter, faster, and better than you. Find something interesting from your day-to-day task and become the master in that area. Make an impact."
good,"As a team supervisor, one oversees all team operators by creating roles and breaks to follow in concordance with successful productivity and processing. I have learned a great deal in data processing, creating and distributing sheets with information privy only to employers. Co-workers are exceptional to work with because there has been a mutual respect created within the work atmosphere. The most difficult part of the job is the adjustment to different locations depending on the weekly schedule."
good,Good people with good environment need .I am very much satisfied with this company
good,"The pay share i used to get for there clients advertisement is much less than the actual share of advertisement, but the amazing fact is you can work whenever you want to."
good,I worked there as a temp.  There was a high turnover rate due to people getting let go/leaving so often.
good,"I loved working for Google and my job; however, if you are a contractor you definitely get the lower end of the stick.  The culture is none like no other on the outside - work from home, flexible schedules, food galore, games, gym, etc.  However, management is very corporate and they still play the favoritism  games, etc.  It is very easy for someone to get caught up with the physical culture and the benefits of working for Google and overlook the fact that they are still strongly corporate behind closed doors.  They do not train you at all so if you work for Google you already know what you are doing and you should be able to sit down and get to work."
good,"Working with local business in N. Vermont and Google. Working to establish, repair and/or extend local businesses online presence in Google search results. "
good,"online advertising company"
good,"Company has great, perhaps the best perks you'll find anywhere. Pay is good, even for the non glamorous jobs. Makes sure that you have all the resources you need to get your job done. Can be a bit chaotic at times with a tendency to ""start from Z and go to A""."
good,"Many opportunities to learn, competitive work environment."
good,"As a Data Evaluator, i analyzed data for a project for Google Maps, this involved evaluating data by website, and by phone. I learnt how to use my own initiative,the most enjoyable part of the job was meeting all different nationalities and making new friends."
good,"Overall a great experience. Come hungry and you'll be busy! The work environment is great, and there is always so much to learn around the office. Everyone is friendly."
good,Coworkers are great and Most Managers are Amazing mine just happens to be bad. Competitive sales for commission so there is good money to be made if you can handle the competition. Great training and Knowledge imprinting.
good,"Very fun being a part of a project that is a new feature for a popular app that millions of people use everyday. Having the experience of using new technology called, Augmented Reality and how it will help people find there way throughout cities in the country is very profound."
good,"Find your niche and become a true Googler. It's a great place to work, but you have to be comfortable with being subsumed into the work and culture. It's not really a place for truly individualistic people."
good,"A great place to work with a fun, supportive, and exciting work environment. Creativity and thinking outside the box are not only welcomed but also encouraged."
good,lots of perks but not too many full time employees. Most are contract or will move to other cities. They also have lunch and breakfast every day. Also lots of oniste
good,"Overall decent experience with good compensation, interesting work for a remote position, and office perks. Low points were the TVC versus full-time employee culture and the micro-management policies imposed by the higher management."
good,Great work life balance and generous amenities. Promotions rarely happen and can be really tough to obtain. People are generally friendly and approachable.
good,"every day is new adventure and exiting to work there."
good,"Google is an exciting and dynamic work environment that is definitely oriented toward people under fifty.  Employees are expected to think critically, and think globally, while acting locally."
good,Can learn and grow at Google but can get stuck in one job- difficult to move up and around.  Lots of learning opportunities in special projects and assignments.  Amazing benefits.
good,"With superb dedication, initiative, collaboration, and networking skills, you can succeed and survive at this very demanding workplace.  They look for people with not just their skills but also for their well-roundedness as a person and as an employee."
good,"Google is a special place—it’s not perfect but it’s pretty close. "
good,Fun place to work and learn new stuff but you need to improve your skillset everyday or you will have problem in the future. Great benefits but unfortunately it is decreasing slowly.
good,I worked a contract job at Google as operation support I didn't have to go to allow the meetings but there is very meeting intensive lot of long hours quick quick and ambiguous direction is definitely not for people who are used to Long steady pace.
good,"I have a lot of experience writing software for over twenty years. If something wasn't working right, usually it was allowed to persist or something else was already built as a bandaid. Wonderful people. Wonderful products. Boss wonderful. Just not able to challenge the status quo. ""At google, we do it this way"""
good,Google is a great place to work with awesome culture. There's a lot of changes right now with new leadership.  So much is yet to be determined. Right now a bit disjointed from the field sales teams to executive leadership.
good,A lot of freedom to get work done. Loved it. I would recommend this company to family and friends. Fun place to work and be around like-minded people.
good,"As a temporary worker, I feel the employer paid me fairly.   Individualized ""thank you card"" from my manager is appreciated.  This is very impressive."
good,"Working on the Google MDP Project was fun. My co-workers were fun and easy to get along with and the managers were capable and professional."
good,"Great Place to work and grow, Culture is to take ownership, risks and get rewarded. The size has slowed down some of the processes but still a lot of opportunity if you can keep up with the velocity and speed."
good,"Have a lot of good benefits such as free food, free buses etc.etc."
good,"This review is for the other half of Google that works as a TVC (Temporary, Vendor, Contractor). I believe it's important, because that is what more than half the people who work there are, and the ratio of employee to TVC shrinks yearly. I am a vendor, and overall I will say have been treated well, and with kindness and respect. My only real issue is that despite many years working there, it's very hard to be made from a vendor to a permanent employee, and there is little room for advancement. If you are a TVC, you'll have to remember that overall, that is the case. Unless you are excellent at what you do and happen to be at the right place at the right time, you'll probably do best to work there, get a solid reputation and skillset, and then use the Google name to go somewhere else. If you want to come back, you may be made full time once you have more experience under your belt."
good,"Google software and hardware are some of the best in the industry. I worked with excellent engineers and enjoyed great benefits and perks. At times I didn't agree with the leadership's direction, however they were usually very open with their thinking."
good,"Its a great company to work for but sometimes it can get a little bit too stressful. A lot of times, its because of long approval processes, which hurts our team in terms of time."
good,The culture is awesome.  People are supportive and welcoming.  You have various places to work within the building that are comfortable and you can work in peace.
good,In the beginning I loved working at Google Express but there are several layers of management you have to get thru in order for your problems to be solved. They over hire and cut back on everyones hours. They schedule employees based on how fast you work and if you know the store location. and if you live in another borough forget about working somewhere close to home and be prepared to hop from location to location. The job is so easy it just sucks that the management doesnt really care about their staff.
good,"Google is what everyone thinks it is. Very relaxed, very friendly. However, something no one thinks about is the contracting. Contractors are treated very poorly. They are released whenever they feel like it even if you are exceeding metrics. That is the only concerning area"
good,Can be extremely boring but overall relaxing and not too stressful. Management is kind and understanding but not much progression can be seen. Good part-time job.
good,Good place to work if you are looking for consistent hours and have a flexible schedule. This also a good situation for you if you are diligent and have a quick work pace
good,"If you enjoy digital sales, this is the place to be. You will benefit from the constant mentoring and on the job support that is provided to all employees. Company sets high standards for all its employees, excellent for people who like to push their boundaries. Work can become monotonous and less stimulating over a period of time, but the company allows you the flexibility to switch roles."
good,"Loving Staff, Friendly Atmosphere. Interesting co-workers, Fun Team. Looking forward to same kind of place and team ti work with."
good,It's a fun project to be a part of. It's fast paced but fun. It challenges you and rewards you. I have  a great and supportive manager and my team is great to work with.
good,"Great place to work.  Depending on your position, promotion options may be limited.  If you are young and starting there early in your career then no worries."
good,"1) Career growth opportunities can be significantly more given the opportunities company has in all emerging tech growth areas. "
good,"I really like their culture of running meetings and being on time. A 30 min. meeting defaults to 25 minutes, and 1 hour meetings default to 50 minutes on their calendar so you have time to prepare for your next meeting. "
good,"Great company full of incredibly smart people. Culture feels like it's shoved down your throat a bit though. Other than that, not much to complain about. Great perks, great compensation, awesome people."
good,"Since when I started working in different projects for Google I had the opportunity to learn many things related to Marketing and Digital. The dynamic and creative environment gave me the chance to grow a lot in terms of self motivation to learn new things and in terms of self management, thanks to this I developed a 'get things done' attitude and to be more productive in my work place."
good,"Typical day would be starting the day off at the gym to get the day started, arriving in to work early and organise my working day with which accounts to review in what order, responding to urgent email enquiries, set a personal target of achieving new accounts and making sure I left my self time for breaks and lunch. "
good,"I've worked several vendor jobs at google. Last hiring was a contract job for GSX(google shopping) limited contact 2 years only.good short term job placement for me at the time. "
good,"Working at Google was an amazing experience however, there is not much room for growth. "
good,"My workplace at Google was in the Production kitchen. A typical day starts at 9 am and the kitchen is very busy and fast paced, I deliver foods to each building on the campus and at the end of the day I close the kitchen down and leave by 530 or 6pm."
good,"Dans ma ville natale, Zurich. Nous avons de nombreuses cultures différentes, j'ai donc pu apprendre dans le cadre de mon travail de nombreux plats nouveaux tels que ""lentilles daal"", ""jambalaya"" ou encore banane plantain. J'aime apprendre de nouveaux plats et préparations."
good,"It was a place where work flowed in small amounts, but it got done rather quickly.  Diverse group of workers with a lot to offer.  Loved the team I work with."
good,The stigma of being a contract worker at Google is very apparent. The overall atmosphere contains a lot of superiority complex. People there are very stuck up.
good,"Typical day at work is situated around your computer, or in a conference room. It is nice to have so many options for break time entertainment... to take a load off of staring into your computer all day. Free warm lunch is provided every day, and the mini kitchens allow you to store your lunch but also partake in cold drinks, hot coffee, and even toasted bagels if you choose."
good,"I was contracted through ranstad, had the perks of being able to eat in any cafeteria or use the gyms, as well as the bikes. The Rolle I was in was a new role a while back we were client support when google first took over the market place and launch the Asus tablet."
good,No typical day at work everyday something new. The atmosphere was always good everyone willing to help everyone. hard thing was the new updates every once a month. The best part of the job was getting to know people you working with as everyone was from a different background.
good,"I don't have anything to mention as i would not like to add any specific details about the company. However, it is great place to work with flexibility."
good,"Management is incredibly flexible with work hours and starting/leaving time. Working from home happens often. Parking and commute can be a pain due to congested roads. Workplace is open environment, so it can get loud. Lots of interesting, challenging problems you're likely to never see anywhere else. Security has the benefit of having the support of upper management tiers, making it less cumbersome to get your work done. Friendly working environment, albeit the job itself can be very, very stressful if you're bad about work/life balance."
good,"Google is a fast paced company with many new projects, programs, and challenges popping up everyday. It can be difficult to keep up with the all of the changes and work/life balance is always an issue. Management is flexible and accommodating which makes dealing with the sheer volume of issues a bit easier."
good,"The day Starts With lots of emails"
good,"The job is good its a contracted job so it only lasts 2 yrs, its fast paced at times and really slow at times..ice learned a lot about time management and how to multitask better...It also helps me be a better self starter..make crucial time decisions and listen."
good,"This is an ideal place to work. If I wouldn't have gone back to Vietnam for family reasons, I would love to stay here to work. "
good,"I was a TVC (Temp) for 2 years, which is the max.  I was amazed at what benefits I got for not being an employee. The culture is unmatched by any company I have worked for. "
good,Great place!!! Nice people. Amazing enviroment where you can lear a lot.
good,"Empresa de grande porte com clima agradável, com ideias e planos inovadores, Gerencia exigente acessíveis,  atenciosos e a equipe é sempre muito unida e dinâmica."
good,It is a fun place to work. Free meals and cab benefits are included. Less work pressure and cool atmosphere. No political pressure. But salary hike is less and no growth in career.
good,"- A typical day would would be to start by checking in to my work station by logging on to phone. answer calls to support fiber install techs in there needs. analyze calls (call volumes & reasons for calls) to sreamline and understand call flow. "
good,"working here had its ups and downs but overall, the time i put in was not bad at all. i got to learn a new things and met amazing people along the way. As far as management goes i dont want to speak to much of them seeing as i have nothing nice to say, but i will say communication with your employees should always be key when running a business"
good,i worked in one of the top companies it was great experience over there. i use to enjoy my work with my team. i never felt the work was burden for me. we use to participate in everything.
good,"Outstanding work environment with open minded co-workers. You are free to prioritize your daily tasks. Limited supervision as long as you respect projects' deadlines."
good,Google Squared Online provided me great experience in the Digital market place and gave me a good platform to build from. Excellent client portfolio and marketing team.
good,"For those who are still trying to determine what to do with their careers, this would be a beneficial position to keep you financially afloat until that is figured out. A typical day consists of being very slow in the early morning and picking up the pace during the lunch period. The focus is to ensure the satisfaction and comfort of Google employees, whether it is giving them medical attention, helping them find a lost item, or doing activities more behind the scenes that they are unaware of. There really is no difficult part of the job, the coworkers and supervisors are wonderful, and human interaction is the best part, as well as being a part of a lively culture."
good,I had 5 conversations with my manager in a year. never personal and very short. I learned everything from my coworkers. Google hires some of the most intelligent people I have ever had the pleasure to work with. The food is great and Google takes care of coworkers with excellent benefits and fun employee functions. The down fall is that job security is a big issue. Google is always looking for someone better and will have no concern with letting you go in a heartbeat.
good,"My initial role involved geospatial data collection. It was contract position and 80% travel. I was promoted multiple times there within my time there to Operations Lead. In this role I was in charge of the admin process and management of associates administering data collection throughout the United States, Australia, and some parts of Canada.The project was fairly new and underwent a major operational infrastructure change. "
good,"pretty good company to work for. great environment, amazing team.very friendly atmosphere.i learned a lot while being here,learned more about google and of course gained more tech skills too"
good,"A typical day was lots of different financial duties, the main thing i learned was to do with PPC & Wildcat. I enjoyed my coworkers but it was frustrating getting anything changed with the work structure."
good,"AdWords professionel hvor vi var ansvarlige for vores kunders online kampagner. Arbejdet var spændende, men det var svært at få den rette provision udbetalt."
good,"85% of meetings are via Google Hangout, very flexible and fun environment but easy to get distracted and  has a LOTTTT of re-org. So prepare to change roles, teams, management every quarter!"
good,"Rather monotone and very much inside the box"
good,You always need to watch out and schedule work since there is more work that needs to get done then there are resources (people).
good,"I have learned many things, like how to deal with flustrated cusotmers. How to make them understand."
good,"Dynamic environment with extremely high goals and objectives.  Cross-functional work on a daily basis, requiring in-depth overall program knowledge."
good,Here its indeed one of the best place to work. You get lot of exposure and also opportunity to explore yourself in which field you prefer to.
good,"- Most days in front of a computer working on photographs."
good,"I worked at Google as a contractor for Adecco.  99% of my interaction were with Google employees versus Adecco so I am basing my review on that.  "
good,"From the moment I step into work, and the minute I leave, I am on my feet with nonstop workload. My store lead, she's amazing at managing our shift, from giving us a role we are good at on busy days and roles that we need to work on on a slow day. Our morning team has two cutoff time we need to make, and we communicate with each other to make sure we hit the time. This position has taught me a lot; products, prices, stockroom, and working under pressure. I enjoyed this position the most because of the energetic environment and how well a group of strangers could work so well together. The downfall would be the amount of time it took me to get to the Bronx. I live in Queens, and my shift starts at 6am everyday, I needed to be on the train by 4am to make it to work."
good,Main Responsibilities: Visiting various large sized retailers on a daily basis in order to validate online shopping information and inventory details using a mobile device and bespoke software while interacting in a professional way with Managers and Employees at all times
good,This is a part-time position that could be done any time from home.
good,Typical day is as you make it. You get what you put into it. Hardest part is maintaining self-discipline.
good,"A nice place to work I enjoyed my time there,	Schedule and dispatch workers, work crews, equipment, or service vehicles to appropriate locations according to customer requests, specifications, or needs, using radios or telephones."
good,Developing Android Games and accepting projects from clients who wants to advertise their products through Games.

good,"Great Company, difficult to navigate sometimes. Management can sometimes not be attentive"
good,"Buenos compañeros de trabajo, y me gusta su facilidad y libertad de horarios."
good,"A typical day at my current position at Google starts by logging into my computer, checking email for updates or any other necessary information, and checking the Calendar for any meetings. Then moving data around using the proprietary software that they have made for us to provide data to engineers in Mountain View occupies the rest of the day. The coworkers and culture is the best thing about working here. The relationships you make, and the people you meet make coming to work an enjoyable experience. The management and the directions the project veers according to their leadership is the most difficult thing about working here."
good,"Like a duck - cool on top, paddling hard at the bottom. Great atmosphere and challenging"
good,Things were Fine all around but yet little discomfort But still Okay good
good,Google is a innovative and fast evolving company. The company provides a lot of benefits and opportunities to pursue personal and professional passions.
good,"Working at Google was refreshing but also shows that your life is suppose to be dedicated to work. They offer almost any amenity that you will possibly need so as to keep you working. All in all that isn't a bad thing but have a balance of work and life is paramount if you don't want to burn out. My position was transitionary so I did not experience the full intensity of the work life, but I was around it and could see the affects.But, there too are great perks and I did experience those!"
good,"Google is definitely a great company to work at, but as it got larger some teams became a bit corporate and about politics."
good,"I learn a lot about time management, multitasking and how to take decisions based on data analyses."
good,"Working for Google is very rewarding in the sense that millions of users depend on the products, and being able to create a better user experience for users in several different countries is very exciting. I've learned how to adapt to change very quickly. The management and my co-workers are supportive and the community-like culture allows us to collaborate with each other, which makes working more efficient and enjoyable. The biggest challenge of this job is that nothing stays the same, the only thing that stays constant is change.The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to help thousands of businesses and users."
good,"Very fast pace environment with lots of experienced gained in the department of net working communications, and research."
good,"A typical day involves a lot of freedom, minimal micromanaging, and fun client work. But also involves a lot of managing upward and striving to be heard amidst all the noise (it is a big company afterall)."
good,"Very stressful, though support environment."
good,A typical day included business operational tasks. I learned how to provide quality service at scale. The workplace culture was very open and friendly. It was easy to make friends and feel supported by co-workers.
good,"Good work and life balance, fair pay, overall positive team dynamic and some healthy amounts of competitions. Overall a great experience at the Toronto office."
good,"Google wants to make its employees' lives easier, and it's constantly searching for ways to improve the health, well-being, and morale of its Googlers. Google offers on-site physicians, nurses, medical services and health care coverage to keep its employees happy and healthy."
good,Gained fundamental knowledge of Google Ads and also had a great time with colleagues. Good workspace with proper facilities and perks. Work life balance is taken care off.
good,Google has an incredible array of projects and is constantly adding new ones.  Many of these are completely game changing from the well known ones like Waymo to the under the radar ones like terrestrial FSOC. The culture has changed too from its early days when it was great.
good,Working for Google was both challenging and interesting and a Place i would highly recommend or even apply for again. The culture their is relaxed and supportive. It was a Position you could move up in and learn through.
good,"I learned a lot of troubleshooting techniques while I was at Google. Management was fair, and some of the people were friendly and sociable. The workplace culture may need some work."
good,Great company to work for. Everything you hear and read. Sales culture is changing however. What it turns to still remains to be seen.  Great place to start (and finish) a career. Seasoned sales leaders might not find it as enjoyable.
good,"Google is an incredible company, however your experience is directly related to your particular team/manager/etc. I've found similar feedback on the Blind app and from chatting with hundreds of coworkers."
good,Best I ever worked at. Too bad they have more contract positions than perm positions. If I could have stayed there to work I would of. Everyone there is friendly and it was always a great environment.
good,"Buen ambiente de trabajo, suficiente acceso a posiciones superiores."
good,Working for Google fiber was interesting. I learned about installing a new fiber optic network in Charlotte. I also would definitely recommend working for this company the work/life balance was the best part.
good,"I was a contractor and was given flexibility work hours I chose to work as long as I complete the job daily. The team I worked is great to work with and we collaborated our responsibilities very well. It was a learning experience and I get to see so many places in my travel. As a contractor, your chance does not improve the odds of landing a permanent job with Google. They treated me with respect and was very accommodating to provide ASL interpreter for meetings and training."
good,"I loved google, they were such a great company to work for as an intern. However, my manager was not very good at managing, nor were they very good at delegating tasks or setting expectations. It made me not want to return full-time, and I am glad that I will be seeking employment elsewhere post-graduation"
good,"Great perks available, especially if you like sports: multiple gyms, classes, outdoor soccer fields, tennis courts, etc. The food is good and there are options for every diet."
good,"I learned how to create videos and upload to YouTube, and distributed videos on Google+, FaceBook and Twitter. I worked the hours I wanted to work, and connect with others on social media."
good,"Contract ended earlier than expected with bcforward. But, it was a great place to work, with tons of training, and great people.  The free lunches was a plus"
good,"its a good job , very quick paced and has good pay as well. Lots of time off (paid) , also has weekly pay. Located on 14th street so it is very convenient to get to."
good,"As a contractor I worked at Mountain View and also on the YouTube Ads project in San Bruno.  "
good,"Great environment for learning from one of the most talented people I've worked with, but at the same time very competitive and fast paced. Make use of extra time to developer relationships outside your org!"
good,Very relaxed environment. The work pace is slow. If you’re someone who thrives in a fast paced office this role would not be for you. The work is also easy. Some days could be busy but mostly not. The full time employees tend to test the contractors different.
good,This job was a great job the only problem was it was a one year contract. If it wasn’t for that I would probably still b working there. Fast paced environment.
good,Lot of learning as an outsider and let everyone learn new tools to manage the work place. No end to learning and plenty of opportunities for growth in the organization.
good,You can find anything on Google. Google has absolutely no internal organization. Structure and accountability are things not included in Google perks package.  You got ping pong tables and climbing walls instead.
good,"Always new challenges, effective management, determined coworkers with great vision. Everyone works hard and take time to enjoy the work and time off."
good,"Google is an amazing company to work at. The work/balance is is unreal, and the perks are very good. However, certain parts of the company are becoming corporate as they get bigger, and are beginning to lose the traditional Google mentality that people are used to."
good,"Os gestores as vezes favorecem os puxa saco devido a isso, as vezes ficamos de mãos atadas."
good,"A typical day was sitting at my desk, consulting clients over the phone and learning more about Google."
good,"Contract gig. Interesting projects that I cannot discuss in detail, but I got to work with smart people on products that might or might not be released."
good,Working at a site  that helped me grow with a team. I learned various ways of how to trouble shoot to find out different factors. Learned a lot of their in-house software and system.
good,"Loved the job, even though it often involved difficult physical work. The people I worked with and for were amazing. I was honored to work for such a place. Wish I didn't have to leave."
good,"Pros"
good,This was a new experience for me since it was my first exposure to a true sourcing role. This was great experience in sourcing but was limited to just that so was not the best long term fit for me.
good,wish it was full time.   I was a contract employee so no benefits or perks.    loved the job travel to and from my home was quite far but the people and atmosphere were amazing .  I would recommend working at google for anyone even a chef
good,You are in charge of your career and are given tools and opportunities to advance yourself.  Software engineering is the main focus so may not be a place for non-technical oriented people.
good,"I enjoy working at Google as a research coordinator because we are in a team-oriented environment but also we know what each individual needs to do to be successful. The work is different everyday and we get many new projects weekly. I love the culture at google, because it is very relaxed but people know when to work hard and when to have fun. Google has taught me a lot of different skill sets that I can take with me into my new career. The only thing that I would say that's negative is job security, and employee benefits."
good,"The company was decent. It was not too stressful, reviewed scanned images of books on a daily. Management and HR were great. Wish the pay was a bit better."
good,"Google creates an environment for creativity to thrive. "
good,"You need to be on your toes and sharp to work there.  There's a lot of smart and competitive people.  lots of great lifestyle perks, but expect the hours to be typically longer than most companies."
good,"Probably great place to work if you are not a contractor! As a contractor, your access is very restricted. Management style is ok, not mircor management. Communication is relaxed."
good,"Working at google is wonderful. I enjoy working at here and want to stay longer if I can. There are enough parking spots. Also, I can join free gym classes."
good,Great place to have a family but if you are ambitious...it is  not the right company. It is very difficult to be promoted because it it very corporative
good,"Google is a great place to work if you're here full-time. As a contractor there is way too much work instability. Sometimes you're lucky to find great managers who are willing to sponsor you for a full time role. Other times, the management you're working with only sees you as a means to a result and you're left with just the name on your resume, looking for another job outside of Google."
good,"Meu trabalho consiste em fazer triagem de app modernos que não tem dinheiro suficiente para investidos ou mesmo desenvolve los, fico a triagem no estado de SC com as melhores ideias e se meu chef aprovar acabo ganhando uma comissão. "
good,"Best place I have ever worked for having a fun and productive work day. Great attitudes, great collaboration, and most importantly everyone has a great work ethic."
good,I started as a dishwasher got promoted to and porter and then a Reciever there's a lot of room for growth. As a Reciever I check all food that comes into the building for my floor by temping and making sure it's 40 or below. Check to make sure the quality looks good.
good,"A great place to work in one of the most innovative companies in the world!!! All 5 starts to work place and culture, working with very talented people from all over the globe!"
good,The workday is nice and simple once you get the hang of it. Most people are really nice. The work was never too stressful unless deadlines were coming up.
good,"I am dedicated to improving the customer's experience with the company. A typical day at work would involve optimizing online campaigns and assets, sending satisfaction surveys and attending them to inquire about their professional needs. As customer service advocate, we are the front liners of the company. Therefore, our answers are professional and concrete according to standard operating procedures. I don't find working with client's difficult but working with difficult clients may be challenging at times. I have a high level of patience and tolerance and that, in my opinion, is my strong trait"
good,"A good place to work. "
good,"Typically I create assignments for my subordinates to work on and allocate them for training sessions, set deadlines for creating training materials and reports. I usually take up critical calibration sessions and simultaneously I mentor my subordinates on the same. Learned a lot about managing a team and I have groomed myself a lot in the process.The management is pretty decent and organised like it should be. The hardest part of the jobs is to maintain deadlines as the tasks are pretty time consuming. The work environment and the culture on the floor is the most enjoyable part of this job."
good,"Google is a great place to work, hard deadlines but manageable, overall very nice atmosphere. Great people to work with."
good,Got to learn more about the digital advertising space which was enjoyable and interesting. A lot of your experience here will depend on the team and the functional group that you are in.
good,Great job for going back to school and working from home whenever I had the time. Very convenient and the pay was not bad. Recommend it to anyone who needs a part time job.
good,"Overall a Productive, Innovative and Fun workplace. That said, the intense competition between the extremely intelligent and competitive environment between colleagues can get intense at times with people resorting to pull in long hours sometimes just to try and get ahead"
good,"I Enjoy working with this company and gained hands on experience in GIS and Mapping. The Maintenance, Food and the Transportation is better compare to other company."
good,"Fun, casual, fast paced working environment that teaches self discipline while learning new software. Learn proprietary GIS with decent oversight on workflow as well as experimental workflow."
good,"There were pros and cons, but overall i believe it is a nice, cool, and fun place to work at. I learned a lot of skills that will help me in the future."
good,"Working environment is good"
good,I enjoyed working for Google Express because of the valuable experience I collected. I learned how to successfully manage a team of 20+ employees. Management worked hard to insure we had everything we needed to be successful. I enjoyed my co-workers because they came from different backgrounds and brought something different to the table in terms of experience.
good,"Google is a great place to work. The culture here is unlike any other. You're encouraged to be creative, and that in turn is infectious because it motivates employees to give it their all. There are great perks around the main campus - the main one being free food. But it's nice to take a break and go play volleyball or take a ride down one of the slides."
good,"One of the best companies to work, Good and friendly environment at work."
good,"Working with google was good experience. My job dealt with google maps.As I was working for Point of interests, I had lot to do with the research work. I learnt so many things while working with google. The stress level was comparatively low, as there use to be fun activities for the employees. Apart from working in my team I also use to be a member of fun club and emergency team. The hardest part of the job was to finish your targets, which I believe every job has. The best part was the job timings and least stressful."
good,The position was very productive. Help manage wear house and help unload my drivers trucks. Interact with with a lot of people. Was constantly busy.
good,"Great place to work, great peers,perks and management. The caveat being that there is only two teams that work in the local area. In order to move on you either need to change companies or move."
good,"-> The most typical day at work was when we worked on others project for mare than 15 - 16 hours a day. That was really very happy we did that in time. "
good,"Typically, my day begins with Google employees coming into a parking garage. The garage I'm in tends to fill up pretty fast so as soon as all the spots are taken, I direct the employees in a single file line. I get their information down including phone number and estimated time of departure, they hand me their keys and I give them a ticket. As soon as spots start opening up, I'll take a valeted car and park it for the employee. Our management is okay, a bit inexperienced but still learning the ropes. My co workers are great and easy to get along with. Easiest part of the job is pretty much everything. The hardest I'd say is sitting in traffic on my way home."
good,"With breakfast, lunch and dinner all in the same building, you never needed to go anywhere, which improved work being completed on time. Did not hurt that ping pong, video games & foosball was within arm's reach."
good,"Look up Adecco in San Bruno, CA and ask about their ""Google"" branch. It's through this staffing agency that they recruit temps to have a chance at having a stay with Google. Valuable stuff I'm telling you here - Good luck!"
good,"Overall, Google is an incredible company to work for and learn from. You work alongside the brightest, and have the opportunity to learn and grow in a highly stimulating and creative environment. You can, however, feel like a hamster in a wheel, and like trying your hand at other roles, or looking to move up, can feel nearly impossible. The perks and co-workers make the job amazing. The hardest part is that you're stuck in such a specific niche that can feel really boring, and under challenging after a while."
good,"I was hired with a group of 30+ people to provide Googles Play Store with Technical/ Product Ordering Support. My time with Randstaff Staffing as a temporary worker was short lived, as Google decided to cut the project and lay us off a week later. Despite the temporary set back, I was fortunate to be hired among a pool of Thousands of applicants and I consider that an accomplishment in and of itself. I was grateful for my time at Google and LOVED the micro kitchen with unlimited snack privilages."
good,"My typical day at work would involve logging into Sales Force, Pycis and Cases. I'd review customer emails to obtain information on the customers issue. I then would need to go over the customers information to take the proper steps to resolve issue. I'd respond to customer via email with the confirmation of resolution, or ask for more information to proceed to resolve issue. The most enjoyable part of working there was the atmosphere. They created a fun and enjoyable environment that encouraged positive attitude and constant production. Management was very supportive and informative, which promoted a great learning environment. What was difficult about my job was that the availability for promotion in the company was extremely limited. There has to be self motivation to keep a positive view for remaining at the company long term."
good,"I have been working in the industry past 7yrs , have experiences working with good management teams. Have good support from my team always. Have enjoyed working with multiple companies & got good experience."
good,"O trabalho era realizado nas ruas de Santos, onde eu analisava e conferia informações recolhidas pelos walker da minha equipe, conversava com minha equipe visando melhoria de qualidade, criava polígonos novos a serem feitos, e resolvia problemas rapidos ."
good,"Working as an account executive for Google is very informative, adventurous and quirky."
good,"A typical day at work consists of providing our Candidates (who are interviewing for Google) a positive experience. As a Candidate Host we are also there to help with any day to day issues that may occur during or before an interview. My co-workers are amazing and always a huge help if I do need any help. We all work independently and we work hard as a team. I don't believe my job is hard, I see it more as a challenge to help me grow within the company. The most enjoyable part of the job is the diversity different backgrounds, everyone at Google is incredibly nice and always willing to help you as well as throwing fun facts your way."
good,Get a great chance to learn about how Google is changing their search engines and what really makes them the best company to work with.
good,A typical day is 9-5 and the workplace is positive. The hardest part of my job is being recognized. The most enjoyable part of my job is the freedom the position gives me.
good,Great benefits at Google. Hard to stand out due to large amount employees. The culture is very diverse. Lots of incredibly smart people to learn from.
good,Overall Google is an awesome company to work for.  There are tons of great opportunities and awesome people.
good,A typical work day would include the set-up and inspection of technical data capturing equipment. The nature of the job required continuous attention to detail and a high level of situational awareness. The independent nature of the working environment required an extraordinary level of trust and communication with management. The hardest part of the job was also the most rewarding part. This included setting personal goals which would successfully translate into meeting goals of the entire project. The most enjoyable part of the project required the highest level of personal restraint and responsibility. This was being able to effectively communicate the goals of the project without divulging sensitive details.
good,"I was fortunate to have worked at Google for seven years, in a variety of sales and operations roles. I loved getting to work on cutting edge global products, collaborating with brilliant people, and enjoying really generous benefits and perks. The hardest part about working at Google, particularly in my latter years, was trying to get things done in such a large company."
good,"I take incoming calls and emails from world wide clients. I work out solutions to problems, installations and migrations to newer versions of software. I tested software for issues to resolve technical issues and new features."
good,供职于 Google 中国商业合作部，从事市场分析，数据分析，针对于中高端客户的广告销售及帐户管理等工作。
good,"Google is an amazing place to work and its not a conventional company,"
good,Overall good experience and very constructive. Very thoughtful for others perspective about the work environment and culture of the company. It is wonderful step helpful for everyone.
good,"Innovadora,aprendes siempre algo nuevo. Es muy interesante."
good,"It was a great place to work! Except the building had bed bugs. The hours worked for me and it was close to my house, and they give out presents like TVs and XBoxes and PS."
good,"Google was a great place to work, but it does have some issues. "
good,Great environment and loads of great mentors. The culture was inviting and many social events. Loads of food and perks. Plenty of buildings to keep yourself entertained.
good,The perks and amenities alone make it almost worth the jobs. Everything is free and accessible to some extent. Everything is pretty laid back and easy going as long as you're not affecting anyone's work or money.
good,"My general experience at Google was positive."
good,Typically a day consisted of helping clients with there accounts and encouraging them to try new strategies to improve their had relevance in the Google platform
good,"Pick, pay and packing was the summary of the day. Learned a lot about the efficiency and accuracy of multitasking. Worked alongside other eager co-workers."
good,The people and management were great. They were very understanding in all situations and were very professional. I learned how to do inventory and how to do daily sales of products.
good,"At Google Creative Lab we sought innovative solutions to some of today's biggest challenges whilst reminding the world what they love about the Google brand. We would create our own briefs, or respond to briefs from internal Google teams - either way we would work with the world's best writers, designers, developers and film makers and product specialists to create award wining experiences."
good,Smartest nicest people I have worked with. I am told this can vary from one group to another. A lot of work is expected and the standards for code clarity and format are very high to pass a code review.
good,"I learned a TON working with the people in this office and the environment is like working in a resort. Everyone on my team was incredibly respectful of the learning curve I had to go through and supported me along the way. My primary issue was with management, we were largely left to fend for ourselves and our team was dissolved with very little notice to us. Despite being such an accomplished company, temporary employees/contractors are largely treated as disposable/ignored."
good,"Great place to work especially if you can get on as a full-time ""Googler"".  A large number of employees are contract and/or vendor roles.  Becoming an actual employee of Google is tough."
good,"J’ai travaillé chez Google via une société sous traitante ce qui fait que je ne suis pas mieux placé pour noter à fond cette structure. Bref les Googlers sont toujours mieux traité que les Vendors. Et leur façon de manager les contrats avec les sociétés sous traitantes ne garantit pas le boulot des employés de ces dernières car Google change de sous traitants comme on change les couches des bébés. Et c’est unfair pour les employés qui à un moment donné sont forcés à quitter le site qu’ils aiment bien et les gens avec qui ils étaient déjà habitués. Si non c’est un environnement plutôt top niveau pour le travail. Déjà tout est offert gratuitement du petit déjeuner, déjeuner, goûter, salle de gym, de danse, de jeux etc..."
good,Excellent place to work. Lot of potential to learn about the technology and how it works. Amazing colleagues to work with a loot of helping nature. Top notch management.
good,"A  typical day would be cashiering or helping other people in other ways,. I learned that you need to be consienscious and honest.  Management in my workplace would be productive, care about it's employees and treat others with respect and courtesy,  The hardest part of a job for me is having to deal with two customers at once and trying to prioritize my time with each customer to make them each feel wanted or that their needs and wants for me helping them out is important.  The most enjoyable part of a job for me would be helping people and working in a atleast semi-relaxing atmosphere with nice people.  I would ask to work in a place where the customers and employees were treated kindly and with respect,"
good,"Mostly worked inside of the  Machine shop, performed equipment moves and worked with other teams to perform assembly tasks Contact was short at 3 months long."
good,"While Google can be a lot of fun to work at, it does feel somewhat like a big staffing firm.  The bar of talent seems to have dropped as the Austin location has grown. Regardless, there are few better places to work out there!"
good,Google is a great place to work. it has changed obviously in the past 12 years I have been here as it has grown larger. It has lost some of the start up feel.
good,I was a TVC for Google Fiber.  I enjoyed what I did for Google in the short time I was onsite.  The culture for Google was a great learning experience that I had never done before.  I would do it again.
good,Prepare to work hard. The better you work with your manager and coworkers the easier it is to advance. Be prepared for tough performance reviews. They have high expectations from all their employees.
good,"Everything in Google is great except for the management specially with the vendor. I don't have any issues with the benefits but for the vendor it self, they do not give accurate information specially for the incentives."
good,"Typical day at work I was empowered to run my own business. I obtained strengths in areas that I had not yet built out, like analytics and SaaS. The hardest part is being under a non-renewable contract; I am not mobile at this time and if I was I would have been supported to apply for full-time roles."
good,"There are a lot of things to like about working at Google, but there is the potential to get the feeling that you're just another cog in the machine there. If you put 100% of yourself into the job, work nights and weekends you will do well, if you try to maintain a strong work/life balance it will be difficult to excel."
good,There are incredible people and opportunities to make a large impact.  The perks and technical support are fantastic.  There is strong attention to users and opportunities to engage with professionals outside Google as well.
good,"Great, fun place to work. The perks do wear off and does start to have that large corp feel and you are just a number. Can definitely see how some can thrive and others fall by the wayside"
good,Good work enviorment and atmoesphere. lots of perks and possibilites.room for growth. google helps with the commute. Good people to network with and a safe wokplace
good,"Wages and benefits are greatest perks. Culture bit stale, depends on your workgroup. Very smart coworkers can lead to a ""know it all culture"", inhibiting new ideas."
good,The work culture of Google was great. The people are friendly and like having fun. The one problem I had with it was sometimes you would be dragged into it when you were trying to accomplish work and finding quiet places to get work accomplished could be difficult since the closed off office spaces were typically occupied by meetings and the desks were all in an open space.
good,"Google has a diverse environment,  interesting place to work at. everyday the company give out free lunch. always enjoying my work day never stressing out. its a great job"
good,"What's beautiful about this approach is that a great environment is a self-reinforcing one: All of these efforts support one another, and together create an organization that is creative, fun, hardworking, and highly productive"
good,"lots of great perks like free food, workout facility, great office but limited growth and challenges"
good,I have truly enjoyed my time on the Google Express project as a fulfillment lead. I am given a lot of freedom to implement process improvements and work with the in store team to drive positive change. I have worked with a variety of people across multiple cross functional team that builds a strong culture at work.
good,"Google offers extremely flexible working schedule, and they definitely ensure employees are well taken care of. They also offer all kinds of trainings to ensure employees are advancing."
good,"I have been working at Intelenet full-time (Less than a year), Friendly environment surrounded by colleagues and team leaders.For a beginner it's a good start."
good,"The benefits and compensation are unparalleled in the market. The competency, friendliness, willingness to collaborate among peers was exceptional. Most middle management was grossly ineffective, even impeding progress and hampering promotions for dedicated team members. There was also an underlying atmosphere of misogyny that wasn't present in every interaction, but would reveal itself as a ""boys club"" when it came time for dolling out credit and ascending the ranks. I would work there again due to the high level of compensation."
good,"I worked as a contractor for 2 years at Google, and overall it was a positive experience. The culture and benefits of being onsite were incredible, but being a contractor had a lot of downsides. I performed at a high level and they chose not to convert me (or many of my coworkers) to FT status because they preferred to hire people fresh out of Ivy League schools. With the culture of companies moving away from this model (and with how broken the university system is in general), I was surprised to see Google wasn't at the forefront of hiring people based on talent and not based on where they went to school."
good,Google/CDI was a great experience and I am eternally grateful for all the people I met and the exposure I got through this role. My contract ended and I'm currently looking for new opportunities!
good,Job is very easy with lots of free time on hand. Hired through a staffing agency. Little to none upward career mobility. Goals tend to be set too high for slower markets.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working at Google and was understandably disappointed when my contract was not extended (due to new hiring procedures within my department).
good,All in all a great company to work for but advancement beyond a certain point can be extremely difficult.  Benefits and perks are amazing just like you hear about.
good,Typical day included monitoring day to day test performance and investigating issues with those tests. It was enjoyable to code and do work. It involved working with very sociable and helpful coworkers.
good,"Enjoyed my time at Google, nothing to repent, but managers are so-so for an otherwise great company. "
good,I enjoyed working at Google and formed great friendships. It was very fast-paced as I started there pre-IPO and left a few years after the IPO. I understand it is a very different company but I learned a lot during my tenure there.
good,"I'd like to find out more on growing the CPC rate."
good,"Work environment is awesome.  You get many perks working here.  Free meals, gym, snacks, coffee, and etc.  Although depending on what program you are in, it can be hard to move up."
good,Empresa de gran renombre y en la cual existe buena disposición de personal en Estados Unidos.
good,"Coordinate events that took place in building."
good,"As a store operator, I drove my own car to a large chain store that Google was partnered with and stayed in a back stock room with the rest of the team. We would get specialized smartphones that received incoming shopping orders that we would then purchase from the store with a Google credit card, neatly package, and place them in a convenient location at the store and wait for the courier drivers to pick up the packages. Some days were busy all day, some days only had one or two orders. The people who worked alongside me were great people. Very friendly and fun to work with, The manager took her job a little too seriously, and didn't interact with the rest of us unless it was to give orders or tell us we did something wrong. The hardest part of the job was finding some of the items, as stores like Target or Toys-R-Us have huge amounts of products. The most enjoyable part of the job was having fun with your co-workers and making work into something of a game or competition that would give us motivation, increase our productivity, and keep our spirits up."
good,Intelinet global services  is a service provider organisation  at global level. Working environment was fun as colleges and seniors have friendly nature.
good,"Working for Vaco was my first real job out of college. They recruited me two months after I graduated and I wasn't going to pass up on an opportunity to to work for Google. Been here for 3 years and its been a wonderful 3 years. The people, culture, and experience was like no other and I wouldn't have traded my experience for anything. Looking forward to taking what I've learned here to the next step and put myself on the job market again."
good,"A typical day is summed up by saying; its cool place to work, the Google busses help with the commute, and the free food helps you focus on doing your job, but don't expect this to become your permanent gig unless you are extremely bent on becoming a Google Employee."
good,This program is an initiative to teach elementary school students with basic robotics and programming tutorials. This includes teaching with toys and basic robots.

good,"My work experience is great, I love working here and the culture is wonderful.  I learned a lot working in this place, unfortunately this is a contract job."
good,"A typical work day is very predictable, the work is mostly the same throughout the day. I have learned how to work with current policy for workflows and also how to make the policy better.  I cannot disclose what I do specifically during the day because of the sensitive material I work with day to day.  The management for the entire office is fantastic, very helpful and always positive.  The pod leads for my specific group are also very helpful, informative, and always willing to answer questions.  Most of my coworkers are rather pleasant, it can be hard for some to stay on task due to the monotony of the job.  The hardest part of the job is to not get bored with workflow during the day since it is extremely repetitive. I enjoy having a job that I am continuously editing and working with maps, I did go to school for mapping and geography."
good,"While I highly recommend taking a job at Google if one is offered to you, I would proceed with caution if you are a contract worker (or ""TVC""). There are certain perks and company functions you're not allowed to enjoy, but the biggest caution is that Google is only allowed to keep a temp on for two years. If your contract is renewed after the first year, great. But if they don't hire you on as permanent by the time the second year comes around, start looking for a new gig. In theory, you can be re-hired as a TVC if you are out of the company for a minimum of three months, but I've never seen that happen. "
good,"Great place where to balance work and personal life. Commute is an issue to deal with if you don't live in Mountain View."
good,"It is an enjoyable work environment, mainly because of the employees. The day can become tedious but the good company makes time go by quickly. The field (main) operators are also attentive and understanding. As long as the workflow is running smoothly, they are open to suggestions and willing to solve any issues. The least favorite thing about the job are the weather conditions. Being that transport is a vital part of the operation, it is a constant battle with the forces of nature depending on the season."
good,"Fun working environment for young people. "
good,"No clear, focused direction from management (on my specific project).  Revolving door of Technical Project Managers...5 TPMs in 12 months.  With such a large and very talented staff on hand, the analogy of the US Marines being lead by the Keystone Cops comes to mind.  In the defense of the TPMs -- there most definitely ARE some great ones -- unfortunately, they're so over-burdened and spread so thin that I can't imagine how they're able to keep much of anything focused and on-track."
good,"The project itself is still fairly new and with anything new there are a few kinks. Such as scheduling problems, issues clocking in and out, and the constant new faces due to a high turn over rate. Those things aside its a great company and a fun project to be apart of."

good,"A typical day at work consist of a staff ranged from 1-20 depending on the site assigned. co workers for the most part are welcoming and the leads are knowledgable.There are some leads who require further examination within their led position but that can also be said about management. Management try to maintain punctuality even though there are many who may not be able to grab the necessary attention needed to completely handle a situation that only management can touch on such as availability, Pay stub's and Sick Hour adjustments."

For some of us, we have a car or a plane to get."
good,"Great place to work, however not garunteed that you will keep your job for long. Sometimes you may see a bunch of people leaving and being fired, and wonder whats going on.

The pay at this job has afforded me many opportunities that where at my previous employment I could not afford. The pay is great for what we are doing but since the position is contracted it is hard to get attached to the project. For myself I have gotten very attached but due to the CA law I must leave soon. "

Co-workers are recent grads, generally. The hardest part of the job was the repetitive nature of the work, but it was easy to find interesting. Most enjoyable part of the job was helping new hires.

good,"A typical day at work started with me cleaning the area, in store where i was situated. Usually the mornings started off slow with only 5 - 15 customers in looking at my products. Then the afternoon got a lot busier which is when my skills of working under pressure came to be very helpful. I learned a lot about computers and tech support. Also I learned how to work with strangers which was my main worry when i took on the job. I formed very good relationships with my co-workers on professional and personal levels. The hardest part of my job was that I started work after only having 2 hours training which meant 95% of the information that i passed onto customers was all learned from self study. I have to say that the part of this job that i  enjoyed the most had to be the customers. I dealt with that many but i can still remember faces and every tutorial, educating session and sales pitch."

good,"Google has been a fantastic place to build my skill and abilities, but often offers more lateral movement than vertical, and pigeonholes people into specific roles. Also, there is a tendency not to pay attention to the workers in the Other Bets. As a Fiber employee, I felt Big Google was pretty distant from me."

good,It was alright. Was not 100% associated with google but more of an internal opportunity. They are very giving and willing to help you reach your goals.

good,"Good to have google on resume. Enjoyed my work at google, however the knowledge gained at google cannot easily be transferred out to other jobs. Google has a lot of proprietary hardware and software which makes it tougher to relate to the industry. However doing some self study and reading through docs/guides one can gain valuable information. Best thing about Google is the people, all of which are genuinely humble and there to help you. Free food and games are a nice bonus for a hard days work. "

good,"Worked as a contract employee. The group that I was in is a sink of swim startup group. I didn't spend a lot of time with my manager. Ramp up was basically a bunch of decks given to me, and had to learn on my own. There wasn't much in set processes, but I helped put many of those in place. Everyone was very friendly and you have a lot of autonomy to do the work how you want to. Make sure you meet your team and you know how it functions before you start."
good,google is a great company to work for in itself but some of the contracted managers on campus in the culinary setting are a bit sexist and racist at times. I have seen during walk through as an intern how the kitchen staff is disrespected

good,"Google originally was managed properly. During my time there you have to know change it always occurring. I made a lot of money in profit for this company but the commission was always changing and monthly commission goals always increased. (Example: $33k - $68k) in my time with the company was expected each month. Our commission pay out was 1% at highest when I left. I loved my job and was good at it. I enjoyed helping customers and the business"

good,"This was a fun place to work and got to travel to CA and PA to see the offices and meet some really smart people. Google is a great place to work.... if you're hired directly, but if you came in by an acquisition, you were doomed from the start! Never got a real shot to shine, just immediately cross trained your replacement and that really brought down the morale of the team."
good,has a good work life balance. the people were good and friendly. the team eas very encouraging. any new updates they would give us training. it was competitive and there is lot of scope for learning.

good,"Overall job was wonderful.  Someday a little crazier than other, but day always brought new challenges.  Wonderful supervision willing to teach me the ins and outs of servicing our clients"
good,"Working at Google is great and there are not a lot of issues working there.  However, the one area at Google that could have been improved upon was the work life balance.  As I grew older, working long hours was not what I wanted to do.  As I progressed through my career at Google, I struggled to maintain a great work/life balance and found it difficult to disconnect from work due to the fact that I was working on many high pressure, high visibility projects.  Other than that, Google is a great place to work and it is what you make out of it."

good,"Great place to work at as a contractor, even better if you're fulltime. There's game room, yoga balls/mats, shower rooms, etc. Meals are provided which is nice. Google takes care of their employees, too bad for contractors, the work is only for a limited duration."

good,"Very hectic and high paced environment. Lots of perks to keep in in the office as long as possible. Work/life balance could use improvement. Corporate culture is great, but office culture is very entitled and fraternity-like. People create a lot of distractions and don't seem very career focused."
good,"Good culture, environment,people, innovation,. And so many things to learn with.."

good,It was a startup and i happened to start my IT career in it. I learnt the very basics of work ethics and grew proficient day by day working at this company.
good,"Good place to work if your looking for a quick job out of college. Good food, good in office rest locations. Management is approachable and friendly if a little unfocused."
good,Typical day of work was repetitive while scanning for errors in book images for Google's online library. This was through Randstad temp agency.
good,"I had fun working with side by side with my Executive Chefs, Chefs, and Sous Chefs learning and growing. My Co-Workers were great and fun to work with. The main move for me is to grow and continue to learn from other Chefs. With also a possibility of moving up."

good,"Google has a great culture and environment."
good,"it was a great place to work for but they dont want to keep people around long term which i think its not fair"

good,My last job was an excellent learning opportunity and I developed my skills and experience in numerous different ways. While I already had strong IT skills. When my employer introduced a new order management system which used Access they gave me the opportunity to undertake additional training so as to be able to work effectively with this. I was then able to put this training into practice on a day-to-day basis and I am now extremely adept at using the package.
good,Great experience as I got the opportunity to work on different technologies on different different projects of Google.
good,I had a great time there working for 4 years. I had the opportunity to work on different Google projects of international significance.
good,"Great place to work."
good,"Google is an amazing place to work with fantastic benefits and smart people. However, the workforce is lacking in social skills and would benefit from an etiquette overhaul. Days are filled with meetings but as long as you meet your goals its up to you what you do the rest of the day. Working from home is a great benefit."
good,"Fun people to work with and free food every day. The hardest part of the job is how repetitive the work is, but the people and the things you can do in your free time help you to get through the day. There isn't really anything that I can say here other then it has a good work friendly feel."
good,"very enjoyable, manager was always around to help and assist when needed."

good,it was so friendly and peaceful work atmosphere.but the only thing was whwn we were mapping urban areas where roads were so condensed it was the toughet part of the job to map there
good,"Good place to work."
good,Yup it's a good company to work at. Here are more things I think about it. It's fast paced and I met interesting people here.
good,"Working in Wds, Technical Support Customer Service Advisor, make you able to understand what the customers need. I work for the Google Wallet area, is the payment platform for Google. "

good,"Google is a great place. Full of smart, motivated people. There isn't very much room for advancement."
good,"Awesome work environment."
good,"Loved the work and the people and management was good, as long as your stayed on the mark and was able to continue the work your job was great but it was only a 3 month assignment"
good,Good Work environment. Fiendly attitude with all employess.
good,Enviornment  at IQOR is very friendly. Teamwork is more important than an individual work though individual work also matter but teamwork is given more preference. Your co-worker supports you a lot. The hardest part of the job is to satisfy our client with the best support we have without any error. The most enjoyable part of the job is the salary plus incentive and also you get Saturday and Sunday fixed off.
good,"During a typical day at work I greet new and interesting interview candidates. I guide them to their interviews on time and make sure they have a positive experience at Google. I also make sure that interviewers show up, and If needed, I trouble shoot video equipment for video conferencing."

good,"It was 2 day event , a life changing experience , we transformed a close to 400 websites to mobile and justified the title of the even ""Mobilizing mobile"" ."
good,"I have been working for Google 4,5 years at this stage and still love working there. What makes Google fantastic are the people, who are some of the smartest and most interesting you will encounter. However, job satisfaction depends largely on the team that you are in and the management that you are under. Some teams, such as Sales or Acquisitions, have a great deal of mindless administrative work which can be very frustrating. Also work-life balance in Sales is poor, and the wages are not high enough to compensate for this. There is a lot of top-down initiative pushing and revenue pressure, and morale can be quite low as a result. Engineering/Product Management on the other hand seems to be the ""sexiest jobs alive"" at Google. These jobs are very hard to get however, and it helps to have a contact within the firm to be referred."
good,An environment that exposes you to the latest trend in technology and offers a healthy balance between your personal life and your career. It was a 2 year contract assignment working in the digital library.
good,"Would it be possible to remove this section when applying for roles? This is not applicable to the job that I just applied for. "
good,"I totally recommend living the experience. You will work with different cultures, with good benefits and with the best resources to improve your career."
good,"Working in a warehouse, each day, you're kept very busy making sure items properly prepared for shipping & receiving. Demand changes  based on projects Google prioritizes."
good,This job is very well due to the fact that management above is rarely seen. This is due to working in multiple retail locations and super independent. Hardest part about the job in staying productive with different stores.
good,"- Everyone is super smart and super helpful"
good,"Dagelijks moesten er +/- 70 winkels/bedrijven door mij gescand worden. Hier mocht je tussen de 4/8 uur over doen."
good,I worked from home for google/youtube and enjoyed it. The way I worked for them I was allowed to do and create what I wanted on my own schedule. The monetization aspect of youtube is tricky and not stable however.
good,"An amazing company to work for, however it is a massive company and making a big difference is getting harder and harder. The company is doing everything they can to make sure you have what you need to succeed. But as with any big company, and a company like Google where they count revenue in Billion and not million its all a bit surrealistic."
good,"Aunque fue una experiencia muy positiva poder trabajar en Google UK, los contratos eran todos temporales"
good,Free food everywhere with flexible work hours. It was great work opportunity to experience a laid back corporate environment. If you're able I'd highly recommend applying here.
good,"As a contractor, I had a more strict schedule. My day was divided into 3 sections with different tasks. I was expected to finish them within the duration. However, if I had to leave early for my personal issues, I only have to notify my supervisors and finish the rest of the task the next day. The flexibility was really helpful and enjoyable. I also learned to manage my time during each section because of different priorities. Overall, I think the hardest part was to learn all the technologies that were used for the tasks. Nevertheless, once I got it down, I was able to finish everything really quickly. Last but not least, free meals and facilities really save me a lot of money. I could work out after work, enjoy different types of cuisine and do laundry when I arrive."
good,"I am a Google Business Verifier, Google Trusted Photographer and Google My Business Specialist. Google simply provide me the platform but do not manage me activities."
good,"Good people, Good atmosphere, positivw vibe. productive enviroment, friendly people to work with. staff is very supportive and teaches everyone a lot of stuff."
good,High expectations but compensation that reflects their demands.  The Team was small so I was able to get a lot of exposure to different projects.  My management was very knowledgable and supportive.
good,"It is great to work if you are full time, but if you are a contractor expect to be inferior and treated like a second class citizen. (even though you have the same job)"
good,"Fantastic perks, talented people, little space for advancement as temporary worker on certain roles. There's also a great turnover of the roles and people."
good,The culture is just amazing and it makes you feel like you want to go at work everyday
good,"Sensible work condition.  But it is crowded in office and in parking lot.  Most of the time, you need to do the work with self motivation, there are rules and procedure to follow, and there is once a day group meeting to report progress and next step.  Sometimes, people lack direct supervision, so for junior people, the work may not be done right or correctly if no one closely supervise and advise you."
good,"keine Angaben "
good,"- Loved the company and the people I met there."
good,"tools infrastructure are unbeatable at google, they are really convenience to use and learn. "
good,"Googlers work hard and play hard.  If you fit in with your team and your work, you'll do fine.  Don't be afraid to ask questions; everyone feels lost at first."
good,I had a great time working for Google.  They provoyou with every tool you need to succeed at your job.  They also provide their employees with food and othe amenities.
good,"Creative environment, people help when you ask questions, flexible working hours, free lunches, easy parking, opportunity to expand the job responsibilities"
good,"A typical day starts off with gym session and breakfast if you choose to indulge. Then meetings and checking various programs and metrics to ensure technical productivity. A typical work day would start at 7am - 4pm. Really checking programs, conducting meetings, and sitting through meetings."
good,A good place to work.  Just be careful if you work in the data centers.  It can be rather difficult trying to find another position in the company if you are working in a data center
good,I learned a lot while I was here. Everyone was very welcoming and helped me get started so I could be productive to the teams efforts.  Interning here was the best decision I ever made.
good,"There's a reason why people say Google is where young people go to retire - great food, benefits, very reasonable hours.  But be prepared to do the same job for 10 years!"
good,"A typical work day is very well balanced with coding in solitude, meetings, meals, gym going and other fun stuff."
good,Working at Google has been a wonderful experience. Almost everyone who works at Waymo is hired through a temp agency. The temp agency I was hired through was Adecco and it seems to do the absolute bare minimum.
good,All of the people I had the pleasure of working with were amazing. We had lots of fun on top of work which made it a great place to be. The perks like free pop/snacks and pool tables doesn’t hurt either.
good,"great place to work, fast paced, had to adjust to a environment with process that can vary, Imaging and IT skills needed. Various IT hardware involved, knowledagble staff, growth and good management. Culture revolves around you and your work ethic. Hardest part of job was various elements with options to change day to day. Enjoyable part of job was benefits of gride and gbike commute, free food and fun exciting campus to enjoy and walk around in."
good,"representing Google when working with clients "
good,Many cool events to know more people. Micro-kitchen is a great place to know people from your floor (or anyone who has meeting in that floor). Amazing work culture. You can bring dog to work (that's not a secret anymore).
good,"I have been working for Google Android Project for more than a year now, receiving inbound calls, doing outbound calls, answering customers by email when following up their potential issues/ questions and also provided help through the online chat service. "
good,Typical day with Google starts at 8:30am and ends around 4-5pm depending on the job. Really great company and really great co-workers. Few things could be done differently but its currently being changed.
good,"Great place to work, amazing co-workers and job atmosphere, easy going people, free breakfast, lunch and dinner, only down fall about the job is that you have to go thru an temp agency, not a temp to perm position."
good,"Good atmosphere where work can be completely balanced."
good,Supportive culture and nice people. Makes it fun to work there. Impactful projects. Good food. Depending on how high up your position is affects your work life balance.
good,"Um dia tipico de trabalho lá é entrar as 8:00 da manhã, chegar ao ""campo"" ou ""polígono"" com antecedência, que no caso é o mapa no qual recebo para ir em cada comercio, atualizar informações, endereço e ajudar á usar o aplicativo que ajuda a gerenciar o estabelecimento no Google, correr parar atingir o numero máximo de atualização dos comércios (meta por dia), se não conseguir atingir ficar ate mais tarde. "
good,A quickly moving machine that uses a tight knit team to accomplish daily goals simple or burdening. The growth and development of the culture offered at Google Express was par none.
good,"Let me start by saying Google has been good to me, even though I am a contractor. I've met many wonderful people and you certainly can't argue with the perks. If I were a fullitme employee I'm almost certain I'd be writing a stellar review, but as a contractor espite all the wonderful benefits and exciting work environment it is simply hard to shake the feeling of being undervalued. It varries from team to team, but unless your team has a high budget and less need (which is never the case) your wage is going to be just enough to live off of. The freedom to stay late and work overtime is sometimes given, and ultimately that is what one must do to even have a shot at a full time role. I have seen several good friends simply leave however once they were able to get the Google name on their resume and it is hard not to notice that one's talents are in demand and more valued elsewhere. I hope that the internal machinery of the company will catch up to the problem of top talen leaving the company, but I recognize there are resource constraints. Overall I have enjoyed working at Google and there is certainly nothing I'd rate as negative in terms of company culture."
good,Google is a great company to work at for contractors. You get to work with some of the most talented people in the industry on some cool projects. Contractors get to enjoy most of the perks as well.
good,Great place to work. Tons of amazing things to do and see. Work can be demanding. In many ways it feels and act like a start up. Great experience working here
good,You know it's a great place to work when people voluntarily return to stay at the office until 9pm every day. People love Google so they put in 100% effort into doing their best.
good,"Management Skills in taking care of the pilot team in bringing up the project to mainstream level, working on multiple task to improvise the quality standard of the Product"
good,"Everything you have seen and read is true! It's an amazing place!"
good,"Confidential and several NDA's signed. It was an excellent opportunity and I learned an incredible amount of information in the mapping and engineering department. I look forward to learning more in my next opportunity,"
good,Compensation is low relative to market value but everything else is beyond comparison.  Love the ability to give back to the community and to make a difference.
good,"Very fulfilling and challenging place to work. Tasks change daily, adaptability is a must. Enjoyable work culture, it's one big family. Work closely with a team and also independently."
good,"As a contractor, you see almost as many benefits as an FTE, as long as your willing to work for them. Your job is not as secure as a contractor, however its because so many people would love to have the position. If you're willing to work hards, correctly and as a team then you will absolutely succeed within this company."
good,"The best part of the company is the teams you'll have the opportunity to work for. My team was among the greatest group of individuals I've ever met and I feel immensely fortunate to have been able to get to know them. "
good,"Super smart people, fast-paced strategic decisions, team-based environment. Would recommend the company to entrepreneurial-minded individuals who are comfortable with frequent change in unchartered territory."

good,"Google business group dhaka has a wonderful office and has a splendid working  environment. "
good,i use to train the qc's in and out and manging the people who are working under me i use to look at north and south india. enjoyed working for this project
good,Its a place to work when you dont have a whole lot going on and you are waiting for your next gig unless you want to be working with visual maps for your career.
good,"Aprendizaje del sector tecnológico, buen ambiente de trabajo tanto con la dirección como con los compañeros. Lo más difícil del trabajo es tratar con todo tipo de clientes, aunque con experiencia resulta más fácil."
good,I actually worked for a contractor of Google called Pro-Park.  We were a marketing experiment that would take online orders from businesses such as Target and Costco and deliver them to the customers doorstep.  It was fun to be part of a start up project...
good,"Es una empresa seria y con varias ofertas de empleo y te especifica"
good,I was working on a lot of data analysis  and creating documentation.
good,"cannot disclose information"
good,"•Research and analyze data via the sources and responsible for the development of content for Google India through online research of information on various issues using multiple search engines. Checking relevancy of data in the specified schema of database and taking a suitable action on data through DELPHI."
good,"The learning curve at Google was so steep, for it blessed me with an immense opportunity to explore the uncharted territories in the deployed domain. I was part of the product management team of YouTube doing analytics and arriving at solutions to improve the user experience and finding ways to increase user engagement effortlessly by seamless integration of YouTube with the Google ecosystem. The challenging part of the job was working on the overhaul of the user interface and the whole user engagement of the product and its phased roll out in December'11 and January'12. The management at Google believes in fostering innovation and creating the industry leading products to make life easier, and this paves a way to a hierarchy that encourages the individual's efforts rather than stifling them. The Google experience enables you to develop an attitude towards learning that goes a long way to enhance your career goals."
good,"Amazing sites and buildings to work in, however, there is a stark difference between being an FTE (Full-Time Employee) and a TVC (Temp, Vendor or Contractor). Make sure you know which one you'll end up applying for, as every team within this techno-giant offers a different management path. Some easier than others."
good,"This is definitely a fishbowl environment where there is a lot of room for growth and things, but it does not provide a realistic expectation of what to expect in corporate america."
good,"Learned how to manage multiple tasks at a time, the workplace is fun and productive at google. I enjoyed my work and completed the given tasks within the required time."
good,"Drove  improvements across the business as a result of IT implementations. Equipped SPM’s across the organization with solutions that accelerated their OKR(action based metric) by 40%, providing additional visibility into partner relationship(improving the workflow), and reducing ticket to support by 60%."
good,Google is a great place to work as a junior software engineer. There are a lot of resources that are accessible to you. There is a lot of potential for growth as full timers are very willing to meet and talk about their work.
good,"Superb work culture and Employee friendly company."
good,"Pros:"
good,Work life balance is the best and the amenities are even better. company makes sure to organize team building and time to enjoy life. Depending on the department i need to say. I love it.
good,It was good as contract worker. The day was busy and fast pasted but fun. It's a social culture. the hardest part is high expectations but thats part of the draw.
good,Amazing learning curve and great challenges and projects to be working. Artificial Intelligence has huge potencial and you feel on the top end of new technologies.
good,very good company. very much co-operatives and employee friendly company. Good training. New challenges. Flexible timing on time salary. very near to home town.
good,"Planning logistical support for Streetview Equipment in EMEA region and globally."
good,"I was an Order Management contractor in Austin, TX. and I LOVED working here. We were provided with free snacks and drinks, but as a contractor had to pay for food and gym membership while Google employees ate for free and got to use the gym for free. It is pretty fast paced and guidance changes frequently. Pay is terrible  compared to what actual Google employees make, and there was not a lot of room for growth in my contract position. We basically got to wear what ever we wanted (within reason) and the atmosphere was super relaxed, not micromanaged. Absolutely no job security, after 1 year everyone on my team/contract had their jobs outsourced to the Philippines, including the contractors based in India."
good,"Working at Google was great. The people are very smart, the job was interesting, and I had a lot of freedom to do the work that I thought was best. "
good,Pick your role carefully so that you don’t get bored. Otherwise the free lunches make you fat and unhappy. Love what you do and you’ll be OK. Most people are overqualified for their position.
good,"-A virtual assistant every day provides administrative, creative (social) assistance to companies sorting out all the resources to solve issues.  "
good,"Good experience, the company looks after you fabulously but the environment is highly competitive especially in the Sales team. Great perks available as well as team management."
good,As an intern at google I always felt like I had the support necessary to finish my projects. I learned a lot over the course of each summer and enjoyed working in a fun and laid back company culture. 8/10 would recommend.
good,il faut qu'un environnement de travail soit sain pour maximiser les chances de réalisations personnelles
good,"This was a fast-paced environment that was constantly changing. This is a good place to be, if you enjoy a competitive atmosphere. You have to be able to work well with others."
good,I would review working with Google a good experience and was worth being there. All my employees were very nice and made me feel at home. I was really sad leaving Google because my contacts ended.
good,There can be hardly any negative feedback of working at Google. But the team and manager at Google does matter a lot. You can end up working on boring stuff if you are not in good team
good,"Professional & friendly environment, free food/gym/perks/snacks etc. "

good,I enjoyed working with SMX and google express was fun. Every day was a different day and I had lot of fun helping training people. I also liked our meeting and working with everyone was cool.
good,"I can say that it was a true blessing to work there for the short time that I did as an intern. Although sometimes it felt like I couldn't keep up (due to change in policy locking me out of essential documentation) I still greatly enjoyed doing my job. The people were friendly, compassionate and very hard workers. Not everything is rainbows however. The job culture is on the cutting edge of the progressive left ideology and the office was cluttered with pride propaganda and other sorts of images, not really caring if it made others uncomfortable or not."
good,"I worked from 8am to 5pm, Hot south/north indian breakfast then work for 3 hours, may have meetings with the client in US before lunch and busy fridays as it was the end of week, good team work, proper management , hardest part was to do the work in time, which took a while to get in to it, most enjoyable part was smiling faces all around, which makes work ease."
good,"In all, i could say in a typical day at work is very normal because you meet new people with new ideas, management are very okay and since the company is inter culture company, you meet people from different countries."
good,"Google is a fun place to work, always challenging and keeps putting you to think big. Plenty of perks in addition to great work life balance. Free lunch as well."
good,Qui ne connait pas Google... C'est presque exactement se qu'en dise les médias.
good,Great if you enjoy complex social systems and processes.  A lot of perks and flexibility.  Many touch points across big teams internationally too.  Suggest for anyone curious about working in a multinational corporation.
good,"Google is as great to work for as everyone thinks. It is a very relaxed and collaborative work culture. Lost of free time to do what you need to in your personal life, able to bring your dog(s) into work and everyone is extremely friendly. This has probably the greatest company I have worked for because of the overall culture of the company. "
good,Overall great place to work. Management listens to your ideas and you're surrounded by creative thinkers. Room for career advancement and they encourage you to develop your skills.
good,Working at Google was an amazing experience. I learned within my role and got to network with many professionals as well as enjoy the festivities the company provided to their employee's. I loved teamwork mentality and transparency within teams.
good,"I have gained experience in teaching methodology, different operating systems, database administration and programming languages like java and VB.Net. I have also gained social interaction with different people having different level of education and experience. Even though the management of the center is not as per expected through time it can be changed. The most enjoyable part of the job in this company is the benefit of the companies resources in improvement of personals , the exchange of experience and the satisfaction of customer needs."
good,"Bonnes opportunités de développement"
good,"Googlers solve complex problems everyday in the name of our core mission to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible to our users. But what makes working at Google truly unique is the workplace culture that encourages innovation and a healthy disregard for the impossible. Watch Alan Eustace, SVP of knowledge, explain the secret ingredient that makes Google a great place to work: our people."
good,"Managed the day-to-day operations of a team of store operators"
good,"very nice place to learn and grow."
good,easy job and pretty much hired anyone. hired too many people then started to cut peoples hours
good,"- challenges"
good,"our management is good, the hardest part of the job is to work alone in night some daysand most enjoyable day is salsry day."
good,"All depends on the role and the team. You can be in an environment where things are always exciting and you are taking on new challenges, but if you're in a support role, things can get tedious and you may not learn as much. Skills can become very specialized and not applicable to other jobs."
good,"muito agradável, pois ouvia os funcionários e li dava as melhores condições de trabalho."
good,"Nice people to work with, many challenges like any job but overall would recommend any work here. You will learn and grow. Also opportunity to network with many people."

I felt like I was treated poorly by management there. As well as my health and safety while working was put at risk"

good,"I indirectly work for Google, my videos on Youtube make enough views that advertisements are able to pop up on my videos. The Advertisements make ""Ad-Revenue"", I don't know much else about it, I just know that Google makes money, and I end up making money. I don't make much because I'm not a HUGE youtuber. But at the end of the day, the money isn't what I care about, it's the fun. I'd say Youtube is more as an internship as I learn more about other people and connect in a way that I never would've thought I could."

good,Fun and enjoyable atmosphere. No complaints at all on my part. I was a contract position so my expectations were not high but I was surprised by the warm welcome.
good,"Being a contractor at Google has it's downside for sure.  Management views you as disposable, you're not afforded the obvious benefits of full time employees and you can't remain at the company for longer than 2 years.

good,"Prior to joining the project, I knew just the basic functions of excel. Now I'm able to pull multiple spreadsheets together and pivot data to display graphs. In the short amount of time on the project, I've become well versed in their purchase order system. I learned to work both autonomously and collaboratively with other functioning teams to launch projects. My peers are always willing to provide assistance. If my peers cannot help, the least they would do is point me in the right direction. The hardest part of the job is the amount of work everyday. Since it is a startup project with an ever-growing demand for its service, it is not an easy task to stay on top of all the projects. The most enjoyable part of the job is collaborating with various teams and see the successful launches of our projects."

The management was great at teaching you how to be great at your job. I learned how to prep and cook a multitude how different dishes, also I learned to manage a account and great customer service skills. All of my co-workers were devoted and great at their jobs. Everyone worked together as a team to complete the mission and not once did we fail.

good,I will not lie if I say that Google has all conditions to work there: starting from good food and going to comfortable and entertainment rooms and sports activities. Everything is available for free. The only thing you need to think on is your work.
good,"Sometimes work will be hard but should be doing as my duty."
good,Working here was fun depending on who I was working with. If given the opportunity I would definitely work here again. Their point system sucks.......
good,"Excellent company, very smart people, many resources to do our jobs. Excellent food, beautiful campus, great environment, everybody is happy and proud working for Google."
good,"Google is a company that trust their employee and they provide extremely kind and convenient environment for their worker. However, this kind of environment sometime does not give their worker enough challenge compared to the startup companies."
good,Come here for the culture. Come here if you want to work with some of the best people. Come here if you don't want to feel restricted by a JD. Come here for the opportunities.
good,Good place to work for freshers. KI worked on Mapping project and is very interesting to work on. One will get good insight to know about Google work culture iff hired for mapping projects. Thank you.

good,Its a great product and service i and enjoying it but its little difficult to selling because there are so many partners in the market so that only.
good,"Geolocalizar todos los negocios de durango asi como los centros turisticos del mismo, conocer diferentes perzonalidades del estado asi como grandes compañeros de trabajo"
good,"Fantastic company to work for. Obviously great salary, perks, benefits, office culture, office environment. Opportunities for hard workers/ self starters, opportunities to move between teams/ job functions. innovative and challenging colleagues."
good,"Analysing the market, creating day plan for self and team. Work assignment and time management along with teamwork is what I got to learn from this company. Colleagues all were helpful and use to work hard along with me. The hardest part of the job was co-ordination with the internal team but was manageable."
good,"lots of creative space for new ideas and contribution. too many team members assigned on one project so contribution is not significant. I worked in India and I felt i was micromanaged. Too many freebies at the company, they load you with food,  tshirts and other goodies."
good,No such thing as typical day of work. Very diversified and plenty of opportunity to learn new technologies. Quarterly outings were always fun until things took a turn. Co-workers remain unmatched by any others. I loved the challenge and the intellect each individual brought to the team.
good,"Google Maps is an excellent place to work. You are working with teams and leaders from every part of the world, constantly being encourage to participate and interact during the cultural events within the work place. "
good,"A typical day at work:"
good,"Working at Google was fun and exciting."
good,"Google is a great place to work. There are many great perks such as the free food, gyms, basketball courts, ping pong tables, pool tables, etc. As a contractor, I feel like there is little opportunity to become a full-time employee. I have really enjoyed my time here however and would love to stay if I had the opportunity."
good,Very rewarding and challenging.Good exposure to inhouse tools and good utilization of resources
good,"Excellent experience in many ways, the culture and way to perform tasks was excellent and very demanding and challenging."
good,"Excellent Organization to work with."
good,"Making awesome food for awesome people!!!  What else can you say, working at Google is everyone's dream job and working in the kitchens is no exception."
good,My time with Google was through a temp agency by the name of Aerotek. I got to learn much about the Visual Data Specialist position and working within a productive team. While it was only a temporary position I would certainly recommend it for anyone wanting to gain some valuable experience with a great company. 
good,i have learned how to mingle with people very easily in a team in this corporate culture. Learnt smart working. Learnt how to manage the things very easily.
good,Google is a sea of information and many amazing people to work with across teams.
good,Ensured that high quality TV spots flowed smoothly and efficiently from advertisers to TV

good,Amazing experience to help Google build out their Local Commerce space to compete against Groupon and other daily deal companies
good,"Google was a great place to work. Employees feel engaged with the company. After a while, the opportunities for advancement get to be a bit harder. The culture is also changing a bit more as it continues to grow."
good,"Great People. Work environment is awesome. If Temp, you are very expendable and they let you know that with the pay amount. Others around the job have the sense of wanting to work and include you. Everyone seems to help everyone, and that is always a great place to work."
good,Even as a contracted employee it is the best place to work. The emphasis on work life balance is important and there are so many resources to help you be your best.
good,"Coordinated the Google Retail Program (GRP), and managed teams of Google Retail Specialists creating awareness, and facilitating sales of all Google Hardware"
good,"It was a good experience to learn about google and its culture, I am glad I've been a part of google team, work environment is good as we all know about Google :)"
good,"I've enjoyed my time at Google from day one. The work is complex, engaging, and each day presents new and interesting business problems to solve. I am free to try new and interesting projects and then demonstrate their value through open communications and manager discussions."
good,"Great people to work alongside. Opportunities to keep you challenged. "
good,I work for Google through YouTube. Not through the regular Google Campus. I am free to make content on my own schedule. I receive a deposit from Google once a month that is based on the ad revenue my videos accumulate.
good,"Great environment to work with fun and amazing people "
good,"They are very serious about hitting the monthly quota, but if you follow the instructions of the managers you will be just fine. everyone is there to help each other and they have a team mentality."
good,"My experience working at Google was good overall. It has a laid back atmosphere, but make sure you make some friends because it can be pretty cut-throat at times."
good,"A Typical day at Work: Its always Exciting learning about new features and Testing the Application,management was very friendly and co-operative,work culture also very friendly."
good,Great place to work.  I wanted to have an opportunity to live in NYC and the only option that was available for me was with UPS.  I would have stayed with the company due to the structure and collaborative work environment.
good,"days at work were long and hard but the pay made it worth it. "
good,"Google is a great place to learn about industry standards and experience some of the most interesting problems in the market. The company perks are fantastic. The downside to this is that you spend more time on campus than you would at a typical job. If you don't have good self-discipline with your work/life balance, it's easy to end up working far more than you probably should. Lastly, it's a great launching point for a career and almost feels like a continuation of college, right down to needing to share housing with 2-3 roommates so that you can afford rent in an area with such a high cost of living."
good,une grande expèrience enrichissante dans le domaine de la technologie
good,"Um dia de trabalho nesta empresa, nunca é igual ao outro. Aprendi a cultura americana em sua essência. A gerência é exigente, o que é bom para o crescimento profissional. A cultura e o ambiente de trabalho são também essencialmente americanos. A parte mais difícil do trabalho é o volume do mesmo, que ás vezes é cansativo. A parte mais agradável era o ambiente de trabalho, academia, sala de jogos, etc."
good,"Pese a que el salario no era muy alto, recompensaba con salario emocional."
good,"It was a great company to work, I been trying to join the Google team again. Very hard to keep up with workflow sometimes there is always help when needed need to know a lot about Linux and Network protocols and be able to think quick on your feet."
good,"I am a contractor for Google, so I work for a company which works for Google. That being said, Google is an amazing company to work for, and the company I work for tries to keep up on the standard which Google wants for the employees, but they are not as driven to perform in the same manner as Google itself does."
good,"A typical day at work will be coming in at 8 in the morning and sitting down and look and review videos that were published on the queue.  The workplace and culture was amazing, all my coworkers were friendly and nice.  The hardest part of the job will probably be when we get meetings at random times and the most enjoyable part of the job is the environment."
good,Involved meeting clients and training retail employees about various Google products that are offered in electronic stores. Met with various types of people and established strong bond
good,"I worked at Google short term as a QA Engineer testing Google Assistant mobile app on Android devices, both phones and tablets.  There weren't enough meetings and discussions about testing strategy, and following the test suite strictly was a requirement.  I think more creativity in terms of testing and more open lines of communication about changes to the product would help uncover more bugs."
good,Every day I find an amazing work environment plus the latest technology to help in my tasks. There's constant team contribution and a very well organized management.
good,"Excellent work environment and a very dynamic work place. Challenging organization that gives an opportunity for self improvement, while contributing to the growth of an individual."
good,"I had been working on FTC for 6 month through recruitment agency."
good,"Far and away the best job I have had to date. Worked on leading edge projects with some seriously talented and fun people. The culture is outstanding, but being a contractor often left me on the outside looking in at all the fun and benefits, despite the team's efforts to include me as much as allowable. I would work here again in a heartbeat, but preferably as a direct hire."
good,"Great company to work for if you're proactive about seeking career development opportunities. Upper management is supportive of letting you take on ""20%"" side projects in different professional areas of interest. Great perks - free meals, gym classes, baristas, laundry, game rooms. Intelligent colleagues."
good,Coleta de imagens para o setor de transportes para o Google Street View
good,Very good benefits. Schedules are really good as well. I liked not working on the weekends too. You learn a lot in this company and also a lot of trainings to be completed.
good,I was a contractor at google so not an official googler and they make sure you remember that all the time. The contract had zero benefits and was honestly pretty terrible. A typical work day began by clocking in on a phone where they tracked your location. Then you would proceed to package boxes basically all day long and then clock out immediately at the prescribed time regardless of task. The pay was uneven and completely unfair. Not nearly enough to live off of.  The culture was corporate and micromanaging in the main office but satellite offices were pretty relaxed and conducive to good work. Most enjoyable part was clocking out each day or getting a schedule that included more that 30 hours. Hours were ridiculously tight.
good,"Every day I had a chance to meet with exceptionally smart and interesting people, who were so inspiring."
good,"It was Google Express and it was a great job to have. It teaches you how to move fast, think quickly and work with a team. It was also great and easy for clients to shop no matter where they was at or what time of day it was."
good,"I learned so many things while working, my collogues are always help us, we enjoy a lot in the office events like( sports day, tours, annual day, monthly festival celebrations, etc.)"
good,"As a contractor and not an employee, it was clear that becoming an employee depended in being able to fit with the clique - meaning having the right combination of education and alumni connections. Team members that were employees were sometimes snobbish, but there are jerks in all companies. Managers were generally helpful and clear with what they expected as work output. Only disappointment is feeling like a part of the team, but not really, because a handful of employees are immature."
good,Great place to work lovely people and great pay. Gave me the opportunity to travel and see new places and meet new people. Management were amazing and really helpful
good,"My job consisted of showing up on time, sorting, marking and packaging hard drives scheduled for decommission for about eight hours a day. There was free food and what was probably the most friendly working environment that I’ve ever had the pleasure of being a part of. While the work itself was a bit monotonous, the monotony, helped me find ways to pass the time and get through the day and still do the job as well as I could."
good,"Me permitió conocer nuevas habilidades y descubrir la plataforma, en todo momento hubo alguien que disipara nuestras dudas."
good,"Nice environment, extended knowledge to be gained. Helpful colleagues many potentials, respectful seniors .I'm still new can't comment more at the moment"
good,I had a great time working there great people great atmosphere just wish I had more time bosses where awesome money incredible just the job it self wasn’t long term wish I could go back
good,A good place to work. Get used to never getting tired or in other words never being lazy. That way you get the most out of it. Keep engaged. Solve problems efficiently.
good,Great place in general to spend 40 hours a week.   Free Gym and food.  The layout is beautiful and the people are friendly.  I learned a lot and enjoyed building lasting relationships with the people I worked closely with.  The workplace culture is one of positivity.  Its going to be hard leaving this contracted position because I do enjoy working here but the current wages aren't competitive enough.  The best part of the job was management and the coworkers.
good,"Best balance between work/life balance, compensation/perks and quality of colleagues.  As we are growing bigger, the typical pains of bureaucracy are cropping up."
good,Google Creative Lab was such a breath of fresh air. Really team-oriented and smart management made for a great experience. I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to go to grow and learn about tech problem-solving through advertising.
good,"Learned a great deal about change management, people management , project management, leadership, diplomacy, tact and professionalism and the type of leader I want to be"
good,"Ambiente de primeiro mundo com cozinha, lanches, petiscos, tecnologia e muitos desafios."
good,"Google don't need any introduction. And the atmosphere where I work was awesome. No other company till date I like much I like Google. I was working for Google products like Google Pixel phones, Chromebook, play cards, Chromecast"
good,"Fun place to work. Lots of perks. Smart people."
good,Good to work with such a big company. Good support from the leads to complete the given task. Friendly Environment. Reaching the targets. Overall it is a good experience.
good,Working at Google Express has been challenging and allowed me the opportunity to grow as a person and as a worker. I was privileged to work with an array of talented and driven individuals while providing an excellent service. Communications among the teams and levels of management was excellent and ongoing. The only unpleasant aspect of the job was that the volume was work could be inconsistent.
good,enjoyed each and every day while working. Learned a lot about digital advertising and tools. Working in night shifts is the most difficult part of job.
good,Hired on contract based. Great experience and good for the CV experience. The location was good and centered. The management where friendly and approchable. Wish there was an opportunity to stay after contract end.
good,The management was nice and the atmosphere was awesome
good,"Working in the warehouse was fast paced because your trying to fill customers orders by locating each item in the warehouse. It demand that you come to work ready to move around looking for items, and with another associate working together to take care of the customer. Most money I ever made through a job, weekly."
good,"I found working at Google to be very challenging and rewarding. It wasn't perfect, but the pros outweighed the cons. I appreciated working with a stellar group of people from wide-ranging backgrounds. Google's dedication to users and scientific principles helped changed the way I do my job significantly. If you are ambitious I highly recommend it. I found it both hard and fun."
good,"Working with Google on site is a great experience, usually the day is packed with work still we find sometime to give hearty laugh and fun."
good,"I worked on the Google Express project during its initial inception in the East Coast cities such as DC, Boston, NY and Chicago. While on the project I was stationed in the brand new Google office in Pittsburgh. I loved it. The culture is fun, the company is flexible and cool. Most importantly the people are smart and a joy to work with."
good,We as a team get to work in different stores and are able to provide different customer service to different kinds of customers. Since we get to work in different store they job is always exciting and everyday there is a new experience. Since I am a rover i move from store to store more often then most but its always nice to meet new people.
good,"Smart, Energized Workforce; Lots going on. Agile environment...not much, if any analysis...just jump in the deep end and see if you live."
good,"-Мало свободного времени, чувствуешь себя в вечном рабстве"
good,"Responded to inquires for clients in travel and post travel.  This job allowed me to travel to great destinations."
good,"We worked hard, but the culture created by Google owners and management is one that should be replicated everywhere. It's amazingly relaxed and open to creativity"
good,work life was amazing! the environment was prime. there was always a buzz of excitement and a go get it attitude. co workers are very fun and nice. and overall an extreamely productive workplace.
good,"Worked at the company for several years on a team with a high turnover rate. There's always work coming in, and management was often in flux. There was a lot of emphasis on team bonding and power hours. Fun coworkers and interesting work. Overall had a great experience."
good,"Google is great, but they need to hire a better staffing agency who respects their employees! You learn to work with good quality to make a deadline to get all packages out to the customers on time. My co-workers and the employees from the different stores we went to were great and friendly."
good,"Google Express was my first introduction into the tech world and I wouldn't have wanted to start any other place. A typical day at work is you get into the office, get a free breakfast, and then get to work. We are usually working on multiple side projects at one time while scheduling upcoming trainings or new stores to onboard. I am usually in and out of meetings throughout the day depending on the day and how busy we are at the time. My co-workers are all awesome and we do a lot of collaborative work together. Our team started out small when I first joined and we have now grown to a 18 man team and taken over the Google Express Merchant Owned and Operated world. It's been a great ride."
good,"Dynamic work environment with great coworkers, and excellent at providing help and hands-on experience. I actively seek working there again."
good,"Google can still be the best place to work.  Some departments are heavy in ex-consulting backgrounds which can be challenging for those that are looking for the ""open innovation"" feel of yestergoogle."
good,"Learned a lot during this internship, was a fun place to work at with good work life balance."
good,A typical day at Google Express consisted of going to the pick up location at the beginning of my shift to meet my driver for the shift. I learned how to use my phone to scan parcels and confirm deliveries via the GSX app. Management was reasonable and considerate and very willing to help me and my co workers in anyway they could. The most enjoyable part of the was being outside and interacting with different people everyday.
good,"Co workers are great,everyone is friendly, welcoming. If you ever have a question you don't have to hesitate about asking for help."
good,A typical day at work involved working with existing clientele as well as designing advertisements to attract new clientele. I learned new techniques and skills to make the job easier every day. I am a quick learner so once I was taught a skill I could put it into practical use right away.
good,"Good Management, Open culture , great workforce with projects and work that provides challenges to ensure you rarely get bored or have the same day."
good,"To be honest, I can only divulge minimal information due to my confidentiality agreement which is still in effect."
good,"First of all it’s an amazing experience of being able to be part of a qualitative project which certainly has a big impact not only on the research community but also on the society. Also in my case being in a Graduate Program there are lots of barrier to participate in an internship as physically relocation not possible leaving the research lab, but Google Summer of Code gave me the opportunity to experience and accomplish something more parallel with my Gradate school life."
good,"My experience at Google summed up in one word would be ""unforgettable"". The opportunity of working in such a successful, prestigious company was a real privilege. A typical work day involved waking up early, catching the morning shuttle, enjoying a nice ride to work with comfortable seats and wifi, after arriving at my destination I would quickly go to the cafe nearest to me and grab some breakfast and coffee, then head over to my desk to check emails, and start working on my production. My co-workers were always very friendly and outgoing. We would all interact about our job and share insight or give advice to one another on how to improve. I've learned how important it is to ask for feedback on work in order to improve as well as give something back to the team. The hardest part of my job was completing the production in a timely manner but my favorite part was when it was finally accomplished at the end of the week. Overall great place to work!"
good,"Enjoyed every minute of it! "
good,"Great place for self-learners in marketing domain. great co-workers always striving for learning. "

good,"I had a great experience at Google. Very smart people work there. They are doing really interesting things. You will work hard and everything moves very quickly, but the fast-paced nature is exhilarating!"
good,"Google offers great work/life balance but when it comes to compensation and benefits, it depends which contracting company you actually work for."
good,"Great colleagues, Interesting work, fantastic place to work.  Innovative department within the legal field in general and the ediscovery field in particular."
good,"Great team, good managers, interesting day to day."
good,"good culture"
good,"Very interesting and creative work environment"
good,"Google was an amazing workplace. I enjoyed worked with Google. The infrastructure, the food, colleagues are just amazing. It's a nice place and also the work was also good and I learnt a lot of new things working in Google like Mapmaking and doing research on multiple features and tools implemented to make researches on the features."
good,"Google is a great company in many aspects but as far as career growth it's not very good because of the hundreds of thousands of people that work there.  "
good,"Responsible for the overall safety, quality, performance and customer experience of the shift. Lead the execution of customer orders. Ensure processes are maintained to monitor and manage inventory on a daily basis. Work closely with the marketing team in evaluating demand forecasts and manage master distribution plans to ensure that efficient stock ordering and planning.

good,An amazing place to work! you have to be on the ball at all times as it is a face paced and challenging work place but the benefits are superior to anywhere else I've worked before
good,"This driving job is definitely easy for the skilled delivery driver.  Most of the stores are close by, but  pull times can be frustrating.  Especially when scanners or Google phones are not working properly.  There is some maintenance to the box-trucks & vans but only hand brush can do."
good,"Very easy to help customers and the manager was very nice "
good,"Reporting directly to the Managing Director, diverse roll requiring expansive and adaptable skill set."
good,"-Maitrise d'outils Google (Analytics, Adwords, Google Docs, Webmaster Tools...)"
good,"Google has been the best working experience I've had by far. Every day I'm surrounded by motivated, intelligent and fun-loving people who together create a momentous atmosphere of goal-driven innovation, and creativity. During my time here, I've learned many new skills which helped drive our business in a variety of ways. It's definitely not a 9-5 job, and there are quarterly crunches to tackle in an ever-changing industry which are some of the hardest parts of the job. However what I've enjoyed most is the opportunity to work with such incredibly smart, hard working and collaborative people, as well as the ability to  gain skill sets in areas both relevant to my job, and beyond."
good,"Working at Google's Data center was a crazy rush to keep numbers high and downtime low. Working at Google HQ is a different beast. YOU have more time and control of your day and how you spend your time, but the pressure to get projects completed is higher. THe hardest part of this company is the promoting process. It seems very clique-ish."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was to being yourself and interacting with customer challenges daily.
good,Great experience at Google. Lots of exposure to all functions of the business which provided many unique learning opportunities.
good,It gives me the opportunities to maximize the performance and value of the career. The day to day work is busy but happy. Everyone here is open-mind and innovative. It has a great atmosphere to create the products that change human life.

Everything you could possibly need to right there, restaurants, gyms, laundry, basketball courts, volleyball pit, parks, you able to bring your dog. It makes your work day so much more relaxed and easy to deal with. Working there was an amazing experience."
good,Great company to work for with like minded people. Great benefits
good,"The people are all so brilliant - it is like going from being a big fish in a small pond to a guppy in an ocean of talent. Culture has changed over the past two years, true, but I still recommend it. It is hard, you have to be very proactive to succeed."
good,Good Company to work for . I help identify relevant opportunities and content for workers connections. I work one on one with the management for the field workers . Management brings me field reports every morning and I put into system and sent them where they belong . I work on payroll Tuesday's and Wednesday.
good,"Good overall culture, semi-flexible work, mostly smart people, a few opportunities to work on side-projects."
good,I traveled throughout the Midwest on a special project for google collecting data. I was solo work and a lot of windshield time but good hours and nice benefits.

good,One of the best contracts I've ever had. By far one of the most fun years of my life working for Google. I would definitely recommend working there if possible and finishing your career there.
good,"My experience in google was excellent, got a lot of things to express and learn from managers and got to know the better culture of corporate industry."
good,"I thought the management was great.  Very helpful and kind.  I was not happy with giving sick days you could never use.  That was dumb.  Why even offer sick days?  If you use one you get a bad mark and after 3 your out.  Just doesnt sound right."
good,"Google is a great example of a business that provides excellent corporate culture. The staff and management are relatable, proficient, and easy to work with. "
good,Loved working for the Google Express Team. Was not happy with the 3 weeks notice of companies budget cut that left me and 40 other employees without a job.
good,"I was only there a short time, but enjoyed the culture, autonomy and work environment. Google also clearly seeks to be a good neighbor to its surroundings."
good,"Despite the long commute from SF, the facilities and workplace culture are worth the travel time."
good,"I like the culture of the company, lots of new ideas and support floating around. "
good,"flexible schedule."

good,"Muito boa a empresa. Otimos funcionarios,gerentes,recepcao agradavel e confortavel,comida na hora que quiser."
good,Great management that created a fun work environment. Well treatment of the employees. Hardest part of the job was working long hours. The most enjoyable part of the job was having the freedom to create my own menu.

good,"great working enviroment and work stability, great managment , over all job title is great, great company to work for, makes you feel valuable and they treat you good"
good,Çalışma vaktinin olmaması büyük bir rahatlık fakat bu pozisyona göre de değişiklik gösterebilir.
good,"When I worked for Google under their contractor it was under  very intimidating  conditions. The pay was great but the local management was very selective to whom they shared information with."
good,I really like working for Google.  Great company.  People are great.  Free food and bus from Santa Cruz leads to a more productive day.  The level of engineering expertise is awesome.  You can always learn from other engineers
good,Great experience. I enjoyed working in Google. It offers jobs through contractors. Contractors compete in offering their benefits. I think it offers good opportunity to get hired directly with google.
good,Great job for someone who likes photography and working outdoors. Photo assignments are pre-scheduled at local businesses in numerous neighborhoods in the Bay Area everyday. Excellent way to gain experience as a photographer.
good,"Would love to work for Google again, the environment was great in terms of people, facilities (gym, restaurants, parks), letting you bring your dog, and having all the equipment to be productive and efficient."
good,"Supervisores responsaveis, pagam direitinho, porém comissão é muito baixa e metas são altas, precisa também ter ajuda de custo pois gasta -se muita gasolina em várias viagens."
good,"i am honored to work for google , every day i learn new things , management they are like a family members , i enjoy every moment i am at work , i love the ping pong table i wish there was more tables and Foosball table"
good,"Google is just about exactly what the oustide reputation is. An immensely successful company that has an outstanding culture. Great people working there, and you will not be thin on resources and educational opportunities. Awesome place to work."
good,Always have work without pressure. nothing to learn more about my profile. It's more like monotonous work. Learnt triaging and used to raise bugs which is new for me. Overall its a great experience.
good,"Working for Google is an extremely rewarding experience, however, Google as a company does not accept anything less than full output. Your are rewarded wondrously for your hard-work, but you do work very hard and long."
good,"As someone who was a contractor, and previously was a contractor at other tech enterprise companies, I felt that Google offered much more inclusiveness. I took a role in research infrastructure that was incredibly empowering, although management was extremely hands off. Overall, I had a blast working with my old team and would have stayed if I had an opportunity to convert."
good,I learned so much from working here.  You can go beyond your job role if you are interested in new things and are producing great results.  There are so many opportunities to learn.
good,Everyday I mapped a new area of either my city or the surrounding counties. I learned the city like the back of my hand this way and with the guidance of management(who were awesome) I efficiently got my job done. The hardest part was simply getting used to working a job that didn't require me to do back breaking work. It was very odd just driving all day and getting paid for it but very enjoyable.
good,"Google was a wonderful place to work at.  A typical day consisted of reviewing on going bugs and delivering ways to fix them, as well as committing change lists to improve any systems/applications that were launched in Borg.  I learned a lot on how Google executes business practices in fluid and collaborative ways without getting bogged down in paperwork.  The Management Team is highly technical, they could provide feedback for challenging solutions and guidance on how to wrangle them.  Google's workplace culture is collaborative but highly competitive, you always need to bring you ""A"" game on a daily basis.  The hardest part of the job was trying to manage work life, as the demands for getting projects completed on time were paramount.  My fondest memories for working at Google were the SRE members in the flights team.  These members were a great bunch to work with."
good,"Contractors are definitely treated as second class citizens at Google, but that does not make it a poor place to work. I love the company culture and the way it values its employees as human beings. Management on my team was terrible, but everything else was great."
good,"Working at Google was a dream. Everyone there is motivated to move forward with their career and there is a lot of opportunity to do that. I accepted the offer to Google through the Adometry acquisition and have no regrets. "
good,It's a great place to work at and learn in a Tech Corp but comes with the hassles of working for a corporation where everything is too outlined and your work may not be noticed or be tangible unless following a formula.
good,I enjoyed the people I worked with. It was a friendly and fun atmosphere and I actually enjoyed going into work each morning. I felt the leadership team was great as well. They knew all of their employees on a first name basis and tried to make those personal connections.
good,"It was amazing working for Google. Looks great on your resume. Got easily hired somewhere else when they know I came from Google. Also, it’s very challenging so be prepared to prove yourself."
good,Great Company! Great People! Great environment! The people are a breathe of fresh air.  Great environment for learning!  Great leadership and it's never a full moment!
good,"A day at google starts of with entire team meeting setting up goal for the day kind a encouragement the program manager give to the entire team, networking with different team and work collaboration with the different branches of the google networking with the other team around the world is the best experience a engineer could get, enjoying part of the job is updating the live feed of the atlas into the google maps that the most enjoyable part of this job."
good,"Google is a wonderful place to work, I wish I never left! As a TVC though, your experience is greatly dependent on what agency you are with. If your agency is timid about asking for more money so that in turn, YOU can continue to climb then you're out of luck. Everyone is pretty collaborative, easy going but hard working. My experience as a TVC was that they didn't care how or when you did something, as long as it was done and on time. You do have to get used to requests from FTE's that can seem frantic, I.E. ""I need this YESTERDAY HELP ME PLEASE!"" but if you can communicate and ease fears of trusting a TVC to complete a task, then you'll do well. Engineers there, both software and hardware, tend to lack communication skills or emotional intelligence so if you can bring that to the role then you'll be greatly appreciated. You get almost all of the same perks like free gym access and food however you do have to pay $1.50 each way on the G Bus shuttles whereas this is free to FTEs. All FTE shopping perks, concerts and happy hours are not extended to TVCs but its not that big of a deal. Overall, great place to be with the RIGHT agency."
good,"Google is not a bad place to work if you get in; however, google has the worst hiring process of any company I have ever seen.  The absolute debilitating fear of accidentally hiring the wrong person creates an environment where there is a long winded hiring black box, with almost no feedback what so ever.  You might be in communication with a hiring manager one week getting ready for interviews, and the next week, you are no longer being considered, with no explanation, and having not even interviewed.  Once you have made it through the notoriously difficult 4 hour back to back interviews, there begins a long mysterious process of going through hiring committees and executive reviews, where there is no feedback.  This process took at least a month or more for me, with a solid month between phone and in person interviews,  There was also a delay of a couple months between resume submission and any contact from Google."

good,"I had a short but eventful work experience at Google. It was the best break I could have ever asked for my first job in the United States. There are undoubtedly very talented, hardworking and bright people at Google, but I have also seen people have an attitude to be open to learning. An average Googler is very modest and approachable, and that's what I love about the culture there. A contract opportunity can be stressful work wise but there is a lot to learn about managing time and getting your best foot forward. Although I didn't land a full time role at the end of my contract, it helped me gain momentum and visibility professionally and landed me many full-time job offers at reputed organizations."

good,Google is a great company. Their products work very welll and they train you to them. Customer interactions are always pleasant and you get to work with new tech.  I loved this job while I had it and I loved it the second year when they invited me back.  I would have gone for a 3rd year but I had just started my new engineering job when the call came in.

good,Team work with productivity with amazing work culture combined with excellent employees from various backgrounds. Quality given the most importance.
good,"Great place to work, unbelievable amenities, great salary and benefits better than ever expected.  Co-workers were for the most part a lot of fun and very bright.

good,"Equipe dinâmica, supervisores excelentes."
good,"Because they work at a consistently fast pace, individuals with a good work ethic are often highly productive. They commonly get large amounts of work done more quickly than others who lack their work ethic, as they don't quit until they've completed the tasks with which they were presented. This high level of productivity is also due, at least in part, to the fact that these individuals want to appear to be strong workers.

Many hotels struggle with low occupancy, underutilizing their investment. I consistently drive higher occupancy into our hotel. I don’t just manage a couple of rooms, I help them fill a whole hotel. Most hotels don’t have effective rate plan, promotional and pricing strategies. To maximize overall revenue per room, i fix that. Prices should change based on key seasonal events; historical occupancy levels; current occupancy levels; competitor actions; and marketplace dynamics"

Workplace culture was diverse and friendly with the exception of the leaders.  Typical day consisted of providing email support to customers.  Meetings to create workflow standards.   The most enjoyable part was being part of team that would create a standard flow to be used for future teams. Also enjoying all the wonderful perks at the google campus until one day we all got demoted to yellow badges by management.  When asked Management informed us that it  was brought to their attention that some of the employees were being greedy and taking advantage of the food.  Meanwhile management kept their perks.

good,I enjoyed each and every day in my job with google maps.It was an great memorable experience with my co-workers.
good,"I loved this job and too bad it was only a one year contract. Typically a daily routine would be testing memory from the servers that google utilizes from all it's data centers globally. A few times a week we would brain storm over other IT related subjects and on Fridays we would go to lunch together and it felt more like a family atmosphere. I can honestly say I learned more about IT than in my 10 years working/school combined. Management was fair and respectable. Any time you needed personal time or was sick they would not hesitate to help out. Co workers were fun to work with and always there to assist in any issues I had or questions. The hardest part of the job was the fast paced environment. We would continually receive shipments daily and had to inventory, scan and shelve the memory so if you ran a little behind it would be a challenge to catch up. But the overall job experience was great. It had all the perks that I heard about on the news, web, etc."

Yes, as the company got bigger there were more politics to deal with, but as of 2008, I still really loved the company and was sad to go."
