bad,"The working environment was toxic. Peers competed in negative ways. In one instance a peer simply overrode tasks assigned by manager, leaving the original owner without work. Another instance a peer restructured requirements only to revert it later and say they created it."
bad,"Like crabs in a bucket. Pay is low, for a lot of expectations that are under-appreciated. No overtime or paid holidays. 40 hour forced furlough with no pay. Hours are graveyard shift"
bad,Worst recruitment team. Managers doesn't have any decision making skills. Pls. Consider other company if you're seriously looking for career. Unprofessional behaviour from manager & hr.
bad,"People dont leave companies , they leave managers ! So true in case of so many managers I know in cisco . Within the last 2 years , I saw 5 people (including 2 ladies)  either moving out or refusing to move in under my particular manager . I was probably more thick skinned so I overstayed by 1 year . So much of micromanagement , lack of direction and grit and petty politics that it became suffocating . This guy was so self non-confident and poor communicator that it was very hard to discuss or resolve issues with him . Probably that explained his insecurity also since he never liked people even casually talking to his manager or other superiors ."
bad,"- Hired instructor outside to teach on QNX Neutrino Embedded System"
bad,It was an stressful nightmare that I though would kill me from a heartache or stroke.  I only stayed because of the high salary and great benefits (I am the sole provider for my family).
bad,"Worked on a contract only to be laid off 5 months later."
bad,"Clueless management, no career advancement opportunities, lack of vision and most importantly no opportunity to make a difference. This is a team of paper pushers ! If you want to retire in peace, this is your place ! If you want to feel no sense of empowerment, this is your place !"
bad,"was fun to try it, hope they will say same about me"
bad,Organization was not a cohesive one. Those that had been didn’t want to share information for cross training especially for contractors. They would hold onto everything they knew as if they were scared you were going to take their jobs.
bad,"awful culture, awful people, high stress environment, they refuse to pay you overtime for hours worked and you're expected to be perfect with little/no training. NO learning curve whatsoever."
bad,My experience with Cisco was my first as a contractor and my manager was abusive at first. My first day was cleaning out the cubicle I was assigned from the person that they just laid off. The manager pitted workers against each other and there was no opportunity to become permanent.
bad,"Too many hours not enough pay, The supervisors there are only looking out for their own best interest and are willing to fire any employee just to make an example to the rest of the staff."
bad,Its very apparent that the left hand has no idea what the left hand is doing... WAY to top heavy!!! Mgnt located outside of SJ and typically out of state....
bad,"Cisco was full of political corporate climbers and backstabbers.  Couldn't hack the soul-less culture, so I left after 4 months.  "
bad,"Not much to add as this was a position working for Federated Systems group (which is no longer around) due to being incorporated into Macy's Technology,"
bad,"They don't convert to full time even after working super hard and then they just replace you!"
bad,low attitude management. No cultural diversity when your manager is from certain  countries .The most enjoyable part of the job is  when you are ready to go home and the hardest part of the job is when you going back to work.
bad,"I will not say how I really feel for fear of retribution. I can only tell you, that like most places, you must be aware of things around you. You must just go along with what is happening in the culture."
bad,"Excellent people to work with at Cisco."
bad,It is a very unprofessional company. Their management is bad which creates a bad work atmosphere. They are not successful to define their expectations.
bad,"During the time of working,i realised that how are people communicating to each"
bad,"Pitney Bowes was bad, but Novitex is worst, the phrase out of the frying pan into the fire comes to mind. Nothing about this company is what it seems, do not trust anyone or anything management tells you, and forget about advancement."
bad,"Great company meet and worked for/with very talented people would would work there again in the future."
bad,"Low salary, getting a simple raise takes an act of God. Director level and above get all the perks and bonuses while the rank and file get scraps (if they're lucky). I was replaced with 3 PMs when I left. They just kept loading me up with work until I couldn't take it any more."
bad,no assistance with regards to help with family life when needed i found that when my child was sick i was put in a place where i was told so what someone else could habe minded her
bad,Good work environment with talented people. New challenges every day. Many opportunities depending on experience and  skill level.
bad,Great company to work for with growth within the company. Schedule was perfect.
bad,Periodically layoff affect the productivity of the employees.   Managing style could be improved.
bad,"Was a great company to be an employee at until about 2005, then things went bad."
bad,Currently working in Cisco Systems as QA engineer validating BMC firmware (Baseboard Management Controller) for all kinds of cisco rack servers and storages.
bad,"I made it through 5+ years of  yearly layoffs. Always a stressful time of year, and sad to see people let go that you've worked with for a long time. They finally let me go too. I was doing critical jobs and had rave reviews, but they blindly say this department must be cut X% and let people go. I'm actually glad it was me this time because I've talked to co-workers who remained and said it was miserable."
bad,"Makes you work like a donkey without regard for recognition/reward/responsibility. Very political place, racist, had colleagues trying to convert me to Christianity. Management is only interested in cya."
bad,I worked as contractor for 3 months as business analyst.  There is no management support.  Lots of restriction to get access to information to do the job.
bad,"Very demanding work schedule, poor opportunity for advancement, very much in flux - I would definitely not recommend unless you located in either San Jose or Texas, which I was not"
bad,"Very powerful execs who aren't doing the right thing for the business. Some very passive aggressive people which creates a very political culture. Most Managers lack integrity and this leads to a lack of trust - probably learnt from senior leaders, lack of vision or direction. "
bad,"I contracted at Cisco Systems in 2014. To get a laptop and be on-boarded I went to a sparsely-populated Cisco suite near my home office. On-boarding support was non-existent. The few guys in the office all seemed to be Sales staff who paced the office talking VERY loudly on their cell phones and randomly shouted things like ""Suck it"" and ""well F@!k that!"" (literally); very unprofessional environment that made me feel uncomfortable. Work pace at Cisco was brutal; weekends AND evenings were expected, for weeks.  Granted this was a services transition, but it seemed Cisco over-promised, then had to torque team of employees and contractors to meet the crazy dates. Not my first time working sick hours, but was first time my hours weren't approved by the gent who had to, resulting in my not being paid for several weeks in a row. This while I had worked 90+ hours at Cisco's request - and I had to chase the Gent down to see why I wasn't getting paid. Between the unprofessional office environment and the lack of payment for my efforts to help them meet their contractual obligations, I would never work for Cisco again."
bad,"Production support is not a good experience in Cisco. Process is well defined and followed . Typical work day is too busy (depending on the project)"
bad,Male dominated company and they treat woman horribly. Manager was rude and  consistently lied.  He did not provide training on any of the tools that were utilized as well. Good ole boy klan.
bad,"Poor management, who bullied, humiliated and lied to their staff.  Long hours, no home/work balance, and although the salary was good, employees paid for it in hours worked"
bad,My Manager treated me different based on my political views after she was the one questioning me harshly on who I voted for. 1 week later I was told my job was moving to India!
bad,"Management is very good at blaming employees to cover themselves.  Manage up and flow down with criticism.  Cut throat environment, no live work balance."
bad,"In 7 years I had worked for Cisco, I never felt relaxed and safe. You need to constantly guard yourself because the management encouraged employees to compete with another. It's like dog eats dog. It's a hostile environment. Also, they favored contractors and kept reducing regular employees.  Cisco has huge man power in Asia where they can pay 5 people easily vs 1 American worker. It's no brainer.  Layoff is a norm."
bad,"Having always been a huge Cisco supporter, my excitement was immediately diminished by the leadership team I reported to and up through.  It was the most disheartening contract experience in my 18 years as a professional contractor"
bad,"Apart from Flexible working schedules, there is no room for career advancement, redundant hierarchies, multiple managers everyone competing for a promotion or raise - causes ppl to kick their subordinates and peers and kiss their bosses."
bad,Lots of politics.  Not recommended. The people at Cisco were very confused.  They pulled quotas out of the air. Very unprofessional. Hard to believe they were still in Business.
bad,Cisco has a reputation and a culture of hiring a lot of temps; there is no career advancement opportunity for them no matter how hard you work. I'm pretty bitter about my experience at Cisco.
bad,"Management is arrogant, incompetent and abusive.  Overloaded with work,and yet efforts go unnoticed unless you are ""part of the gang""  Treat Red Badge (contractors) extremely bad."
bad,"Cisco overworks, mismanages and undervalues it's Employees even in Areas it deems important like security. Don't work here if you want to advance your career, be paid what you are worth or be treated with respect."
bad,"I recently worked there for a few months and was hopeful it would be a great company.  I was deeply disappointed with the politics.  There's just not enough time for me to describe the 1950's management style and culture of fear that exists at this company.  I honestly don't know how they get anything done.  Heads roll (or bonuses are not paid to management) for missing unrealistic deadlines so that creates death marches galore."
bad,"Hired as the result of a limited restructure in Dec 2013.  Never met my manager.  Extremely poor assimilation process.  Complete disregard for my career expectations.  Procurement function is entirely reactive vs. strategic. Very poor procurement data analytics.  Culture is very poor.  One Director described Cisco as being like a fraternity ""Sure you get hazed when  you join, but you get to turn around and haze the next guy""."
bad,"Cisco touts itself as putting employees first, yad, yada, yada, but that's a bunch of bull. I've been here a year and I've seen enough. Typical big company with massive process overhead that makes it extremely difficult to get actual work done. Poor management, and quarterly layoff cycles. Reminds me of IBM, which is why I left there too. Anyway, this is my last stop at a large company; I'll never work for another again."
bad,"Like any tech company over the last 10-15+ years, the expectation is to pour everything out to them for fair to middling compensation (at best) and empty platitudes from middle & upper management who are generally out of touch with how to streamline efficient work processes for employees or how to keep their more talented/senior staff on board. They force a 17-step system of tools on their employees that other companies of their stature accomplish in 5, and their results suffer from it. Cater more to shareholders than customers or employees. If you're planning on building a career with a company and prefer a sensible work-life balance, apply elsewhere, because Cisco is the textbook glass-ceiling-corporate-treadmill with no chance for upward mobility - in fact, you're much more likely to be laid off in one of the multiple rounds of budget cutbacks they perform each year."
bad,"This review is specifically for Supply Chain but generally applies to other functions."
bad,Cisco is laying off people continuously based on business decisions rather than individual performance.    This has destroyed the culture and teamwork as everyone is looking to protect themselves and protect their jobs.    Everyone has become a short timer as they don't know when they will be laid off
bad,Worst workplace to work at with most of the managers and directors do not have a strategy to proceed with projects and try to hire as many consultants from their preferred vendors so that they get some cut from the vendors
bad,No clear people strategy. Lack of development and promotional opportunities. Poor Communication from all levels of management. Lack of a open door policy. Leadership is not approachable.
bad,"I watched Cisco go from a technology leader, engineering driven company to a place where management makes their gold grabs on the backs of a workforce they micromanage, berate and disregard. Rampant ageism, sycophantism and buddy clubs where the only safe jobs are superflous management jobs.  "
bad,He sufrido discriminación por parte de mi lider de equipo debido a mi discapacidad fisica.
bad,"Great company if you don't mind the threat of 5,000 to 6,000 employees being terminated every August for no reason expect for the company greed and missing of another market transition."
bad,"Cisco is currently experiencing a mass exodus of top talent, resulting in low skill level managers filling internal power positions without the ability to manage the company effectively. Poor decision making, stressed out workers, and negativity are the common theme today."
bad,"Busy workplace..with calls coming in every second"
bad,"Great place for compensation, but no training, advancement or integrity."
bad,"I had more than 10 managers or leads telling me what to do on regular basis. They were in constant conflict. I was getting around 800 emails a day and I had to sort through them to find what my managers wanted me to do. The work never ended and I had to work evenings and weekends. I had many of managers in remote locations like San Jose, Austin, India and each had some crazy idea they wanted you to do. The developers were always hiding info so you can't find bugs in their code."
bad,"Working at Cisco was frustrating as a contractor. First of all, the office I was in was mostly empty. Cubes with name tags of people I never saw. They must have been ""working"" from home. Why waste such a massive campus for the 5% of us that were there?"
bad,"This is a great place to gain experience in an office environment and immediately move on to another workplace. The building looks and feels like a prison, no windows and very depressing. There is very little room for growth and management is very strict. I loved my immediate supervisor who mentored me and supported me, but my manager just above her was terrible. She was ruthless and never had a single positive thing to say to anyone on my team, regardless of results."
bad,The company changed for the worse over my 21 years with them.  It now appears to be run by accountants who know the cost of everything but the value of nothing.  There is no oversight of management and therefore there is considerable inconsistency in management ability and style.  It means that there can be truly awful managers and their employees have nowhere to go with complaints.
bad,"Some people in my product group, including my manager, were deliberately disrespectful and unprofessional. "
bad,I just got bored too quick and nothing moves. Too much red tape and managers are just controlling the herd. You will be stopped at every wall you hit. People just hang on to survive.
bad,No real place to practice Project Management due to the take the money and run attitude of Wall Street and it's shareholders.  No job security for Project Managers.
bad,"Cisco is fundamently nothing more than a VC/banking company that would prefer to outsource all work to contractors and or AP region.  As soon as it is able to will lay you off.  it has NO loyalty to employees and the HR ""people deal"" is a joke.  Since when is it hard to have a review program that focuses on your performance against goals and metrics without stack ranking you?"
bad,"I found the work to be disjointed. No documentation is easily available. The Culture is very disjointed."
bad,Could not have been more unhappy.  Long hours.  No appreciation for my efforts.
bad,good company to work with. nice colleagues.  There is a lot of room for innovation and new product development.
bad,"After being in this company for as many years as I have been here, there are really only a few things I can say."
bad,"Job role is not defined"
bad,I really enjoyed working at Cisco . My days always included different challenges and learning to solve issues. I often got the chance to work along side several Engineers and them getting my personal input on how to improve the work process. The hardest part for me would have been getting the opportunity to cross train more. I was one of very few testers who did my job and that made it somewhat difficult for me get cross trained in other areas. The most enjoyable part for me was that everyone had the same gaols in mind and were all focused on meeting them regardless of what issues we faced.
bad,"un PSE (généreux) tous les ans"
bad,Evolution par copinage et non pas une évolution à la méritocratie
bad,"5 bosses in 3 years says it all.  There is very little diversity within the engineering departments, leading to poor teamwork and information sharing."
bad,Good people to work with. Job responsibilities are limited to less than a 1/4 of my current expertise in areas I have 20 years of experience and knowledge. No chance for advancement due to internal security system forbids long term contractors to viewing available jobs.
bad,"If you need decent benefits, I would not recommend being a contractor at Cisco. Frequent reorganizations, no chance of being converted to permanent, no stability, constantly moved before projects are complete. Chaos with huge contractor turnover."
bad,"interesting company.  Lacks empathy for employees. groups of people gang up on particular employees. Lying, creating negative situations, etc.  Run away."
bad,I was extremely busy at Cisco when on contract there.  I found it to be very cut throat.  My manager could not function without someone else doing her job for her.  It was very strange.
bad,"Work was challenging (Performance Testing), however, Cisco has a habit of using people and throwing them away."
bad,My contract at Cisco was meant for temp to perm but never flourished into a permanent position and my contract kept getting extended which made it a very undesirable situation.
bad,"Management is disengaged - too busy doing her training to manage the team."
bad,Did not enjoy my work. Not much opportunities to learn. Manager expects you to learn on your own rather than putting you through training. I will think twice to work for this company in future.
bad,To many layoffs and is political hotbed. Management is out of touch with the employees
bad,"Cisco is too big if you are looking to make a difference.   Perfect company for working remotely and work-life balance.   Frequent re-organizations, poor management"
bad,Cisco was a fantastic company to work for in the 90's.  Not anymore as the there is no innovation and thier only hope to survive is to buy other inovation companies.  Career growth is strictly based on how well you suck to your management.  Merit and good performance will get you nowhere.
bad,Poor culture.  Not innovative and not attractive.  Not a very inclusive environment and employees compete against each other to get promoted.  Cisco has lost sight of what is important in order to grow.
bad,It is very good place for learning to work in high pressure enviornment. Best of the technologies and very good solutions for networking ideas and certifications.
bad,The company starts off good. But as time goes on. You realize they let employees write your story. Instead of management handling the job. The mechanic for Glastonbury is racist and a liar. One driller stinks ( doesn't shower) . Other drillers and helpers are good to work with. But the owner is shady. They cook their books.
bad,"Tell me that work is slow, but will pick up, will not give shift hours until work/business picks up, resulting in people leaving. Poor communication from management, no feeling of job security, unaware of procedures and applications used for work until a task is due as was not advised of such. Disappointed."
bad,"I've had a bad experience with my group and it might not speak for the whole of Cisco. There is too much bureaucracy and success is more based on how well you can suck up to your boss rather than performance and professional ethics."
bad,Terrible sales culture that takes advantage of its employees. CEO created a culture where sales people were always on the hook for terrible product vision and had no idea how behind we were in the market compared to our competitors.
bad,"This company says one thing and does another - horrible culture, manages out and lays off older workers, violates HIPAA with mental health initiatives, really poorly managed."
bad,Too many processes not followed and work culture is not conducive for success for sure.  Good job to get while you are looking for another job.  No social life and family work life balance is neglected for contractors.  Contractors are treated as disposable personnel not human beings.
bad,Advancement is about who you know not what you know.  It used to be that you got promoted based on your work.  Reviews are a joke.  It is based purely on whether you are seen and not what you do...at least in my space that is how it's done.  My management does not go to bat for us based on work done which is unfortunate.
bad,"Weak Management Support"
bad,"Disconnected management (director).  "
bad,"Verizon: IoT 'is now mainstream,' carrier focuses on smart cities by ..."
bad,"Terrible place for work life balance, they tell you that your dog is allowed in the office but the building owner has a much different policy. They also say that working from home is encouraged which makes sense since they put millions into webex and other tools to make collaboration/communication easier but this is not true, the rule is on a case by case basis, meaning if your manager doesn't like you then you don't get this opportunity. They also said any overtime is compensated since I objected to a salary position, this is also false. I work from home when it is convenient for the company (so on weekends and most nights). This is the worst place I have ever worked."
bad,Work 7-7 most days - Contractors get no O/T!
bad,"Very Management heavy. Culture was very stiff and conservative. Sales territories were based on who you knew, not how much. There were multiple layers involved in every aspect of the sale."
bad,this company outsources most of their cusotmer service and tech support employees. I was with the company for over 9 years and they outsourced my job and layed me off. It took 8 people in the Philippines to do my job. This was over a year ago and I still havent been able to find work. Also they have put an office in a different country so that they dont have to pay taxes in the US.
bad,Too much politics.  Too many people have been there too long and have risen far beyond the abilities.  There are a few pockets of the organization that are still worthwhile but its only because of the people in charge there.
bad,Good place to work with friendly colleagues and flexible work  hours and  work life  balance is  very well maintained. with . very minimal . job security as . the . billing . cycle is . generated only 3 months and very risky for contractors.
bad,"WARNING - Cisco is not the company it once was.  Once Chambers left upper management has decided that engineering has no purpose other than improving the bottom line through ""limited restructuring"", but the only thing limited is the severance and the warning given."
bad,"I took the role because of my Sr. Director (she rocked!). The role and my immediate team (direct reports) were the best team I've ever worked with and they made coming to work fun and interesting. Shortly afterwards, we had a re-org and all of the other Directors I had were horrible and knew nothing about what my team did but instead made changes for the sake of making changes. I left because of the instability and lack of vision."
bad,"After working with manpower for 7years, with two job placements, I wouldn't go back. There is little to none job security. Always underpaid because they get a cut. I wish I would've opened my eyes sooner rather than realizing this in my late twenties."
bad,Cisco is a sales and marketing company masquerading as a technology company. Fundamentally unable to see the future and take the risks required to innovate.
bad,"Good place to work, they usually kill the product/companies they acquire. Not a good place to work if you are willing to work for long term. Internal rotation is very rare."
bad,"Yearly, company downsizes jobforce regardless of position - contractor or full-time employee.  Longevity contractors are not transitioned into full-time workforce.  Contractor workload for many positions is greater than 40 hours per work week."
bad,"•	Managed phone lines in high Traffic buildings"
bad,"There's tons of work at times, none at times. Learned little, if any. Management is highly politicized. Co-workers are snitches. There's nothing enjoyable, I work to feed the family."
bad,Had a terrible manager that was a sleazy and a cheat and would do anything to further his career - including squash rising stars that intimidated him.
bad,Management seem un-interested in the needs/ wants of the employees.
bad,"It is run like a sweatshop. Nobody is really happy. Upper management says it is not a call center, but then yell at you if you don't make 100 calls a day. It was a total boys club when I worked there, women rarely moved up."
bad,"Please read this page for detail. The job security is not there. Expected to be laid off thousands in every year."
bad,Cisco is too big and going through a massive transformation.  We'll see if they can do it.  There will be a some massive growing pains and I expect many layoffs will be coming to assist with the transformation.
bad,"Cisco is labyrinthine with folks all over the world working in different time zones. It can be difficult to get the information that you need, especially on short notice."
bad,"To focused on corporate image, not on strategic product development and services. Should be the leader in 5G but is not close to Qualcom. Lack's true workforce mobility."
bad,"no comment for this particular job, other than that the fact that important information during the hiring process was excluded and the fact that upper management is selfish when it comes to employers personals or job entitlement."
bad,"flailing corporate strategy, constant restructuring, layoffs every other month, lots of stress...added to long hours and lack of fulfillment overall due to paranoia and infighting."
bad,"Contract/Temporary employees are not valued and are used as cheap labor. This may be the same situation for major corporation now."
bad,"Good paychecks. Engineering is king here, and good design practice is ignored so engineering can make their deadline.  Politics, politics, politics.  Toxic culture, managers lack people skills, senior architects having public tantrums in meetings, other teams dismantling your design to make it fit with what they already built, then want you to sign off on it."
bad,The company is in transition and looking to figure out a way to be on top.  Going through many rounds of trying to figure it out.  Looking to cut back on remote workers.
bad,I assumed that it is a great place to work but the company underwent turbulent changes and i had close to 3 managers in less than a year. Stability and growth becomes a great question mark. Not a good company to stay with
bad,"Great place to learn,  especially for younger workers willing to accept low pay and job security relative to other marketplace employers.  Shifts include weekdays and weekends at the RTP campus;  some buildings offer recreational diversions like pool tables and video games, with outstanding lunch facilities and frequent catered meetings."
bad,"Not an ideal company to work for as far as work/home life balance."
bad,"Good place to learn how to work within a large enterprise environment, but there are a lot of politics at play and promotes a culture that blatantly discriminates against contractors (red badge folks) they bring on board. Good gym and the food in the cafeteria is good and reasonably priced."
bad,"Cisco used to be a great company.  With recent management changes, the company has completely lost sight of its strategy.  It is struggling to grow and be relevant outside the Core Routing, Switching and Data Center Solutions market.  Its definitely not a company for ambitious, growth-minded individuals."
bad,They Hire low wage techs. Offer no benefits. Then wonder why they can't meet customer expectations. High turnover rate.
bad,I learnt a lot in this company.Management is not Good.
bad,"High stress, very demanding, and not enough time off. You will almost always work through lunch. Co-workers tend to be condensing if they feel like they are more qualified than you are. They aren't afraid to throw you under the bus to make themselves look better. You shouldn't have to shame someone else to make yourself look good. Your work should speak for itself. I have seen many people bullied into quitting and others fired. This place is not for quitters or those that are easily shaken by others. I would recommend CISCO if you are looking for a position to build your resume. It's not the dream job for everyone. They go through many employees for a reason."
bad,Management planning is not appropriate. They hire and release contrcator resources in adhoc way. They have small IT team with around 60 people located in a small area.
bad,"Tough Culture.  Massive changes and many employees frustrated,  Preach transparency and importance of culture but practice a very diff behavior.  Many leaders are out of touch with their teams.  Customer Experience Organization is in Chaos and struggling to organize and execute"
bad,It was a fun place to work back in the day.  It has become a sad ghost of what it used to be.  Turn 50 years old and it's basically the end.  They cull the herd twice a year.
bad,"After the DOT COM bubble, the company has been going on an aimless soul-search to no avail. Expect continuous struggle on all product lines. Stock is up recently but I will sell all my shares soon."
bad,Middle management not following Companies missions in day to day decision making.  Relying too much on outsourcing for cost cutting even though the overall expense is much higher and quality and creativity suffers tremendasly
bad,"high stress environment. no teamwork. unrealistic expectations. workplace bullying is out of control.  as someone once said to me, ""this place requires you to sell your soul to meet their expectation"""
bad,Technicolor bought a loss-making business unit sold by Cisco and desperately trying to retain employees and make it work. Worst place to work. No proper projects and lack of long-term vision
bad,"Not structured, family business not room for advancement.  Never received a raise although meet criteria for advancement.  When I received a raise three months later benefits cost were raised.  Was only offered a raise when I was leaving the company."
bad,This was the most stressful job I had ever had. No leadership and the boss is a nut job. Ob the flip side I got to designs clothes and learned al lot about how to survive in a high stress enviroment
bad,Limited finance personnel and lack of sufficient training was extremely overwhelming.  Lots of transition within the finance team is the most difficult part of the job being new to the team.
bad,"High Stress work Environment, Plan on working 60+ hours per week. Your job can be moved to Mexico at any time. Little time for family due to long work hours. Internal systems leave a lot to be desired."
bad,Depends on the group you work in. Balanced work life and personal life. Office hours would be 9:30am to 5:30pm. You'll get to learn good technical skills.
bad,Lots of mandatory overtime and late night work hours. Very little programming involved - under utilized skills. It's basically a technical support role.
bad,"For the #1 IT company in the world, they really don't have their internal game together. Management is mostly clueless to what their engineers do, and the training material provided is a joke."
bad,People who dont have a degree and want to start career in tech support this would be one of the good starter it will also make you learn how to work under pressure
bad,"If you have the right bent of mind and the technical edge it is a good place to work. Work life balance is not guaranteed always, Innovation is always encouraged."
bad,I got to learn lot of things since this was my first organization in the corporate world. Transitioning from college to corporate is always a big one and there were challenges while doing so especially with the poor management - I although appreciate the learning which really helps me till date.
bad,Culture of confusion.  Not answering emails is completely acceptable.  You waste more time trying to find the right people to work with verses accomplishing anything.
bad,"Good place to get hands on cisco gears, a fast pace learning environment. bad work life balance, stressful but good learning GRA team"
bad,"Even though I study their classes, which are very hard, I would never go back to networking. They work you till death and the other employees are not trying to lose their job, so is a very caddy environment. People get hired and fired depending on who you know, that is just the sad truth."
bad,"No job security, very bad condition your company is merged with cisco, you will never become cisco"
bad,"I am fortunate to work with Cisco for over 7+ years now."
bad,"still haven't learned from past misadventures in how to integrate acquisitions"
bad,"Work is like the wave of the ocean, it comes and go, sometimes big waves some small. A days work is always  busy with long  hours and  very challenging. People are very professional, they respect your space. Management is strictly goal oriented that need more incentive programs. Co-workers are very friendly and have good work ethics. Difficulties of the job is unable to receive customers commitment. Job is enjoyable due to the people you work with."
bad,"Worst job I had in a LONG time!  Never had time to spend with family.  Poor management oversight...and even worse onboarding process...set me up for failure!  Didn't have time for lunch most days...and dinner several nights a week.  Very stressful...very demanding.  And the sad thing is...doesn't need to be that way...but that's the way the culture is set."
bad,"Hardest part of the job is always getting approvals due to several levels of bureaucracy. So a task that would take half hour to complete will take 3 hours due to the approval bottleneck. "
bad,Plenty of hardware around to learn. Lots of projects.
bad,Need to work for a company with better benfits and room to grow.
bad,"Lack of leadership and ownership, things changed frequently due to lack of consensus building. Things are artificially made into complicated than what was really necessary, with intent to make few rock stars and create job securities rather than accomplishing tasks as a whole. This in turn makes things not duplicatable and scalable, and consequently, company's growth is limited no matter how much money it has in the bank."
bad,"Great people to work with.  I learned how to use various systems to log in employees and make temporary badges, visitor badges and service badges.  Interfaced with alot of different people doing different jobs."
bad,Cisco is a great company with great benefits ... but cant say the same about the management / people who control / execute it as all the benefits and policies are good on-paper but not in implementation. Inconsistent  / Not-so-ethical management and very poor HR personnel and bad HR policies combined with bad execution at both Business Unit and at HR organizations.
bad,The option to work from home is a huge asset and giving the ability to work remote offers employee's to not have to drive in the office everyday.  Health benefits could always be better
bad,Not a lot of excitement either. Highly motivated folks tend to move on. Not a lot of management pressure but guidance and growth are fairly limited too.
bad,The group I worked in was the Cisco Capital team which is the captive finance organization.  The culture in the San Jose office was very tense and stressful.  Management failed to deal with difficult and disruptive employees and colleagues from other departments did not respect the workers in the Capital team.  The hardest part of the job was the thankless aspect of hitting the stated goals and objectives and no rewards for doing so except a bigger number next quarter.  It took almost 6 months to arrange a half day off site for the employees once we hit our goals and the management refused to participate or fund even water for the picnic.  Harassment was common as well as bullying and passive aggressive behavior.
bad,"Als Sales Person musst du wie eine Machine funktionieren und hast absolut kein WERT als MENSCH,du bist nur einen Zahl."
bad,"There are so many people involved in the change management function that there is overlap in project management, people playing similar roles as organizations scramble to take control of the direction of the change.  Lots of money wasted in contractors and consultants."
bad,"Cisco was an acquiring company to my smaller company.  After 10 years and many failed opportunities to advance, I left Cisco and it has been a very good break. My health has improved. My family is happy to have more access to me, even though I never left home, except tp travel for client visits.  At one point I had (my team also) 6 different managers within 5 months.  Any momentum towards advancement was lost for years at a time. "
bad,"Depends on the mgr- bad or good experience"
bad,"Good luck! I don't wish to recall all the details but in brief:"
bad,"Failure to move people to the needed areas requires ""Limit Restructuring"" each year. Low morale of those lucky enough to get to continue employment.  Must be young and a part of the right group to get career advancement."
bad,Cisco is constantly laying entire business units off without a goal of relocating those individuals to other organizations within the company.  If you're not in San Jose you will have limited growth possibilities.  Stay away unless you're in San Jose
bad,"Выполнял все возложенные на меня обязанности, коллктив был замечательный, ушел по тому, что нашел работу интереснее."
bad,"Cisco keeps buying new companies, then there is mismanagement and then they Lay off people."
bad,"Cisco does everything by job description. It's difficult to get new projects when they come out. Also, management has a tendency to go to the same people and doesn't really distribute the new opportunities."
bad,"Good infrastructure and office environment."
bad,Fun company to work with. Job security is good. Management is regimental.
bad,"Overall a good company with human values and ethics."
bad,"It was fun working there because of the customers and a few co workers. All in all, the manager was a bad teacher and so were alot of the coworkers dispite a few good ones. I would say that the hardest part of the job was convincing customers why they need Direct TV instead of whatever it was they had"
bad,"It's like every Tech Company, you put your all into the Company, then they let you go, doesn't matter how much dedicated time you put in with the company, Tech companys are Tech Companys...go along for the ride, its not forever!"
bad,"While Cisco touts several benefits and positive culture this is completely dependant on your department leadership.  Travel and training opportunities are not provided equitability. Raises are not given, bonuses are low and not equitable its very much of a ""do more with less"" environment where new ideas and innovation are not welcome."
bad,"I have nothing to share from my experience. Managers need to have required training, Just because someone says that want to be a manager does not make them management material"
bad,Great company and products.  Tough job for work life balance...great pay/benefits.....minimal training/minimal support.  On your own- hardest part of the job
bad,no need for this review but in general the environment was ok. But I felt that i did not fit the position. this is a small feedback. But the environment needs improvement
bad,"First and 2nd Line management not high Caliber."
bad,Poor management. Favors foreigners over Americans. No raises or advancement. The focus is more on politics than it is on the work at hand. Cisco was a great place to work until the culture crumbled around 2004.
bad,too much of powerplay does not help anyone grow and build positive experiences in a workplace. That is a big lacking here. it can be very disappointing to come across such pointless self aggrandizement...
bad,"If you want to do software development at Cisco (a hardware company) then think again. Their management has no clue how CI/CD and code quality works. Management is behind the times on new technologies and is really quite sad."
bad,"If you want an easy job where you can't get much done because of culture and politics, but no one will ask you about it - this is the place for you."
bad,"Sales oriented company, lack of true vision, no commitment to employees, bad culture, particularly in the failing business units left over from acquisitions."
bad,"Constant reorganizations, change of strategy and change in mgt. results in disjointed teams realigning to hit the numbers as the primary goal. Constant limited restructuring does not lend to loyalty or commitment to team success."
bad,I am optimistic and team player and cisco culture is just opposite to it. It is poisonous and too negative though the company provide great employee benefits.
bad,"Cisco, believe their prefered vendor instead of work or delivery. so all projects at the same starting point after Year time also. they just need vendor continuity instead of Continues delivery."
bad,It is a large stable company where you can be part of a large family.  They are involved in many different businesses.  People recognize the name
bad,I was a contractor supporting webex and they gave false information on offering me a job with compucom.
bad,"Stressful environment bullying - you don't get rewarded no matter how hard you try, it's mostly about politics specially in eastern Europe murky opportunities, public sector business, aggressive Balkans management mostly Greeks, Bulgarian and Romanian, tender corruption,"
bad,"I work in IT and the culture sucks--for lack of a better phrase. They are very much stuck in the ""old"" Cisco ways and need to work more on leadership development, emotional intelligence, and empowering their employees. I don't know if other areas of the company have better culture or not, it's such a big company that every area has their own culture."
bad,"Not many fancy things in the workplace, just a desk and a standard laptop, May have upgraded in the years since I worked there, but it was all about the project, hoping that your group can win out against other groups across the country working on similar goals."
bad,"Leadership culture at Cisco is about execution period full stop. The culture is driven by your direct manager and is not consistent across groups in the same division. Accountability among leadership is low and standards of excellence are inconsistent across teams, leading to a sense of arbitrariness."
bad,"I was hired on a project basis to help develop communications throughout the Cisco environment for a very forward thinking project.  However, the team had been working together for many years and this made understanding very difficult.  The solution was very technical and trying to understand it thoroughly in 2 months proved to be a difficult task.  In addition, when I finally began to understand and make a plan of action, they no longer felt like they needed the support.  Unfortunately, this did not allow me to do the work that I was hired to do."
bad,"They say you should work 8-5 but you'll never be able to keep up with it. They need to hire more bodies. "
bad,"Cisco has a numbers, not employees and they love to cut those numbers to increase their bottom line. They care more about productivity than about the actual employees.  Our office had nearly fifty people when they bought us  and less than ten when I was laid off - everyone hated the culture."
bad,Organizationally very challenging given I was both remote and Cisco was going through many changes at the time. I wish the environment was better at the time as I believe it would have worked out.
bad,"I worked at Cisco in RTP for a few years. Over time it become obvious that my project peers were working other full-time jobs and shouldering me with an unfair amount of project burden. I made management aware of this issue but they were too busy to effectively look into the matter. It was a complicated issue; management typically doesn't have time to manage staff at Cisco and actually see whats going on. Many managers have too many employees, some like mine have the title of manager but are really too busy working a sales role. This puts them in the place of trusting mid-level employees.If your under a shady one theres not much you can do."
bad,"if the company is doing well, it would be a good place to work but things have changed over the past few years.  several layoffs with no severance , and no more bonuses"
bad,"Treat contractors like replaceable parts and don't do anything to bring them into the company. Can't access advancement training programs, and change org without sound solution to transition teams and individuals."
bad,"Cisco pays well and has great benefits. The Individual contributor roles are the best career tracks for promotions. The management path outright stinks as far as promotions go. Getting to Director is next to impossible, even if you are a star performer. The worst part is all employees and contractors have a job for roughly 6 months then lay-offs happen, if you are not released you are mostly safe for another 6 months and again with the lay-offs. This is the culture at Cisco. It has totally ruined the atmosphere there."
bad,"Nice and challenging place to work, one of the smartest people on the job. Tough working environment, requires hard work."
bad,My typical day at work is meeting a lot of people. I am working on a business model transformation project that allows me to meet a lot of people from different business units and learn from their experiences.
bad,"Job security is nil, and with it comes a poor morale.  This is due to the frequent layoffs, yearly, but sometimes even quarterly.  "
bad,"This company is beholden to its stock holders.  Add in the inability to move positions internally and you are in a dead end career."
bad,"Cisco pays well, the projects are interesting, frequently leading edge, and the hours are generally pretty good. However, everyone is constantly looking over their shoulder and worried about their job. In this respect it is a high stress position with little sense of job security."
bad,The company was confused about my duties when hired . Brief experience but good people I just wished they knew what they wanted to hire before I accepted the role
bad,"More Generals than Soldiers."
bad,"Work environment good for permanent employees with options to work from home and good benefits. Unfortunately, not much hope of getting hired on permanent."
bad,"Being a contractor, I did not receive an benefits or job security. The training was extensive and you were expected to acquire training from other employees that were also very busy,"
bad,"This was a great employer, now it's just a good employer. The layoffs every summer have definitely impacted the culture - there's a reluctance to take risks, for fear of failing and being the next one voted off the island."
bad,The work-life balance is very good at Cisco System and the products it work on have significant impact on everyone's daily life. It addresses lots of critical issues in the networking industry.
bad,Layoffs happening every year. No interest in getting current employees trained to take on new technologies as new hires join as lower salaries. New CEO the only positive sign as long as they can get the long time leaders out that have delivered no shareholder value for years
bad,"Business Process Analysis & Documentation of As-Is and To-Be Processes"
bad,"5 years ago Cisco was still the best place to work but with the introduction of Adjacencies, CABS, and the need to diversify management lost track of what was really important the people and being the best at our core competencies."
bad,"Every person lives the experience differently, I hated it because I don't like the IT sector and work in a stressful environment but other people do.."
bad,"Did not like the politics and had multiple supervisor changes in the short period that I worked there."
bad,job was mellow enjoyed the work opportunity. enjoyed working with the supervisor and staff. was not overwhelming . learning how to work in a cafeteria was excellent with the staff that I worked with. They were awesome
bad,"Poor work life balance"
bad,"Workplace culture good"
bad,company in search of itself.. may or may not make the transition to the next networking world.  Annual layoffs now really detrimental  to morale.. has become another big company
bad,"no Job security,poor management. Work culture was not so great. People use to prefer to work from home.Hardest part pf work was no support from management to the employees."
bad,"A typical day at work, I start working at 6.30 AM, I review all the pending and the e-mails that I received, but If there is something urgent I have to focus on that ."
bad,Supportive engineering team but no good managers. No proper planning to complete tasks.. there is a differentiation between contractors and the full time employees.
bad,Heavy Politics. Benefits & Perks are good and opportunities are available to move around the company. But the politics is a big turnoff.
bad,"not much career growth"
bad,"Around 2.5 Years experience in Storage Testing(DAS, SAN and NAS technology)"
bad,"organisation tres orientée performance mais qui se remets peu en questions, "
bad,"When I arrived for my first day at Cisco the first thing I did was wait 4 hours for my manager to show up. He then gave me some documents to read which were *clearly* meant to be read by someone with significant previous knowledge of the Cisco architecture. After two days of slogging through what I can only assume my manager thought passed for onboarding, he pawned me off to somebody under him who gave me a solo project to work on that summer. Working alone on this project, I was very much forgotten by management. I met with my manager a total of 3 times over a 12-week internship, and I would often go days or weeks in a row without ever speaking with another employee."
bad,"I have worked at Cisco multiple times with different managers and different work environments. The first time was with a normal work environment with a cube/office and the 2nd time was working in a floating room within a Proof-Of-Concept team. The first is much preferable as the team already has a proven ""worth"" and communications with other development teams have already been generated. The POC with floating offices is new and doesn't allow a feeling of permanence."
bad,I was told repeatedly by manager that I did not need to worry about job security and then was terminated suddenly without any warning due to an emerging clearance requirement.
bad,"Good work life balance."
bad,"Beware consultants, you are not honored, on a ticking time-bomb, get your money upfront, up charge your services, they will pay and then let you go as soon as you are not 100% relevant, communication is terrible across business groups, keep your mouth shut and just do what the boss asks, stay out of any politics, they will use you as bait. Do not try to change anything, the will not change."
good,After acquisition work environment has totally gone for a toss.
good,"HR team is not the greatest when there is conflicts. Being a huge corporation there is a downfall to awareness of what is going on at this company meaning internal issues that need resolve seem to go without investigating and looking for ways to fix internal practices. Lots of ignoring of issues rather than fixing."
good,"azienda che ti fa lavorare,ma basta che ti ammali 2 volte ti buttano fuori"
good,"The culture is always changing at Cisco, also a very face paced place to stay busy!"
good,"To  the best of my  knowledge..  Hard to get  in  Cisco ... Once you  get it,,  you sre constantly  on  toe and working   24x7 with  offshore team.  Lot's of plitics and less fruitful output.  Lacking  implementation partnership."
good,"Great place for a permanent employee.  For a contract employee, it is very stressful and workers are not treated very well.  Contractors are not well respected here."
good,This time was a spring board for me to launch myself and establish as a software engineer at the highest level in my professional domain with world class technologies and its applications.
good,"Normal professional work culture."
good,"great work from home policy, too many lay offs, no management structure. hiring only contractors"
good,"The manager said to me two months after coming back, ""I just need bodies to take a customer case""  only took me 4 more months for me to say good-bye.  She didn't care about the employee, the stress levels, the improper work load, just horrid management.  Oh, and she was the one that told me, ""I'm here because my husband and I didn't plan our retirement right and need to make up some money"" after having a discussion about buying a house."
good,"The documentation managers demand a certain style of writing that is not in the best interest of the audience. They just want to write ""enter this, click there,"" without any real, useful information. I knew way more than they did about writing."
good,"the most enjoyable part of the job was helping customers resolve issues, the hardest part of the job was the open work space, several different departments within the area that could get loud."
good,"Shark Tank, its all about money, people and conditions are deplorable. Takes forever to get in there "" system ""."
good,"This was a remote contract position and as a contractor, was expected to set up your own laptop, telecommunications, and applications with little to no support. Same thing for the actual work. Poorly documented and presented self-guided training with high demand on immediate productivity. While the group manager was delightful, she was largely absent from the day to day operations. The immediate supervisor was highly demanding, hyper-critical and largely unsupportive. It was expressed that it's a sink or swim approach to training. The work was extremely complex with little to no effective documentation. The only way I succeeded in this position was through the excellent and helpful other remote team members. Systems and procedures seemed to change from week to week, again with little documentation to follow. Not for the technically weak or the faint of heart."
good,Working as a contractor and regular full time employees are not open to new ideas for improvement.  Rigid structure with an us and them attitude toward contractors.  Employees are threatened by outsiders.
good,"Not recommended. You will not move anywhere if you are not the favorite. 1 year max, if you do not get sick before, then find another place. End of it!"
good,Management is fully biased and never neutral. Not matured management and No WorkLife balance No Job security. Never join if you want a job. Join if you want to work like a GLADIATOR (SLAVE).
good,Typical day would include working with Sales and creating and approving new opportunities.  Working with customers and delivering Cisco services and deliverables.  Manage escalations.  Manage people.  Train my team.
good,It has become second culture at CISCO to layoff people multiple times in a year. This is not good at all considering job security point of view. Pathetic company from that point of view.
good,"Used to tap kegs on Fridays and hang out and enjoy our commrades in arms.  Changed a bit. On Tuesday's without fail, Wednesday's would always follow...I never could figure that one out :^)"
good,"Nice place to start your career. lot of flexibility in working hours,"
good,"I consider myself a mid to upper level IP Telephony / Unified Communications engineer and would work at Cisco if I were a tier 3 blue badge.  I was put into the position because my previous job had to go through mass layoffs due to financial distress.  No advancement unless a position opens and pay increases need to be practically begged for.  I come from a military background and the management for my team in the RMS NOC was pitiful at best.  Employees would consistently show up late, work from home without permission, or just not show up at all.  Management has done little to nothing to fix the issue.  "
good,"Work to work day are typical but does have a learning curve."
good,"Good work life"
good,"Staff is treated like slaves, management is highly political, and they like other cultures than US since they tend to be subservient, IMHO."
good,"Off roll are paid very low."
good,"No one wants to collaborate or work together because everyone fears for their jobs all the time and no one wants to give their job away. They stopped hiring people, and instead go to 3rd party vendors and outside the US. They have a lot of job openings posted, but it's for show - most listed are not budgeted for and they are closed and reopened several times."
good,Cisco is a cool place to work everyone puts on the work face and tries to help each out out as much as possible. First management is approachable and second line is not as approachable.
good,"Small company with family values.  Opportunity to learn several different tasks, including time management, task management, and communicating with internal and external customers."
good,Enjoyed the time I spent there. Worked with great people. Still talk to them today. Location is easy to get to..................................................
good,Challenging work. Nice people but not corporate culture to speak of. If you know the right people you may get the chance to advance. Otherwise you are destined to remain in your role without many opportunities.
good,Pay and benefits are fantastic but the expectation is a 60+ hour work week which leads to challenging work/life balance.  The culture is changing with the end result to be determined on how it all shakes out.  Trying to shift from transactional to strategic customer messaging but metrics are still very transactionally focused.
good,"It's all about the group and the manager in the group. Overall, CIsco is a good company, if you want to have little balance of family and work. Culture is good."
good,Your day will consist of meeting after meeting after meeting with your team who is 12 hours either ahead of you or behind you. Cisco has lots of tech geeks and nerds and brainiacs.  Lots of Visa workers with lots more benefits than any typical American worker.
good,"CI/CD development pushing code to cloud everyday."
good,"Your job is always on the line, miss your quota for 1 quarter and you could be on the chopping block."
good,Great place to learn a lot of new technology. Always acquiring new technology so something interesting to learn. Work Life balance is a challenge with the workload per employee.
good,"High turnover among contractors was common and expected.  Pay was entry-level and advancement opportunities were limited at best.  Senior leadership was outstanding, mid-level management was   caught between client demands and constant turnover."
good,"It wasn't stressful at all working at Cisco. However, it often felt like you need to find your own work. This short time I worked at Cisco I spent a lot of time doing charity work. I was part of a team with 112 people but only 9 of them were Cisco employee rest were all contractors."
good,"In the very short 4 years I was at Cisco, I survived no less than 6 re-orgs and 6 new managers.  Complete lack of vision and stability at Cisco and some of the managers had no clue what our team did. So frustrating!"
good,Leads are not good in CISCO and if any issue comes then these leads will try to escape and we have to handle it which then impact to our performance and management can fire for poor performance employee
good,"The money is good. Flexible, depending on your team and manager's discretion."
good,"A typical day in IT at Cisco, starts early and ends late, you are always connected.  Is extremely fasted paced, with a steep learning curve, however that can be fun for a while.  Hardest part of the job was the politics, favoritism at the junior to middle management level is difficult to stomach as they have turned favored individual contributors into managers, which doesn't always translate to good management.  Most enjoyable part of the job is the people you work with."
good,"Casual dress code, free gym membership for all, game rooms!  Company of gamers and engineers.  Company celebrates Pi day (March 14 - ie. 3.14....)."
good,"The product I worked on was Cisco United Computing System"
good,"When i come in the fist think i do is check emails for any types of updated, or if a Program Manager called out the day of there briefing. After that i make sure all Circle ups are before 9:30 am if its not i need to know why, the Circle ups allow me to see what catering i need to enter for the next day briefings, also the circle up will show me if a room needs to be set up a certain way and that's what i would put on the Priority list for facilities to set up for the next day or if there are any big events going on. While doing all of this i also have to make sure all the briefings for that day all customers are taken care of and answer any questions they have as well if they need transportation to airports or dinners."
good,"Over see center LAN, configure OS images for clients both consumer and corporation for daily use. Learned alot of troubleshooting techniques. Ok working environment. There aren't any hard parts to this job , but the most enjoyable part of the job is  setting up configurations."
good,"Great place to learn about technology and the company is always looking for ways to improve. Constantly looking at things in different ways and hell a reorg here and there. For it's size it is amazingly adaptable to change."
good,"Lots of work, Bad Management, Very unorganized staff. You would be working with people from all over the world in different time zones which can be a major pain."
good,Cisco has grown a lot over last 10 years. No longer a growth company
good,"Joined Cisco as a contractor, turned down many offers from other companies because Cisco was my dream job, or so I thought.  As a contractor, I didn't get any PTO, and no pay during mandatory holidays.  I was mandated to only work 40 hours a week, but I would usually go way over due to being on call, but was unable to collect overtime, even though my contract said I was entitled to it.  Cisco has their systems in place, and doesn't seem to allow for any innovation... If Cisco wants a new innovated idea, they seem to just buy out a company that already does it, and rebrand the uses.  I didn't enjoy my time there, but many others do!"
good,The work environment was team based. There was a lot of peer to peer collaboration. Training was limited a lot of things were self taught. This job is made for a self starter.
good,"I chose to leave Cisco because I was working constantly, weeknights and weekends.  I had 2 children in high school at the time, who were very active in volleyball.  I could never make their games because I always had to work. Including some of their weekend games. :("
good,"I am not sure of the full time side of the business but the contractual side was something different. "
good,"Great with more mature employees"
good,"As a contractor it is hard to rate any company ,"
good,Standard of life is stressful at times with lay off every 6 months. Lack of leadership direction in any given time. Gets too political on the top.  No job security.
good,"LR every quarter or six months. Absolutely no job security. Employees are really good. Good benefits, and work life balance. Almost everybody at Cisco has been affected by LR"
good,"* Typical day at works depends on your position.  Some areas are heavily watched and others are given autonomy to deliver on their goals. "
good,"Deliverables were unclear.  Strategic planning was done by one consultancy; overview planning was done by a different consultancy, and deliverables were completed by staff and yet different consultants.  Coordination among all the working groups was loose-to-Poor."
good,"There are people who can do the work and work harder than others. However, management fail to recognize those effort and reward the ones who don't work as hard. Too much politics and gossips."
good,"Cisco is dependent on contractors to accomplish their goals, but do not feel any responsibility for their career, even for long-term contractors. I've had 8 managers in five years which guaranteed that they left us alone to do great work. If you're a contractor, don't expect recognition or reward. You won't get it."
good,"start at 9am, ends at 7 pm.  Not good for health."
good,"Cisco's current culture does not represent the current tech culture of fast, progressive atmosphere. It is a comfortable environment, but difficult for professional advancement. With new executive management, I believe they will have continued changes over the next couple years to change the company culture more modern."
good,"I believe outside of the organization I was in at Cisco I would have thoroughly enjoyed my time. Unfortunately, I was put into a position with little to no room for advancement"
good,Cisco job is good for someone who would like to take the responsibility of learning by himself. Lot of lab resource there. Management is not actively interested to evaluate true performance. Management mostly worry about their own interests.
good,"I would go in and do time sheets.  I learned how to open work orders close them, time cards.  Things always changed so I was learning something new everyday."
good,"Cisco is in IT and total addressable market is shrinking.  They have not broken out from selling primarily products that are becoming commoditized.  As a result, management keeps trying new things, but mostly, continued downsizing and cronyism."
good,"Manager has work schedule from late morning to evening.  Expect employee to be available all the time online even at after work hours in the evening or night time 10:00pm or later.  Employee has a normal work day schedule from 8:30-9:00 am to 6:30-7:00pm would considered as not hard working."
good,"Cisco is growing from technology perspective and the work is good. "
good,"The company is deep in a hardware sales culture with a strong merger-acquisition approach to technology innovation.  For us whose software development company was acquired into Cisco, it is challenging to maintain an engineering-centric culture since everything is short-term, sale-driven."
good,Culture and work are interesting . Good collegues. Nice projects to work. Awesome Infrastructure. All in all a good company to settle down. All this depends on the Business Unit too.
good,"Cisco provides a good learning opportunity and is a great place to learn new skills. Teamwork is good and office politics is negligible. Long working hours and focus on third party payroll is a dampener, as it means very less or no benefits and hardly any leaves."
good,"a good company to work with many talented & innovative people. There are many opportunities in headquarter location; however, there are limited opportunity outside of the headquarter location."
good,The only thing constant at Cisco is change so I've learned to adapt quickly. The hardest part of my job is gathering context around a new project coming my way.  Everyone is very busy and only some folks are willing to invest time in others to set context in order to ensure a successful project.
good,"Biggest Pro: interacting with LOTS of fun, engaging, smart people doing really cool things."
good,"Cisco has completely lost the family mantra that used to make it a great place to work."
good,Cisco was a nice place to work however management seemed to be not very organized.  My manager at the time did not have any experience AT ALL in the finance department.  Which was difficult as a new comer to Cisco.
good,"Work life balance is near impossible to maintain and even if you have it, there will be gradual creep where it will whither away."
good,"Meetings start early "
good,"too big, not like a fast grow up company. and every year has lay off plan, but never cut the worst performance person. just waste budget and employee's passion."
good,Things move at a slow pace at Cisco.  Lot of approval processes need to take place to get work done.  I found their management to be very vague and ambiguous in communication of their goals and objectives.
good,Work life balance is good and flexibility is good but you can be online constantly.
good,"Resistance to help from hardware vendors (superiority complex)"
good,They want want hire contractors for grunt jobs. Don't want to use talent or experience of the new hires to improve processes and productivity. They just want to run the environment as is.
good,Average salary but lots of favoritism. Employees are not rewarded by merit
good,"Managing the transition process from installation to bringing the customers' network under RMS (Remote Managed Services) management. This process is called Service Activation and involve coordinating between the client, installation teams, sales teams and second day support teams. "
good,A typical work day would to run reports. Send daily updates to clients and to send accounts to legal
good,Depending on the management style of your team this could be a great company to work for directly.
good,Sehr schnelllebig und zahlenorientiert. Kann auch viel Spaß machen.
good,Training was great but the work environment in the Telepresence area was difficult. Management expectations were high but they would only complain without giving guidance or feedback.
good,"For a tech company this large and successful, the infrastructure of how and where you perform your actual job is broken.   The company prides itself on being diverse, but it is not true.  There is a sub culture of racism,  classism and misogyny that is prevalent in all levels of the company's managment."
good,Choose business unit and position carefully to be sure it matches goals.  Some projects are less-well supported by mgmt than others which can be grinding.  Company does offer a lot of training and various projects are moving to cloud and related deployment technologies and those will be more interesting to most than embedded networking jobs.
good,"Project planning is a mess.  Management gives a deadline then ask engineers to do scoping.  "
good,"This organization at Cisco was not an easy place to work with.  In one of my projects the demands of the management was unclear, confusing, understaffed which in the end required you to work more hours than necessary. In another project, they were overstaffed and had more people working on the same requirements than were needed."
good,Cisco has a relaxed culture which is great but suffers from its giant bureaucracy. Very difficult to move up internally. Teams were oversized and impractical.
good,"No job security, cut people every quarter. If you stay there long, you will have lowest salary in  the industry,  lots of politics.  Some BU are super busy, some are very relax"
good,Current position has terrible manager (vindictive jerk) combined with night meetings with off shore teams 3-4 nights per week while expected to work full day.
good,"Typical day at work was good, collaboration with fellow workers was good, unfortunately there was a lack of transparency and job uncertainties were high, did not know when it will be the next round of layoffs."
good,Good experience but lacking in the management and IT side. Could do with better management and investment in systems. More communication and Rewards available
good,"Overall good company. The salary and benefits are good. There are various orgs to join for networking purposes and there are a great amount of  training and development opportunities. My only concern is there is a lack a structure in who gets promoted. Your skills, initiatives, contributions, hard work and team work do not get you promoted. Its about who you know. It's a popularity contest so in which there some bad managers. And those that deserve the role are sometimes over looked. Also, the work hours are hard and long. It's all about shareholders equity. Cisco lay off employees at the drop of a dime  to save for that month or quarter then hire somebody new in that same position the next day."
good,"The culture of Cisco is one of the most demanding in the industry.   There is little loyalty form the company to the employee, however they do provide opportunity if you are so motivated."
good,"Cisco can be good to you over the years, but there are pockets within the company that have problems - e.g. managed services. Politics and cabals unfortunately prevent the company from moving forward. Frank/candid talk about content is taking a back seat to favoritism and a pleasing attitude. The 'yes people' advance while those daring & astute with the bravado to speak out are summarily ignored or placated."
good,I was grateful for the job. The work was relatively easy and colleagues shared information easily. I didn't like being laid off as soon as I returned from sick leave.
good,"The technical people with whom I worked were top quality. They were knowledgeable, skilled, hard-working and passionate about their work. However, their leadership people were poorly trained and often failed to communicate with other group leaders so that the work of the technical staff was uncoordinated and morale fell far below what could be achieved. They accept this situation as normal and seemed unmotivated to improve it."
good,"Great People, but lots of politics. There is a lack of clarity in expressing the team mission and an assumptive attitude that people need little or no coaching when they start."
good,"Lots of lip service paid to work/life balance.  Don't believe it.  If you work there full time, depending on the position expect to work evenings/weekends."
good,"Most of the positions need more than 8 hrs of work but there are flexible work hours which makes things little better "
good,Not as impressed as I thought I would be overall.  Work/Life balance is good.  Constant re-organization of leadership.  A lot of turnover and moving in and out of teams.
good,Cisco wasn't a bad place to work.  There's no job security as they are always laying off and rehiring in different locations.  They do have a very good working environment.
good,"Not gender equal but well paid and great products. Pale, male and stale. Little chance for advancement but there is a lot to learn whilst there. Nice offices."
good,"Very hands off, but just didnt seem to ever check in with their employees very often at all.  They did respond to calls and or emails, but I just think they were a bit too hands off."
good,"During my experience at Cisco, it was a professional environment and the ability to work with various geographical locations using the on line Webex was a great tool that I used before going to building location and also in evening working with India in evening hours from home and weekends."
good,I work for a business unit that had been purchased as a start up. The culture in this business unit is probably not the same as the rest of Cisco. We are going through reorganization at the moment and a lot of people are losing jobs or being made in to contractors with a third-party.
good,"Amazing company culture. Schedule is flexible as long as you get your work done. Very demanding regardless of how many roles you are maintaining. I was working two additional roles while working in hq and my team was shocked to hear that I was being worked so much which didn't help the process. I was expected to train, document, and learn new role simultaneously with constant meetings (most which were unnecessary). It can burn you to a crisp. The better you do, the more they suck out of you. Roles can be promised, but not until they drain you with little to no appreciation. Be prepared. You'll notice people will start looking like zombies due to this strategy, and then you'll become one."
good,Management is only interested in their own job security and paychecks. Lacked of employee support. They did only minimum to keep work going. Not very interested in business overall.
good,Not really so much opportunity for interns. They are laying many people off in order to catch the train of changes in the market. As an intern we couldn't work from home and our benefit package was limited.
good,Job security is less in Cisco. Layoffs are quite often. Recently hikes and promotions also reduced. Company is losing revenue in Hardware YOY. Most employees often fear of layoffs.
good,"Friday's most people work from home. I am in IT, so we have calls with folks in APJC and EMEA (early morning or at night PST). Managers are supportive, but career advancement and salary are not up to par with rest of industry."
good,"environment is haphazard at best. Was promised company trips, bonuses, etc, 2 years after I started all that went away. There is a lot of overhead with people that are in positions that your not really sure what they do."
good,"When I started with Cisco, it was a great company.  There was a great focus on team building and motivational events.  Unfortunately, as time went buy, I noticed that the company changed from a fast pass fun company to a long hours, bad management sweatshop.  "
good,"As a contractor for Experis at Cisco, I definitely don't have to worry about the work following me home or dogging me on the weekends and overall it is a very easy job."
good,"Great company, evolving, transforming. Smart people, looking forward to the future. Sink or swim environment, not for the faint of heart. But tremendous opportunity to learn and grow."
good,They are not what they used to be. It was a fun and vibrant place to be. Now it is just a job. The company's revenue is shrinking and they are evolving into a SW company.
good,"It used to be a great place to work with amazing, creative people. Over the years, upper management seems to be focusing more on numbers than visions. Starting out, it could be a good place, but don't stop learning new skills."
good,"The pace here is SLOW. You will spend months in meetings on decisions that at most require one hour of deliberation."
good,"Being at Cisco, one thing I liked the most was that innovation/creativity was given lot of importance. This made life quiet interesting because there were lot of Hackathons, Innovation councils where you present your idea etc. A typical day at work started with scoping of features, interacting with partners and reviewing their work, answering customer queries and little bit of testing the features. Co-workers were nice and cool to work with. The hardest part of the job was when our features were getting deployed at customer premises and just keeping our friends crossed so that it works perfectly fine without any issues."
good,"Current manager is very poor technically and also possess average communication skills. He has a authoritative attitude which does not allows employees to comfortably put forward their work related issues."
good,"Working on Embedded Technology."
good,"I loved my job at Cisco, but the main issue was our production manager and the lack of support from my other business partners."
good,Cisco was great to work with. I was a contractor and the company I worked for was market star which I would not recommend. all of the people at Cisco I reported to were very professional good hard working people who treated me great.
good,"It has become common place to layoff large number of employees every year, with little to no process for redeploying strong talent.  Very insecure place to work."
good,"Too much politics"
good,"Cisco is quite an interesting place, it offers flexible work hours."
good,Partnering with cross boundary functions is key to success.
good,Fun place to be at. You get to learn a lot. All Cisco Products are available for you to experiment and learn.
good,"OSI Consulting is a good place to start career. Good technical expertise."
good,"A typical day was working with customers, program managers, project managers and customer service managers to ensure that orders for cable boxes and satellite products was processed and delivered in a timely manner without errors.  Handled hundreds of mid-market accounts and processed order to increase revenue on an annal basis. Mentored and trained other reps."
good,"duties including packing and unpacking products, stock checking..."
good,"Al finalizar cada año fiscal (Julio) tu trabajo está en riesgo, ya sea porque no alcanzaste las altísimas cuotas de ventas, o porque la empresa se reestructuró globalmente."
good,"Great pay, but the culture is very San Jose focused. If you want a long term career there you must have San Jose tie. No personal help. You need help click a link and wait, wait, wait....No personal help includes human resources, work help when you see trouble, or help to navigate the system. Click a link and wait."
good,If you stay longer than 5 years in Cisco you will regret it. The work from home benefits and the travel can be fun to begin with but progression and job advanvement is not very good.
good,It gave me a good platform to learn and improve my skills. Job Work/Life Balance was okay. Job Security was not that stable. Management was pretty okay.
good,"When I started my contract at Cisco, we had full-height cubes and some interesting prospects for the work in my group.  I enjoyed a voluntary side trip into porting OpenStack, tho it was only for a management demo (not for a specific customer/deal)."
good,"Great place to be, but can be difficult to be noticed and valued for advancement into more leadership oriented roles which seem to be reserved for those who play the political games the best. Those in perceived hierarchy can be abusive and disrespectful to those perceived to be below them."
good,"not friendly, people from other culture bring their bias  and ask illegal questions such as what religion you have, how many kids and where are you from"
good,Your work / life balance is not that good. Your work life whether good or bad will depend on your team's manager. Be prepared for company layoffs. Plenty of opportunity to learn different technologies.  Good benefits also.
good,"long hours and lots of out of hours work "
good,"The company has amazing products and services and some of the brightest minds working there. However, it seems to struggle with collaboration across departments due to job security concerns."
good,I was on a contract working with a large team.  I moved the project forward using Agile/Scrum methology.  The project was good but the funding ended so my contract ended.
good,"good workplace. good learning experience."
good,"I was able to work remotely, but the work atmosphere is corporate office space. oceans of cubicles. good benefits. good pay. horrible org structure. extremely disorganized teams."
good,"Most of the workers in Cisco are ""consultants"" It takes years to get hired as permanent employee.  The management are all and inexperience."
good,"Looking for projects and create impact individually."
good,Great workplace culture and compensation. The issue is they have continuous layoffs thus is not a stable place to work. A lot of missteps as it relates to C-Suite business decisions as to the direction of the company.
good,"Cisco has become a different organization since Chambers departures.  There is not the ""family"" culture that enabled teams to take chances in trying new approaches."
good,"The team was great to work with and everyone strived to provide the best service to the customer.  All of the different teams seemed to work well with each other and I appreciated the support from other departments when you were looking for a solution. "
good,"My typical day started at 9 A.M. and usually ended about 9-10 P.M."
good,"Great company but terrible managers. If you are in good with management team you are safe, if not better start looking for another job elsewhere. Way too much politics."
good,"Cisco is a very fast and stressful place especially now with all the changes and yearly layoffs. The expectations are very high and the compensation does not align with the ask of the employees, especially employee who have been there over 10 years."
good,"Interesting and relaxed working environment ."
good,"Very difficult place in which to work if you're not a blue-badge employee as there is no career plan, perks. Red-badge employees are not given much in terms of context of the projects that they are supporting. The company allows employees to work remotely all the time, but this creates other problems. One boss that I worked for, I never had a face-to-face meeting with, for over a year. Everyone is constantly fearing layoffs at the end of each and every quarter."
good,Good place if you want to start your career. Management is not that great. Funding is usually challenge. Constant pressure on job security. Promotions are tough
good,"It was a good Job to gain good experience. Unfortunately the contract position with no benefits, employment uncertainty and Long shifts with my situation and a new baby at home this was not a great fit for my situation."
good,"Good work life balance and nice friendly environment with colleagues."
good,"Typical IT sales organization; no unique culture. Obviously, they have very good products, but I would not want to work there again. Good experience to build resume."
good,"I enjoyed most of my time and my co-workers at Cisco. Unfortunately it can be easy to lose track of how you are helping the company being a smaller cog. I had 4 managers in 5 years. The last one was more concerned with advancing his own career at the expense of stability. Cutting and slashing budgets wherever possible regardless of whether it caused problems. Once problems arose he would blame others, (see: Me). Somehow this worked and he is a Director while I am looking for work."
good,"Cisco is a big company. This means that a lot will depend on which team you are on. Some teams have great flexibility, others mandate you to be in the office 5 days a week. The same is for managers. There are some truly great leaders and some horrible ones, and your success and job satisfaction will heavily depend on that. In general, people are great at the company with most willing to collaborate and support each other. Compensation is not on the level with competing companies and performance measurment process is absent as of today.  Benefits are good, with 4.5% 401K matching and good discount in ESPP program."
good,"Cisco is a very large company. Hence, it is easy to get overlooked. During my time there, advancement was limited by a good-ole boy system. My focus was on my team rather more than impressing my managers."
good,"Flexible timing and employee friendly rules"
good,"Not willing to give info, I do not believe this should be required in order to use this job board, my reasons for looking for a job are mine and mine alone"
good,"Cisco is a good company as technology jobs go..I had a good career as an engineer..when I moved to a non-technical job, as a  service lead, and approached the 50 year old mark, I, like others, were targeted for age..The hardest part of my job was a poor manager, who gave no advice or 1-1's what soever..The most enjoyable part of the job, was collaboration with mutliple groups on a daily basis..handling escalted issues to resolution...if management and age targeting were not an issue, I would still be staying..."
good,Average work day consists of collaborating with fellow coworkers to progressively work on projects assigned to us by the Supervisor in charge at the time.
good,"expectations for influence on others outside the organization are unreasonable.  compensation is great, benefits are great, and ability to work from home."
good,"I worked for Cisco for a very short time in the early 00's but was laid off as part of a large scale workforce reduction.  I would have loved to stay, but we had entire teams laid off."
good,I allowed me to learn as much as i could and carry on this knowledge to other endeavors. I was able to walk in with little to no experience and leave as a mid-level Networking Engineer Consultant.
good,"Able to pick up a couple new skills sets. Typical workday come in check emails, check projects, work on AI's, staging, next project in que. "
good,"There is a large cultural gap between the veterans and the new hires, but overall Cisco is working to close the gap. Cisco is a great place to start off your and learn new skills and value."
good,"Good facilities and work culture"
good,Need to retain and promote red badge employees.  Transition to new positions when contracts run out.  Not commit to them that they will have position for 12 more months then pull the rug out.
good,company culture is good overall. However problem in management in managing contractors. Management does not seem to care the contractors. At least this is the team I was in.  It depends the team and manager you have. I heard a couple of teams that managers treated the contractors like employees.  It is luck.
good,"Every 3 months some re shuffle and re org ,news about downsizing etc ,project cancellations , gr8 place to work if we are not worried about job security and growth."
good,"For big companies like Cisco, experience can't be generic."
good,Company is losing share and lacking a viable way forward.  There is no CTO and the corporate strategy is lacking.  Cisco needs a fundamental reboot if it hopes to be relevant in 5 yrs.
good,"Pay is good, but make sure you are networked to all the movers & shakers.  If you are not good at ""politics"" you may not want to go to Cisco.  "
good,"I was very excited when I first came to Cisco and have to admit to some disappointment.  The division I work for here in Austin maintains a 60/40 contractor to employee ratio so converting to full time is exceedingly difficult regardless of performance.  There's also annual layoffs every August which is a serious moral killer and a shut down for two weeks every Christmas which is very hard on those 60% contractors who miss half a months pay during the holidays."
good,A large company trying to get back on track.  Trying to get into cloud with mixed results.  New CEO still trying to find his footing.  Very flat organization.  Long hours.
good,"Typical day at work mostly focused on finishing tasks at hand.  Always pressed for time due to hurried Agile cycles. Depending on the team you work  with, the co-workers can be great to be with or sort of you get by with. Hardest part of the job is convincing the management that you are worth keeping on, so your job does not get outsourced. Enjoyable part of the work is focusing on the work and seeing that it is being completed and  being used."
good,"Back in 2000, Cisco had such an entrepreneurial spirit, challenging folks to greatness.  Over the years it has provided a wealth of development opportunities with the ability to take on new roles and learn so much. Over the past 5 years though, the yearly (and even quarterly) limited restructuring have created a challenging environment/culture.  "
good,"Work was challenging, the company tries to connect with employees, but building relationships across the company can be a challenge due to the subgroup culture; but not not a bad environment just takes a minute to get used to."
good,Good place to work with. Just want to move back to NJ. It is good place to learn and be challenged. The Management Structure is weak though in the group I currently work with.
good,"Expect a lot of changes. Continually. Depends on the team you work with. Some people are too competitive, and there are teams that are fun and supportive."
good,"Big organization - hard to make quick and meaningful decisions.  Old processes that do not work in current days."
good,Great work-life balance but the company is not as creative as others.  Constantly laying off people.  No strategy and at times chaotic.
good,"Light job duties, more responsible on going, details focus. Most new hire employees under contract with agency and difficult to become a Cisco employee."
good,"Fast paced environment; and team environment. smart people engaging to share information and best practices. Must be able to juggle multiple priorities at once, and be flexible and open to continuous change."
good,"A fun Place to work, use to have free drinks"
good,"Good place to work in terms of people and culture but compensation and growth is not as expected. "
good,"Often had to check email at 10pm to make sure I was prepared for next days meetings that could start at 8am."
good,"Employees I interacted with were fun, intelligent ""nerdy"" types.  Great international teams though required unusual work hours/needs."
good,"Depends on the teams you work. Have to stay focused on your career(layoffs occur anytime). Some team gets good projects. "
good,"Depends on which team you are in. In general old school management, lack of energy. Too many middle managers."
good,Not bad place to work. They will lay off at any time. They are doing layoffs last 4 years
good,"Cisco was a great company to work for 13 years ago, but as the years past working a a remote campus became poor. The sense of a team fell apart and we feel isolated."
good,Very good work culture and work life balance. High probability of lay offs and very slow growth
good,"As long as your job expectations and objectives match what Cisco has defined, you will be fine. What made Cisco an exciting place to work was that your co-workers had your back and shared knowledge. Now many aspects of your job are now out sourced, your co-workers and manager rarely see you as they maybe located in different states. Expect frequent management, reorganization and job title changes. Constantly being scrutinized and micro-managed is to be expected. Also moving within the company is very challenging as you are either ""too valuable in your existing position"" or ""not meeting standards"" due to job satisfaction which is the reason you are looking for a change."
good,Structured company into Security and peripheral services.
good,L'azienda sta soffrendo i cambiamenti del mercato e la diminuzione dei profitti registrata in questi ultimi anni. Grande enfasi ed attenzione viene posta al processo di forecast e al raggiungimento dei target di vendita.
good,"Cisco is a great place to start your career.  However it is not a long term job.  You will be overworked, you will see hypocrisy on a regular basis from the leadership.  However the resources they have and the level of talent you can learn from make it a great place to start your career."
good,". Benefits are great"
good,"Very fast paced environment requiring after office meetings till mid nights. Colleagues are somewhat helpful, but not everyone is fully sure of what is the desired outcome. Hardest part of the job is managing unsure situations, enjoyable part is the full mobility through Webex tools, allowing you flexibility."
good,every day we had new things to learn
good,"Busy workload, good team, overall good benefits and good company but hard to grow within a small department"
good,"My first manager there was really good, so they laid her off. The next one was a total amateur. There was a Sr. manager involved as an adviser on all projects who thought that you motivate people by being rude, condescending, and just plan ugly to everyone. I was brought in because the person who did the job before me was going to quit, because of that manager. After 9 months I was relieved when they ended my contract. The technology and processes were good at Cisco, but they expected you to walk in the door knowing all of their processes. They weren't written down any where. Sorry I did not get my implant at the door."
good,Flexible hours
good,I began working at Cisco right off of college and I enjoyed it.
good,"good company, pay is ok. Management is ok. Most co-workers are ok."
good,La subsidiaria fue perdiendo la motivacion y la cultura.
good,Cisco may be good at their core competency of enterprise hardware but they know nothing about the consumer electronics business.
good,Challenges were very interesting. But its Dynamic nature of working push hard and demand more. Heavy competition at every step of your ladder. They offer a very good compensation.
good,"Great opportunity to learn, transform and perform. Channel culture and teammates are very professional. The most enjoyable part of the job is helping partners to meet their goals and deliver value to their customers"
good,"Great place to be an FTE, or to get your feet wet in IT as a contractor. Do not buy anyone's X amount of time to hire line. Contract to hire conversions are political and based on who you know, not what you know (like most places--this isn't unique to Cisco). A lot of people in infosec or networking spend some time at Cisco at some point so it's a great community to be a part of for future jobs/networking opportunities."
good,"Fun workplace to work at and you will learn a lot from other engineers, working in the labs are enjoyable and you will keep bust with the different tasks that you do."
good,"you have permanent night shifts and you do have fixed working hours however it is stressful, actually we are a third party vendor for Cisco and paid for Altran"
good,Cisco is a very large company. You'll need to work with a lot of people to get things done. Very fast paced as it's going through the transformation to software subscription. The company is not very diversified. Decisions were made in a short time and sometimes not going through thorough consideration.
good,"typical day is no slow and steady."
good,"Sweat shop - early morning calls with east coast, late night calls with India"
good,"Be expected to learn the lay of the land on the ground running, working autonomously as training is not provided. "
good,The company offers good work/life balance to employees.  Work usually requires engagement with multiple stakeholders from various functions.  Managers typically are hands free - you owe your own job to get it done.
good,"I like working in Cisco Voice Engineering for the fact it's ever changing and the challenges are enjoyable to work towards."
good,Unfortunately due to Cisco change in strategy from hardware sales leader to software and subscription model life at Cisco was lived quarter to quarter as layoffs were common each quarter for those business units that didn;t fit the new look. It made it hard to concentrate on work when you were busy updating resumes and making new contacts for an eventual layoff.
good,"The company offers interesting tasks and opportunities to learn, however, they are known for their routine mass layoffs which create an uneasiness work culture."
good,"I was looking forward for more career growth , which did not happen."
good,"Cisco’s business model is to buy hot startups, nurture them to capture the market, then if your product is not growing 100% a year, cutting back every quarter until the product dies is brutal on productive employees.  "
good,Every 3 months there is a hiring freeze and your job is constantly in review. Productivity then suffers and the culture reacts and work quality suffers.
good,"Cisco required you work as many hours in order to get the job done.  Being salaried, I was not eligible for overtime and would work many late nights in order to get the job done."
good,"The experience I gained at Cisco will prove to be very valuable as I continue my career.  But at a price, I worked over 12 hours a day on average just to accommodate standard business flow (customer meetings, interactions, etc) and then having to deal with the sheer amount of administration and internal governance required made for a daunting experience.  You will leave there better informed and better equipped for the outside but at the expense of sheer burn out.  I was a contractor so this may have just been a case of squeezing every dollar's worth from the hired help. But my blue badged peers didnt seem to have it much better."
good,"Its ok, dont expect anything special. Its like most other corporate environments. You are not special unless you work yourself to death and can be easily tossed out when they decide to do something different."
good,New team and needs to be open to change in order to grow and move forward. They need more team building as well as peer to peer training. Managers need to discuss more of improvement for the Team.
good,"Cisco is an okay company. Some people like a work environment like Cisco's, while some don't. It's just normal with any company. Just wasn't a good fit for me."
good,Good work culture and good place to work if your are on permanent or direct roles of Cisco. Being on contractual roles does not give you many advantages as compared to being on direct roles.
good,Cisco is a sweat shop.  Promotions are hard to come by.  You may need to quit the company and return.  Benefits are good and pay is a little below the industry.
good,"I found Cisco employee friendly, but frequent leadership changes, layoffs and change in priorities sometimes takes away the motivation of seeing the fruit of your work."
good,Learned som very positive things but also learned what not to do.  Lots of politics and often more concerned about perception than work being accomplished.
good,"They have a large portfolio and expect you to know it so make sure that you are interested in the products/ services. "
good,"I was allowed to make make decisions but things are now changing. Depending on the manger job will determine how much time to be spent or recognition received."
good,"Cisco's culture is positive - the company has many employee-friendly benefits and there's a general sense of unity across functions. Like any big company, each employees experience is unique to his/her direct manager and peer team. In my years at Cisco, the majority of folks care about the company and each other. "
good,enough opportunities to grow and have work life balance. Overall a good place to work. Leadership management experience depends on the business unit you are working for but lately lot of job insecurity concerns as frequency layoffs.
good,"Depending on what department you work as a contract consultant, the culture can be upbeat and wonderful vs. just another working pool.  Some have superb leadership while others have lackluster leadership.  Cisco is inconsistent and for contractors, they pay VERY POORLY.  Lowest rates always. They have been offering the same rate for the same job for about eight years and always claim they don't have the budget for more.  Not ethical, nor competitive."
good,Worked for Cisco twice and was laid off twice. Don't think I will work for this company again. Management can make a huge difference in your team and how things work.
good,That's is a really sad story of the successful product that has been killed/ended by the huge and successful company as Cisco shortly after Cisco has acquired booming and profitable company and its product.
good,Had the opportunity to work for a great manager and enjoyed my time at Cisco.  Senior leadership lacking in providing direction and stewardship of the company as indicated by corporate results.
good,"My direct manager has ZERO people skills, emotional intelligence, and terrible at communication. She would go through the contract holder instead of communicating with me directly.  She demonstrates poor leadership.  "
good,"The mission and vision from the upper leadership is clear and right. However, there is too much noise caused by middle management (politics). The morale of individual contributors are low due the psychological safety issues and poor advancement opportunities."
good,"My years at Cisco were filled with great learning experiences. I changed roles several times and had the opportunity to learn a lot about services distrbution, global alliances and partner incentive programs."
good,"A great product organization and has great people. Org dynamics changes here very often resulting into disruption. Lots of new innovation and works are being carried out and strategically it's well poised."
good,Cisco management has no clue how to run a tight engineering company to maximize profit.  They get great margins because they got into the Network equipment arena early.  But they clearly know nothing about engineering except for silicon design.
good,"Uncomfortable degree of churn due to shifting priorities, often resulting from political stuff going on in California. Local, on-the-ground management was relatively powerless and the executives in San Jose were disconnected from day-to-day realities at remote sites. It's a common story."
good,"Comprehensive  leadership changes from the CEO down has lead to a number of strategy changes, with no clear long term plan for success. Excitement and Morale among employees has been on the decline."
good,"I was an employee at Cisco for practically 3 years. I worked on several projects in their UC division. The people were good, and the job's were challenging, but the management was very difficult. I tried to get on as a direct several times, but was never offered a job. They pay well, but have a very narrow definition of what a productive engineer is. The company has been going down steadily since John Chambers gave up his office. Cisco is still a Titan in the IP industry, but if it doesn't change it's employee hiring criteria, and get some solid talent in their ranks they will continue to decline."
good,"I had started to work with Cisco  in the mid-1999's and it was the best job i ever had. I left due to immigration in the early 2000's  and my Visa ran out. It wasn't so much that Cisco could get any more time. The INS locked us out and Cisco tried to keep me there but they could not."
good,Great place to get your feet wet when first entering into the job market. I left because of how slow the management was to enact ideas as well as the constant reshuffling of leadership.
good,"If you are interested in a telecommute friendly work option, Cisco provides a good flexible workspace. Meeting heavy culture. A typical day of work would start with global meetings with different stakeholders groups located in different time zones."
good,"If you are a contractor Cisco doesn't seem to care for you"
good,"Pros"
good,"They say they value work-life balance, but management only wants workaholics that are willing to devote exorbitant unpaid time towards the job.  They don't give engineers sufficient time during a regular workday to complete all necessary tasks, so overtime is necessary to complete workload requirements.  The webmeeting product is a shitshow of old spaghetti code, and almost none of the topmost-level engineers can explain what it does or should do.  The people were great, but the majority of them were extremely unhappy with the job, we all just liked each other.  Sales pushed management to usher products to production well-before those products were ready to be sold, with most products still needing rigorous QA, or simply lacking the options noted by the sales people during the sale."
good,No security of job. No clear direction or roadmap for many projects. Most work are R&D and shelved because of poor marketing and inability to get clients who will purchase the solution. Multiple reorgs causing confusion.
good,"Simply put moral is low with layoffs every quarter and layoffs spread over Sep, Oct, Nov 2017 this year.  People are becoming disillusioned of what used to be a great company.  10 quarters for declining revenue does not help.  The attractiveness is working from home and as an Engineer working for the largest Vendor in the world."
good,"Cisco is a sales organization masquerading as a tech firm. It acquires technology and products through acquisition, re-brands them poorly, and then sells them through channel partners that already have switch and server deals. Technical people will be frustrated by constantly changing direction, reorganizations, and the regular reduction in force events that paralyze employees with fear for a week a few times per year."
good,Project helped me to understand Cisco Advance Service selling model and the business needs. Good opportunity to learn next level of Cisco offerings. It was very heard to convince a manager if he/she is not clear about the project deliverable. This project given me good opportunity to work with Senior Leadership and visibility to grow my career.
good,"Great job with great perks. "
good,"Great experience at Cisco, opportunities for advancement.  The only reason I left is because of the economy crashed and things got shaky because companies stopped buying because the banks weren't lending"
good,"Networking focussed company, need to have strong networking fundamentals, productive and fun work place to be in, good work-life balance,good-colleags"
good,"When the ratio of contractors to full-time employees is 3-to-1, there is trouble in paradise. Programs/initiatives are started with great zeal only to be cancelled a year (or less) later. Job security is laughable. Reports of layoffs only include FTEs - no mention is made of the number of contractors let go."
good,"Cisco is one of the best company I have worked for if you want to pursue your career in Networking field."
good,Operations is not appreciated at Cisco.  They are the first to lose budget and some of the most important in the company.  They are not treated like any other organization within Cisco and I would not recommend working there.  No visibility into issues and my current manager would rather go to bat for Sales than his own employees.
good,"Good place to work, depends on the manager, department, some are more productive than others, "
good,"You work with some of the best people but it is hard to get recognized when management keeps changing the organizational structure - get lost in the shuffle."
good,Good workplace culture but tough work life balance.  Workplace culture gives many opportunities to grow your expertise and network.  Management style can be too micro-managing.
good,Good company with benefits and relaxed work life balance. But too much restructuring happening every six months. Only some organizations in the company better for growth than other ones.
good,"For a person who contracts with Cisco for several years, they are a good company, great people but they have layoffs every year. they lose good talent and then rehire new people just because they need to cut costs. I can't say much about the benefits. The departments do not know how to budget and when year end comes, many contractors are out of a job. The vision of the company is changing but management does not have a grasp on how to set it in motion.  They continue to buy companies instead of spending the money on area of security, data centers and the infrastructure development.  "
good,"Working in 2 unique areas, learn new technologies and have all the toys. The prob is because its unique, your head is on the chopping block when its time to save money"
good,"Very difficult escaping fully from work. It is assumed you will be available for late night / early morning meetings to accommodate people in other parts of the world, which of course needs to be prepared for or tasks followed up on afterward. If you are looking for a reasonable home life, look elsewhere."
good,"While the project was a good one for rolling up sleeves and collaborating with strong players, the program came to an abrupt halt after just five weeks and budget cuts."
good,"Productive working place but no diversity. Some group use old technology and has no requirement for innovation."
good,"Too much outsourcing and management politics.  Employees are no longer hands-on.  No real direction from upper management, just general discussions about what we need to do but it never equates to a strategy or stated direction.   Upper Management has series after series of meetings that resemble Talk Shows, but never really get down to strategy and operations."
good,Work life balance is good. Hardware team is very small compared to Software. Cisco seems to focus more on S/w front and outsource most H/W development.
good,"It is a good company, but if you are a contract employee expect your assignment to be ended without previous notice."
good,"If you live and work in San Jose you are probably okay.  If you are acquired (like more than 200+ companies Cisco has acquired) like me, it's not so great.  Lack of opportunities, site strategies (IE closing locations other than San Jose), consistent change in Leadership and direction, new leaderships ideas of re-structuring (blind decisions not based on facts), lack of transparency just to name a few."
good,"The salary wasn't bad at all and the work/life balance is nice given a 8:00-16:30 shift pattern."
good,"Too many politics with too many SVPs."
good,"Not a fan of the politics of the companies this size. This was not a great professional experience, there was very limited opportunity to learn and people were not very welcoming. The culture and thinking are rooted in a team of Cisco employees that have been there way too long."
good,They are a good contractor for the tech industry.  They have low oversight regarding daily tasks but are there to support their employees with any issues.
good,ambiente lavorativo ottimo con i miei ex colleghi di lavoro..
good,"JCI GWS was acquired by CBRE in 2015."
good,"Cisco is a good place to get experience and work for a world-class organization. Lately, leadership is not top-notch and employee morale is struggling."
good,Cisco is a leading company in the valley and has a lot to offer. They are strong in Unified Communication and routers and switches. They grow through purchases of companies and integrate the technology into their core competencies. They have continual layoffs.
good,"With a good manager, Cisco is a great company to work for with decent pay, good benefits, and a generally pleasant culture.  Managers are given a lot of freedom, so a bad one makes the job very difficult and hard to escape."
good,Cisco is a company where you can have a good work/life balance but this again comes at the price of career advancement and compensation. The flexibility is amazing and it really helps when you have kids who are small.
good,"Cisco has exceptional teams hard at work on overcoming legacy challenges and remaking the business into a future-oriented enterprise. That is demanding, difficult, and sometimes requires heroic effort. But most Cisco rank and file engage the work with skill and optimism. "
good,"Cisco Systems has evolved since its hey day in the early 90's. It's still  one of the biggest names in networking gear for the rest of the world but in the past 10 yrs has slowly loss its charm both to Wall Street as well as main street. The brand isn't as strong as it used to be. There are plenty of other vendors to go to for less."
good,"If Cisco acquired your company, you should be better updated new technology and find another job within 3 years. If you are not going to update new skills, you are out date. It will be your hard-time to find the job."
good,"Cisco is a great company in terms of its achievements and strength in the market but from my 8 month experience at the company, the management skills of many managers are lacking. This could be due to a possible non-existence of leadership courses offered to those who have been at the company for a long time and have gained their management positions over time without any coaching or management/leadership training."
good,"Cisco is great on work-life integration, but they tend to hire management and upper management from outside the company, rather than promoting from within."
good,"Great place to learn new technologies and working in a multiple vendor delivery model"
good,"Cisco is basically a good company with a strong product portfolio.  However, it has had to adapt to a much slower growth rate.  The management has stagnated and there is little growth opportunity."
good,"I worked for CompuCom, a ton of politics, didn't get very much benifits that actual Cisco employees get. I did not feel like part of Cisco's family but more as an outsider since i wasn't with Cisco directly."
good,Co-workers are great.  The culture has suffered with what seems to be annual layoffs.
good,"Hardest part of the job: Managing politics within silos of each team"
good,"It's a great company if you like large corporations. If not, then you will dread feeling like a number. Very hard to get fired, there are a lot of people who landed a job there and do the bare minimum because of that and the fact that if you excel it will most likely go unnoticed with the exception of an eventual advancement/pay raise. It is what you would expect out of a 70k employee organization."
good,Cisco used to be a really great company to work for. The morale has gotten pretty low over the years with the layoffs and the company restructures. If your in sales then it's a great company to work for.
good,Great company if you are lucky enough to have a great manager.
good,"There is a wealth of information and people are willing to help. Getting a good manager takes luck, though, if you do get a good one, life balance will be a priority.  While here, I learned a great many thing; as there are a lot of opportunities to learn and to gain certifications."
good,"Flexible work schedule"
good,"ZenSar Technologies is providing average salaries and even after performing best,i didn't receive the appraisal.Policies are not good."
good,"Cisco is a high-technology company going through continuous and necessary change, held back by turf battles and a short-term focused business model.  The leadership would like to be more responsive and agile, but wants a silver bullet, and there are too many 'cooks' with not enough leadership vision.  "
good,"Great working environment , knowledge sharing within team, cool campus, extra facilities provided to ply."
good,"Cisco Systems was one of the best places to work for years. They were the leader in many facets of computer networking, had an excellent group of leaders and visionaries, attracted the best and the brightest, and treated the employees as treasured assets."
good,"The marketing team needs re-built."
good,Have worked here for 2 years and feels like I could have done better than this company.
good,"- Typical day: Meetings over webex"
good,Good company to work. Flexible working hours. Good management.
good,"Most of my day was spent managing multiple calendars and schedules. I quickly learned to 'go with the flow' and to always be prepared for anything at anytime.  No matter how much time and effort had gone into something I was working on, I always needed to be prepared for everything to change and most likely in the final hour.  After working at Cisco for the last 5 years, I learned how to manage my time more effectively and accept assistance from others.  I was able to grow not only as an individual, but as an assistant as well. What I loved most about my time at Cisco and still dearly miss are the people and the friendships that were created there.  I worked with a lot of tremendously talented and kind individuals.  I will always feel grateful for my experience at Cisco."
good,"Changing culture, lack of advancement potential."
good,"If you work full time for Cisco it is a truely wonderful experience.  However, Cisco primarily hires contractors these days, and they are not treated with the same respect.  Contractors are regularly left out of team meetings, are not eligible for on the job training, can not receive work incentives offered to other coworkers, and work for roughly half the pay with no vacation, no sick days, no benefits and because of winter holiday and company wide shutdown contractors are not paid during the month of December which makes Christmas time extremely financially difficult."
good,"It was one of my best jobs, I didnt like being at the phones but it did pay my bills so I did my best to an an outsting agent."
good,"Has some good points and some bad"
good,"Advancement difficult unless you're hand-picked and then you are fast-tracked regardless of your competency.  Majority of the employees (~75%) performance is ranked as ""satisfactory"" which means no options and no raises.  COLA are unheard of unless you're moving between organizations or are part of an acquisition.  You can lose money working there.  There's constant pressure to be available.  Emails sent at 9, 10, 11 pm requesting feedback are common as is working at home in the evening after leaving the office at 6 pm.  "
good,Work queues via HPOV program. I have learned and continue to learn the procedures in Warehousing and distribution of products.
good,"Overall, Cisco is a great place to work provided you belong to the ""club"" due to so many friends being promoted instead of the people who really deserve it."
good,*A typical day at work begins with reviewing emails and calendar for scheduled meetings; prioritizing and working action item lits; and collabrorating with particular teams to obtain progress or resolve issues/concerns related to the particular item on the list.
good,"On the engineering side of the business, the intensity and innovation factor is very high. Dynamic work environment, fast-paced -- and great people. When you go to the support services side, the intensity is greater, the workload high, communications among groups is iffy, and if you are a contractor you may work 60 hours a week, however, you will only be paid for 40 hours! Projects start and stop, are put on the shelf for a few months, then restarted again with the same expectations and nearly unreachable goals"
good,- Opportunity to work with some of the finest talents in business development & computer network engineering.
good,a typical day at work = 8am to 7pm
good,-Learnt a lot working for Cisco.
good,"I worked at Qualcomm for more than a year"
good,"You are thrown into the deep end of the pool on day one, expecting to figure out how to get started, how to get the software you need, who to talk to for badges, etc..."
good,"sin duda es un ambiente laboral estresante pero a la vez muy satisfactorio por todo el aprendizaje de este cliente tan exigente."
good,"Pros:"
good,Cisco managers expect a very high level of functioning from employees and contractors - it's not a place to slack! Bring your A game and be prepared to stretch yourself.
good,"A typical day working on the GE Team with Cisco was basically monitoring the CEO's daily meeting schedule. Other than that the management structure in the Austin Area was really not people oriented, it is not a work-life balance type of company to me."
good,There isn't must to say / review about this job. To me it was just part of the journey / requirement to get through my schooling. I'm just writing now to fill in the minimum character requirements.
good,Good work culture. Good place to learn. Multiple opportunities. Work life balance.  Decent pay. Good cafeteria. Multiple employee benefits. Fun place to work.
good,Work-life balance was off from time. I would highly recommend if you are only interested in maximizing opportunity in technology. Meaning technology products.
good,24yrs at Cisco and have held many jobs in that time frame. Learned alot also watched the transformation with the company over the years. Work loads can be heavy and alot of project schedules heavily demanding of your time. Not a lot of management support for training and learning the skill sets to accomplish goals set.
good,Great place to work with opportunities in many areas.  Can be challenging to complete work when most of your day is busy with meetings. Enjoyed working with many highly skilled people.
good,"Sold cable in retail stores. Walmart, Best Buy, sams, frys and other entertainment retailers. I also went to Louisiana to work in Alexandria all in all I enjoyed the job."
good,"Cool Work Culture,"
good,Cisco can be a good place to work depending on the team you are on.  But they need to start treating contractors equally and give people a fair chance to convert.  Too many full-timers are taking advantage of contractors because they know they can't go to HR to complain.
good,"wide range of product and multi location team"
good,The algorithm brought up this survey. Please disregard this portion of my profile. I have worked with Cisco networking product for almost twenty five years.
good,Join at startup style environment. Then management of the BU was changed. Then become traditional Cisco working environment. You need to fight for the job assignment.
good,Experience will vary with management. Middle management can be great or make it miserable. The company also regularly has layoffs so you will constantly be looking over your shoulder.
good,"The great place to work, for stable and stagnant work life. The work-life to social life balance is amazing also long as you finish your work. The demographics are skewed to the Asian mentality. There are older people and millennials."
good,good place to work and grow.  oppourtunities to learn and develop outside your comfort zone.  people are typically happy hear but does depend on your manager and leader.
good,"Can be shared during discussion with interviewer or HR in detail, overall cisco is great place to work but with lesser job security and multiple layoff,s."
good,"Overall great work/life balance."
good,"I was actually a contractor via two different companies during my tenure at Cisco.  I enjoyed the work, but was disappointed not to have the opportunity to become a regular employee."
good,"-Extremely supportive coworkers (the most helpful people I know) -The benefits are amazing - not just 401K/PTO/Health Insurance, but Cisco has so many continued learning events and resources, 5 days VTO (volunteer time off) to give back, employee resource organizations to get involved with, on site gym (with awesome classes) and healthcare facilities, plus a lot of on-site events to promote cross-collaboration with other..."
good,"Un dia tipico en el trabajo en Cisco es la libertad de hacer tus propios pendientes a tu ritmo sin embargo en algunas ocasiones se crean problemas innecesarios por la falta de comunicación de parte de los manager realmente ellos no saben lo que las personas a su cargo están haciendo o trabajando en el momento, solo tienen una idea general por lo cual al momento de pedir apoyo no son de mucha ayuda."
good,"Cisco is a great company for work life balance, but career advancement opportunities are limited. The compensation is lower than most companies but the benefits are good"
good,"Excel at your job, then get let go. Very political and unpredictable.  Highly toxic at times and disorganized...sometimes managed by fear...some benefits are good"
good,"Chuck needs to do some more cleaning. Lot of mafia/groups, cant get anything done. Lip service for collaboration but each bu for themselves and no doubt competitors are chipping away from different fronts"
good,"Cisco is a great company and provides great opportunities for professionals with the right technical skills. However, it's very hard to be promoted from within, so make sure you negotiate your salary well before joining."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was the restaurant meeting lots of people working on different projects. I did learn a bout diferent technology that Cisco was involved
good,En su época fue una de las mejores maquilas de Ciudad Juarez
good,Fast paced but I enjoy working with the level of tech minded people there.  It's ever evolving and they are Cisco for a reason.  They know their business and it's a great place to work.
good,"Average Management. I actually worked under a subcontracting company that provided the labor force to large businesses, performing customer service functions. Management was fair."
good,"Plenty of experienced people to guide you."
good,"Overall, my experience was very positive."
good,"Working on interesting products, with smart and talented people from engineering, UX/UI, technical marketing engineers, sales and customers."
good,I have nothing to document or comment on about this company/employer. It was a place to work and a regular paycheck that is all I have to say about them.
good,"Cisco is focusing on transitioning from a hardware seller to seller of software for the hardware. While there are numerous business groups working on similar product lines, there are good projects if you can find one. The focus on customer driven engagement is pretty good."
good,"I have been working for webex operation team for the last two years as a contractor. Cisco has two types of contractors; SOW or temporary. For the Temporary contractor; it has a 18 months ceiling. After 18 months if Cisco does not have an opening to turn you to permanent position then you have to leave regardless of your job performance. This policy does not provide enough job security for contractors. For the working environment; there are many Indian co-workers in the team; the operation team is a 7/24 three shift rotation between Indian oversee team and the local team. The workload is quiet heavy as Webex supports huge customer base and many data Centers, You also need to be a fast learner to work in the team since there are many different components in the systems and also requires to work with other teams to resolve issues."
good,"Práce pro Cisco mě naučila samostatnosti a sebedisciplíně, protože můj management sídlil v USA. Dozvěděla jsem se více o nových technologiích a pocítila amerického ducha v Praze."
good,"Unfortunately, Cisco has definitively become a layoff company. That said, it's a financially solid and wealthy company so it can offer good benefits and opportunity for advancement as long as you don't get stuck in a dead end organization that frequently cuts headcount nor is motivated to help you succeed. In such an organization, most managers are scrambling to keep themselves alive while the layoff culture permeates from the top down. There are strong orgs within Cisco, however, that have deeper pockets so are less under the gun to reduce headcount when the word to cut costs gets passed down from the the executive leaders."
good,"Good company to work , but being in the same role for long time sometime makes you feel bored. You learned the complete software lifecycle . Good concept of ownership."
good,"Cisco is a very process oriented which is a benefit when running larger projects and trying to keep different functions accountable. The same process is sometimes stiffing, to some extent individual PMs don;t really own the business and be made accountable."
good,Flexible working place. Working cultures are based on divisions and teams. Typical high-tech corporation style with many changes. There are rooms for individuals to learn new things.
good,"Compared to other companies, Cisco provides EIC a higher salary over ""free"" amenities. I think it is important to recognize that Cisco allows you to purchase the granola bars YOU want, vs. them providing them to you for ""free"""
good,"Always feels the lack of trust between departments and information withholding. Many hardworking, motivated people, but so far it seems sweeping changes wear everyone out and all are on edge."
good,"Working in the payroll department at Cisco is fast pace with long hours. Maintained and processed payroll information concerning garnishments, tax levies, medical benefit deductions, research missed payments and over payments to employees.  Assist in the preparation of W-2’s and year-end reconciliations for Payroll."
good,This was way too long ago to properly review. Great place while I was there but was impacted by first Cisco layoff. The whole communications division was let go and merged with Enterprise
good,"Intense, at times rewarding, sometimes challenging. Many opportunities to learn, to personally grow. Sometimes too much politics. A lot depends on your manager"
good,"Was able to balance work and personal time as I was a remote worker.  "
good,"Provide assistance to the sales team through contractor.  Young, fun team.  Had to prepare weekly/monthly reports as per team sales.  Working as a third party was difficult in getting things completed in  a timely manner."
good,Working for Cisco is a good inbetween for contract workers. There are always temp projects going on and short term goals for departments. I enjoyed by temp time there but would never work there full time.
good,"I used Cisco equipment in one of my past jobs but I did not work for the Company. I actually got the Certifications while studying and in order to get a job as Network Engineer, but it was very difficult to get one without experience even though possessing the knowledge. Thus I started moving away from Network and focus on software which I like a lot. If I'd have the opportunity to work on Cisco a Software developer I would do it happily."
good,"Your experience depends on what group you are in. Some groups have good management. Some groups have average management. Some managers are demanding, they can you on personal cell phones at 10:00PM even if you are not on call. Not sure why most good software managers and technical leads do not hang around for more than a few years."
good,"Friendly atmosphere."
good,"Hands on experience in hands on experience in refining global firewall, enterprise proxy and edge connectivity services to efficiently manage important control to diminish threat"
good,No comments or reviews for Cisco as I worked as a student consultant on contract bases so do not have enough experience or information to provide a review.
good,"Stable company, good work culture, allows remote work. Bureaucratic at times and things can take longer than they should to get done. You may or may not get credit for your work, especially if you are at lower levels of the organization."
good,"First Job"
good,"good place to start.. tho cisco is still recovering from the 2000 dotcom crash.. its shows in it's kind of panic to drive new projects."
good,"Good company to work. Good work life balance in few of the BUs but not all."
good,"Cisco has so many business groups within which makes it good to move around.  Cisco is always ""right-sizing"" so need to beware.  Many locations and if you have access to the data center equipment or training, a great plus."
good,"Cisco is a big company. It has a lot of money and has become a place provided by aged technical people. Even if its work life balance is good and its work pressure is low, people in my group are always under pressure of lay off. And sometimes, management will not choose the best way to judge employees and to properly promote good employee and lay off bad guys."
good,Cisco is a place where there are a lot of meetings. People collaborate with Cisco's technologies like Webex and telepresence. You are typically allowed to function remote as necessary.
good,"Cisco is a great organization and provides all the necessary tools to be successful.  "
good,"CISCO is undergoing major struggles to adapt to these times, whilst being at work, they changed direction and left 6000 employees out, even senior valuable technical personnel as in ""in depth knowledge"" of technology.   Being the new kid on the block I tired to show my value, by developing (on my time) a platform that would have saved 240+ engineer's 3 to 4 hours a day in capturing data to perform the job they were hired to perform, saving close to 8 mill US dollars a year, but CISCO wasn't buying even though it was convenient.,  it is disappointing to see that one has shallow chance to move/advance career forward.     Has CISCO been a stable work-ground, I'd probably have better things to share, at the end of the day it is CISCO."
good,Cisco is trying to change their business to generate more revenue from services. They acquire companies for that goal and lay off to keep same employee count.
good,"Good PLace to work if you are permanent employee."
good,"Empresa del ramo de telecomunicaciones"
good,"They hire only contractor and the ones that have been there for years have their nose stuck up their parts.  I liked the pay but its an empty office, only contractors show up"
good,This is a team that cares about employee happiness.  They work hard to find optimal solutions for employee retention.  Project timelines were flexible to ensure success
good,"Cisco is one of the yesteryear technology giants that is struggling hard to compete with newer giants like Facebook, Google, Apple etc. Its a good place to work but do not expect anything awesome"
good,"na not m uch to say, "
good,"Good working environment, some times too much work. Good working environment. Learning experience is good. Healthy environment to work. management is good and supportive..."
good,"Cisco was a dynamic place to work in the 90's and early 2000s.  It became a very political place prior to my departure.  I valued the relationships that I had fostered with the sales teams, engineers and executives"
good,this is a good place to be I'v been here for about 5 years since i was a fresh grad and now i work in another technology that was completely new to me but its all good
good,There are few weak points in working there but in overall it is good place to work. I learned a lot of thing about IOT technologies. I think it is good step in career.
good,"Extremely competitive workplace, long hours, never really ""off the clock"". Very stressful, management issued unreasonable goals and expected them to be achieved."
good,Working for Cisco once was a proud moment. Now every 6 months Cisco has layoffs. Employees at Cisco always feel that there is a sword hanging over their head and it may fall on them at any time.
good,"Lots of politics, lots of the right hand not doing what the left is doing.  All of the decisions and priorities are made so high up the hierarchy that the managers and individual contributors have no say in what they should / could / do."
good,"-Plentiful resources are provided to further education"
good,"Cisco is a great marketing company, whose hardware technology has improved over the last few years.  They are not a software company and an expensive option for services.   Successful employees are forced to look out for the themselves, which often causes conflicts with other employees, partners and customers."
good,Have Agile meeting every day. Must meet target determined by the team leader. Everything is regulated. High technology and powerful machines. No permanent job position for a long time. Only hire consultant. Not enough project to work. I left before the department shrink.
good,There is a good balance between persona life and work. The people are nice to work with but the environment is not very stimulating. The culture should embrace change.
good,"Cisco offers a lot of facilities and benefits to employees for entertainment, well-being and networking. However, there is not much in terms of challenging work assignments and career progression is slow"
good,"CISCO does not enforce their own policies about family or personal issues. In my case I had a major back surgery and was threatened with being let go if I took too much time off to recover. Then my son had a major life threatening accident and was told ""I didn't need to take care of my son"" regardless of being a single parent."
good,"There was bad management in the end and lot of favoritism"
good,"A typical day at work was to login , start with the days activities. Nothing crucial or on time submission . just a cool 9 hours of work with leaisure time too."
good,i didnt really enjoy my job here however i didnt hate it.  it wasnt really all that great but it was busy enough to make the days go by.  really a lot of the same thing day to day.
good,"OK kind of company. OK benefits and opportunities. Industry leader , multiple teams and spread across timezone. Daily latenight meetings and weekend customer calls."
good,Need to keep in touch with employee more for better understanding of job site situation for better service and support.  This would keep the client/services have more effective/productive.
good,"Management works hard to find a fit and delivers, however, their small size became quite noticeable when working a project with representatives from larger services with greater resources."
good,"I rather not give any impression about my time at Cisco. I have work for this company for over 2 years one as a contractor, and one more as an employee."
good,It was a good company. It was like working for a government job. The culture was relaxing and there was alot of red tape. Management was okay and varied.
good,"For me, I work across geolocations; getting up early to host a scrum meeting with one India team.  I normally has two or three teams in India. At day time, I work with a) product manager to discuss feature related issues that engineers have during the design or implementation; b) work with other team leads in San Jose for design discussion/integration discussion...c) I may need to do prototyping for certain solution and give guidance to engineering teams in India.  I normally own the design if a feature is completely new add-in to the product because I want to control the quality of design.  I also do some implementation of the product if they are critical to the system or at least I provide prototypes.  At night, I have to work with the lead engineers in India to 1) resolve any new issue they may have, 2) give them suggestions on how to solve certain problems they encounter...  I normally have two demo meeting at night, one with the engineering team (for each two weeks Sprint), and one with product manager to get his acceptance of our implementation.  The fun part of my job is that I connect to different people every day which gives me the opportunity to sharpe my people skills, leadership skills, influence skills... The hardest part of my job is to adapt to the dynamic changes of marketing requirements or customers requirements during each release.  I have to make a right decision on whether or not I should say ""Yes"" to product manager when a new requirement comes in the middle of implementation or convince product manager the other way...The most enjoyable part of my job"
good,"This was formerly Scientific Atlanta, acquired by Cisco and a slow decline in the video industry led to it's sale to Technicolor.   No longer exists so certainly not worthy of pursuit."
good,"My manager was really inexperienced and can best be related to a lieutenant in the military that just commissioned.  Power hungry and didn't respect the experts around him.  Due his shortfalls, and instead of correcting them the SMEs were asked to compensate.  This threw additional workload on the team decreasing productivity. Globally, Cisco is a great company,"
good,"balanced work and life & Poor management"
good,"Would not necessarily recommend being contracted at Cisco. You are not offered decent compensation, benefits, time-off, etc. Culture is great, very laid back. There is not typically great job security being contracted as well."
good,"innovadora, liderando cambio de la tecnologia. Brinda todas las herramientas para alcanzar los objetivos"
good,"Have not opinion about opinion of this company...worked for Cisco Air Systems, not Cisco Routers,  Need 53 more characters to get out of this screen and finish up"
good,"During my tenure at Cisco, the company grew from a hungry competitor to a behemoth with its fingers in every pie. The official position became, ""If we can't be number 1 or 2 in a market, we will not be in that market."" Their reputation as ""The Borg"" is well-deserved."
good,good stuff here.  there is a lot of work to be done in this transformation and lots of smart people to get to the work done.  The biggest asset is the people!
good,"Awesome collaborative practices"
good,"start early "
good,Cisco revnue is going down and it lay off people multiple times every year. A lot of people at cisco is worried about their job.  Cisco needs to innovate and improve working environment
good,I have enjoyed playing different roles at cisco and built expertise in different domains. Learning is the best and enjoyable part of my job. Hardest part was the slow pace in career advancement.
good,A lot of us were laid off due to the company we were supporting severed ties with customer. Milestone was not really proactive in trying to help those laid off find other positions.
good,ils sont sociable accueillant et tres aimable on se sent bien
good,Cisco did an exemplary job of on-boarding a senior team to lead the introduction of products into specific vertical markets.  This enabled an effective collaboration of knowledge as specific projects were targeted.
good,"Almost constant ""re-organization"" and lay-offs definitely have taken it's toll on Cisco as a once great company to work for. No longer a place you can make a career at. The work doesn't lessen while the workforce is reduced."
good,good work life balance and  finance is good place to work and esplore data driven projects . Imporoved my data analysis skills and  also BI skills rewuired for Reporting
good,Productive workplace but no recognition and consultants are not treated professionally. Projects are good to work on and give great exposure to diverse team environment. But only full time employees are given recognition.
good,"Lately Work life balance has gone for a toss, now it is work work work and constant pressure to do more with less and the fear of limited restructure looms around"
good,Great Company going through a significant change. Be resilient. Always Network. Be mindful in Sales you live one quarter at a time then it starts all over!
good,"nothing new, same routine work nothing much to learn after an year or two. otherwise other facilities are so good and ofcourse very good campus.not big learning curve for all"
good,"There are a lot of people who work remotely for Cisco so there is a great deal of flexibility with hours. I really enjoy working remote and my direct manager is awesome. The company culture feels like an 'every man for himself' culture. There are a ton of contract workers (myself included) and the contract workers are traded around teams and laid off on regular intervals. The pace is slow like most large companies. You don't really feel the impact of your work to the bottom line, but that may be good for some people in that it's less pressure. "
good,Cisco is very well known in the market as a leading networking company.  A typical day at Cisco was working with the channel partners to renew their end user SmartNet agreements.
good,"Company changes direction tactically, affecting many positions. May provide short-term benefit, but damages company in the long term."
good,"Contracted position many years ago.. was treated like a contractor .. not a great experience. I can not remember all of the details, just that is was not my most pleasant experience."
good,Cisco is a nice place to work with. Friendly people and management. But it often comes to the point of ambiguous when the business decision has to be made.
good,"No technical vision from senior leadership"
good,If you are a go getter then Cisco gives you enough opportunities to prove yourself and innovate.  Employees are trusted with their time as long as it yields results.
good,"Great people.  Great vision.  Good opportunities for movement. Excellent cafeteria. Flexible working environment. Best part of the job was that there was always something new around the corner.  Hardest part of the job, the uncertainty that came with each new quarter."
good,"Strategy is stuck, they are focused on core only and they don't understand how to proceed. In my opinion, if the strategy is to grow the business with customers, we must understand our customers' business.  Recently Cisco has cut all of its industry-knowledgeable people in both product and services sales.  This deteriorates Cisco's ability to be relevant and therefore will lose sales/revenue because the buying decisions and budgets have moved to the LOBs. Management or Leadership doesn't seem to see this - very shortsighted and similar to an ostrich sticking its head in the sand.  It's sad."
good,"Interns are free to explore, not unlike other service industry companies where you live and breathe as your client demands."
good,"Its a good company for starters but as time goes there is lot  uncertainty of Job security. "
good,"very good environment. "
good,"Cisco has a changing environment and continues to strive to determine what they want to be - everything to everyone; a hardware company; a hardware and software company."
good,"Out of business out of business, no longer in business< why do we have to rate companies that are"
good,A lot of great people to work with.  If you are lucky enough to be converted from a contractor to a permanent employee there are great benefits and programs to support the employees.
good,its an ok place. i am having a good time. fun place to be has ok growth potential. more sales focussed organization. i do not have anything more to say
good,"Cisco is an excellent company to retire from. The work/life balance is great for parents, and there is virtually zero pressure to complete work on-time or ""correctly."" Since the culture of the company skews older, many managers are empathetic to last-minute PTO requests, and extensions on deadlines are always viable. This means that there is no expectation to ""crunch,"" which can be a great relief to anyone who's about to burnout from the fast-paced software industry."
good,"Cisco is large organization with huge manpower. Here  I found all the latest technology used as solution to IT. "
good,"due to layoffs company morale is down, certain managers should not be in the position they are in. good benefits is what keeps employees loyal."
good,Decent place to start your career. Mostly laid back culture. Fun place to try out new technologies. Flexible work hours for most of the times in the year.
good,"They're a work at home and multi-tasking culture."
good,"Cisco is a great company to work for if you are looking for a good balance between work and life. It was once a fast growing company and now it is a stable traditional company. While the day to day work is still fast pace, senior management decision making is rather slow. "
good,The technology either acquired or developed inside Cisco is truly great.  The organization is a bit of a broken play and is going through a lot of industry and culture changes.
good,"Pros: "
good,"Flexible but job security is not good. Lots of learning opportunities."
good,"While this is a very professional and efficient workplace, it was not a role I chose to pursue. This is a corporate setting, and involves zero public interaction--this is the only reason why I could not continue."
good,I was working across multiple teams and managing conflicting project requirements was tedious and led to more meetings than there should have been
good,"The office reflects your typical San Francisco office. It's probably one of the best, offices in the Bay Area with great employee perks. On the flip side, the company culture resembles a college fraternity. If you are not friends with the correct people, it will be very difficult for you to advance your career, whether it's based on merit or not. I don't believe that this office is diversity friendly."
good,"Good place to work, kept busy. hours were reasonable.People were pretty easy to get along with."
good,The company is currently restructuring and this makes for a very unstable strategy and confidence in the job role is now lacking.  With a new CEO and leadership team there has been a lot of shake up and morale is starting to suffer.
good,"Please understand, that since this is so long ago, my comments would be outdated."
good,"->  Set up the test-bed."
good,"Work days were long with 12 hour shifts spread over 3 and a half days.  That meant you then get 3 a half days off so two thumbs up for that.  Every one had to rotate to night shifts every 3 to 6 months.  Only downside was there was no benefits whatsoever and management was non-existent until your metrics fell out of line, which sounds great, however, if you needed guidance, management refused to offer any guidance whatsoever other than to ask Tier 2 which they are mostly too busy to assist.   The buck stopped with you. Yourself or their intranet was your only source of guidance. New technology is always being released with no training with only a massive page install guide as your reference, sometimes lacking pertinent technical documentation.  Too many passwords that required constant updating for each customer network every 30 to 60 days.  Doesn't sound like much until you realize you support over 30 customers.  Outsourcing jobs to other countries."
good,"From my experience, there are two main items to keep in mind:"
good,Learned a lot about release management and Safe Agile and implemented it. Manged multiple releases and worked and release manger and program mamger
good,Loved the flexible work environment but one needs to be ready to work anytime and anywhere.  On-going restructuring and no job security.  Competitive but emphasis on calibration across various organizations which was very fun to work with.
good,I worked with a solid team at Cisco that was highly educated and dedicated to their work. We had a great manager which was the main reason that I stayed at Cisco for so long.
good,"Very mobile driven"
good,"I have a lot to be thankful for while being employed at Cisco. The working environment in 1994 was great!!! Over time, as with most companies, that grow, the work environment and management changed."
good,"Wonderful co-workers "
good,Work culture is not at all pleasant. Too much overload of work and no appreciation for the same. That is all I have to say about the company.
good,"Once a truly innovative company, in recent years Cisco has grown primarily through acquisition of smaller companies that are doing something right with their products and services, but Cisco doesn't take time to learn from these companies to benefit from what they have learned and what they have found is working with their customers, so it can be properly institutionalized into Cisco's culture."
good,"A typical day at work has atleast one webex meeting with either an immediate team member , or offshore team members, or clients located in other parts of the world. "
good,"Worked directly with fellow financial analysts to enable cost codes in Oracle software and System Integrator for booking intercompany and adjustment entries."
good,"Not a bad place to work, learn, and grow, but can get static and feel stale and repetitive after a while. Also, a lot of changes and restructuring that can make it difficult to think long term."
good,Yearly ratings were pre-determined so no incentive to excel.  Management is out of touch and manages to numbers and not people.
good,"Fun work place with good  management. Lots of red tape, and you have to work hard to expand your potential for growth. This is a very competitive company to work for even as a contractor, though I believe this is to be expected of a large company."
good,"-  Work from home facility"
good,"Cisco quit caring about the quality of there products and more about out-sourcing."
good,"Its a good place to start career. Good learning and very solid mentors to learn from."
good,Some people don't get their salary merit increase three years in a row.  This makes the morale in the work place low because people are unhappy and jealous of their co-workers.
good,"Cisco is a strong, credible engineering company for the past 20+ years. It has (and still has) many top talents in engineering. However, due to deeply rooted ""portfolio company"" culture, some business units still use waterfall style for development, and they don't bring in new blood and new skills. This makes product development very slow and effective. in many cases, they are behind the market."
good,Cisco is a good place to work.  It is very diverse and offers a flexible work environment. It supports community volunteerism.
good,This is a very nice place to be in. But I work thru a consultant and the  management in Cisco is relatively easier to work with than the consultant I am working for.
good,Nummi pays very high to interns. they try to convert interns to permanent employees. i heard benefits are also very good
good,"Working for a large aerospace company can be a great way to gain wide experience as they, if they are successful, have projects in every technology area."
good,"Beaucoup de travail"
good,"Different work culture in different groups, its like companies within a company. Process Oriented, any change takes a lot of time."
good,In Cisco Systems I have learned people management. Management is good in Cisco systems.My co-workers are supportive.
good,"Roles and Responsibilities:"
good,"I worked for and with many good people at Cisco. There are many opportunities to gain experience, but advancement is limited. "
good,NDS is now part of Cisco. Its mainly involved in EPG. As an intern i got an opportunity to build a feature and was well appreciated for the same.
good,Typical day is very constructive at Cisco. I have learnt a lot working with the team at Cisco. The management was good and so were the co-workers. The hardest part of the job was owning a complete component and working on it. The most enjoyable part was having flexible timing
good,Productive and fun workplace. Lots of challenges with projects and people. Managing people during difficult times etc..
good,"In addition to good work and personal life balance, you can expect good opportunities for growth internally."
good,okay company. too many Indian contractors. very biased company.
good,"i liked the flexible timing and virtual meetings ,Onshore offshore model and learnt a lot."
good,"Great place to work, people are very nice. Flexible work hours and plenty of parking available close to buildings."
good,It is fun working here.  I feel any documentation should be given more priority and importance.
good,"Cisco is a huge company. I have worked across multiple teams, functions and timezones. Overall, my role(s) entailed bringing people together to track work progress. In this, the opportunity to build rapport presents itself. Not only is this important in the success of any project but also in one's career. I've had the pleasure to meet great people and build stronger relationships."
good,"great salary and benefits"
good,The great part of the job is being in contact with the end customer; that gives me a better insight into what they need and how can I help them.
good,"Interim personnel  is about connecting with people. For this reason, I like having a very personal, face-to-face experience. The fact that we'll always need to have the face-to-face experience keeps me motivated in always being the best of the best with my customer service attitude.   I like the that the company is always growing in the way they use technology to play a significant role in the way people connect and relate in today’s world. I appreciate that the company has made it a priority to keep pace with the latest innovations and trends hitting the market."
good,There are a lot of egos in middle management that interferes with getting things done and the long term benefits of the business.  Many deliverables are prioritized based on squeaky managers that don't understand or refuse to know the benefits.  I had 10 managers in 3 years and 2 months so I was never in a position where anyone knew my full potential or the history of the organization.
good,"Here i started my career and worked as interim employee. "
good,"A great opportunity to master your skills and get paid well but the cultural expectation is to do exactly your job, as you are told with no questions. Internal promotions are few and far between unless you're someone's hatchet man. Benefits are great."
good,"great place to work"
good,"a) Inept management makes work tedious."
good,"Cisco is a well run organization.  It is a demanding and fast paced job with large quotas and high expectations.  It is a sink or swim environment.  If you swim, you will be well compensated.  It is not for everybody."
good,Company has focused on cost reduction opposed to innovation. Above average company to work for.
good,"I have to do daily morning report. Update report if necessary."
good,"Overall it is a great company to work with."
good,"Typical big company."
good,"Good Company to work for, except they lay off a lot. Senior Management is set at where they are, it is the little people that get effected."
good,I believe that management is divided in groups of people that favor one another and will only helps those with whom they have worked before or they have helped before. Difficult to advance only on merit unless you are part of the good ol' boys club.
good,well recognized company. political environment. not much room to grow.
good,"Management shifts throughout department and unstable. Inconsistent with raises and not guaranteed one on a yearly basis for outstanding job performance. I stayed there for the flexibility, but there is not much opportunity to grow, unless you hop jobs within the company."
good,"Good company at the time i was working there, but unless you rotate frequently your experience tends to get compartmentalized"
good,I basically worked from home most of the time managing my customer accounts with minimal or no supervision. Learnt a lot of Project Management skills.
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"I loved getting the experience of a large multinational Fortune 100 company when working at Cisco.  However, overtime, constant reorganizations and layers of middle management meant that priorities were moving targets and thus obtaining measurable results were difficult.  The compensation and benefits were pretty nice, in my opinion.  The culture, while changing, did value disruption and doing the right thing regardless of the current trajectory.  I found advancement opportunities limited and with recurring layoff amidst record quarters the job security has really been at an all time low.  Even though there could be long days and late calls with partners and teammates in Asia partners, that was balanced with understanding and flexibility for personal time."
good,Cisco is a fast pace high tech company. They have top talent and there is not much room for dead wood. The place can by chaotic and management is schizophrenic. Lot's of unhappy folks and a high rate of voluntary turnover.
good,"Managed project for the implementation of a cloud supplier collaboration platform. Designed process for the proactive inventory site balance module; benefits include reductions in execution time (75%), excess/obsolete inventory (10%), and lead time attainment (1%)."
good,"A typical day is 9 am to 5 pm."
good,"Le poste était surtout s'assurer d'avoir la base de données de l'entreprise mis a jour. Parler quotidiennement  avec les commerciaux régionaux et les commerciaux sédentaires, suivre les procédures et les règles standards de l'entreprise. Les comptes éteignent  diviser par secteur, je travaillée dans le secteur commercial."
good,"Cisco is still a great company to work for, though it has become fairly process heavy."
good,Very busy days with lots of priotizing your daily and weekly tasks. Lots of data analysis and critical thinking. Learned the supply chain process in a build to stock model and then a build to order model. Management lacked some leadership and needed to build a team as well as level load the work load. Co-workers were very click-ish. Perm's clearly made a dinstinction between contractors in my department only. Hardest part of the job was the lack of process improvement. The most enjoyable part of the job was constantly learning something new.
good,"It is a good solid place for a software engineer to work."
good,"Cisco is a solid company to work for.  If you want to learn and have opportunity to move around, it's a great place."
good,"This job is good for someone that is just starting out in IT. It allows you to get your feet wet with lots of OTJ, by acquiring new skills that you can build upon for the future"
good,I learned a lot about corporate marketing and also was given a lot of unusual task like restructuring the marketing department's asset tracking system. 
good,"Good balance  in life and work.  As other corporations, work culture depends on which group you are working in."
good,Yet to form an opinion so i do not have mych to say.  I have only been working there less than a year.
good,Work culture is different in different divisions but generally its flexible and family pro.
good,. Signal Integrity validation and improvement
good,My day starts by sorting all in coming mail and processing.
good,Another case where I worked for a start-up that was purchased by a big company. I left shortly after the aquisition.
good,"Right out of undergrad I was fortunate to get a job with Cisco as a Software Engineer. Once joining the team I did, it consumed my life, which at the time was ok. I was taking it all in, learning all the technology I could, since Cisco has many different technologies. Once I took in all I could the job got dull since I had to take on just one of these technologies."
good,I am learning that how to be in companies and unity of working
good,Software products and concepts MUST be expressed in terms of hardware that may be sold (the “appliance model”). Here is the software development life cycle:
good,- Learnt more about enterprise development
good,"Cisco is a great company to work for, but the last couple of years have been down. Cisco needs to get back to the innovation machine it use to be just 5 years ago"
good,"A typical day: Working for 7 hours supporting Cisco Products, learned more about cultures and technology"
good,Great place to work. Always meet friendly new people with great attitudes.
good,"I go in around 8:30 am each day. For someone in the generation Y, I would not recommend it. New college hires usually leave after 2 years due to the lack of work and attention upper management gives to them. The co-workers are great but as a company, it seems like they're always penny pinching. The most enjoyable parts of the job are definitely the people and the ability to telecommute."
good,Seems like they dont care too much about the working hours
good,"It is a good company to work in for industry recognition and you are able to learn a lot about management or any other aspect of personal growth, in addition to the job opportunities that are available."
good,We are team of about 12 people working in Networking security area.
good,In my 6 years at Cisco as a consultant I can say that I have been lucky approximately 50% of the time with my managers and team mates; but other 50% of them time-were times where I truly regretted referring friends to join Cisco as contractors.
good,"Proud and previlege to be part of Ocean called Cisco, Commitment and workenvironment"
good,"If you in the start of your career and you're more interested in software instead of hardware part of the niche, I don't recommend choosing this company. Everybody has been too comfortable, and the management has been terrible inside my pod of the business. Also too much politics to me, I couldn't handle."
good,Cisco is a classic large old school technology company. Many people have worked there for years with stable employment.  It is a value stock and good for those looking for stable employment. Things take a long time to make happen and politics can be a bear.
good,"Work and Play Hard"
good,"Management is good, but too much work pressure, No job security.  You will be soaked in work for at least the first couple of years. Better be prepared to work a lot."
good,"I am a project worker.  Cisco is a dynamic large multi-national company that is constantly trying to change how it operates.  As a result there are multiple projects that continue for years before being canceled and reworked.  Obviously they are budget oriented but because making a decision to move forward with any project takes so long, often those working on projects just sit around waiting.  "
good,Focus is too tactical when it comes to hiring. The big picture is not well shared to provide a driction and perspective. Contract employees and marginalized and kept away from fuller picture of business objectives which hinders performance and inclusion in team spirit.
good,"Unrealistic account assignments, alignment and quotas imploded the Minneapolis market. It rolls downhill quick when managers can't hit their targets. You can learn a lot of valuable industry knowledge working here."
good,"My superior gave me a lot of opportunities to  grown with them.I enjoyed working here."
good,The management in the department that I worked didn't know how to treat their employees. No respect and talked to you any kind of way like they were above you. The overall company was wonderful. Really enjoyed my time their outside of management.
good,good place to work as long as you have a good manager and salary. I worked for TAC and the environment was good.  The director was not good and the new manager was a micromanager.
good,Working remote is the only downside to this company. I really like the management team and all the co-workers I’ve met. I think the salary could use some readjustment.
good,"Cisco es muy buena para quien trabaja con IP, VoIP o Data Center. Para cualquier otro equipo o producto, no existe soporte interno, la presión es demasiada y llega a ser agresiva. No existe entrenamiento a los ingenieros de soporte en elementos fuera del core business."
good,"Cisco used to be a great company to work for before it completely globalized. Cisco awards its blue badge (permanent ) workers. It treats contractors like trash. At any given time, you can lose your job (even your entire department) on a whim of the management, who is always changing their minds and shifting people around. Red or Blue Badge, your job is always in jeopardy. The culture is not as toxic as some companies, but the concept of disposable people should prompt a wary interviewee to watch their step.  If you are young and work cheap or work around the clock, you will do well - at least until they find a cheaper alternative."
good,nothing good or bad to say at this time. Cisco is  not a bad company to work for just show up to work on tie an do your job. That goes with any job so.
good,Nice to Work in the company. My team is especially good but it depends on which team you are working. People around me are very good in what they do and are happy to help always.
good,"Was great, then not so much, maybe getting better again now?"
good,"Great place to work, flexibility, the people are great and the location was convenient. There was a lot of training and communication with the higher executives"
good,"Annual restructure disrupts business and lowers morale. Poor leadership. People are put into leadership roles based on their performance, not their ability to lead."
good,"- Most enjoyable part of the job was the flexibility and balance of life. It let me work from home."
good,"Culture is good. Hope gym is free.  "
good,"CISCO allows for amazing growth, learning and encourages employee innovation.  Benefits are fantastic and the people are great to work with."
good,"High talented and passionate set of people to work with."
good,"Peers are great."
good,"Overall a good company, but the future of some BU's is in question ... and management seems to be keeping the ""plan"" close to the vest, even after recent LR's.  In this regard, the silence is deafening, and is leading much of the top talent (assuming they survived the LR's) to explore other opportunities."
good,"If you work at Cisco, you're going to learn something new every day.  You'll work with some of the brightest people around.  "
good,It is a challenging place to work but can be rewarding. You can learn a lot there and will have to do so. It can be fun. They will ask for a lot at times.
good,"* Every day is a roller-coaster ride in operations"
good,Belt tightening leads to minimal advancement opportunities.  Cisco is more concerned with recruiting new talent than taking care of current employees.
good,"My responsibilities consisted of creating complete and concise recommendations to customers regarding many different aspects of their network."
good,"Cisco is overall a very good company.  As an employee you have opportunities to work across many domains.  It does take a certain type of person to work there though.  Constant change, Lack of security, mgmt culture, etc.  I feel fortunate to have worked at Cisco but it was filled with positive growth opportunities and at the same time limited security."
good,"Good work/life balance. Not much else. Managers on some teams are fantastic, on others, you wonder how they have lasted there so long. Work experiences can differ greatly depending on what team you are in."
good,"15+ year veteran, have seen the culture degrade.  I would still recommend it as a company to work for, and if you're willing to make specific sacrifices, you will be rewarded.  "
good,"Good place to work in."
good,Organisation is good if you get motivated Manager. People around you are friendly.  To adjust with manager. Added new opportunity for business for growing.
good,"Good place overall"
good,"Worked as Unix/Network consultant for 1.5 Years ( Bangalore)"
good,"It is a secure job to work, and Cisco is a profitable company. While promotions are solely based upon individual up to a certain level, the amount of opportunity to create and develop new software is minimal. Count on spending your first five years here fixing the bugs that were so hard that nobody else could figure out before you. And the more senior engineers are making more bugs for you while you are at it."
good,You could learn a lot of things here. Management usually is good. The company reward you if you do a good job. You need to make much attention to details.
good,"A good place to work with good work/life balance. I worked on a team that treated everybody very well and with respect. Though there were opportunities for cross functional learning, the execution of creating an atmosphere where this could proliferate was lacking."
good,"I worked as an On-Call receptionist/staff assistant for Cisco Systems, Inc; because I was on-call, I didn't get to take advantage of the perks/benefits that are available to their full-time employees however, the office was very fun and active. There was always free food/refreshments to partake of; and the people in the office were very friendly."
good,"challenge people all the time. very high pressure. but if you can handle them. you feel sense of accomplishment."
good,I don't understand why i should tell you about my current employer. I love where I work and it provides a way for me to pay my bills and take care of my children. I enjoy networking with people from all over the world. My co-workers are amazing and they make it a joy to work with. I have learned alot
good,Cisco is a very large IT company and there is a lot of good opportunities to learn about how a large IT Company runs. good balance with work and life working for Cisco.
good,"good place to work with great WLE, but one needs to take care of one's own career. Lot of tech learning possible. Management is a bit disoriented in strategy"
good,"Great place to learn and build upon a career in IT, or begin a career in IT. Fast pace environment with variably heavy workloads. Would recommend if some one really wanted to stay at the very top of the industry."
good,"Good Side: Cisco has a good benefit package and flexibility to work remotely, Cisco offers a verity of trainings which are really good."
good,Very similar to working at EMC. Can easily get burned out. Your contribution and impact to the overall company is minimal but held to very high standards.
good,"Working through a contractor, I had no holiday pay, no sick pay, no vacation pay. Working while sick is a miserable experience."
good,"Got opportunity to learn Cisco router architecture and their configurations."
good,Last minute requirements.  Lots of office politics.   Non-FTEs are working like in a factory model.  Lots of inefficiencies.
good,It is a good company to work and learn networking. One must have a goal of learning more when at Cisco because it is a big company and can lose sight.
good,Cisco is still a relatively good company to work for.  It is not as good as 15 years ago.  A success mature company needs visionary management to carry out wise and effective evaluation/optimization routinely in order to preserve company's well being and be competitive in the market place.
good,I am an ASIC/FPGA Hardware Engineer.  It is a tossup.  You could work in a tough group where they ask you to work 24/7 or you could end up in a group that is an easy job.  Some groups let you work from home all of the time where as others they want to see you every minute of the day (even if you are not doing anything).  There doesn't seem to be any break through designs that you could work on.  You mostly end up working in old product lines that evolve slightly and it has incremental changes made to them.
good,I felt the company was too lethargic and everything moved very slowly.
good,Receiving cases through internally created system. Based on priority all cases required technical layer 2 and layer 3 assistance. Administration and strong customer orientation required.
good,"The people at Cisco are some of the best that I have ever worked with. They are very professional with a very good work ethic. "
good,"End to end project management, Quality Assurance"
good,"Cisco culture is changing, you need to have you resume ready at all times because layoffs are imminent  every year. Good flexibility. Promotions are difficult and nearly impossible to move around."
good,"•	Performed all the nonfunctional tests: Load, Stress, and Performance, Fail Over, System Scalability test on Cisco Videoscape Product such as NDS Unified Headend System, VideoGuard Server System, Video Back Office System for various cable television businesses"
good,"Cisco is a good company to work with. From the past couple of years of work, it gradually became routine work that I need to make a change."
good,"Working at Cisco Finance gave me a great introduction to a relatively fast-paced workstyle.  The contract was presented to me as more data-heavy with some knowledge of finance; the reality was the opposite.  Cisco expects you to hit the ground running.  They provide online training for contractors and training sessions for new full hires.  Help files and tutorials are all at your fingertips, but if you don't know where to look, help may not very difficult to find, even if you ask multiple people.  The company leverages a solid communications backbone to provide seamless real-time communications among all of their worldwide offices through online meetings, email, and instant messaging.  I was not used to this environment, so it took me a while to become comfortable.  Our office was also an open plan with all of the positives and negatives associated with that kind of space.  My co-workers were very friendly and very helpful."
good,"Good Learning for new joinees"
good,It was a very flexible environment to work in. The culture of Cisco made it easy for collaboration across different expertise.
good,Nice place to work with good people. Slow work pace with good benefits.
good,Typical day at work is run the business and assist in escalations.
good,"a big slow growth company, but it is with a flexible working time"
good,"The good:"
good,Used to be a great company. Changed in the wrong direction especially in last 2-3 years.  Too many distruptive changes...
good,Cisco has been a good company but has extremely limited room for growth beyond Senior Engineer levels.
good,fast paced. execution oriented. global teams and iniatives. lots of change. management inconsistent.
good,"Problem – For existing software, start with a systematic, diagnostic approach to configure the project which can be scalable in terms of Enhancement of Application and flexible to incorporate the new technologies."
good,"I worked with Cisco for more than 13 years for some talented people, doing really cool stuff. In that time it proved to be a very dynamic workplace. The company and leadership played to my strengths as an employee, so I held compelling positions in a variety of different disciplines."
good,"Opportunities to work with the latest WLAN gear can be fun and challenging. There's not as much structure as you would think, at least not in the business unit I'm in. Always learning new things. Most people are helpful. You are always very busy and hours can be long. Pay is good."
good,Good place to work and learn.
good,I was able to work form home. I was giving an ip phone and a phone number so i was able to make call from the IP phone from my office at home. The commute to work was reasonable.
good,Collaborative space with freedom to innovate. Focused on the employee experience and many internal advancement opportunities. Culture and experience will truly vary by business unit.
good,"Don't use latest tech stack."
good,"every Friday has provide breakfast to employee and every Friday after 4 pm, employee can play some game like pool, ping pong ...etc."
good,"This is a small division of Cisco not really a good example of the Cisco environment and culture.  With the major changes in the executive team and global strategy that began in 2018 I believe Cisco is and will continue to be a great company to work for and do business with."
good,"Cisco provides a good salary and benifits and as a whole a middle of the road work/life balance.  Cisco is still a business and  they operate to be efficient and cost sensitive. Sometimes that can mean making hard business decisions with the employees just like every other company in the world."
good,"They say it's about the people,  but yet they do twice annual layoffs without trying to retrain anyone. Great flexibility and benefits, but that's it."
good,"I had a very dedicated team in which I managed in NA."
good,"Overall a great place to work. Good people. Talented people. But too many many people. Dedicate your first week to mapping out all the cross functional contacts that will help you succeed. Takes some time getting the lay of the land...its a big family, but a good one."
good,"Cisco is undergoing a significant change and transformation.   Current leadership is changing too much and the staff is scared and no one is truly trying to make changes because no one wants to stand out.   People that take risks are not rewarded, and in fact, if the risk is a failure they are fired. "
good,"When I started Cisco most managers were once engineers, which provided a respect between management and employees. As time went on, there were fewer management jobs for engineers and location requirements made it difficult to move around in the company for someone with roots in your community. Newer management had come from a non-technical background, which started an increasing divide between management and employees."
good,"Middle management changes during critical time impacted much on the original company culture. Plus the industry sunset situation, it may not be the best company to work for any more."
good,"Cisco is a good place to work.  Smart, nice people, lots of flexibility, good work/life balance.  Opportunity to move to different roles and learn new skills."
good,Good Work Culture But Management is not good because they don't understand employee personal life and the problems we face. They only need a person like machine to wok when they say you to work
good,"While Cisco is likely too big to fail, it is under profound competitive pressures."
good,"When you throw off $3M FCF every quarter, I guess it's hard to get too charged up about creating and executing top-class integrated strategy.  The temptation to accept good enough vs. innovate in the sales execution domain is apparently overwhelming."
good,"Loved working at Cisco, wish I could have stayed in my first position. Budget issues required reduction in Contract staff. "
good,"Overall good worklife balance"
good,Its a large company with many sub cultures within it. Some organizations and cultures within the company are start up like and fast paced while others move at a glacial pace. Due to its low growth advancement is slow for many thus there can be high levels of frustration.
good,We were required to meet our business sales goals quarterly. We were required to reach out to current and new clients for new business daily and document within their software. Business meeting two times a week with Regional Managers to discuss goals and whether we met or exceeded those goals.
good,"It's a big company with many talented, bright professionals throughout.  The company is going through transformation to drive recurring revenue and to have a portfolio that is tuned for current customer needs and expectations.  Over the past several years, interest in CX and UX has increased. Investment still lags other companies and is not uniform; some areas are turning the corner faster than others."
good,Cisco was a good company for keeping your training up to date and providing resources as needed. The managers were very busy and the company was always changing the structure around and re-aligining the reporting teams. Very unstable.
good,"I loved my job at Cisco, yet when it came to trimming down the workforce as it required to streamline. Unfortunately the company i worked for was an acquisition and i was part of the ""Limited Restructuring""."
good,"Jobs can vary a lot person to person, some people are stressed out and overloaded and others have more balance. In general, it's an older company. The management think they're doing more to get and keep early in career employees, but most early in career people I know leave by or within 2 years of starting at Cisco, and Cisco seems okay with that."
good,You go to Daily standup and give your status. Then you can carry on with the dev work and come back home once you have worked decently in a day. Perfect work-life balance. Easy Work from home option to avail as well. But to get a promotion is next to impossible. Great job security. Career advancement is on the lower side as you work in a slow-paced environment.
good,Worked in a company that was bought by Cisco. Management had no clue. Benefits were reduced and hikes were scarce. Would not recommend to friends. There is no job security.
good,"Very large company, provides great opportunity to get varied experiences.  Easy to continue and work in same function for many years. Make sure to plan your career and moves to get the  most relevant and progressive experience."
good,"Cisco is one of the leading company for network. Work culture, campus, cafeteria are awesome. Over all a good working culture. For freshers it offers relatively less package as compared to market but gives good growth opportunity."
good,"Overall it's a good company to work for.  However it depends on the group and the manager, you are lucky if you get to work in next gen technology group."
good,"Excellent work-life balance, good compensation and benefits but frequent lays-offs and constant org changes are stressful. Less job security. I love  4.5% 401K match although medical is bit expensive for family."
good,I was working for Insight Global contracted to Cisco TelePresence support. During this time I found the experience to be the best so far in my career. As a starting position it was more than one could possibly ask for. The pace was incredibly fast and stressful but the rewards were just as awesome. They bought us lunch at least twice a week and rotation was 3.5 days on 3.5 days off. So 3-12hr days and 6 on 4th. I would highly recommend Cisco to any friend.
good,"Large distributed work force. There are a higher level of bureaucracy and unresponsiveness. Almost all support processes are automated which can handle normal situations but cannot handle special cases effectively. Each group, even small one, is held responsible for its own profit resulting in silos and inefficiency (not willing to share cost/headcount for common support functions like maintaining office supplies)."
good,Great group of people but what used to be a yearly job security concern is now quarterly.  I both learned and gave much but there is too much stress regarding the future.
good,"There were a lot of perks with working at Cisco and it's a name that everybody recognizes. But with such a big company comes office politics and Cisco is no different, so moving up can be a challenge."
good,The people I work with on a daily basis are the best part of the job.  The exposure to new technologies and being given the opportunity to impact customers is really a plus.
good,"Great Work/Life Balance."
good,"Typical day at work. "
good,However the desire to maintain growth means job stability drops every year due to high cost of upkeep of the company. They're only recourse is to cut and gut positions continuously and maintain questionable contractor culture
good,Cisco is a good place to work. Wish opportunities and value are given to contract employees to retain them and pay them on par with regular employees.
good,I think Cisco has really gone above and beyond to create the perfect atmosphere for employee success. Implementing timeout zones and employee spaces to relieve stress or interact.
good,"Marginal hikes "
good,"NICE PLACE TO WORK WITH MULTIPLE OPPORTUNITIES ,good career growth .Management is very sincere and helpful.I have learned a lot from configuring to implementing on working on various platforms on Cisco Products."
good,"Cisco has a flexible, collaborative culture.  Open culture where you can work from home as needed.  Collaborative culture, people are really nice to work with and always willing to help."
good,"Very smart employees, great teams, great compensation, and company spirit, but lacks a singular purpose, vision, and agility."
good,"Flexible work environment. Good employee resource groups helping employees network, learn and enjoy working at the same time. Working on huge transformation initiatives globally, gave me the opportunity to travel and work across diverse cultures and regions."
good,I have been working at Cisco Systems full-time (For nearly 2 years). Continued Limited Restructures are causing talented individuals to be let go. Lack of strong senior leadership in some areas and poor decisions are being made.
good,Cisco is very flexible in its work culture and that is a great benefit. Challenge is company is going through a lot of churn
good,Cisco is very supportive of our work balance relationship between our work and personnel life.   We are able to work remotely from home which helps out the parents.
good,Cisco is a huge company and is very easy to get lost in the mix. If you work hard and you do your ob well you will be noticed. I was not a blue badge employee but was treating as the same.
good,"The pay is on the high side for the market. Cisco provides opportunities to take training. With Cisco always having layoffs or selling divisions, the job security is not very good. Management is not as strong as I expected from such a Corporation. A lot of good ole boy mentality. Flexible on work schedules. CEO gave himself a $10M raise and laid off 7k (guessing) people that year."
good,"Very Slow growth, but have plenty access to different groups and products. Fantastic work life balance , Easy access to senior management."
good,"Mileage varies greatly depending on your Team and BU.  I spent 15+ years on the Service Org.  "
good,working in this company is nice. I especially love the work culture they provide to employees . The work life balance which everyone craves is maitained.
good,"It's nice place to work, flexible timings. Implemented some soltuons to streamline business processes. Always good support from managment ti try different things. Some times it's hard to work with offshore teams as the meetings some times stresh to late nights.."
good,Had too much fun working here. Alot of challenges and ability to move forward that makes impact larger than you.
good,"Cisco has all the potential to make it big in internet of everything, a excellent networking company to work with."
good,"Great Place to work, people seem to know how to work in a timely manner"
good,should have been more proactive in seeking out other opportunities within the company
good,"I worked for Cisco for 18 years.  I started as a contract employee and was then hired as a permanant employee."
good,One of the strongest companies in the market that provides employees with compeititive pay and benefits
good,always looking for new opportunities and areas and markets to get in to
good,I learned many new Cisco related tools and worked with a lot of great people. I worked extremely long hours from both home and at the office. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work from home with somewhat flexible hours.
good,Over the years they have lost focus of how to motivate employees to feel thoroughly dedicated. Still a good place to work but they have an opportunity to make themselves a great and fun place to work again.
good,Great company with strong market share. Needs to infuse new ideas and talent to continue to evolve.
good,"It was a life changing experience for good to work with cisco. I learned a great deal about technology and networking. It was my dream to work for Cisco, which i accomplished."
good,"EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION - Ask any Cisco employee how they like their jobs, and you'll hear nothing but okay things. Cisco takes employee feedback year after year and continuously improves the workplace."
good,"Great company overall, but limited opportunity if you want to remain within GVS. If you cover the bigger accounts your role is more strategic, but the job becomes a lot more cold calling the smaller sized ""accounts"" you have."
good,The culture at Cisco is relatively refreshing and they seem to take care of their employees.  Although it varies from organization to organization and executive management.  I enjoy the team and people I work and overall I like the Company however the expectations are somewhat unclear at times.  I'm looking for a business partner not just an executive to support.  That would fulfill me.
good,Day to day the work activity is very productive and it is a busy place to work with offsite picnics and onsite fun events. The product development cycle is shortened that causes to work more aggressively. Great benefits.
good,Wide range of team cultures. Choose wisely. Some managers care more about dotted 'i's and crossed 't's. Others can be all about what the customer actually needs.
good,"Good work-life balance, can be a breeze to work with. Company is changing for the better, but still have a lay-off culture. Management vision is unclear"
good,"Work was a bit boring, mainly maintenance work.  Did not do any cool new innovation and software engineering.  However, i met amazing people and my mentors were truly great and made us feel welcome."
good,Way to much information to keep up with. Very fast paced environment. Very difficult to maintain a life/work balance. The product portfolio was very broad
good,"Cisco is a fantastic company to be in until the day comes when you are asked to leave, and they dont really need a reason for it. Its a simple re-org happening and they dont see you fitting the new structure, No matter how good you are, I believe its part of life and I accept it. What is not acceptable is that you are then on your own, there is no HR or anyone who steps in to help you find another job withing the Organisation. This clearly means the company doesnt care even if they loose good employees in this process. "
good,"My time at Cisco was valuable, however I would have wished that Cisco offered a more open work environment. I rarely got to work with anyone, and I thrive working with likeminded people. The people working there were incredibly smart, and I loved learning what I could from them. Overall it was a positive experience."
good,"They purchased a great company and stripped it of it's best.  All sorts of benefits and support when they first purchased NDS, but then once they had all systems in place, they began to unload personnel."
good,I enjoy collecting money for Cisco WebEx. I especially enjoy when customers get angry with me and want to fuss about what they owe. I enjoying helping those customers who want to understand how their payments were applied and how to reconcile their account.
good,"Overall great company. Good benefits and work life balance. Slow paced and lay off can be seen as negative. "
good,supportive management team. Good work life balance. Management supports working from home occasionally. Interesting projects and good collaboration between co workers.
good,"people can work from home "
good,"Typical day:  meetings with internal project teams and suppliers"
good,"For those who are looking for a place to wind down, spend time with your family and see little growth, this is the spot for you. Despite encouraging innovation and thinking differently, they reward those who play by the rules. Great people and a relaxing open culture will make it difficult to leave."
good,"Cisco has a ton of vendor/contract workers. Management takes a long time to promote within the company."
good,"Overall I love working for Cisco, my team is the best and I loved my role.  The Austin campus has very nice people and a great culture.  Cisco is a wonderful company that surely will provide excellent experience."
good,"Its been a very good place to work it, great  managers (6 out of 7 were awesome). Got to work with great teams in Federal, Commercial and Latin America. Culture is mostly good but sometimes you fell like no matter what you do its never enough, Not enough appreciation for the work"
good,Good work life balance but need to be fast paced for growth. Need to bring in new thinking to catch emerging transitions. The challenges faced are how to transition into a software company with the huge HW product portfolio.
good,"I worked at Cisco Systems, for a while, the people there were kind with me. But wasn't happy with the macro management they had. Overall the workplace was fine and very clean."
good,"started in the office or at home around 9 am or earlier if a con call with colleagues in other countries; wrapped up around 7 pm or later if a time pressing project is on hand, or on con call with colleagues or customers in other countries."
good,"strong company, focused on quarterly returns, learned to understand the company culture better; not a conducive culture for team players.  everyone is looking for their next promotion, how to position."
good,"Very corporate company, weak on REAL culture and opportunity.  Great for good salary and benefits though. If you want to actually make a difference or have equity, this is not the place for you."
good,"Cisco is a good place to learn a lot of things. "
good,"Cisco has a great culture, which is open and exploratory. It has great employee benefits and in general its a good place to be in. Just find your place and network well and you can go places."
good,"Relaxes environment, great place to work, good work and life balance, almost all the technologies out there are being implemented or POC'd at Cisco. Great co-workers."
good,"Heavy Data Analysis"
good,provides flexible hours to work which is very employee friendly and compensation is also good.
good,"Good work life balance and good management."
good,"Cisco used to be nice place, lately with layoffs every year, it is a very insecure place for anyone wants to build a career. One has to see overall benefits before working there."
good,"Working schedule depends on the project timeline. 50% is not that hard to catch. Company culture is ok, but slow compared to those new companies."
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"Great place to work in terms of life/work balance. "
good,"Overall, Cisco is a very flexible employer."
good,"Wonderful atmosphere, great culture, "
good,Lots of good work/life balance.  Great benefits and ability to learn new skills because money is plenty.  Managers are good but not great.
good,"Like my job. Good people to work with. Excellent workspace - macbook pro , 3 monitors , multiple linux work stations, windows work station etc ..."
good,"Even being the same company, your experience may be very different depending on the organization you work for. In general good work/life balance but lately there have been too many reorgs and unfortunately are happening too often."
good,"Very flexible work environment, workers are friendly although compensation is not great at all. The most fun part about the job is the culture, casual dressing and flexibility."
good,"Its a fun place to work and enjoy. Big company mentality, offers great benefits and generous PTO plan."
good,"worked with some of the smart people, challenging project. worked on a project which helped Cisco $1M in maintenance costs. learned a lot as Product Manager. great work culture."
good,Life is not so bad at Cisco. Lots of people work here.  Everyone has their own responsibility.  Days come + go.  Then your in the next year.  Over this review.
good,"Wonderful place to work. Everyone there gets along well, which makes environment happy and productive. No real advancement opportunities though.  Hardest part of the job is working for management that is still working with mindset of 40 years ago.  Needs to be more diligent in the legal protection of company."
good,"My days at Cisco are ever changing."
good,Its really good place to work and the co-workers are really great . The   working hours are according to the standards . The management is also good .
good,I really enjoyed working for Cisco! I am a single parent and my boss was great with letting me have time over when I needed it.
good,"- Very flexible and provides good work-life balance."
good,"Cisco has excellent salary and bonus structure, very good for technical engineers with interesting work. The company in general is good, Career development for management is limited in satellite sites.  California site has the most opportunities."
good,"Have grown a lot in the current role, have learned to work with tough customers and enjoy the dynamic network challenges."
good,it was a wonderful learning experience and the 2 years spent there wil always be close to my heart.
good,"Flexible working environment"
good,It is a good place to work with seniors around who could guide you. The core networking teams are challenging as well as lots of practical stuff to work on.
good,Good company for work life balance but very little opportunity for career growth
good,"Not really sure what to say, It is a great company but there is no guidance and no way to improve or move up"
good,Very Co-operative management where are always ready to unblock their engineers.
good,"A typical work day would consist of meeting at the office to practice for 2 hours. Once everyone and all the interviews were completed we would leave from the office and head out to the stores. After the day was complete we go back to the office for a night setting, to gather anything we could improve on. The day would end about 11p.m. Co-workers made sure if another person didnt have gas we would car pool because some destinations were quite far, so we looked out for one another. THAT WAS THE BEST PART. However, due to the way the pay system was structure you could alter your check prior before the work week sometimes for good and sometime it would leave you worrying about the next day. But, overall if I had more hours in the day it would have all worked out."
good,I spend more than 10 years per day working as a team and that allows me to learn new things and enhance my skill how to manage the office and people in a very critical or delicate situation and the hard part of the job is working under pressure and this helps to think analytically and motivates me to go office daily to face more new and upcoming challenges.
good,"CIsco is a great place with less job security. You can have more work life balance, all the amenities, benefits are very good Except job security. Rest All good"
good,It is a great company to work but you never know when you will lose your job.  However work culture and environment is just great as long as you are in the company.
good,"Cisco offers great work/life balance, but size of company and continually changing mission/goals and red tape make it difficult to accomplish anything.  A lot of lazy people."
good,"Working at CISCO will really spoil you in terms of working conditions. The down side is, it sometimes seems like an old boys' club, and, as in any corp, decisions are made on a high level, creating a feeling of futility of work"
good,A lot of hierarchy in the company.  A lot of politics and no clarity on work description and responsibilities. But great company to work for.  The group needed to be managed properly.
good,"nice company to develop our skills and very excellent work culture."
good,"If you are looking for a fair salary, the company pays very well. However, it is hard to have a work-life balance because you have to work a lot of hours."
good,"Learnt a lot, very supportive colleagues, lot of professionalism."
good,Layoffs come around often and you never know if you are on the chopping block or not.  Sooner or later your name will come up and you will be out.  The package is good but would rather still be working.
good,"Es un placer trabajar con los compañeros de Cisco. Una de las cosas que mas valoro es el grupo humano que compone la empresa."
good,"There is so much talent, opportunities and good people, great working environment. The hardest part of the job is keeping up with technologies. I learned how to work with people who are so smart and brilliant"
good,"Well, maybe different perspective, work time is flexible, i.e. you always have the option to work overtime. With nothing promising with sales or market share, job security is often at risks, and the room to grow is remote"
good,"fun workplace, learned way too many things , love my co-workers , i didn't like managemnt they don't care if you work hard or not"
good,Highly political culture with targeted reduction of age 50+ workers.  Claims to support remote workers but slowly and surely they are reverting back to an in-office culture.  May be ok to work here for a few years but a long career is out of the question.
good,"Frantic! Expect always the unexpected. Stay organized, informed and calm."
good,"todo puede ser llevadero desde el punto que pasas mas tiempo en tu trabajo que en ocaciones en tu casa, lo mas compklicado es lidiar con la Elite Salary y sus diferencias de status con el personal Hourly. la falta de comunicacion y sustento para conformar un equipo fuerte y multidiciplinario en el area especifica de Recursos humanos es complicada y desgastante"
good,"If you love powerpoints, this is the place for you! If you love fast moving and not many hoops to jump through, this place is not for you. It's great to see the company moving the needle forward in social support of the local areas."
good,"it is a good company to work with with lot of opportunities and benefits."
good,"Most recently a typical day at Cisco for me is working with the field / customers in regards to product road map, issues, escalations. Focal point for engineering development. Led sereval teams as a Agile Scrum Master and / or Program Manager"
good,"It is a very fast paced work environment that requires complex financial analysis for very large/complex opportunities.  The hardest part of the job is that I am responsible for the largest and most complex customers, who are very demanding.  The most enjoyable part is to know that I play a key role in $100+M transactions with very high visibility."
good,"I worked for Adecco for 4 years in within the Cisco organization, nice and friendly on site staff that was always willing to help in anyway they could."
good,Gained a lot of experience at this company as they encourage job mobility and encourage education.  Company encourages interdepartmental movement to encourage potential personal growth!
good,great place to work...the work life balance working remotely is wonderful.  Amazing amount of maturity still not present for a company of this size and age.
good,first manager gave me great review. second manager canned me. Even after completing performance improvement plan I was fired at the end of the project after I caught another engineer stealing cables from my test setup and accused him of ruining test results. Company perks are great. If you start at this company make sure you are at least at CCNP level. I had little networking or programming background when I started. Most of my experience was in hardware. I was placed in an environment competing against masters level computer science grads. Highly competitive environment and next to no mentoring. worked 50 to 60 hours a week.
good,"Engage with customers to ensure their success."
good,"VERY dependent of organization and manager as to whether you have a positive experience. There are organizations and managers that really do what ""Cisco"" says and look for advancement and growth for the individual. There are others that expect you to stay quiet, do as told and do not insert reality into any discussion if the executive(s) above your team have issued edicts re: programs - regardless of market/customer requirements. VERY frustrating when you are within one of those situations and most frequently depart when they are."
good,Productive and fun workplace. Kudos if you are blessed enough to land in the right department under proper leadership. Could really be a really great place to work. Lot's of employee perks and benefits.
good,"Flexible with work schedule;"
good,"Many hours working on many different projects, very demanding but also very rewarding. Day to day changes and you do have the possibility to work remotely on different projects."
good,"I am fresher. This is new experience for me. I learn new things,  and new experiences. I gain some new knowledge and ideas in this job. I work hard and harder."
good,A great workplace culture with no dress code. Flexible timings but the only hardest part of the job is to be consistently accurate and very dynamic. A competitive environment lurks around with politics being played around within departments.
good,"Recommends"
good,"Nice work environment with great professionals. Interesting technology and good benefits."
good,"A good place to work. "
good,"Able to learn a lot, got multiple certifications done."
good,"Strong experienced technical co-workers, good work-life balance, innovation encouraged and supported"
good,"Cisco is a good place to work in my opinion for the human people that works there. It is very interesting to work daily with people around the world. It is a company that gives you the opportunity to develop your suggestions, any idea is much welcome and you can add your thinking."
good,"Same teams doing the same thing without communication, and trying to race to completion with unstable solutions."
good,"Good culture, GREAT benefits and pay, but depending on the team you may have no work life balance."
good,"Manage all aspects of the operations for the organization; work with Program Manager to integrate internal communications-video and data documents to internal website, manage all meeting and calendar requests along with managing organizations IP based Cisco equipment."
good,"I learned more at cisco in 4 years than I had prior. You are exposed to many different technologies and very smart people. The hardest part of the job is the realization that there is so much that you don't know! I enjoyed challenges and solving problems and the ability to work autonomously. A typical day at work is filled with configuring routers, switches, firewalls, troubleshooting networks."
good,Would recommend to friend to work at Cisco Systems. They allow work from home which promotes work-life balance and provide good communication facilities to enable effective communication with co-workers.
good,"The typical day varies, and I find that depending on what team you're on, you may like it better or worse! In general, it's exactly what you'd expect though."
good,"Cisco is a great place to work, if you can work on leading edge products. The company purchases lots of startups, building compelling technology. They use there extensive sales channels and brand marketing to really push your product."
good,"Cisco is striving to be a better place to work but the nature of the business causes high stress and very aggressive deadline schedules at every turn.   Management just echo what higher manager dictate and when turn over happens there is no hand-off of lessons learned from previous managers so lessons have to be relearned causing major inefficiencies."
good,"It's not as rewarding/flexible/innovative/fun as it once was, but it's not the worst. There are great benefits but regular rounds of layoffs and shifts in expectations of worker locations so it's not a stable job. If you want to work on something interesting and innovative, you have a higher risk of being told you have a month to find a new job or you're sent packing (with a package). The best bet, sad though it is, is to find a large, well-funded org, where the work will be less interesting, there will be more management stupidity, but your job will generally be safe for awhile."
good,"Cisco is a good place to work as far as behemoth-sized companies go. The company's upper-level management were too myopic regarding Cisco and its intentions in the broader HPC Marketplace. Upper-level management were convinced HPC was strictly a high volume low margin play, which couldn't be further from the truth. If that was true, Cray Inc. wouldn't be able to sustain their typical margins of 25-40%."
good,Good work place but with over expectations of employee work contribution.  The company has a lot of work  and not enough staff to support the work requested.  The result is overworked employees and clients not getting timely and effective performance on contracts.
good,"good work place, lot to learn on networking. Less of challenges (depends on team). Compensation is average and less growth if you stay long. offcie is good."
good,The reason I rated the company low is because there was too much politics in play at Cisco. Management didn't really promote based on performance but on who knew who and how well one schmoozed!
good,"My managers assisted in my career growth, but I wish there were more focused tracks in regards to my current position. There wasn't much communication regarding the learning centers or courses available."
good,"Nice place to work. Good cafeterias. Nice office. Nice equipment."
good,"Cisco pays well, but the work is a bit of a grind.  Schedules are over committed and the expectation is that teams will work longer hours to make up for it.  Management does not give appropriate weight to engineer estimates."
good,"Great focus on execution. With the leadership change, the strategy is more clear now. "
good,The worse part of working at Cisco was being informed you no longer work there. No explanation other than you are on the list of we are cutting. The decisions are not all made on the basis of performance.
good,"Stable job, less growth, takes long to get promoted. things move slowly, no recognition to skilled engineers. Lot of opportunity to learn and work on projects."
good,"Good work/life balance but no career advancement."
good,"Its been wonderful to be a part of the company "
good,"Old charm of Cisco is gone. Specially in Cisco Webex. No growth , zero work life balance and hostile environment resulting to high attrition. Webex management has gone down from micro to ""nano"" resource management."
good,"This is a good place for pure network engineers."
good,"Très bonne expérience, bonne équipe, la proximité avec le client"
good,A wonderful opportunity to the world of communications systems and software industry for a master's degree student in computer science and engineering.
good,Cisco is a very demanding company. You have to be prepared to work long hours and create informal relationships in addition to performing your job.
good,"I learned a lot of new knowledge and experience in this company from financial analysis and communication skills point of view."
good,"My is work location is very Quite, hardly we can see people around, cubes are too lighted but in other building I see its very happening and good."
good,"Typical Day:  Check customer requirements"
good,Every day is a challenge and sales and finance operations are always looking to innovate or improve processes that helps productivity and customer experience. It is great when your ideas are listened and procured.
good,Cisco is a great company to learn new software tools and work on different platforms. I worked at different departments over my 4 years in Cisco and had a wonderful experience of meeting great people there. Would definitely love to work there in the future for other departments.
good,"productive work setting."
good,"A typical day is slow as is the learning curve per employee. One has to undertake a lot of individual initiative."
good,Working with bleeding edge collaboration technology (in the group I worked in). Administrating a global high availability voice/video environment. Fast paced.
good,"Though the technology used is legacy, the work-life balance is amazing. Great team and flexible management. Though the pay is way less compared to the current job market."
good,Very flexible workplace and environment.  Management is reluctant to commit to long term solution development and tends to rely on shorter-term visions.  Promotions and pay grade ups are limited depending on the group you are in.
good,"Good manager = Good job."
good,"A typical work day is usually full & busy. It allows little down time but it is very rewarding since Cisco is always at the cutting edge of technology and there is always something new to learn. However, there may be a few slow days depending on the time of the year where the work environment is very festive and allows for some fun! The most enjoyable part is building new relationships with the great people that work at Cisco."
good,"I've worked at Cisco as a contractor multiple times, and overall, they are a good company to work for.  They have excellent products and hire good people who are highly committed to success. As with most very large multinationals, it takes awhile to ""learn the ropes"" and figure out how to do things, but the teams I worked with were very good at providing help and insights.  Cisco has undergone massive change over the past few years, and as they continue to change, they struggle a bit with communication, information sharing, and matching competencies to roles.  There is also a tendency - in general - for management to take the short view instead of a longer view; that is, they will often make decisions without thoroughly considering the implications or involving the people who actually have to implement the change.  For example, they will decide to roll out a new program on a very ambitious timeline - often in spite of advice from experts - and then when it gets ""down to the wire,"" everyone has to scramble.  Projects, technologies and service offerings do not have a very long lifetime at Cisco due to technical upgrades and a strong need to stay current.  It is a fast-moving, sometimes chaotic and frustrating place to work, but everyone really does put forth their best effort."
good,"The workplace had excellent facilities, I was fond of a lot of the people that worked there. My criticism is that there is a lack of good structure. A lot of times I felt like I wasn't given a lot of support and structure in securing new projects to work on."
good,"Great company. I was a temp for a year, and I was trained properly, and I liked my coworkers. I would have liked to have been hired full time, but sadly this was not an option"
good,I enjoyed my time there but management didn't notify me of scheduled planning meetings.  Staff was very knowlegible and easy to work around.  Fellow employees were very friendly
good,"Cisco provides flexibility to you on scheduling your daily work to fit into your personal lifestyle. For example, the campus in HQ offers onsite gym, childcare, dental care and health center."
good,Would highly recommend for someone early in their career as learning best of class processes and procedures. Difficult to have work/life balance. Excellent leadership.
good,big company. Struggling to remain relevant now due to mismanagement. undergone heavy leadership changes and the future of Cisco is unclear but the company was good to work for.
good,"One of the USA's best companies to work for, however you'll really be worked.. often 17 hour days 7 days per week were required to handle the calls from the release of poorly tested products."
good,"Large, structured, driven company. Endless WebEx meetings (Cisco bought the company). Some days seemed filled with 5, 6, 7 hour-long conference meetings with 6, 8, 10, 12 attendees."
good,"if you are looking for chalenge and professional growth, this is the place to be."
good,Cisco is an excellent company to work for with great products and a fast paced culture.  Typically your co-workers are also top-notch people who have earned their way into an industry leading company.  Downside is job security.  Cisco typically does a large layoff just after the end of their fiscal year and tend to drop both good people and bad.  I did not get caught in a layoff but this recurring house cleaning did enter into my decision to stay or leave.
good,"I was a contractor for Cisco and they over worked us with no morale or proper leadership. They demanded more and more work, but never looked out for their people. I think it was just the team I was with."
good,"The time worked at Cisco I learned alot in the administrative roll through other groups. My particular group had a certain culture dynamic that I personally didn't fit into, however the overall culture of the company is wonderful. People are very friendly and there are so many programs to learn and build from."
good,"Reviewed more for how information was perceived, rather than whether it actually addressed and improved upon a situation.  Management teams can tend to be petty and vindictive, spending more time talking about you than with you."
good,"I work a lot of hours, but i get to work from home. I am working at 2 grade levels above where I am paid which seems to be typical. It's very hard to get a raise once you get into the company."
good,"List Price Services is a Pricing module where the Price of a product, software and services are set and then are calculated based on many of the attributes/uplifts/Geo and are exported to various form of tools, ERP System."
good,"work day was flexible and most folks were good colleagues"
good,Best large company I've worked for.  They have annual cuts so you often don't know where you stand and could be let go at any time.  They pay well but you have to balance that with your live.
good,the constant restructuring and mismanagement is the cause of the constant layoffs.  There's lots of potential to get hired but also a lot of potential to lose your job.
good,"Cisco used to be a great place to work once upon a time. While probably is still better than many other companies, its no longer the same as it used to be."
good,"me encanto la flexibilidad que tuve en esta empresa, podia trabajar desde el extranjero!!!"
good,A learning curve in a very fast paced environment.  With new technologies coming out there is always a new product to learn.  Work/life balance can be tough given the world wide presence of the company and teams.
good,"I am always look a challenging job. I can learn quickly the new job."
good,"Cisco is good place to work. Most people are collaborative, but they are not transparent about raises and promotions which is very difficult to get. Good work life balance."
good,I worked 24 hrs a day in the RMA department and learned how to build  web tool for internal and external customers on return products.  The pay was not enough for the work that I completed.
good,"I worked at Cisco for many years in many capacities.  I met many wonderful people from all walks of life.  I learned that work was not the only priority at Cisco and in this culture I made great connections.  As a Lobby Ambassador, I was the face of Cisco midtown.  As the Executive Assistant I was the right hand woman of the Operations Director and as the Business Analyst to the sales team, I was an important part of team strategical planning.  The easiest part of the job was the friendships I forged-most difficult was understanding that at the end of the year or quarter the pressure is on and don't take anything personally.  Overall, I learned a lot and wouldn't change the experience for the world."
good,"Work is good we have lot of things to lean."
good,"Good work culture and good vision."
good,"This is actually one of my favorite jobs, it was an easy job for day to day, most of the people on the call floor, there was a lot of issues when trying to escalate things through management. They seemed to like to forget about things that they promised they would go over or look into."
good,"Contractor positions are definitely a good way to get a foot in the door at larger companies like Cisco. They allow you to see more how things work internally and help you to decide what direction you'd prefer to go in should you desire to apply to become a direct hire. "
good,"Hard work, little training and help! Management there is under a lot of stress and tends to take it out on employees. There is otherwise a lot of learning and growing that takes place here."
good,Cisco is a great place to gain new skills and knowledge. Participated in many cross-departmental meetings.  Hardest part was completing work in normal 40 hour week.  I worked a lot of overtime.
good,"Typical work day consist of"
good,The past 15 years with Cisco is a great ride. Cisco needs updated to stay on the leader role of networking going through transformations.
good,"1. Too many layoffs of good personnel"
good,"In Cisco i had the opportunity to work in 4 different projects and that made me more versatile. "
good,"The reward I get from putting all the pieces together to pull off a successful webcast is exceptional! I have learned a great deal from my departmental mentor and also working with multiple Enterprise, SMB Business Units such as Marketing, IT, Networking, AV contractors, Project and Program mangers, Law and HR as well as the C-Level interaction with the client."
good,"Cisco was the company of my dreams. My pref work ex perfectly blended with this company. A typical day in Cisco involves all the meetings and discussions that one would associate with an IT enterprise. The hardest part of the job was the steep learning curve. Overall, its a very nice place to work."
good,"* Proactively manage internal and external customer programs and inquires for assistance."
good,Work from 8am to 2pm. Every Friday you write a progress report on current project and what tasks you will be performing the week ahead and stick to this schedule. Worked in group of very hard working people. Enjoyed all the tasks of programming and management soft skills.
good,"if you land on a right team, it is a wonderful env to work. Good team"
good,Napewno rownowaga life/family daje duzo do zastanowienia.
good,"If you are a technology freak and have a passion for high growth and high achievement, then Cisco Systems is for you."
good,"Not a bad place to work. Makes sure you interview for the correct positions. If you're an engineer, you want a Post-Sales role or contract onsite engineer role."
good,"A great company to work for with a truly diverse yet inclusive workplace; where hard work, innovation and creativity are not only encouraged, promoted, and appreciated but also recognized."
good,I have learnt many things in the company of companies going through technology transition. I had the flexibility in the work schedule. I enjoyed working at the company. I
good,"You will enjoy the Project,you also can learn more in the project and also good interaction with team as well as leads"
good,Environment was as relaxed a work place I have ever seen.  Focus was on accomplishing the projects and expanding knowledge. Tons of knowledge all around to learn from.
good,"il s'agit d'une bonne entreprise humaine, avec une équipe très collaborative"
good,Bell'esperienza ambiente ripeto tranquillo team nella media. In ogni luogo di lavoro o altro c'è sempre invidia e cattiveria
good,Got opportunity to learn new technologies. Worked with excellent guys who helped me to excel in my career both technically and as human being. Best place to work
good,"Generally good place to be to expand knowledge base and industry connections. Benefits are very good. Management style is haphazard and unpredictable, and sometimes ruthless."
good,"Great place to work, and management lets you do your job. Lots of perks like free soft drinks, coffee, and a Roti machine. There are snacks, a game room, and a massage chair for you to use. Great work-life balance, too."
good,Great company with innovative technology and tools.  Cisco was easy to work with and was creative in their go to market strategy and their logistics to help support their distribution partners.
good,"Cisco is een heel goed bedrijf om mee samen te werken. Het is een bedrijf dat zijn medewerkers de kans geeft om verder te gaan in hun carrière. Vooral werken voor Cisco Advanced Services gaf me de kans om complexe projecten uit te voeren voor grote organisaties zoals de Centrale Bank van Nigeria, KPN in Nederland en MTN in Nigeria."
good,"I started out as an intern in the digital marketing team, where the folks were very supportive in getting me up to speed, teaching me the craft as well as the tools to get started and succeed. Transitioning to full-time I was challenged with working with global stakeholders and developing a new team from the ground-up. The marketing team in the Raleigh-Durham area is very Silicon Valley-like with a open and inviting office space, plenty of inter-company networking events."
good,"The best thing, I worked at Cisco That I could play my tennis or exercise in the morning everyday before I come to work. It has shower bath and locker in bathroom."
good,Cisco has friendly work environment.I really like work for Cisco. But Cisco should open more permanent positions and consider contractors who work for Cisco to convert them to full time employees.
good,"Unfortunately I was working for US market, based in Europe and the timezone was killing me. Overall I got amazing experience and knowledge for a short period of time."
good,"good place to work"
good,"Good company, flexible work hours, some travel depending on job duties, plenty of internal training available. Good opportunity for advancement in many fields."
good,Overall a good experience and great colleagues.  The cons is that people tend to be nervous about layoffs which happen every year and turn over can be high.
good,I really enjoyed working in Cisco. I liked its culture and working environment. Very proud of Cisco technologies. Cisco has been rated one of the top companies to work for.
good,"I enjoyed working at Cisco Systems, Inc, for 15+ years. They were fair and I would be given chances at promotion. I worked in Global Lab Services where I was in charge of the Rack and Stack Team."
good,"Acquired by Cisco. Very good integration and on-boarding for such a large company.  Responsibilities can incur a great deal of overlap (8-legged sales calls), but otherwise, your roles and responsibilities are well-defined."
good,"The ability to increase business acumen from a global perspective was fantastic.  Holding various roles in different areas of the company lent to greater aptitude to relate to all disciplines including engineering, marketing, program management, operations, IT, sales, alliances, channels, etc."
good,"The INSIEME Business Unit (INSBU) is a highly technical environment with innovative approaches to data center networking, automation and AI/ML-based Analytics."
good,Great place to work with inclusive and diversified in nature. CSR activities are conducted very frequently. Great team work and equal opportunities provided.
good,"I have working with Cisco from last 4years and it was good experience, and getting good opportunity to grow my career in Cisco. I'm glad that I'm a part of such a reputative company."
good,"Good place to work and additional benefits like transport from and to, cafeteria, overall experience is good. Even for small things considering it as an critical one and sort it then and there."
good,"Good balance and experience with technology, hands on with latest technology. Visible fast moving environment, able to gain understanding of variety of things."
good,"good work life balance, good compensations and good culture that promotes innovations and new ideas. "
good,"I never worked for Cisco, however I am required to fill out this form so I'm making up things to write here to fulfill my requirement to add at least 150 characters."
good,"Internal corporate jobs, especially engineering, are very stable."
good,"For the past five years, I have seen significant changes within the company.  Too many layoffs. It makes you feel like; ""when is it going to happen me next?"""
good,"Resolution problems in case hardware, software and internet connectivity issues are found for individual employees’ workstations."
good,disappointed in the quality of some managers.  Most come from other departments and not very intune to the process and knowledge of a product in the department.  work sometimes suffer from these.
good,"Cisco offers decent benefits.  The work life balance can be a little bit of a challenge, but that's to be expected.  A lot of management is trying to build their kingdoms over doing what's best for Cisco."
good,"Great company to work for. I have worked in Cisco for 11 plus years and can attest to this fact. Good products and good people in general. Hard to change roles laterally, say from software engineer to product manager"
good,"Productive and a great place to learn new cutting-edge technologies."
good,"Company has the goal and mission unfortunately it does not apply to the BU level.  "
good,"I found myself in an environment that welcomed the development of my professional skills. Everyone was eager to teach me, as I was eager to learn. It was a great place to learn and develop."
good,Was acceptable to job movement.  May different training and growth opportunities. ONce you were ' profiled' you were only considered for certain types of work.
good,"well known company good team, good place."
good,Ever evolving company with industry leading solutions that is a great place to start your career however ageism seems to be taking hold and drive to reduce cost
good,"A fun workplace. Lot of opportunity to learn many different technologies. With snacks everyday.  But no chance of converting to a full-time employee. When 18 months comes, I have to go."
good,"For the most part, the hardest part of the job has nothing to do with your performance.  It comes down to the bottom line of their finances which is most likely far removed from your every day."
good,"Ramping up new cloud based operations for captive companies."
good,"Typical day is coding, testing and chasing down whom to contact to get something going; but then big systems are expected to be that."
good,"Productive,  Workplace, Helps build technical expertise. Work environment is extremely competitive with night and weekend work. Work ethics is low, not much of recognition for work."
good,"Good life/work balance"
good,Cisco is undergoing transition and is downsizing so it is a constantly changing and re-organizing. This makes it difficult to main continuity when working on projects.
good,Cisco had a great mentoring program and plenty on and off campus training.  Cisco rewarded teams for making product development goals and recognized individuals achievements.
good,"It's a fun and productive environment if the team bonds well and has cohesion. There's alot of room for growth, but you'll need to be proactive to push for growth."
good,Cisco is a great and good place to work with. The people here are very good and very professional. Work culture is very good and I have been working in Cisco since 8 + years.
good,"Good working environment. Relatively low salary. Cutting back on good benefits over the years. Technology is getting out of date for engineers, not good in getting better job outside of company."
good,I think with any of these inside sales jobs at OEM's you run the risk of pulling your employees in too many directions. Sales is already a busy job and if you couple that with a complex industry ( channel business model ) the last thing you need is for management to create a bunch of programs to justify their existence that distract your employees from executing in their current role. Less is more. Create an environment and a streamlined approach to things where an employee can just come in and execute on 2 - 3 things everyday and move the needle. Not 8 - 10 things that they can only give themselves half way to.
good,Good place to learn and grow. Good work life balance. Easy to approach managers and friendly work environment. Best place to network and find new opportunities.
good,"Great place to work. Thanks the premium Cisco places on its employees' happiness, the networking giant has proven itself to be the gold standard for employers."
good,"I enjoy working here. I have nice coworkers, but my team is isolated enough that I can not speak for other groups. I really learn multiple concepts every cycle and it is like being in the fast lane on the IT highway."
good,"Cisco at times is fast paced. Product changes often, requires you to be updated with product which can be difficult. Fun environment, good people to be around. Hours can be long."
good,Company has a vision and game plan.  Processes are in place and followed.  Company has a comprehensive portfolio to be a market leader and knows what it is doing..
good,"Located on the Paris end of Collins street it provides easy access to public transport many options for a feed, easy access to clients and excellent views."
good,"Worked with great team of engineers."
good,Good working environment when I was there almost 20 years ago. It has changed and evolved a lot since then. Not sure what it is like now. But seems to be improving.
good,"The company is moving into the software business very rapidly. Too many changes too quickly. Internal politics are steamy. Many decent people but too many bad apples."
good,"Diverse Culture, large number of complicated platforms to support.  Learn on the fly mentality. Workplace / team building activities. Team lunches and outings are common."
good,"Restructuring every six to eight months zaps morale, leads employees to care more about jumping to the right management chain that isn’t going to be cut."
good,Cisco is a great place with great people. There is just too much turnover. There are too many changes in management and once that happens the employees and contractors are displaced.
good,i enjoyed my job right up until SPVSS was sold. Job security at Cisco is not (secure or obviously guaranteed.) I really liked my local management and his supervisor. This was a very well versed team that persuaded me to branch off into Software/Applictions comfortably.
good,"There were teams and projects at Cisco that were among the best I've ever been a part of, and other projects that were the most disorganized and poorly thought through."
good,"At Cisco, I had the opportunity to learn a lot and manage innovative projects. Culture is supportive of a work life balance and remote work. The only thing I did not like was that some departments would ignore contractors."
good,"Its a fun, chill environment. Building in India is gorgeous. Sometimes its slow though but you can ask for more work to pace it up. Flexible work hours, especially with family"
good,Description: It involves the support for CISCO Device support along with middleware application server support for Weblogic and Websphere on Pre-prod environments.
good,Very fast pace when I was there. It was a great place to learn the business as there are a lot of smart people but no one was in the office. Everyone worked remote so it was hard to collaborate.
good,Good place to work and learn technology. Will have opportunity to work across Geo's and workforce. Good learning potential for building your career either in management or technology side
good,Lots of opportunity to learn and work with amazing smart people all over the world!
good,Boa empresa para se trabalhar porém extremamente competitiva. Ambiente excelente para fazer novas amizades e obter conhecimento técnico
good,"Would recommend. This was a good learning experience. You get a feel of corporate work life, get assigned a mentor, and have several projects throughout the summer."
good,"I liked it, but it was just an internship.  Looking for further options.  They are on the table for long-term plans, but I don't know what else is out there."
good,The technology and people at Cisco are great to work with.  There is no limit to what you can learn and do provided you can find the time.  Often you have too many items on your plate and unfortunately only have the time to focus on the most critical.
good,Recommended employer with many awards. Good benefits. Global leader. Known brand. Good team. Flexible working hours. Fast moving. Strong sales network.
good,"The first manager I had at Cisco was amazing. Amazing culture, fast-paced and I had a great team. The second time around not so much. The first time gave me the opportunity to learn and collaborate heavily, while the second time was the opposite."
good,It was a great place to build my career until it unexpectedly ended with a restructuring lay off. I was very disappointed that after 20+ years Cisco had no loyalty to  my years of hard work and dedication.
good,Working at Cisco was a great experience in working at a multinational corporation. I found many smart and capable people who taught me a lot about a wide array of technologies.
good,"Cisco invests in its people.  From technical to professional training, it is mutually beneficial for both parties.  Cisco is a valuable brand and having worked there was exciting."
good,"Overall, Cisco is a great place to work. The benefits and compensation are better than average, however; the change in leadership over the past few years has caused a serious change in culture."
good,Good work environment.  Helpful staff.  Lots of opportunity to upgrade your skill level.  Worked on 3 separate contracts which all helped my career advance.
good,"one of the best accounts that HCL has, lot's of learning and lots of fun. The staff work exclusively for Cisco, and exposure to Cisco technology and expertise are very helpful in growing your career."
good,Cisco has been a very conventional company which is trying ot reinvent with new structure in cloud era. There has been a few changes in office space and culture.
good,"Its a good place to start and learn .  But to grow or to learn new skills its better to go beyond the Cisco. It has excellent infrastructure, but its very hard to advance in  career"
good,"I looking for 5 days job and weekend is not included. Whereas i hve to work on weekends for this cirrent job."
good,Cisco is a very large company and it can be difficult to get to face to face meetings on time. The culture there is very forgiving regarding this issue. Work life balance was very good.
good,"Not applicable and not interested to revire at this moment."
good,"Great place to work if you are Open to learning new things, good work life Balance and work culture."
good,"When I started with Cisco in 1997 it was a great place to work and learn. Management cared about their employees and if you performed you were rewarded. Over the years those trends started to fade away and Cisco. Cisco became more interested in numbers rather than individual productivity and development."
good,"-Awsome opportunities to learn new stuff"
good,"Cisco is an OK place to work.  Benefits are pretty good and pay is average.  Some groups/BUs are better than others.  Seems every year they have a major layoff (usually at the end of summer)."
good,Work is very fast paste and interesting.  Cisco is under going a significant transition to subscription revenue based business models which provides for a complex change management environment.
good,"Very competitive environment, which allows for opportunities to learn and grow. NEVER a dull moment. There is an opportunity to learn on a daily basis.The most enjoyable part of working for Cisco Systems is the diverse workforce. Opportunities to engage with resources from around the globe."
good,"Overall good environment;"
good,"As a contractor for Cisco, I enjoyed my time working for them. I love the culture and the work life balance that this company has to offer. Being able to work from home allowed me to be more productive by cutting down my commute time and diving straight into work. In addition, my managers and co-workers have all been very professional and provided guidance and assistance whenever needed."
good,Typical day is filled with webex meetings and fire drills.  People are nice but very stressed. Communication is disjointed and often people don't know what who is doing what.
good,"Its a good place to work and learn technical concepts. "
good,"Cisco is a great place to work. One can enjoy nice working environment, large modern office, coffee areas, ping pong table and more importantly be part of talented and professional team."
good,"Highly competitive, good benefits. Flexible work hours and options. Cutting edge technology. Work remotely. Day care for child when onsite. Enjoyable most of the time."
good,"Cisco has a strong sales engine that makes the Organization self sustainble, more than individual driven. Great company to learn with on new technologies and trends."
good,"Cisco focuses on trying to connect the universe. The work culture is great - as you can telecommute and thus enjoy better work-life balance. The management is also very focused on trying to adapt to a software driven world and this is having an impact on the work culture, particularly training for employees."
good,"I was only with Cisco for 4 / 5 months, because of my network processor background. I was given a real assignment on day one, no training / orientation was provided. But I can work more than 8 hours a day and more than 40 hours a week; they paid for the extra efforts I have put in."
good,"Typical day at work is good"
good,"Good company for knowledge gaining and healthy work environment but job security is bit less"
good,"Nice culture, I enjoyed the chess and games room for lunches.  It's a global company, but it treats the employees very well. I was a contractor, but had fun."
good,"The nature of the job was very strategic. Can learn a lot because of the diversity of the projects, some of the newest technologies were part of the scope."
good,"great place to work,  with competitive salary package and resources and room for career growth and advancement,  life work balance and maintaining good standard of living"
good,"good place to work"
good,"Cisco, is a good company to work for. However, the politics within the organization much like any other company are really toxic."
good,Good group of people.  Management could use some people skills. The employees are friendly and collaborative; however the higher up you go the more politics there are.
good,"In my roles at Cisco, the work was very demanding and most were extremely demanding, making work-life balance difficult.  The company and managers were flexible regarding working from home and the time of day worked so there was flexibility in that regard."
good,A leading hardware/software network company in the world. Good for me to get an experiences in this company. I left the company and join a startup company with my friends
good,Good work-life balance. Opportunity to work on latest technology. Management is good. Work-setup is nice. Management promotes innovation and spends money for R&D.
good,"Team was very nice to work with, lot of employee perks. Very flexible. Management took time to help employees advance/continuous learning. Lot of transparency on goals/vision"
good,"Work culture is very slow at Cisco. It has been over run with politics as yearly layoffs turn empty minds to devising strategies finding scapegoats."
good,"This company is amazing to work for in many areas - amazing growth for your career, flexible with hours per week. Work was exciting, interesting and varied on projects and programs. Very educational and very exciting to be a part of such a tech leader."
good,Lot of resources and facilities to learn. Work life balance is subpar but it all depends on the manager.  Lots of internal trainings available to advance our career. Time management is critical for success.

good,"Started working with Scientific Atlanta in 2003, and did field engineering work for 13+ years. SA was one of the two major players in the Cable TV industry in North America.

good,Great environment to work with world-class leaders. Opportunity to influence industry leading products. Ability to share the future of technology worldwide.
good,Cisco is a fantastic organization and I enjoyed working with many talented people.  The down side is the organization is in a constant churn.  At quarter and year end the company will predictably lay off a number of consultants and FTE creating an environment of instability.
good,Interesting place to work.  Flexible place to work.  Several restructuring has caused confusion and uncertainly in the employees.  Jobs are being shifted to India for cost reasons.
good,"exposure to various technologies"

good,"If you have a good manager at Cisco, it can be a great place to work.  Generally liked my co-workers and almost everyone was helpful.  The ""People Deal"" that HR introduced was a good idea, but really lacked accountability and ability to execute between manager and employee.  The salary and benefits at Cisco are really good, but it's lost it's mojo as evidenced by the yearly lay-offs."
good,"It all depends on the group that your in. The company in general is primarily made up of older married people. Good benefits, lots of groups, and lots of activities held throughout the year. Good food for a good price."

good,"Flexibility, great benefits, competitive salary, positive work environment."
good,"Cisco is a place where you can thrive but there is always the difference between the blue badges (Cisco) and red badges (contractor). Red badges out number the blue badges, but that is always the pecking order.  Work is challenging in a good way and a good campus."
good,Fun job lots of great people and new technology. Really great people and some out of the box thinkers. Its hard work and constantly re-orging. Leadership at mid levels is strong and very rewarding

good,"I love the work-life balance. The most enjoyable part of my job was the teamwork that was shown across teams, and the spirit of helping out others that were new or were struggling."
good,"Upward mobility is rare, managers do not really mentor and mostly manage upwards. Frequent layoffs create a fear culture and does not really affect work environment in a positive way."
good,Overall this is a pretty good company to work for. But i hear recently that it becomes meaner and leaner. May be this is only way to survive nowadays.
good,Fast paced. internal build of systems. Analyzed reports. Marketing. The people were very friendly. That is all I can remember.
good,"Самое важное, что я научился пользоваться скриптами продаж, что позволило мне грамотнее вести диалог с клиентом"

good,"It was nice working for Cisco System..Managers and employees at Cisco System are all Team Players.. Very nice to worked with..To bad the economy dropped down.

It was nice working for Cisco System and i want to thank them for the jobs."

good,"SVO is a Service Order capturing application to support the customer with post sales service delivery. This system allows customers to submit the request for the repair or replace of the equipment they bought. This system was enriched with web 2.0 UI model and has made an exponential growth in the acquisition of new customers for our client.

good,"leader in networking devices, training is good, but they started the certification renewal setup, and price of renewal tests are high, Most certifications are book memorization and not real life scenarios or proof of knowledge. the only true certification they have is the CCIE lab, all hands -on. showing what you know."
good,Management allows you to freely within reason to get the task done.  Good work life balance.  Difficult in movement in the organization as many stay in their position for a while.

This was accomplished through proactive monitoring to assess for any potential risks, trending analysis to expose areas of concern or opportunities for improvement, and driving high priority incidents to conclusion."
good,"You get chance to work on latest technologies, HR polices are good and located in ideal locations and pay package is also reasonable."
good,"good place to work, good 401k, medical wasn't the best. vacations is only promised after a year, and even then seniority takes availability. dental was minimal, overall good place to work good bonus program. good perks and prices for hard work."
good,"If you enjoy or prefer a process oriented company, this would be a good company to work for. Compensation is fair and co-workers are friendly and helpful."
good,A typical day at work includes taking calls from the call queue. I have learned much about Voice/Video and the infrastructure required to support video teleconferencing for SMBs all the way up to large corporations. Management is great and always working to improve the work environment as well as expand the business. Co-workers are generally helpful and willing to teach if the opportunity arises. The hardest part of the job is when call queue is overloaded with calls and you do not have much time to work. The most enjoyable part of the job is a relaxed work environment.
good,Easy going company... less work pressure.. more joy at work
good,"Cisco is wonderful place to learn and execute. People are supportive and let you try new things at work."

good,"A typical day for a TelePresence Engineer is handing tickets in the as they come in for for any issue from layers 2-7. I have learned about how Cisco implements voice and video to make TelePresence possible. Management is relaxed and it a stress free environment in a NOC center work area. Coworkers are for the most part friendly and willing to help fellow engineers out if they get stuck on a particular issue. The hardest part would be learning how each ticket is to be handled and documented with the assistance of a flow chart, each situation can be unique. The most enjoyable part is my co workers who are helpful and we have built a close bond."
good,"Active working with manufacturers, customers and personnel."
good,"Very fast-paced environment. To be successful, you must be able to handle ambiguity and know how to figure things out. People are great and very collaborative."

good,"A typical day at work involved morning telepresence SCRUM meetings with the team, as I was based in San Jose and the team were based in Austin, Texas. I would then speak to the team about my completed tasks, whether they were completed or not and then talk about the day's work ahead.

good,"I am working on a Network specialist Cisco systems Hardware and Software validation team, that makes a big difference in improving the quality of Cisco Switches and Routers that improves the outcome of good quality hardware for customer."

good,"My main Job included monitoring , escalations and follow up and a lot of documentation like Incident management and TCBs.Good for freshers.Not a very technical Intensive job.Not much trouble shooting."
good,Typically starts off by checking request list with a ticketing system. Clearing out requests based on priority Low-Med-High. Learned a lot of technical skills such as installing OS's on servers. Ghosting images onto Apple Mac Mini's. Still learning a lot too. Most enjoyable part is solving a difficult request. Most of the day goes by support requests from teams that are deployed in India. Working side by side with test engineers requires a lot of quick knowledge and the ability to grasp onto concepts fast.
good,A very challenging but rewarding company where you learn a lot
good,very relaxed work place with nice co workers. management is decent but try to work with yo as much as possible
good,"•	Worked with Business team and stakeholders for understanding the requirements"

good,"At Cisco Systems, Inc., one day never resembled the other, which is my ideal work environment.  I gained experience along with similarly hard working and enthusiastic professionals on such tasks as budget reporting, events coordination, marketing publications and more.  The time spent team building and working through deadlines was invaluable and I hope to find an opportunity to work side by side with other like-minded professionals in the near future."
good,"Pros & Cons like any job"
good,I spent most of my time learning router protocols and Internet routing.

good,Es una empresa comprometida con su personal aprendi a desarrollar mis habilidades dentro de la empresa y gracias a eso me mantuve en el area de calidad 6 años
good,No one is rigid about the time you come in or leave but typical expectation is you'll spend around 8 to 9 hours at work.
good,Great team to work with. Easy management. Flexible work hours
good,Involved in deploying Cisco on Cisco. As a program manager had a successful run of my life for this global deployment wit tight timelines and every one works hard and smart.
good,I was fortunate to work with high-level management that cared about the individual; given the opportunity to advance my career. There were long hours and meetings that filled your days; a lot of work had to be done after hours. Not always the best job if you have family. Really good benefits and bonuses. Would have continued to work there but unable to do so due to layoffs.
good,Lots of fun configuring and troubleshooting customer networks.
good,There are too many decision makers in this company that do not collaborate with other departments.
good,Cisco is trying to find its way in the global marketplace and has had some difficulty recently.
good,Hours are flexible. Great place to work if you have a family.
good,"If you can get your foot in the door and have the right connection in upper management, this is a great company to work for. Otherwise it will be a fight to get where you want as their internal network to transfer departments or go where you want can be a challenge and leaves much to be desired."
good,"Charged with administering sales and service initiatives for 250 active accounts generating US$2.1M in annual sales. Proactively cold-called and prospected for new mid-market sector customers. Coordinated and hosted customer seminars focused on promoting leading-edge IP telephony, wireless, storage, and security technologies. Prepared and presented request for quotations (RFPs/RFQs)."
good,Good place to work.
good,"As a whole, Cisco has plenty of resource and knowledge base and talents for people to grow and work with."
good,Cisco is now a mature company with great people to work with.
good,"Good working environment, Learning new technologies, Exposure to Cisco servers, switches, storage testing"
good,"Just like any employer, there are pluses and minuses. There have been many changes during my tenure at the company. I have witnessed the company grow from about 25k employees to more than 75k."
good,Management is sometimes very difficult to deal with. There are some good manager that just let you do your work. Work location is very flexible for some roles.
good,"My 15+ year Cisco career was spent in the R&D organization working across all business units. The culture was intense: highly competitive, a lot of conflict, leadership was traditional command and control which instilled too much focus on hierarchy and political navigation, a bully & superiority mentality throughout management, passive aggressive behaviors, and sometimes - absolute hostile interactions among management and sometimes the engineers.  It seemed most everyone was always on offense or defense - rarely partners on the same team rallying towards a common goal."
good,i am work over there as a server handler and wiring the modems on floors and handle the associates to work continuously without any problem arise in there work
good,Nice company to start on network related technology. People are very helpful and working together to grow the business unit. Good working culture and easy commuting.
good,Mi evaluación es buena con respecto a lo laboral ...
good,Regardless of how skilled you are in the Networking space.  There is always a new project or product in the works that you can be apart of.  The company wants you to be able to succeed in whatever path you chose and will provide you with amble resources.
good,"Good:  Generally supportive employees.  Vast corporate resources. "
good,"Great campus.  I was a contractor but there weren't many people that worked on campus as Cisco is considered a technology company and most of their engineers or programmers worked from home.  The building was a ghost town most days.  They lay off a lot so job security was a no-go,  I reported to someone in San Jose even tho the corporate office was in Gwinnette.  Interesting financial work and pretty good relationship with staff all over the world....except for ONE individual... Nothing bad or truly inspiring to write.  It was a good place for me to work and the pay was above average...even for a contractor."
good,With all the recent management changes Cisco's culture has changed.  The senior leadership team has been completely revamped over the last 5 years and we see the effects of the new leaders.
good,"Enjoyed the work and culture at Cisco,  but some of the managers are very impractical. Cisco is still one of the companies I aspire to go back to. Thank you for the wonderful time!"
good,Worklife balance is good -  but if your business unit is not a market leader and growing - start looking as it's highly likely you will be re-structured or spun out.
good,"Amazing place to work, amazing people to work with, good salary but can be very challenging as an OEM. Yearly letting go of employees every year  makes it feel like a yearly contract."
good,"Its open culture and employee empowerment is there..but its hard to get career growth in my domain due to limited exposure outside US."
good,"working at Cisco has pros and cons.  very flexible working environment, remote is always available with most positions.  Technology is top notch for remote work, but internally developed and integrated tools are not very well managed or implemented.  Every year there are reductions in force somewhere and in some areas starting to cut into the marrow and the ability to get basic things completed is hampered by the decisions on who is kept or let go.  No thought about saving operational employees who manage the day to day efforts to reduce friction getting work done."
good,"Cisco as a whole is an amazing company and is always innovating. The only downside I experienced is the way contractors are treated. Cisco hires many contractors, but benefits are paid by the contracting agency to them. This varied by the agency. And the real financial benefits did not reach the contractors such as bonuses and stock options. "
good,"I work remote, so don't have much experience with on site environment. When I do go onsite people are welcoming and helpful. This is a great place to work...if they don't cancel your job after 4 months."
good,"As a contractor it's a little hard for me to do an 'actual' review, but I've been at Cisco for quite some time. I've seen a lot of changes in the marketing organization. They are very focused and use resources efficiently. In my role there's never a ""typical"" day. Events can be unpredictable at times. :)"
good,But growth can be slow. Workplace customer is very busy and energy is spent pushing out a lot of products to the crowded marketplace. Too much work done measuring success.
good,"great place to work,"
good,"Inside Sales/ Deals Management Operations and Service Quoting Support."
good,"Cisco is a great place to work at.  Plenty of perks and interesting work if you can get to move around the company.  However, there is a lot of middle management to stride through in order to get things approved and done."
good,"I like working for Cisco on the whole. I have to say, I get to call the shots when it comes to my work environment. When Cisco started tearing down cubicles in lieu of open workspaces, I could no longer concentrate and moved off campus (worked from home). I've enjoyed not having to go out of the house to get to work and Cisco provides me with equipment to teleconference instead."
good,The subject position is a very critical position in electrical engineering field. Almost all design and manufacturing companies need this position to insure they have the right componnet designed in their products.
good,"My 15+ year Cisco career was spent in the R&D organization working across all business units. The culture was intense: highly competitive, a lot of conflict, leadership was traditional command and control which instilled too much focus on hierarchy and political navigation, a bully & superiority mentality throughout management, passive aggressive behaviors, and sometimes - absolute hostile interactions among management and sometimes the engineers.  It seemed most everyone was always on offense or defense - rarely partners on the same team rallying towards a common goal."
good,People with great skills and energy and working as part of a team. I enjoyed growing and learning within the company and having the opportunity to do a number of jobs.
good,"Cisco is a large company where it is often difficult to move within.  It is often highly segmented so that gaining experience in other areas becomes difficult.  However, The offered benefits at Cisco are great.  Health care is top notch."
good,"Cisco is overall nice place to work and foster your career.It had good work-balance culture.Some good facilities provided are wor from home,health insurance , 6 months maternity leave"
good,"The organization I was with had numerous managers who seemed to work very independently to the detriment of the organization.  While Cisco is a great company to work at, it does depend upon the organization one belongs to.  Prior to me joining this team, all of the previous members, except two, left the organization or company for various reasons when the new manager arrived. All of my team members believe that the management would have greatly benefitted with additional management training."
good,The experience you'll get out of Cisco all depends on the group you work with and your management chain.  Cisco's policies are in place for a great working environment but the direct management can supercede those policies.  Promotions and salary increases were rare occurrences.
good,Working from your home office allows you the ability to plan your work objectives based on global staff so all participants are able to collaborate on projects and new ideas.  This working environment provides much more flexibility than a brick and mortar location whereby all staff is easily accessible using WebEx applications for all aspects of any project.
good,Compensation is competitive.  Turnover rate is high.  I like that we get to telecommute some days in a week instead of spending 3 hours in commute time.  Overall Cisco has a diverse culture and a well run company.
good,"Good Company to work for. Flexible work schedule. Good benefits. Onsite GYM, Pharmacy and medical facility. There are too much talent in the company and sometimes completion is tough."
good,Flexible and able to work from home but managed sites globally so would work all day and night.  It was hard to balance work and personal life.  Manager micro managed and was one of 8 over the time there.
good,"Cisco is a good company to work for over all. "
good,"Demanding work environment, with many deadlines and high expectations of employees.  Job satisfaction often determined by your manager.  Employees often under pressure to produce; long hours."
good,"great collaborative working environment.  "
good,"It's a good place to learn. Management is ok, depending on the group."
good,"-opportunity for growth is great"
good,"A lot is expected, and you have to be able to live through chaos. Lots of 'change to simulate progress'."
good,"I had a team I did not personally enjoy. However, my friends were in very good teams so I know it was not a company culture, just a team specific culture. I would return."
good,Its a great place to work however with too many people comes too many problems. Promotions are a rare thing and constant lay-offs are a threat. That said good place to learn and excel in skills
good,"Friendly and comfortable working environments.  "
good,"I would recommend Cisco for anyone who wants a stable job and great benefits.  The pay is excellent if you get into the right group. But just like all companies, some groups are good and some are not.  I was blessed to get into a great group."
good,"Depends the team and the management. Most times the management is short sighted and targets show teams goals rather than the whole solution, which causes a lot of time being wasted in changing design and code."
good,Cisco is a top technology organization that challenges you while providing opportunities for growth. It has a progressive and inclusive culture that allows for self-expression.
good,I worked as RED badge contract with Cisco Advanced services group and during my 1 year contract and working on Cisco next generation products platform increased my technical skills and I loved to work during that time but for some reasons I was unlucky and my contract ended and not renewed and I applied several time on similar job role as consultant engineer Cisco Data Center but did not get chance again but overall my experienced was excellent working with Cisco :)
good,"Hectic day ,"
good,I would work there again if I get the opportunity. I heard management and salary has improved. I enjoyed the fast pace environment. The name has changed from Scientific Atlanta to Cisco.
good,"Great company with great values.  Strong belief in philanthropy and giving back to community, maintaining work-life balance and supportive not only within singular teams but company-wide."
good,"Must enjoy continual learning, and working alongside talented individuals working in a highly collaborative environment. A fantastic workplace if you find a good team of people and exciting products."
good,"At Cisco, management is keen on work/life balance, thus the working hours are flexible though, at times, it may require working eastern and international hours."
good,"I had been working for Cisco almost 20 years. Cisco is energetic company, I am always have projects to do during 20 years at Cisco. I constantly delicate my time of every day for Cisco, but I love all the challenges that I had in my job at Cisco. I have learned a lot from technical point of view, management style and challenges."
good,"Being part of ENG in CISCO was a great experience. They had several fun events for their interns. The work was great. However, it is hard to say you will be called back for full time"
good,"I learned so much working with Cisco, and the name is a power house to open doors once you are looking elsewhere. The culture of learning is powerful here, and people really didn't mind you asking questions at anytime."
good,"In the 2000s was a great place to work in the midst of Internet boom. Management changed fast, but initiative was rewarded. Cannot say howo it is today."
good,"Great tech, most people are outstanding  & share knowledge."
good,"Cisco is a global technology based company; fast paced and friendly. On the Sales side of Cisco the culture is great. Management allows you to work independently and check in when needed. You can always get help from your peers and the company is very much about putting their customers first. In my role as an administrator, I am very loyal to my work. I  have learned so much about the importance of sustainability. It is a very project oriented atmosphere, so contractors aren't likely to convert and will stay."
good,"Mature company with good benefits. Company can be good for people with families and who seek stability, though the constant rounds of layoffs can be depressing at times."
good,"Cisco Systems can be a great place to work if you have patience to deal with limited upward mobility and constant change of managers.  The pay raises are few and far between, but the benefits are top notch.  There are numerous opportunities at Cisco, so you have the opportunity to branch out, but the hard part is getting your name known to those who would be responsible for hiring you.  Overall, I would give it an average overall rating with the potential to be much more."
good,"The work was challenging, but provided an opportunity to meet and learn from people in many diverse roles. The pay was not enough for me to meet my expenses."
good,People are taking it easy. There needs to be change in work culture. Management style has to change. I see lot of politics at management level. Its management heavy.
good,"The company as a whole form top to bottom is driven on sales. Not customer relationship building. There was no team building per say other than to badger the customers once a quarter to buy something. Mindset of the sales team was in and out, there was no customer relationship growth at all. The only thing sales was expected to do was bring in orders on a weekly timeframe. You were chastised if you missed on your weekly number. Not great quality management for a sales person who only has 8 accounts to work with. I did notice that most of the account managers only knew a little bit about each customer they had based on who was buying the products, not the other divisions within the account. No custom relationship building or customer trust for that matter."
good,"A good company, yet one must be ready to deal with the attributes of a big company."
good,"Customer facing, representative of Cisco, Expert in Troubleshooting."
good,"Innovation week annually. Every year, Cisco has one week reserved for innovation. The engineers have opportunities to work on their own idea. If an idea is ranked on the top, it will be funded."
good,"A typical day at Cisco is comprised of catching up on internal and customer emails, taking whatever work is in your queue and doing what needs to be done to resolve the issues."
good,"Nice place to work if you are looking for workplace culture. The compensation is lower than the industry average. One con would be the micro management, other wise great place."
good,"I have worked at Cisco on and off as contractor and FTE. The company has lost its mojo and tries to keep cutting costs. It has too many managerial layers. To get promotion, you must be liked by your boss and peers. Your promotion has nothing to do with working hard or producing results."
good,"I liked my experience at Cisco because I learned a lot by working with a lot of very smart people.  It is a very competitive place, so it is not good for someone who seeks work life balance.  I was well compensated, but along with it the compensation, I felt obligated t go more than was asked in order to remain relevant within the eyes of management.  The hardest part of the job is that I had to work with a lot of cross functional team members, but I had to do a lot of investigation to find out who I need to speak with to get what I need.  The company is very disparate, instructions tend to be very vague, and those who can come up with ways to solve things on his own the fastest wins.  I was constantly faced with balancing areas that are overly prescriptive with areas that were overly vague, yet management expect very specific outcome, and you don't necessary know what they are up front."
good,good work life balance and a fun place to work for. It is a great place ti have kids. My 2 kids were born while I worked at cisco. It is very challenging to work there !
good,"This was the first company I worked at when finishing up my technical degree and it has provided me great experience.  It also provides the flexibility for me to pick my daughter up from school when I need to and finish my day at home.  Unfortunately, I don't know if I see myself staying for a career.  There have been many LRs and I am not sure that there are many places to move to career wise now."
good,"Company pays very well, but does not promote often.  Fellow workers are great and jobs are challenging and rewarding.  Only problem is the company does a RIF every 6 months and it is difficult to stay employed there."
good,"Team inspired environment, which gives each employee an opportunity to learn every minute. The management can be a little negligent because of the virtual technology. The workplace culture is very divers. The hardest part of the job is to stay updated with the continues advancement of equipment, which changes very often. The most enjoyable part of the job was that you really never have to leave the campus. Anything you could possibly need is there. Like gym, showers, cafeterias, rest areas, play areas and plenty more."
good,Office timings were pretty flexible. Got to work on various modules. Gave me good experience to handle things. I had transparency in work hierarchy. Overall it was nice to work with such company.
good,"Cisco is a hard charging organization strong in technical thought leadership but high stress and low level of work life balance.  Not a family friendly organization."
good,Working at Cisco (work and benifits)  is great but from a corporate point of view not so good.  This review is from a remote office away from San Jose Headquarters.
good,"I have worked in a variety of positions at Cisco over the years and the opportunities exist to move from function to function which keeps it entertaining and exciting. "
good,"Nice place to work. It is an employee centric company. Work pressure is not much, depends on the project. Several cultural and social activities are carried throughout the campus."
good,Good place to work. Can learn a number of things provided a keen learner. A Big oranization which can sometime get you in mess. Good flexible schedule with extremely relaxed dress code.
good,"Challenging."
good,great opportunity with several different career paths to pursue. big pond with several opportunities to shadow and network in other career fields. worldwide opportunity.
good,"Cisco is one of the awesome places to work. The infrastructure, transport facilities & good hygiene is maintained overall.  However, the management sucks."
good,I worked at Cisco 10 years.  I enjoyed my time there especially with the divisions that I supported.  We had great managers as well as executives that cared about their organizations and would support you as you worked on different projects helping you excel in your career path.
good,"I really support the culture of service and contribution to the community at Cisco. As a contractor there, I have sometimes felt frustrated with the lack of clarity about opportunities that exist for becoming full-time or for advancement. I am still making the same salary as I did a year ago, after a year of hard work, and I'm having trouble paying my mortgage. Cisco does a lot for the community and asks a lot of their employees. It would be really nice if they also paid them better for their effort. Overall, I recommend the company for its people and culture, but would caution against getting an indefinite role as a contractor."
good,I believe that Cisco is an industry leader because the senior management teams know how to execute.  I always felt that there was a clear focus on what the objectives were and I felt satisfied in my work.
good,"I am focused on customers. I love to meet new people and know more about them and their projects. I am used to dealing with CEOs and CTOs and build strong partnerships with them. I am curious by the new technologies and trends of the market. I am a leader because I always need to share my ideas, experience and take the lead when it is necessary."
good,When the position was open and not being sent over to India it was quite enjoyable working at Cisco. I knew the job quite well and there wasn't a whole lot of micromanaging the employee's. Lunch's were nice and mostly the whole crew got along quite well. As far as benefits went they were far from the best and the pay was enough to get by. This was mainly due to the fact though I was a contracted position and not a direct hire through Cisco.
good,"I enjoyed working with Cisco, with good professionals with awesome learning and gained management skills."
good,Muy buena empresa para el aprendizaje de nuevas tecnologías y crecimiento personal y profesional
good,I am employed and associated with a brilliant team of competitive co-workers who strive hard the entire team to give the best. They are very friendly and lend a strong helping hand to the co-workers and always willing to help. The work is challenging and interesting.
good,"its good place to work and fun to be here. more opportinities to learn."
good,Cisco allows for working from home which is really beneficial for people with families.  It is awesome about training people and giving them opportunities to expand their skills.  Compensation is comparable with the market.  The people are super smart and the corporate culture is very collaborative and they love to give back.  One area of improvement would be to give folks clear career paths and more opportunities to move into other roles.
good,Location is great.  People and projects are exceptional.  Their growth rate is impressive.  Cisco continually rates as a great and fun place to work.  I would rejoin them in a heart beat.
good,". Overall very intense but fun place to work for."
good,Career development opportunities are possible only by creating good contacts in the company
good,Highly focused and disciplined.  This is a culture dedicated to sales and selling.  A con is that they are always trying to figure out the right organizational structure creating challenges to stay focused on the work as you are not sure if a decision will be made to exit a market in which you were working
good,I like the culture in the office. It's a flexible work environment but super busy to make a work life balance. The Job Security is the least because there is a Limited Restructure on a yearly or more basis
good,Its hard to get promoted or transfer within company and people being hired from outside immediately get a higher pay than those within who have been doing the same job
good,"Company has some very good technologies and solutions.   If you are committed to your customer, then everything is easy.   Get ready for long rewarding hours"
good,Dure mucho tiempo en esa empresa me senti a gusto ahi buenas prestaciones exelente ambiente laboral mis colegas muy buenas personas a veces se juntaba mucho trabajo hera muy dificil y a la vez entretenido porque se pasaba el tiempo mas rapido con mas trabajo.
good,"Things changed after 1 year I started.  Work environment changed, more demands and cuts here and everywhere.  Then a big layoff."
good,A typical day would be listed within my resume. I have learned many things during my 5 years within the company. Made wonderful lasting connections and the companies biggest asset is it's wonderful employees.
good,"cisco really stress on work life balance and they are very understanding when it comes to any inconveniences in work caused by your personal issues such as family related problems. "
good,"Incredible culture, but a pretty fast pace.   Things move quickly at Cisco, and you have to dive right in.    One of the best infrastructures of tools I've ever had access to in a sales related role."
good,"Co workers are great and willing to train when needed."
good,Best place to work and learn many things Day to Day. I personally enjoyed every day working and learning things with no pressure what so ever.
good,"I work remotely using Cisco WebEx Cloud Collaboration tools to engage subject experts in application security, network engineering, InfoSec, legal, HR, to complete security responses for RFPs/RFIs in 18-20 hours instead of 20 days.  By using an exception based approach, I shortened the response time as the Technical Project Manager-WebEx InfoSec case owner.."
good,"A great company to work, play, and learn. A bit slow in moving beyond senior manager role but compensates it's employees very well. Love working for last 13 years here and would definitely recommend."
good,"Enjoyed working at Cisco quite a bit. Engineering pool in the company is quite deep, amazingly talented and capable of consistent delivery of best-in-class products.  Learned a great deal, and was exposed to state of the art technology and vendors all the time.  Cisco is an incredible ""sand box"" of technology an engineer can play in, as it has enormous resources available to do so, especially when a decision is taken to proceed with a project."
good,"Release Manager at Cisco , excellent work culture and worked on new technologies but salary and benefits were insufficient"
good,"My personal experience at Cisco i would say is pretty good. Cisco has a good work life balance. I also believe it depends on the manager. My direct manager has always made sure we had work life balance. But family always came first. "
good,A good place to work with work hour and location flexibility. Benefits are reasonably good. Most of people work hard and extensively.
good,"The work load is fairly high, especially for a NOC environment. The compensation for that is minimal, which is really disappointing as I would love to stay here."
good,A typical day start with working on tickets and resolving issues. If there is a complex issue to resolve then I will lab it up to simulate the issue the customer is experiencing.
good,"I worked as a QA engineer qualifying/validating software for next generation switching platform products."
good,"Cisco has been a stable place to work.  Our onsite medical and benefits are convenient.  The upgraded open collaborative workspace environment is a plus.  I did not think I would enjoy it, but it's been great.  The most enjoyable part of my job is the flexible schedule that allows good work/life balance.  My coworkers are respectful."
good,"I enjoyed working in Cisco, the team was great and it was a great place to build my career."
good,"All decisions are collective.  50-200 votes required for even simple decisions can slow things down."
good,Cisco is a great place to work with a great culture and diversity.
good,"Good place to work, non-formal environment , helpful co-workers, new technologies to learn"
good,"Responsible for implementation and administration of a text analytics product called Clarabridge. Lead a proof of concept (POC) effort that included 10 vendors. Clarabridge is fed by customer, partner, and field survey data, along with customer and partner live listening events."
good,"Every day was different.  I got to work on all kinds of projects and everyone I worded with was the best.  Working with a Service Provider customer always kept things interesting.   My most enjoyable part of the job was coming up with creative solutions to problems the business units could not solve in a timely manor and other engineers wouldn't come up with, for example an IOS bug impacting collecting statistics.  I created a EEM tool that would run hidden commands and stitch it together to do the same job and get around the bug.  The hardest part of the job was getting the Business Units to deliver features the customer wanted.  There was always an excuse, either lack of funding or too many priority requirements from other customers, or anything else they could come up with.   It required constant attention and pressure to make sure we got the needed features."
good,"Very thriving environment, would've loved to work there longer."
good,"overall good place to work,good work life balence"
good,"* Workplace is fun and excellent"
good,It is a good place to develop a career.  You can always look for new positions internally if you are not happy with current one.
good,"my over all experience in my last company ie cisco was good."
good,"Challenging work, good work life balance."
good,"Great Company, nice co-corkers, always sharing and willing to train and transfer new knowledge."
good,"A good company to work for, but management plays games."
good,Heavy foot traffic in and out of the lobby and cafe. Checking in all incoming guest. Managing conference rooms and meetings for the day. Providing and assisting all customers and employee with company's information.
good,"Good company, good products, fair to employee, San Jose based.  People work for good boss.  Sometimes, a wrong person as supervisor can drive good productive people who truly deliver company's profitability out."
good,"It's a decent place to work with salary on a market level and good benefits."
good,Never give up attitude & teamwork and skills advancements.
good,I had a good experience with respect to managing the Team and work.
good,"Great people and products.  Good pay and benefits.  "
good,"Full of Partner and Customer meetings"
good,"A typical day surrounds escalation management, fighting fires, and problem resolution.  Relationship management, along with the ability to navigate through the company to obtain results for the customer is critical.   Additionally, performance management and development of reporting team is a big part of the position.  In many organizations,, the span of control is at its breaking point, making it difficult to give the time and attention to each employee that should be given."
good,"•a typical day at work"
good,The work was challenging but rewarding. Compensation was prohibitive but the work/life treatment was beneficial.
good,I work with very talented people. My job is challenging and rewarding. 
good,"Working within the GIS group, handling implementations for the Backups (Data Integrity Group) I split the time between acquiring and installing new or refreshed backup solutions while working in support of global data center realignments."
good,Cisco is a cutting edge technology designer and manufacture that compensates its sales team with comprehensive packages. The pace is fast and always changing with not enough hours in the day to keep up on all the latest and greatest..
good,Mostly relaxed atmosphere with talented people.
good,"A good place to work, coworkers are friendly. Cisco will keep you very busy on your work and if you need more then all you need to do is ask as there is more work then people available to work it."
good,Cisco is a workplace which is providing a very informal and employee-friendly work environment. Lots of productivity tools provided by the company helps you to achieve your objectives.
good,"I worked in Cisco for 11 years, I liked my stay. Would not hesitate to go back. Work life balance is good, you don't have slog 24/7 on regular basis. If you find a good manager who appreciates your work, it is even better. Fortunately I worked with really good managers and team."
good,"Great company to work for, strong culture and ability to advance skills if you are willing to learn. There are a lot of training opportunities and great work/life balance."
good,"Great company, with great leadership. It is a fun place to learn and develop. I highly recommend working for this company. The only negative is that because of the rate of acquisitions mid-management levels are typically overcrowded and there is a lack of focus on developing teams. It is very difficult to grow internally to director and VP levels."
good,Overall Cisco is a good place to work. Like every company has it's set of issues.  At times MGMT heavy and not in tune with local work force. A better job of listening to employees would help.
good,"Nice place to work"
good,"I started as a contractor and saw all the benefits available to employees, but I never saw anyone converted despite years of service. Unfortunate to see the talent walk out the door."
good,"Worked at Cisco Systems full-time for close to 10 years."
good,"The technology was good and interesting, it had option to work even on a bigger network plane."
good,"The company has good technology for engineers to work, good facilitate for engineers and very good compensation. However, due to projects get canceled very often, and teams disbursed which gives employees the in-stability feeling."
good,"Overal Cisco has a very good work environment  with multiple cafeterias, excersise rooms and medical facility.  Plenty of conference and quiet rooms...and hires quality employees...."
good,"They look for people that are very passionate about technology.  If applying for a technical role, be prepared to answer detailed questions.     Once you become a Blue badge, the benefits are good.   Most are hired as contractors first and are made regulars after proving themselves as top performers."
good,La cultura de la empresa intenta ocuparse del bienestar de las personas e incentiva la participación en proyectos de innovación de de bienestar social.
good,easy to get sucked in -- didnt take a vacation for 2 years -- work life balance was good but you certainly made up for it and were expected to...  otherwise you were worried about the semi annual layoffs
good,Cisco is a great place to work but it is not as global as it used to be. It is a fast-paced environment in which one will be expected to be involved in multiple initiatives at the same time and be very productive on all of them. Requires working hours flexibility  as most business is driven by PST hours.
good,"Everyone working extremely hard, but always in a collaborative group. Having the flexibility to work remote, at home, office, partner site was an added benefit to achieving great results."
good,"Pros: Things I love about Cisco are the people and the flexibility. Typically I go into the office 10-2 each day and on other teams, we either are 100% remote or go into the office once a week. "
good,"It was fun to deal with Cisco many years ago. Now not fun, IT security is annoying really. Even if you attach a USB drive to your laptop it is ringing the bell to your bosses."
good,"The pay was at or slightly above others.. opportunities if you can get into a group that isn't running hundreds or thousands of cases in the backlog.  With such high backlogs, it is advantageous to take weekend shifts to catch up and make some extra cash. 17 hour days at the end with no slowdown in sight.  I learned a ton, so a lot of my time was spent to invest in me with access to the labs, which are phenomenal."
good,The role was supposed to go for 12 months but the scope changed and contract will be ending by the end of this month. I need more job security and benefits.
good,Liberal environment that gave people the opportunity to showcase their skills and receive vital feedback to grow in their respective fields. Coaching was very informative as well.
good,Cisco is a great company.  You will need to be able to adjust to new approaches and industry trends in order to thrive.  I enjoyed the opportunity to lead teams and technology within the organization.
good,"Great Place to work "
good,"Day to day meetings, reports to different PM's of different departments.  Follow ups with different venders in other countries. Quiet work place. Hardest part managing enough time for different meetings in different part of country and globally.  Best part meeting the goals and dead lines."
good,"If you want to work in a company where you can manage your own time, Cisco is a good option. The management team is not the best due to its micromanagement style so, you have to learn how to deal with that."
good,As I was there for quite a while over time the money got tighter and there were fewer people to do what was an ever increasing amount of work. While still a good place to work it is not what it once was.
good,"Fast moving, lots of smart co-workers  around to assist you with technical positioning or general advice on selling some of more complex solutions.  Overall a very good company."
good,"Cisco has many interesting and varied projects, a great place to learn and grow professionally. Where Cisco could use improvement is in the job security field. The company relies too much on contract labor and does not allow contractors to remain more than 3 years in the same position."
good,"Typical work day consisted of Security/Emergency Dispatching and client requests for the San Jose Cisco Campus."
good,"A typical day would include working with stakeholders throughout the region (Canada, US, Latin-South America) ensuring network is operating per design.  Addressing other operational issues as required.  Dependent upon time of the quarter, countless meetings for upcoming network review.  "
good,"Nothing to add as this is a corporate company. Typical life is expected, with typical restructures on a monthly basis.  Do not expect too much of your typical job."
good,"Great company to work,good compensation,transparent culture"
good,"BEST OF CLASS BENEFITS, equally stress full environment, opportunity for growing is ok. but sometimes the upper management get really bossy and make you work as per they wish , bit of race within organization for recognition and fame. but still they are pretty good in availing facilities and other stuff."
good,"Spent over a decade working at Cisco，had the pleasure working with amazing leaders and co-workers. I have really enjoyed the work culture, career advancement opportunities, yes well as young parent benefits."
good,"Overall, the two summers I spent interning here were very useful (although the first more than the second). I learned how to work in a team and the process of delivering a product in IT. Everyone there is very nice although some people don't buy into the culture of the company. Cisco tries to be a cutting edge company even but its roots lie in the building blocks of modern tech companies."
good,En République Tchèque au sein d'une équipe multiculturelle j'ai travaillé pour Cisco pendant 6 mois
good,"Compensation was good, but you never new if you would survive the next layoff. Good benefits, good bonus and stock grants, but subject to your managers politics."
good,I think Cisco Systems was a casual schedule and work environment. I'd manage software installations and design environment setup for engineers. I learned JSON and prototyping dashboards for monitoring LSF and server VM's. The culture was pretty laid back. We had lots of meetings online so that the job itself was not interrupted. The hardest part of work was trying to engage others about my projects. The most enjoyable was the laid back atmosphere and the nice people at Cisco!
good,"Enjoyed the company,only discrepancy was the lack of career growth and management skills. The review is mandatory but i also did not have any cons until communication with management is regards to operation concerns."
good,Cisco is largest name in Networking however it depends how your team and your manager is. Good company to work and learn. Job security is little less than any other same level organization.
good,"Greate place to work and gain experience, however the ever frequent layoff was very demoralizing."
good,"Cisco is an amazing company to work for. Its very easy to become productive very fast in Cisco, since all information related to your job is on wikis. The people I worked with were very professional and technically strong, and my communication with them was always fruitful. One of the best features about working in Cisco was, if you ever needed to get information on something, not readily available, the person training you would record the Webex session, so you could play it afterwards to get the details resolved. That was an awesome time saver. And Cisco uses state of the art tools to get work done."
good,Been at Cisco a long time. The culture has always been the same in that bringing people together is more effective than tackling alone. I feel like they do a good job at making sure employees are respected but I wish they treated their contractors the same way. They seem to forget they help Cisco grow as well.
good,I have learned so much from my peers and test leads while working at Cisco. Cisco also provided trainings or classes on site. They were able to work around my schedule.
good,I enjoy working for Cisco. Very bright people with excellent thought leadership. Great culture and resources available for employee development. Cisco is a very compartmentalized company with myriads of BU’s. It sometimes create overlaps in the functions of these different groups.
good,"There is no better hardware & software company to work for, but because of Cisco's enormous portfolio, it is also like working for several competitors all at once.  During my 10 years there, the quota to commission ratio eroded tremendously for field sales people, and most of my team members did not make their quotas while a few did well.  Depending on your relationship with the regional manager, it is a phenomenal sales job if you are favored by the sales manager, and it is probably an average sales job in most cases if you are not."
good,"I have always felt that a structured and driven work environment coupled with the willingness for personal success is the cornerstone for a equally successful business. In my 22 plus years as a collector I have found one thing to be true and that is, that without the Personal Training, Financial Structure and a well informed Management Staff, Collectors will fail. The saying ""That it takes team work to make the dream work"" is as true today as it was when John Maxwell first said it."
good,"I worked in their Beijing office, what I really like is their product line and solution and I did learn a lot. Cisco does have great product, great engineer team. However, I feel the environment is very political. It is hard to focus on pushing forward under such environment, not suitable for those who want to do something great."
good,"This is a great company if you have a family and are looking for a stable, secure environment full of very talented, seasoned individuals. Overall, a great company to work for. They are trying hard to get millennials, but already a great company. Not as ""hip"" as other places, but still a great place to work."
good,"Its a good company with good work life balance, but job security is less. Good salary and benefits , bonus etc. No permanant  on site for Indian resources"
good,Cisco is a nice place to work and easy to fall complacent within your role.  I would recommend Cisco to anyone seeking employment within a large and established enterprise company.
good,My engineering teams were on point at all times.  Some individual members were majorly over leveraged.  My remote manager and communication style made some priorities hard to identify.  Identifying internal resources was often challenging
good,Long days.  Always on call (24/7) and politics often got in the way of progress. I had 3 bosses with one in San Jose another in Singapore and one in North Carolina
good,"Flexible work from home options...good pay.  Cisco strives to conduct business ethically, honestly, in accordance with the company's values and Code of Business Conduct"
good,"Cisco was by far the best corporate experience I've had - culturally.  "
good,"Nimble and very innovative company. The Leader in telecommunications equipment. Hard working people. Designing and validating the next gen router(s). The only thing I wish it would be better is better advancement opportunities, especially for consultants."
good,Cisco is a fast moving company where success is to be earned every day. There are many opportunities to get involved and do well. There is no slacking off.
good,"Large company with many projects on the go, training was adequite and professional work environment.  Resources get shuffled around a lot unfortunately and ownership of engineering tasks is too distributed."
good,"Cisco is a great company to work for but very tough to balance work & life. Recently with the continuous LR (Limited Re-structure) activities, everyone feels insecure and managers only need to protect themselves simply because no one is safe anymore...!!!"
good,"Great Compensatiotion, Competitive work environment with lots of egos.  Lots of very talented people.  Lots of politics.   Strong focus on building great products, strong GTM and sales culture.  Positive but stressful culture."
good,A workday at Cisco included multi meeting with cross functional teams. A manufacturing and process engineer was a unique position in Cisco culture. Product development schedule are both aggressive and challenging. The hardest pert of the job was meeting schedules. However the work was interesting and always state of the art.
good,"Great place to work.  Unsure about the future, layoffs happened yearly.  Salary was a bit under par for the position.  Worked for Scientific Atlanta / Cisco for nearly 18 years."
good,"15 years at Cisco ... I saw it all.  From it very earliest years to it's full maturity."
good,"Cisco Systems, Inc. is an American multinational technology conglomerate headquartered in San Jose, California, in the center of Silicon Valley, that develops, manufactures and sells networking hardware, telecommunications equipment and other high-technology services and products"
good,"Great place to work, excellent benefits, improved my skills in SQL and SaaS. Introduced to several new applications and I used the Tuition Reimbursement to further my education."
good,"Really enjoyed the work culture, quality of people and products. But company is going through transition and stability could be an issue."
good,"Cisco is an above average to great employer. In my time there, I met some of the smartest people I've ever know and learned much from them. Certainly one of, if not the, best places I've ever worked."
good,"Cisco was  a good place to work at if you were hired by Cisco and not one of the firms they contracted with to hire people. Employees hired by Cisco enjoyed many benefits that the contractors did, but the other contractors I worked with had an opportunity to shadow others who worked with the company in different capacities and potentially join those teams."
good,"Cisco typically only hires really smart, dedicated and talented people who work really hard and are good at what they do. It's a great environment from that perspective. Salaries are competitive, and benefits are really good."
good,"The tech industry is hot or miss. One second you're raking in the money, then next a cheap knock off takes a big chunk out of your revenue and you're out the door. That in a nutshell is why I was let go. Cisco was slowly moving away from consumer electronics. Folks were being let go and eventually a year or so after I was let go, the division was sold and formally shut down. Part of the reason was that upper management was more concerned about their image and patting themselves on the back, versus addressing competition."
good,"Es una gran empresa para trabajar. Sin embargo, hay recortes anuales desde hace ya varios años."
good,"Good company too many layoffs, no security.  No advancement for support staff but great benefits and good people that work in the trenches.  Pays well"
good,If you are curious about technology and connect with the right folks in your Org. you'll learn a lot. Great company and it's got global locations and programs to keep you educated.
good,"Cisco is a great place to work:"
good,"Flexible hours, flexible work (home / office), some managers were good, others not as much.  A bit political at times.  Managers sometimes assigned people they don't know how to manage"
good,"It is great working here, but the commute is too long. "
good,"fast paced environment and always changing (processes, management, etc).  Offers great deal of flexibility in exchange for hard work and dedication.  Full time telecommute options and great benefits."
good,"good benefits, interesting work, able to work on very large networks with latest and great hardware and software."
good,"The corporate benefits are great, but the work culture mostly depends on what group you are in.  Some are really encouraging of career growth and others love politics."
good,"Flexibility to work in the office or from home, allowing personal control over work/life balance.  Work was always interesting and challenging.  Lots of opportunities to learn."
good,"I enjoyed working here."
good,i learned alot from this company. we must be safe and secure the premises. we must handle any incidents that happened. update the incidents in the occurrence book.
good,Good not great culture. New management is shaky. Unsure of companies new direction. Good options for remote workers. Stock dividend is a plus when purchasing ESPPs.
good,Love that the team members are very helpful and is always there when I need help. I learned a lot from my team mates and on my own when given the freedom to work on a project with minimum directions.
good,"Benefits and salary is good. Ethical .."
good,"Cisco is a great place to work. The management team is shallow, Company is trying to reinvent itself. It pays really well for top performers. You have a lot of flexibility with work-life."
good,The culture used to be much better but changed over the years as revenues declined. Direction of the company is uncertain and there is a lot of moves/changes and also layoffs.
good,Good experience overall. Many things to learn and enhance yourself. Again if the team is good one loves working there. Hence till now it is good for me.
good,"Good work-life balance"
good,"Typical day involved updating and reviewing work activity, SFDC and customer meetings.  API's, Integrations and Bots are changing the face of how we Collaborate.  Short sighted on management everyone always worried about getting  impacted. If you come in through an acquisition your days are numbered usually within the first two years you will be let go.  It's just the culture of a big corporation doing their job acquiring instead of creating IP and then downsizing once assimilated.  The people and products are amazing, HR has little to know input on everything.  From the outside looking in great benefits and exciting technologies."
good,"Great company , great products.  Exciting product portfolio. Great teammates. Gives opportunities to solve challenging problems. Employee perks and additional benefits are great."
good,"It is a great company, however, politics play a major role. It is definitely a ""who you know"" and not a ""what you know"" atmosphere.  Overall, the company is well liked and does provide opportunity to grow and advance."
good,Cisco is an amazing company.  Only downfall is seeing the lack of care for personal well being given the lack of work/life balance.Must breathe Cisco.
good,"A typical day at work consisted of handling new cases, customer contact and communication with the engineering department. We also worked closely with customer service for warranty issues. I learned a lot about computer networking. The Management was over bearing and invasive. Workplace culture was to work hard. Hardest part of the job was dealing with micro manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was setting up issue recreates, testing, documenting and interacting with Product Engineering team."
good,"Great and smart people to work with, however, career path is slow and you feel lost in the large enterprise environment. if you are looking for a stable and safe place then Cisco is a great work environment. however, for someone used to fast pace and constant challenges you may feel that Cisco is not using your full potential."
good,"It's a nice place to work if you don't mind repetition. The people are trained very well and the work atmosphere is generally nice.There isn't much job security, which can be stressful to most people."
good,Cisco has changed since I was there but the folks I know who are still there still like their jobs and the company as a whole. Cisco brand is well known in the IT industry and although the pace was very fast it was still a fun place to work.
good,"I felt I made a specific difference in the quality of the code for the very important 3750 products we were testing! We actually started the System Test team and I took on the Layer 2 area and found a good share of the bugs every release just by having a good configuration with my topology. It also taught me a lot about Layer 2 data communications which is what I needed to know!! Which allowed me to move faster to get my first CCNA. The propelled me from the Telecom world to the data communications world which I have been living in for the last 17 years now. So, yes, its been a good switch for my career."
good,Consultant for 9 years and employee for 5. Good work life balance and reasonable pay. Very challenging to advance and even find lateral experience anymore. Annual mass layoff's creates a bit of an oppressive work environment and hinder creativity and desire to do more.  Cisco is so large and complex that is moves at a snails pace most of the time.
good,Was always very busy with deadlines for milestones but had fun with the people I worked with. Could be very stressful at times with insufficient time to complete tasks.
good,"Dependiendo del rol puede ocurrir que haya que viajar bastante, pero el Home office termina compensando los viajes."
good,Cisco presents many opportunities to diversify your career experiences whether it be in the direct sales or partner organization.  Beware of the experiences and roles your direct and second-level leadership have had as a word to the wise.
good,"Built the first Cisco government program for SLED and Fed markets, took 2 percent market share to over 26 percent market share during my tenure.  During my tenure received six different accolades from Tech Data for my success in driving sales and overall customer support"
good,"Good work place to work."
good,"Un dia tipico, entrar muy temprano a trabajar directo a las lineas de produccion, revisar las estan listas para el cambio de modelo y las que se quedaron para reparar."
good,"Working at Cisco is a dedicated full time job. Not a single moment goes without some excitement either in releasing new products or running for marathons. Started as an individual software engineer and soon got to work as project lead heading a team of 8 people. Now getting to work on all aspects of Project Management, Software Product development, tactical planning, customer engagement while demonstrating success in leadership, critical thinking, problem solving and analysis. Getting diverse knowledge and experience with various software development methodologies, product development, software engineering, reengineering, and solution integration of heterogeneous systems using B2B REST Api’s.  Currently collaborating with diverse and geographically distributed teams to get proof-of-concept prototypes of new product features.  "
good,It provides enough challenges and opportunities to work in an organisation where work life balance is given the priority.Depending on the team and the department you will appreciate the overall work experience.
good,Cisco workforce is an excellent one.  Problem is upper management does not always appreciate them; ie layoffs 4 out of 5 years. Upper management could be better served with a vision to the changing markets moving forward.
good,I loved Cisco but it's easy to stay there and get used to the culture and never leave and discover what's beyond it's doors. It's a really secure company. Know that you could be there for years and never leave.
good,"Provided opportunity to be free thinker and to lead without oversight. Culture is extremely collaborative with great partnership. The management teams I worked with do not micro manage and allow you to build your own path, but yet they help set direction. The biggest challenge in a large organization is determining who or what department can assist with your challenge.  My biggest skill I learned was to continually communicate and develop materials that are quick and to the point that reach Executive level"
good,"I have been with Cisco for over 15 years.  It used to be a great place to work with amazing, creative people.  Over the years, upper management seems to be focused on eliminating the veterans in favor of new college grads.  I think if you are starting out, it can be a good place, but don't expect to make it a long-term career choice.    The hardest part of the job is massive layers of management.  The best part of the job is the flexibility of working from home, PTO, and health benefits."
good,"I love working at Cisco b/c the job is interesting and challenges me daily. I just wish Cisco was not so contract-employee based and invested more money into hiring full time, qualified employees."
good,"Cisco pays well compared to competition "
good,"A very data & commitment driven organization with clear focus on deliverables. If you are looking to work in a very competitive environment with an hunger for technology, products & services & growth then you should consider taking up a career with this company."
good,"Good people."
good,"Very talented team, top in the market, always fun and creative working amongst them."
good,"This company does not slack off with monetary rewards for dedicated service and provides whatever is needed to get the job done.  Working with others in any group in the company is highly encouraged and supported if required.  However, upper management is severely distanced from the workers in the trenches and with excessive bureaucracy, new products can only be added to the portfolio through acquisitions.  The excess jobs requires a rebalance and restructuring annually with a reduction of 5% to 20% of the worldwide workforce."
good,Cisco is filled with great people that make up the unique culture.  It is a big company and sometimes hard to get things done but overall Cisco is a good place to work. They give you the tools to work from anywhere in the world. The C Suite and VPs are going through some changes and the reverberations can be felt at all levels.  It will take some time and strong leadership to get through this and come out ok.
good,You are expected to work hard. Its a fun job. Working on new technology and moves very fast. Leadership is strong but it is constantly changing. Lots of great people working hard and working toward a common goal.
good,The company is really focused on transitioning from and hardware based product company to cloud based services.  Cisco seems to be on the right track to execute on this vision.
good,"Very Political Environment"
good,Cisco is a good place to work if you are interested in learning new technologies and getting hands on experience with all of the latest industry trends.  Flexibility in terms of hours and location (WFH) is generally very good.  The yearly restructuring and layoffs put a damper on morale.
good,"Cisco is an employee friendly company, Very long hours, no progression, slow in making decisions. "
good,Terrific opportunities for growth and responsibility along with autonomy during growth years. A much different organization today. A maturing industry leader with established policies and procedures that need to be followed - conform or move on.
good,Cisco use to be the star in the valley. The management focus on operating cutting cost rather taking big risks with new ideas. Eventually the company is falling behind even Cisco has lot of cash in the bank
good,"Cisco is a generally a good company to work with balanced work and life, good benefit and reward, a creative and fun place to work and learn.  "
good,"Its a good company with good work life balance. Its a great place to work, with good co-worker's no mental stress. I have been working here since past 4 years and for a better career looking out for a job change"
good,"* Collaboration is key."
good,"Enjoyed lot of meeting with higher officials more and"
good,"It's not Google or Facebook, but it's still a good place to work."
good,"Cisco Systems is great in adapting and transforming its work place to current industry standard, introducing a more fun workplace for employees. "
good,Cisco is difficult to move around unless the group you want to move to has clout to bring you over.  There is a great deal of upper-level political manuevering that impacts day-to-day work
good,A exciting place to be. I learned a lot of new technologies during my stay at Cisco. Individual contributions are not always recognized.
good,"All the days used to same .i learned the basics about server handling,Management was ok.Co-workers were friendly and helpful.There is no such hardest part till now."
good,"A good place to learn networking. "
good,"Customer's satisfaction, email correspondence,technical skills and proper issuing license to the IT expert clients globally. Maintaining high standard process on how to deal with the customer correctly."
good,"Cisco is a great place for individual development with respect to newer technologies as the focus is always to adopt and learn the best available technology and tools available for the solution. However there are sects of middle management who think otherwise, which is a hurdle for professional advancement. Some groups adopt the laid back attitude, while others have focused and aggressive goals. It depends which group.project you belong to which will shape up your career path."
good,Love the opportunities to work with Enterprise Puppet. When work was available. I like the opportunity to design as well as offer concepts for the design of Enterprise Puppet Infrastructure.
good,"Very good company to work as a employee.  I liked the variety of"
good,"Good company with good benefits. Unfortunately, hard to advance outside of San Jose. "
good,You'll love the people! Management has your back! It may be hard to transition to a position that you are passionate about.
good,"Cisco is giving you much in terms of technology. self-developing, however compensations is not the strongest side in Cisco"
good,The used to be on the bleeding edge but now they are just a marketing firm that builds nothing and advertises for millions of dollars a pop on professional athletic event boards.
good,"The company itself practice work & balance culture, super flexible schedule, fantastic work place & fun people to interact with."
good,"Cisco is a great place to work, but make sure you start on the right side of the tracks. Starting out in support is a great place to gain exposure, industry insight and familiarity with products but it is never a wise long term career choice. "
good,Good place to work but salary appraisal can be given based on merit and performance and not via partialism/politics. Great place to get exposure to the newer technology.
good,"Cisco has many different career opportunities both in a corporate environment and working with customers.  While working within a corporate environment there are typically opportunities to work remotely, from home.  "
good,"Very relaxed and comradery is encouraged among our team."
good,"Great work culture and flexibility ."
good,"Cisco offers good compensation and benefits and a diverse workplace with strong non-discrimination policies.  Most of the people are quite good at what they do."
good,"Typical day includes attending stand-up and working with other devs."
good,"Cisco is the first Client I worked for after joining IT."
good,Helping greeting guest when they first walk into store. Assisting customers with gathering final purchase. Hardest part of job having to carter to everyone's budget. Excelled well with meeting store goals and quotas for day's and month's.
good,"Cisco has a shared culture of hard working great people all around the world with an attitude of ""we can do it."""
good,"Cisco is a good place to work but recently their 4th year in a row layoffs in the summer have made it no longer a desired place to be."
good,Great culture; knowledgeable collogues and good work-life balance.
good,This was my first corporate experience. Great exposure to how to adapt the business to a changing market and grow your skills. Wide range of management being not experienced to very saavy. Just be sure you join a team where you have the fit and expect to transition on a 1-2 year cycle to stay relevant.
good,Management of innovative campaigns kept my skills sharp.  Enjoyed working with VAR counterparts.  Sometimes not enough work to do
good,Cisco is a big company with a lot of resources.  There are always opportunities within the company that people can give it a try.  The management here is pretty good.
good,"a typical day at work"
good,"its a good company to work with. It is slower culture with double works, departments or business units."
good,Meetings with cross functional teams daily to discuss software development processes.
good,Generally a good place to work for but work load can be quite heavy with the lack of supporting resources.
good,Cisco is a good company to work. everyone respect each other and recognize efforts.
good,"Great experience.  Ethical, fair and treats employees well.  Interesting work to do.  Supportive of rotating jobs.  Endorses working from home which makes balancing work and life easier to do."
good,"Great market share and margins. CEO is inspirational, too many of his direct reports aren't running the same plays that he is. They undermine the growth that should be happening. Too many of them are comfortable."
good,"Cisco is probably the best place for people to want to learn about new technologies. But that comes at a cost, it is difficult to grow up the hierarchy"
good,Its good place to lean new technologies. Cisco has been an excellent employer
good,A great place with culture promotes job work and life balance but lack of advancement opportunities for people with ambition and good performance
good,Cisco has been a great place to work. We have gone through a few rough patches but the leadership team has helped us push through
good,"Great place to work, work/life balance was great, coworkers work as a team."
good,Cisco 's work environment is exceptional and total work life balance.
good,Over all it was a fantastic experience with the staff and management who were really co-operative as I was in the early stage of my career.
good,"Cisco used to be a great company, but now it is struggling to fend off competition especially from VMWare."
good,Has been a memorable journey with Cisco for more than 8years.
good,"A good team to work with"
good,"Good place to work, good people, good pay and benefits.   Hard to impossible to get promoted.  Director level mgt is poor.  Lost of change."
good,Cisco is a world class networking company. What can I say that has not already been said?
good,"Good place to learn and grow, experienced team members, dynamic senior management"
good,"Good technology to do work."
good,"Depending on one's interests, there were opportunities to take various training offerings to expand one's domain of expertise. If one looks enough, you'll find some very bright people to work and collaborate with."
good,"Ottimi ed intensi rapporti con i colleghi di lavoro. Apprezzabili benefit aziendali, quali auto e assicurazione."
good,Cisco provides a good working environment for software engineers working with networking technologies.
good,Great company and support system.  But increase politics as more and more companies were being acquired. Some turf wars and back stabbing began to surface.
good,"Mobile, collaborative & collective work environment. Close interaction with cross-functional teams across geographies. Flexible working from home & remote location is highly acceptable and part of normal operation."
good,"Cisco is one of the largest companies in the Bay Area."
good,"Overall, Cisco affords an individual access to many job roles."
good,Always lots of work and people interested in helping each other.
good,"Ever changing, fast paced environment"
good,Cisco is a company that emphasizes diversity and inclusion as well as social responsibility. Fast paced environment with constant changes and transformations to adapt to market conditions.
good,Learnt and Excelled as Quality Assurance Analyst and Business Analyst.
good,"Cisco is moving into Cloud based products, my 2 WebEx products were key leaders of that new plan."
good,"Coordinating with Team and Reporting to Team Lead, Peer Review meeting is the most fun to do and learn rectification within the team."
good,i am working as IT analyst at STS Techonology
good,"Leading edge working with Telepresence, Automation products, UC, Phone and video, VoIP, Webex"
good,Cisco is a wonderful place to work. You have the feeling that you're always working with smart people who are changing the world.
good,A great business and technology environment in the middle of a crisis from the strategic perspective and with big internal issues from the organizational standpoint. Good working environment
good,"Good place to learn and work, good benefits, reasonable work schedule"
good,Working there is a nice opportunity to learn about new technologies and work in a helping team environment. Here there is an opportunity for trainings on new technologies too.
good,Great culture and people with the atmosphere.  Cut throat environment if you are a contractor.  Change is always happening so if you don't like change you will not survive here.
good,"Cisco is a great place to work with great culture, personal development and work place flexibility in working schedules. There is always room for new learnings and development."
good,"I made lot of friends while I was Cisco systems. Commute to Milpitas was less than 30 minutes from San Jose. But, the application I worked on was complicated and learning curve was steep."
good,The people there are awesome and the job is demanding. The people I have worked with are passionate people and they are extremely intelligent individuals.
good,The time started out well but there is way more work than they expressed. There is an issue with processes that make things more difficult and take longer than necessary. Unfortunately I do not see any changes any time soon.
good,The most enjoyable place to work and out of work from home option. The workplace culture is good and peoples are very friendly. We have a lot of labs which really makes us learn a lot
good,It was a 6 month (Proof of Concept) project but the work was very interesting.  The teams were all remote (local and international) but that did not hinder the project.
good,Productive and fun work place for Employees but Contractors are having very difficult time supporting 24*7 on production support areas. Typical work day is around 10 hours.
good,Great as I work every day . Good place to learn. Good culture and collabortive environment. Great management and HR policies. Open environment providing growth
good,"Ottima azienda ho imparate moltissime informazioni riguardo PC, smartphone, videosorveglianza e sicurezza sul lavoro"
good,There is never a shortage of work that needs to be done and working with engineers in a fast-paced environment is very rewarding knowing that your contributions are helping accelerate development and productivity.
good,"Cisco provides a great work-life balance. Employees get the freedom to innovate at work. Even though the base salaries are in the median range, the target bonus percentage covers up."
good,New business development and management of public sector account in the state of IL.  Established new relationships by providing solution based sales.
good,"Began my Cisco journey in an 8-5, global customer experience role working with Technical Engineers and Sales Team. Currently a contract employee, so lacking some of the same benefits as traditional employees; however, Cisco is quick to hire when the opportunity presents itself."
good,"Interning at Cisco, San Jose during this summer has been one of the best things for me. I got good amount of exposure, met talented people, had a lot of perks, had great work-life balance and learnt a lot."
good,Good work-life balance but growth is slow. It is a big ocean. To stand out from the crowd you need to perform very very good. Hikes are not good. Culture is good.
good,"Nice environment to work  in. working with real talented people"
good,Good benefits. work life balance. Hard to grow and get promotion in higher grades. Frequent org and strategy changes. Little transparency in promotion cycles
good,Cisco Systems is a world leader in networking software and equipment. It is also a very good employer. If you are on contract and have done a good job they will make every effort to bring you back as a permanent employee.
good,"Great people to work with."
good,Good place to learn. Not great at recognition and reward. Not many opportunities to advance. Used to be flexible and remote friendly but less so when I left.
good,"Decent work environment, but rather bureaucratic and process-driven. Access to resources not that great, and employees did not seem particularly empowered."
good,"Stressfree Friendly, Helpful willing to work with you on issues that arise from questions of direction of the projects. The break area always clean. Fruit on Wednesdays."
good,Cisco gives considerable autonomy in completing work assignments. The workplace culture is amazing. The most enjoyable part of the job is working in a team environment and the level of collaboration required to be effective.
good,"Day starts with meetings first half mostly,. Learned automation and other technical skills on pega etc. workplace culture is very nice and execellent."
good,Company has been trying hard to change direction and market itself as a software and services company. Stock price is going up and we are seeing the results of all the hard work.
good,"Excellent benefits and pay"
good,Overall my experience at Cisco was positive. People were great to work with and company compensated employees well both in salary and benefits. Lots of change happening in the company made things challenging at times but overall things were good.
good,"Cisco is awesome - great culture which has only improved with Fran leading the charge.  But Cisco is still subject to only being as good as it's leaders.  And I've had more ""poor"" leaders than good solid leaders.  Too much favoritism and too many ""good old pal"" networks and cliques.  It's starting to change, and the company is getting younger and more agile... but it's gotta also bend and invite new leaders in."
good,"There are good learning opportunities and you will be assigned to "
good,"1. Salary - Average to good salary, very less salary hikes"
good,Very good company to work for and build my leadership skills.  I had the chance to really drive home successful skill led sales while working in a very competitive environment.
good,"Great Work/Life Balance"
good,"When Cisco was a young company in the 1990's, it was a very exciting and professionally rewarding environment.  Employees were empowered to cross boundaries of responsibility so as to drive the business in new directions.  Over time the culture evolved into one that became very political and inhibiting environment where many walls were erected which fostered negative behavior of others. Many innovators began leaving to other companies that were more receptive to new ideas and business models.  The secret to succeeding in Cisco is political alignment and internal networking to establish a base for influence."
good,I enjoyed working at Cisco but over time it has become unstable with many layoffs.  The benefits are great and most of the people are a well.  Overall it was a good experience
good,"- Its a company with it culture built on behaviors like trust, being ethical,  caring and fairness."
good,"Cisco leadership and throughout the company really emphasizes the values of integrity, collaboration, giving back and healthy work/life balance and personal well being."
good,"Very business like work environment."
good,"Due to scale of an enterprise company, you have to navigate through the politics to be successful. Sometimes it seems like people have their own agendas as well"
good,"work life balance well. But the management level is too complicated, always organization changes.Company has not much innovations. If the company can provide more internal job recommendation, it would be better."
good,"What more can I say? It's a great place to work."
good,"The work environment and resources are great.  The opportunity for training and advancement is great.  Even management, for the most part, is great.  Cisco, however, has ""limited restructuring"" yearly.  Most of the time it is not based on lack of work or job performance.  The layoffs tend to be directed at certain acquisitions or locations only.  Once, the two engineers, the project manager, and the engineer's manager were all impacted because of their location.  The customer desperately reached out to these contacts for support, but wasn't able to reach anyone.  The customer was never informed of the changes and pulled the project.  That was a 1-year $5M contract lost to HP due to cuts made by upper management in ignorance.  What looks good on paper is not always the best course of action."
good,"Good work culture, collaborative teams, Meaningful work, very good management teams, decently good work life balance. Org changes are quite frequent and dynamic though."
good,They don't convert many from temp to full-time unfortunately but besides that pretty darn amazing company to work for. It is hard for them to retain employees. They many re-orgs and it causes anxiety for many.
good,"Good company to work for, although because of it's size it's difficult to affect change. Great work/life balance and flexibility to work from multiple locations."
good,"The people are fantastic, my job required working with teams from around the world, so meetings where from early morning to late evening hours. I loved working there."
good,Great place to work.  You need to take control of your career and manage it using all the resources that are available.  Always be ready to move.  Don't get complacent.
good,"There is some truly useless management here, and they will do whatever it takes to keep their moderate-to-well-paying job for doing nothing more than scheduling meetings."
good,"This company is very aggressive in adding product functionality. They are very flexible in work environments to help complete their products.  Our team is literally worldwide, with several areas in TX, other parts of the US, Canada, and as far away as India and Belarus.  It's an experience everyone should have, to see what can be done in a worldwide team!"
good,"A good place to work and learn, more process oriented and happy to work. New technologies and advanced concepts can be learned here  while working with highly technical and performing teams"
good,"Over the course of my 19 years at Cisco, I experienced the company's transition from a ""whatever it takes to get the job done"" to a much more structured & bureaucratic culture with frequent organizational changes often coupled with many restructurings creating an anxious environment and less than stellar job security.  That said, Cisco is a giant in the industry that is incredibly successful due to the large number of highly intelligent and driven professionals.  Compensation and benefits are very competitive and high performers are recognized and rewarded handsomely."
good,"Good company to be part of.Flexible working hours, and good environment.Company has a transportation facility and lot of sports activities conducted yearly."
good,"Overall a wonderful company to work for.  Excellent individual contributors, with pockets of intense politicking.  Focus on benefits recently, and the transformation of the company has been noticed.  Large enough company to rotate into many orgs.   Advancement difficult."
good,"the leadership over the past 10 years has increasingly become afraid of making decisions. instead the mantra is to 'empower' those who work for them to make decisions on their own. while this may seem like a reasonable (positive) direction in theory, in practice it's only used to allow 'leaders' to avoid responsibility when decisions are bad and to take credit when they are good."
good,"Cisco was a wonderful place to work 23 yrs to date. Remote workers are fading  losing their jobs due to constant LR Restructuring and moving more and more engineers to Mexico. "
good,Cisco is a great stepping stone for the start of someone's career also excellent for working mothers. Conveniently located in the south bay area. I definitely recommend Cisco.
good,"in Cisco, I got to work, had job security, had a decent pay check. people around me were good. This wasn't the cutting edge tech job though. Most of the teams are maintaining the software written and accumulated for last 2 decades."
good,Cisco has provided great flexibility in letting employees work remotely and providing excellent work life balance. The people there are great and they've built a phenomenal culture. Layoffs can happen unexpectedly to employees and their compensation is not on par with other companies
good,I had a good time there. I have really enjoyed the work culture and overall quality of team and work.  Worked on excitimg domain and learned new technologies.
good,"Highly experienced and motivated workforce, creates an environment of learning from others and improving capabilities."
good,"A barrage of work, but attempts by management to streamline process. Training was black and white so there was no misinterpretations of expectations. Would have liked more opportunity for growth."
good,Duo Security is an amazing culture to be a part of.  Management is very focused on ensuring that your work contributes to iteh companies success.  Everyone has a voice here which is very exciting and unique.
good,"Cisco was an excellent company with a culture of teamwork to resolve issues and learn at the same time."
good,"Cisco has relaxed and productive work atmosphere. Time is flexible for all of technical employees. People usually cooperative, supportive and empowered. I really enjoyed working in Cisco."
good,"Cool place to work but management is old school. They need some new blood and new methodologies to stay relevant. Although they keep saying we are a software company, a lot of people do not want to move away from hardware"
good,A very structured work with very clear instructions to follow. Good mentoring. Management conducts weekly staff meeting so that everyone in the team is one the same page. Also weekly one-on-one meeting to make sure that issues are communicated.
good,Has a ping pong table. Friendly and helpful colleagues. Huge campus. Good benefits. It is a leader in Networking industry. So the workplace has a lot of sharp people.
good,"Everyday is new learning "
good,"Cisco has a very dynamic, fast-paced, and cross-functional corporate culture.  Empowerment is an added-value for all players to be creative and innovate to their individual thinking to share with peers, colleagues, and management team."
good,1st joined CISCO as a cisco police officercabd was deployed as a bank guard officer and in fact less than a year i was Then transfer to a VIP department where we are deployed at a minister resident . I get to worked with people from a cross the world and got the chances to communicate with the members of public . We will deployed there for 6 hours and during this 6 hours we need to ensure that every thing is in order and under control . Have to be alert at all times .
good,Good company with great infra. Work is good and on latest technologies. Would love to have more travel opportunities to San Jose Cisco though. Located in a prime location in Bangalore and a hige campus to boot.
good,"Working at Cisco provides a challenging environment while learning new things every day. The compensation is outstanding."
good,"Cisco is good company to work with now also it provides lot of other facilities like gym,club,play grounds,free breakfast and cab , doctor in campus.."
good,"Cisco is a great place to get some great work experiences. Cisco allows you to seek out what you want to pursue as your next career move. Unfortunately, you are so busy with current work, it is often hard to find the find for the next step in your career."
good,"It is a great company to work with and to grow your career. The company has a lot of  career opportunity in different area. However, there are layoff regularly via organization change which is normal for high tech companies"
good,"I didn't get into the nitty gritty aspects of working there so I don't have much information. My mom works there and she let me know of some work that needed to be done, because they didn't have the time to hire someone. So I went in and helped out for a couple of months. It was a pretty laid back work environment."
good,"As a consultant, I was provided many opportunities to develop skills, provided training, and allowed to grow as an industry M&A expert with a great team."
good,This is good company to work for but It is very stressful because it lays off employees very often. It has very good tools and good products. The company allow all empolyee to go out at least 4 hours for fun in every quarter
good,"Good environment, poor management. Very good extra-curricular activities to be in shape such as basketball and volleyball tournaments. Good platform to begin an IT career."
good,Cutting edge technology. Global player. Results oriented. Dispersed teams. My role was managing the technology partner ecosystem. This was very varied and extremely enjoyable. My goal was to find a win-win formula for the partner and Cisco. I worked with partners from across the globe in the Unified Communications domain.
good,Cisco is a great place for work/life balance but there is a cost to that flexibility - raises and promotions are very hard to come by and bit political the process is.
good,"Good work,"
good,"The pay and benefits are good. They have a good work from home policy. It's stressful to work at Cisco because you can be laid off any given day you go to work, no matter how talented you are. Talented people are arbitrarily laid off all the time."
good,"At first the work was very rewarding. Great travel to South America and domestic, but then all PMs worked from home and no travel. No more face to face with customers. Cisco also has the problem of trying to force the customer and partners to comply with their policy and software making a very difficult relationship often. Pay and benefits were really good but the stress of the constantly changing and failing processes erodes relationships within Cisco and with customers and partners. I hope they find their way some day"
good,A typical day at work included brainstorming on different scenarios that would lead to a certain bug. This would involve collaborating with various peers and managers to come up with a probable reason for the bug. There was a good mix of work and collaboration at work.
good,"People are nice to each other, compensation is very good in Dallas area, working hour can be long, but flexible."
good,"Enjoyed the flexibility of the work involved at the company; a typical day at work included going into the office and communicating with my team members on daily objectives, and freely working towards those objectives with the resources provided. The most enjoyable part of the job involved being able to work with experienced individuals and learn from shared experiences."
good,Worked there for 5 years with all other areas of the job itself were fine besides the advancement section. No wiggle room to move up and seemed to be more cuts than anything else.
good,"Due to the size of Cisco there are always new opportunities to explore, your role can be quite diverse and vary but this is up to you to create and drive. Flexible working is great, however it can become difficult to switch off from work."
good,"Great place to to work as anew hire and gain experience. "
good,"Good work - life balance. "
good,"I love this company! I was able to work from home 100% of the time. The workload is demanding however, doable! I found myself working harder and being more detailed and more productive since I was able to work from home, I gave more of myself to the company :)"
good,"If you have a problem with biweekly commit calls and dealing with forecast accuracy and cadences , then CIsco is not the place for you , but it's a great company to gain a lot of knowledge and experience to further your career"
good,I found Cisco to be an exciting environment which allowed me to expand my skill set while working with state-of-the-art solutions. Everyone was a team player & did what was needed to deliver an exceptional customer experience. I enjoyed evangelizing and demonstrating Cisco solutions to a wide cross section of customers from around the globe.
good,Cisco's assets are it's people. Much collaboration internally to engage customers efficiently and accurately. Dedicated individuals willing to take that extra step.
good,"Contracted for Cisco, good company, good management.  Lawrenceville, GA. campus was large with cafeteria, coffee shop and gym on-site, electric vehicle charging stations in parking decks."
good,"Good Benefits, career advancement is very good.  Ability to move within the company.   Total compensation is very good. "
good,"Good Working environment "
good,"Work hours depend from one department to another. For the most part, I've had very flexible work hours and can work from wherever and whenever. I don't have a strict schedule which is definitely one of the reason why I've stayed at Cisco. Overall compensation package isn't bad. However, salary and stock options are onthe low end compared to other tech companies."
good,"Cisco is a large company that operates like one.  It has a flexible culture, but runs largely on who you know.  A typical day would involve putting out fires (caused by someone else) and CYA.  The hardest part of the job was having to sit through meetings.  The most enjoyable part of the job was interacting with vendors."
good,Very challenging but rewarding work. Very large company with many silos. Navigating them can be difficult. But the work is very interesting and the company is a premier brand. Customer success is a high priority.
good,"I have been with Cisco for nearly 5 years. Recently all the product development has moved to Agile methodology of development. The mid management still have waterfall mindset and so expect status updates rather than allowing Engineering teams to drive the product. Some of the product owners have no clue on the requirements and depend entirely on Engineering to collect the requirements. "
good,"Great place to work, but beware of the continuous limited reductions in force.  I feel corporations owe it to employees to do all they can to keep them employed and if there is a need to reduce force, employees should be given a year of severance."
good,"Typical day at work was hands on and interactive,"
good,"I've enjoyed a long time at Cisco, met tons of great people, and worked on many interested (and sometimes challenging) projects/products/services for Cisco, and for Cisco's customers/partners (within support)."
good,"I found Cisco to be a great environment for remote collaboration with teams word-wide.  Managers were fair and responsive."
good,"If you're prepared to  put in some hours this is a great place to work, exposure to the latest and greatest technologies, empowered to make the right choice for the customer and the company, but this does come with long hours."
good,"Flexibility, relaxed, lots to learn, fast paced, "
good,"My last role had many layers and it was very interesting. Initially, a lot of the management focus was on Opex and some of the tools we were forced to use to track Opex could have been better. It was a lot of fun to connect the dots starting from how the skus were set up, revenue recognition considerations, how supplier security or the lack of it (single supplier) could impact product shipment and revenue/gross margins, management and process considerations in taking a new product to market. Workplace culture depends on the team you are with and it can vary a lot. The most enjoyable part was the work itself."
good,Loved collaborating with many  teams.  You learned something new daily.  Resources are bountiful and work and life balance are great.  Dress is very casual much like the environment.
good,"The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability to continually learn new technologies, and be challenged it. Generally speaking, the Cisco culture supports their employees and a strong workplace culture."
good,"If you are a newbie, energetic, careless about the management reporting layers and wants to grow your career then this is the place for you.    Great benefits, good opportunity to learn existing and new technologies while the company is in the process of transferring itself to the digital age."
good,Great company in transition to SW and Recurring revenue streams. Innovation is driven by acquisitions. New teams remains independent for long time and that makes the Marketing job extremely challenging
good,"Worked there a long time, learned a lot, got to experience lots of different roles but tough to advance from a career perspective as pretty political.  Cisco is trying it's best to make itself a SW company but thus far has not made the cut."
good,"Empresa dinâmica com produtos de última geração."
good,"Projects in Cisco are very well orchestrated with good coordinating among teams that dot the i's and cross the t's."
good,"Learned lot of technical things  with my past and present company."
good,"Good Place to Work and learn new technologies ."
good,"Great culture, but limited advancement.  Salaries a little low compared to market rates.  Nice stock purchase plan at 15% discount. 4% match 401K no pension/retirement plan."
good,"Very good company with advanced technology."
good,"The best thing about Cisco Jerusalem are the people, the management at GL and GM level are amazing, and the team really became one big group of friends!"
good,Mostly sustenance work. Most of the products run on proprietary operating systems. frequent re-orgs and restructuring. Only some products are doing well in the market.
good,"Cisco offers workers the ability to work from home which is outstanding.  The health benefits package is second to none.  Some divisions are unstable, however, with new management coming in and laying off tenured employees quarterly."
good,Dynamic. Challenging. Innovative. Collaborative. These are just some of the words I use to describe Cisco. Quite possibly the best place I've ever worked.
good,"I have been working in this company from past 4+ years and found the culture to be more encouraging, the company trusts its employees and work life balance is great"
good,It is a great company full of smart people. Unfortunately having a hard time moving into software business and subscribtion business. Still very much focused on switching.
good,Cisco had a great work life balance. They encourage employees to advance and offer training. Ability to work at home. Good benefits and great company culture. Competitive work place.
good,The work is fast paced and can be rewarding. Lack of real career path can be frustrating. A person has to create their own goals and find a position to fill.
good,"Overall I had a positive experience with Cisco."
good,"Cisco is a good company, lot depend on the your manager and your colleagues. Facilities are very good in campus. good learning. can work on cutting edge technologies."

good,"Daily work is not tough, well balanced work and life;"
good,Cisco had a great work life balance. They encourage employees to advance and offer trainings. Ability to work at home. Good benefits and great company culture.  Competitive work place.
good,"Some outstanding technical and leadership talent at Cisco. Company is still rather agile, given their size, when it comes to creating a corporate vision and executing their strategies. Innovation comes mainly from technology acquisitions while internal development is focused on integrating product solutions and broader architectures."

Innovation comes mainly from technology acquisitions while internal development is focused on integrating product solutions and broader architectures."

good,"Good work life balance. "
good,"Cisco is a Great place to work"
good,"Good place to work. It is a great journey for the past 10 years in cisco. What I write here only applies to my group where as cisco has a diverse culture across different groups. It was fun, challenging, involving and some times tiring. So I believe it is all part and over all I am happy."
good,"Constant reorganization and undercover layoffs. Management is poor. Advancement is uncertain. Other than that, work life balance can't be beat. Love the ability to work from home when I need to."

good,"Relaxed atmosphere with many challenging opportunities that through hard work, dedication and strong work ethics provides the ability for recognition and rewards."
good,Cisco has a great team of people to work along side. Very fast paced and constantly evolving. I learned a lot about the finance side of things along with adding Tableau to my toolkit.
good,"Cisco is Productive in term of work culture technical tools . They have defined process to meet challenging environment "
good,"Good people Good technology"
good,"The people I worked with were great people , corporate management needs a little to be desired."
good,Lots of flexibility with the option to take work home (or even spend the entire day away from the desk so long as you are productive). Free coffee and snacks!

good,"I got to work with some smart people and had the opportunity to learn from them."
good,Cisco is one of the Great company dynamic Work culture. It is extremely technical and challenging and growth might be very slow.
good,"Great technology company still leading waves in the 21st century marketplace. Sound business foundation, culture, ethics and innovation with a very healthy cash balance ($70B!)"
good,"There are lots of politics involved in working here which can make or break your career depending on who you know or how ""liked"" you are.  Depending on which business unit you land in you may or may not have resources for personal development.  One benefit is that your direct manager is required to help you progress in the company."
good,Every day is learning in my company and I can complete agreeing that there is work-life balancing also there is a lot of scope in learning new things day to day.
good,A typical work day would involve testing and then meeting team members within and other teams. I learned a lot of testing tools and how to get inter dependent team work done in time. The work environment was always positive and friendly. The hardest part of the job was to get the overall picture of the test schedule and the most enjoyable part is you could go as far as you can to build prototypes.
good,"Cisco is the most flexible, and adapting environment I've worked at in my 43 year work experience.  The goals of the company are well stated, and it provides a stable platform to build a solid understanding of networking and delivery of information."
good,"Overall, a great place to have spent a significant part of my career.  Moving around within the company is encouraged so the ability to learn multiple technologies, markets, etc is there for anyone willing to grab it."
good,Cisco is a good place to work. There are many opportunities to advance. Knowing people in other areas does help tap in to this other opportunities. Overall good place to work.
good,"A typical day at work for me consist of monitoring and taking ownership of email cases and opening technical cases via phone. "
good,I am a computer science major and work on systems everyday. I really enjoy the work I do. Most of the people are smart  which makes it even motivating. The job is not well paid which is a little disappointing.
good,"CISCO is a good place to work as long as you realize your contract may end at any time. But they do provide a very laid back culture and an easy going management style.,"
good,"A fast paced, telecommuting, with a lot of cross-functional communications with counterparts in many different divisions "
good,"Great company to work for. Very busy and ""always on"" global culture. As the world's leading network hardware company for many years, Cisco  is starting to transition to a more software based company. This presents real opportunity to the right people."
good,"Hi, "
good,"cumplia con las tareas asignadas ,buenas prestaciones por parte de la empresa"
good,"hard work , and to take challenges, and finish work you have started "
good,"- not enough hours in the day"
good,I had a great experience at Cisco. The commute to their San Jose office was too difficult for the long term for me. Not all positions are conducive to telecommuting so make sure you get agreement up front if that's what you're looking for. Best technology in the workplace hands down. Great employee engagement and events.
good,"Numbers are the key ..you deliver genuine numbers you are king!!!"
good,"Good working culture, well defined process."
good,"Open work environment, management by objectives, high expectations, flexibility on hours, as long as the job gets done!"
good,The experience was great and I got a lot to learn at Cisco. The co-workers are knowledgeable and helpful. The compensation is not up to the mark though.
good,"Meetings, phone calls and computer inputting, a lot of conversation needed to different departments and related personnel to get the work done. Very few time to chat with co-workers unless work related. The hardest part of the job was to trying to help other department to understand the customer needs and to find a way to fulfill the customer order requests. The most enjoyable part of the job was when all the problems were resolved after everyone hard working."
good,"I am here for an year now. Its very good team to work with and lots of learning."
good,"Cisco is an innovative and forward-thinking company with awesome technology. They strive to be the #1 IT company in the world so they expect only the best and brightest people. Great perks. Flexible. Wok hard, play hard mentality. People are very helpful, talented and sharp. The company  makes bold moves, but with that comes a lot of ""re-orgs"" within the company. All-around great company to work for."
good,"Cisco is a great company.  Regional management can be challenging and there are alot of cooks in the kitchen at times on such a large customer.  "
good,The company is under constant change and each employee should be reinventing themselves. Given the multi-national nature and diversity of functions there are lots of opportunities to excel especially for the start to mid career professional.
good,"Not very agile as they claim to say. However, they are slowly getting their.Its a big company with a very political landscape sadly"
good,"Great work life balance, but who knows how long it will be until you eventually get laid off?  Lay offs now annual.  Compensation is great, and the benefits are top notch, job culture is professional and respectful."
good,pick you group right. Few groups are very slow paces. NxOS Data center Switching group is good one. Lots of fast paced innovation. Great technology
good,Learning a lot in terms of knowledge and self development too.Nice place to work.People around here have many year experiences and do not hesitate in sharing their knowledge with the freshers as me.
good,"Cisco is good place to work. There is a lot of freedom in work and in discharging your duties. They don't change the product directions often.  Some of the things that need improvement. "
good,"energetic environment, start up vibe"
good,"Great people"
good,"Cisco is, by all visible measures, a great Silicon Valley success story. It has one of the best compensation packages in the industry. But has increasingly become a sweat shop, relentlessly reducing its headcount while increasing the work load. This has further upset the already precarious life / work balance there. Opportunities for advancement are limited. Overall, a mixed experience. but a great learning experience, as well, in terms of program management leadership opportunities and high-level exposure to executive management at key customers."
good,"Cisco does not have good benefits as NDS (formerly company) such as health insurance, vacation and sick time. But Cisco has a lot of training programs for employee to improve their skills."
good,"Lots of nex-gen technologies going on in the company."
good,"Flexibility in schedule, company culture of inclusiveness, transparency, and willingness to help one's peers are all reasons I enjoy working for this company. I have had many managers, and each one has created a positive team environment over the years... this is driven from the top down."
good,Good company just hired too many Project Managers and Engineers preparing for the workload from their client that never came. Their major client cut down on their new projects
good,"Cisco is a good company and the work culture is very friendly."
good,"My team's approach to training was to have senior peers do all of the training/mentoring of new employee's.  Not only did the employee designated to train me support me fully, but so did every other team member that I reached out to.  It truly felt like a team culture where everyone wanted each other to succeed.  "
good,"Very good overall work environment. Employees are relatively cared well. Due to summer heat, AC is being turned on. During night shift, bread, butter & jam with bananas are given, which is a good gesture."
good,"Very good experiences working at this company.  Very good variety"
good,The company provided rotation program for employees to acquire know knowledge and growth in their careers. Great co workers and management.
good,"I spent most of the day greeting guests and making sure security guidelines were followed. I learned how to read people, dealing with so many personalities you pick up on body language and clues to help you greet customers. The hardest part of the job was there could be downtime and if none of the administrative assistants in the building had no work they needed assistance with time could pass very slow. The most enjoyable part of the day was the interaction with the guest and employees and meeting new people."
good,"great company - great senior leadership"

good,Company has the resources to accomplish almost anything.  Knows next to nothing about consumer products
good,"Trouble Shooting"

good,"Cisco is a fun place to work. It is a technically demanding environment but provides engineers with many resources to learn and grow professionally. Day to Day operational work, projects every month and collaboration are the many things that make working for Cisco rewarding and challenging both at the same time."

good,"Good to work at"
good,"Cisco is one of the best place to work. I came across various new technology and innovations, people around me were very kind and supportive . i enjoyed working in cisco"
good,"Compensation package is very good, however many hours are expected.  Alot of policy and procedure involved in each task."

good,"Escorts vendors into DC and performs visual installation quality compliance checks"
good,Cisco Systems is an excellent place to learn network engineering.  My daily activities was to design network infrastructures for Cisco Systems high end clients.  The major part of my engineering development was while at Cisco Systems.  The management staff was hands off unless you caused an issue for a client.  My co-workers were very talented engineers that i can call on if needed.  The hardest part of working at Cisco Systems was that you may be all alone to resolve a major issue.  The most enjoyable part of the job was when you completed a high level design and implemented it with no issues.
good,"- Productive and great place to work."
good,Great place to work and learn.  Some very smart people at cisco
good,"WebEx SOC								Aug.2013-Present"
good,"Cisco is a great place to work if you're looking for flexible hours and colleagues who genuinely enjoy helping you succeed. "
good,"protocol development work in c."
good,"A great company to work for with"
good,"slow pace, job security, advancement opportunies, but quite an amount of bureaucracy as for a normal big company"
good,"Cisco provides a solid work culture with a focus on delivering to an industry that is constantly in change and exciting. A day at Cisco provides an opportunity to make a difference, meet new people, top people in the industry, etc. Days can be long but are very rewarding via solid compensation and other benefits."
good,I worked as a consultant in a project which entails the integration of Cisco DPI to Huawei Packet core node.
good,You get out of it what you put into it. Great people and products. Good pay and benefits.
good,"- a typical day of work is 9-10 hours of heads down productivity. It is an environment that provides many opportunities to contribute to the success of Cisco through hard work,  "
good,Everyone works hard to meet company requirements and they succeed.
good,"Typical day, Meetings and more meetings"
good,"This company has made a lot of people very rich while those people have done very little to earn it. There are too many VPs, Directors, etc. that have no business managing people and are along for the ride only and don't really care about doing what's right for the company or the people. If you happen to be in a group that does things the right way then this is an excellent place to work. Flexible schedules, work/life balance is excellent, salary and benefits are top notch."
good,A typical day at work would be to fix bugs existing in the project or start developing a part of a feature and give status to the lead by end of day. I have learned debugging skills a lot. i have managed many critical stress condition like customer found defect with SLA of 4 hours. Co - workers are very co-operative and friendly. The hardest part of the job is doing some tasks repeatedly. It really sucks to do the same task again and again even though there is an automation script which is not of much help! The enjoyable part of the work is when i get a new customer interlock or a new feature to develop end to end.
good,"Management was good about work/life balance and flexible hours. So long as the work was done, no one micromanaged us."
good,"Very good process and products, but established products so not much of challenge in the work."
good,"nice company but no growth"
good,"Right way of collaborrating across teams-networking , management and software teams"
good,Cisco culture is highly collaborative and matrixed.  New employees will receive little orientation or support.  It is a sink or swim management style.  You will be given a laptop and told to figure out how to do your job and navigate the myriad of organizations and policies on your own.  Everything is on the internal company website but it's difficult to find what you need.
good,"It's a great place to work, I have awesome and helpful coworkers, but my manager doesn't have a very good understanding of management skill."
good,More than 10 different nationalities work in Cisco office in Lisbon. A tipical cay at work is a fun and relaxing day but at the same time very productive. Managers are easing going and always reachable for anything.
good,Everyday is learning. Working here is more fun and joy. The most enjoyable part of the job.
good,"Cisco is a well established company, so rules and standards are organized and thorough. There are various BUs within the company, so they are like small companies without a company, each with more or less different ways of doing business. Current BU is more down to earth and fun to work hard in, and some other BUs just laborous with high pressure. Overall, it's still a good place to work."
good,"a great experience with Cisco, appreciated the culture and value the company has, very humantarian. If you could land a permanent job with Cisco, there will be lots of career advancement offered in the company."
good,good place to work. Work culture is good. Will get exposure to new technologies.
good,"Cisco treats its employees well. The Cisco campus has incredible facilities and services for its employees, including a private medical clinic with state of the art technology, a full gym, and many other amenities."
good,Good place to work if you are innovative and a good team person. Stability and growth are also good. Diversity is a plus as well. Convenience to manage your own projects and resources is helpful and so i the ability to WFH.
good,"My perspective is on IT. As an FTE, expect to spend most of your time in meetings and managing people and processes. Most coding is done by contractors."
good,"Great place to work, met some great people there. Great benefits, good core values and very good place to work when it came to time off or away with my kids."
good,Ability to work remotely helps to balance your work/life. Cisco encourages you to give back to your community and charitable organizations. Your career path is limitless
good,Workplace culture is very friendly and often we get opportunities to solve some of the complex challenged in the field to prove once talent and obtain recognition.
good,Nice place to work. Good quality of life. Lot of learning opportunities. Lots of training and perks.  Lot of churn and layoffs. Overall Cisco is a great company.
good,I like Cisco as the company that treats employee fair and respectful. Cisco has a wide range of products so a lot of different technologies are available there
good,cisco tratta molto bene i suoi dipendenti e li mette in condizione di lavorare al meglio in ogni momento
good,Its a good company to work for and even stay with for 10 years. There will always be challenges and there is of course the occasional manager that should never be in the field or location.
good,"The culture is amazing!  Job security is a concern as they go through a limited restructure every quarter that affects all areas of the company.  Management is supportive, and community service opportunities are always available and encouraged."
good,It is a good place to work. There is a good environment for support. The benefits are quite good. The location was quite beneficial for the commute when u needed to go to the office.
good,Good professional & personal life balance.  They didn't ask about your office time punctuality talks about work is on punctual or not.    WFH is nicely useful.
good,This is a very good company. I have learned a lot from this company. They arrange some fun activities every year for their employees. The competitive environment in this company so that employee can get the opportunity to work in a different department.

good,Great environment. Company cares about its employees. Agile and digital first mindset has turned the company around. fantastic stepping stone for entry graduates
good,"Good company to work for, annual layoffs drive insecurity, customer engagement is good, team environment excellent, benefits are good, management is good as well as working environment."
good,"I was able to work remotely in my Marketing role, which was a true benefit because of the flexibility it allowed me to have with my young daughter. Cisco is a great company to work for!"
good,Cisco ensures that you get all the facilities that you need but also requires that you work and provide the required outputs. This is a fair deal they expect out of employees. Apart from this there is a great nurturing environment which helps you grow personally.
good,Good Company to work with since it has the best of technologies and also good support staff who helps each other. You can grow in the field of cisco voip umbrella.
good,Very hard working and devoted work force. There are many opportunities to grow due to the size of the company. Many of the positions are filled by contract workers.
good,"Good place to work, good benefits, culture and people are better than most other places.  Work long hours, which is expected, and they ask employees to wear a lot of hats, but you learn a great deal especially at the beginning."
good,I like flexible time as long as I can stay up 8 hrs in company. I like to work remote from home. I don't like micro manage. I am professional at working place.
good,"Cisco provided substantial technical growth in all areas of Unified Communications.  Driven by the fact that you would provide technology to 150k people (internal) and countless external customers, Cisco was a great way to change the face of technology."
good,The Only thing I did not like is that you can some times be in a big bulling all by your self and that is scary and sometimes not so safe. You also don't get off tell late at nigh so that don't help at all.
good,"The people working there were joyful, the working environment was relaxed. I enjoyed the work as it allowed me to lean more about the working world and improve my digital literacy"
good,"great place to work within the average portuguese companies. good salaries, benefit package and career opportunities. it is highly hierarchical and could be more transparent in certain situations"
good,"A lot to learn from the company and its employees by the amount of challenges but with a very good work environment and encouraging coworkers. However, some managers don't care and not as involved as I'd like, didn't help my experience at all."
good,Cisco management  expects efficient smart performance from employee's.  People who work hard and make collaboration a priority can be very successful at Cisco.
good,"Cisco was a good place to work.  ME & QE was consistent and the processes did not change very much.  Hardest part of the job was to change a process across multiple groups.  Many groups did not want to make changes to their processes so change management was difficult and took a while.  "
good,Spend majority of time working with account teams and customers. Data integrity can be an issue sometimes which can translate to delays in data being provided to customers in a timely manner
good,"At CISCO they pay you well and you can advance if you are motivated to do so.  However, the people deal is absent and just words.  The People Deal is absent because it is just a check box on a Manager's list."
good,Great company to work for!  Flexible and understanding with the opportunity for growth and development.  Everyone is willing to work together and help people to grow into the industry.
good,Based on Banking domai so work pressure was enormous. Daily was an new learning curve. had worked round the clock to complete the deliverables and deliver the error free product.
good,"If you are a good team person and can ignore few bad (which is bound to happen in any big organization), you will enjoy!"
good,"In my experience, lots of flexibility for work/life balance tho this will officially depend on your team/manager."
good,"A place which has good work life balance. "
good,"Good company, challenging work, good culture, and supportive management, good benefits and work life. Enjoyed working for a leading technology innovation company."
good,Very innovative and results-driven company. Opportunity for career growth if you really seek it out; job security with amazing benefits if you're comfortable in your role. Great people in every department.
good,"At Cisco, I got to work with many brilliant people and nurture great ideas.  Ideas were supported and resourced.  However, as a very large organization collaborating and cooperating cross-organizationally is a huge challenge and is time-consuming at Cisco. There are wide and varying objectives and the natural politics that comes from that, however, when alignment can be achieved, the power Cisco can put behind any initiative is enormous and empowering."
good,The workplace culture was very friendly and met lots of new people. I learned how to overcome difficult situations rather than stress about them by looking at the positive side of things and figuring out solutions as a team.
good,The company has a brand value. High end Technologies. Proprietary tools. Less Job Security.
good,I worked with a team of very sharp people who pulled together to get a project finished.  Everyone worked well together for the most part and it was a pleasure to work there (16 years).
good,"Big, large company with actually tolerant culture. Lots of change due to acquisitions, sometimes leads to layoffs, restructuring, and shifting priorities. They believe in giving power to their employees, perhaps too much: they provide too many HR, benefits, and I.T. tools, then too many overlapping and confusing helpdesks to help you find the right tool."
good,Wonderful people to work with. Very collaborative culture. Always juggling multiple projects at a time. Long hours but flexible schedule.  Provide the tools to get your job done.
good,"Cisco was a wonderful place to work. The employees were caring and encouraging, hard-working and dedicated to the customers. There is a huge customer-centric focus at Cisco, which is encouraging and provides a sense of purpose. Cisco affords a flexible work environment with the option to work remotely in many cases, which supports a healthy work-life balance. In my few years there I grew through exposure to senior employees and their support. The challenges were different every day which adds excitement and provides new ways of thinking."
good,"Productive"
good,"Typical day to day work is interesting, fast paced and uses the newest technologies. Trainings are available for most very frequently and in the hot areas of career development. Management should listen and take input from the engineers more in making technological decisions. Too many technological decisions are made from the top echelon, leading to lower team moral and low employee empowerment. Workplace culture is great with great co-workers and team building activities. The hardest part of the job is getting a grasp for the long term vision for the business and technology from the executives and architects. I enjoy working with my team and making impacts in the broader teams to drive efficiency in delivering features and services."
good,"Excellent work conditions,  excellent for career development.  Fliexible work condition, flex time, and provides many employee services and work-life balance."
good,"Good company to work for, work/life balance is difficult.  Email constantly comes in, everyone needs a slice of what you do.  Seems like we need 3 times as many people.  Travel can be a lot at times.  Can be very stressful."
good,"typical day is tracking the tasks for the project.  attending meetings with stakeholders answering emails"
good,"Because Cisco is such a large company spread out across the world, they were very open to remote work which really helps in balancing work with life. No traffic to go through. You can quickly do laundry during lunch, etc."
good,Cisco definitely provides valuable experience.  The only major downside is that it is quite political -- and your success depends largely on department.
good,"To land a consulting job at Cisco means a very good chance at eventually being hired full-time.  For folks who desire this, it is certainly an easy way to be earning well, learning about whether Cisco is the right place, and finding the best match within the company."
good,"Great company. great time and great support. The processes and producedures are very effective. You learned to use both waterfall/agile, in-house, and other systems."
good,While I enjoyed by time at Cisco and found the work challenging. I was not impressed by the wholesale layoffs of entire departments when a new director would be hired. I understand that the new management would want their own people but I would also hope that they would review the skills and performance of existing employees before dismissing them.
good,"I had great experience with Cisco, it is a great company and the benefits are top notch (what you should expect from a top company). The ability to work remotely is in my opinion the best advantage tech companies can provide now days."
good,"I enjoyed working at Cisco, the culture, people, benefits.  The only problem was getting laid-off."
good,"Cisco offers work flexibility which enhances work life balance for its employees.  Additionally, the collaboration environment at Cisco is great as well; employees seem to invite collaboration."
good,"Cisco is a highly collaborative organization, which has strong plus of being collegial, supportive of family balance but also carries a negative of trying to deliver on too many priorities."
good,Productive and fun place. great place where I spent 10 years and still continuing .Would recommend anytime to anyone looking for a big IT company. Vey supportive of employees.
good,"Great workplace culture. Fun, nice and productive people. Free coffee, tea, etc and some foods at the kitchen. Good work and life balance. A first paced working environment."
good,"A good place for a young recruit to get their start. "
good,Cisco is a great place to work.  Collaborative culture with cutting edge technology. Room for advancement with many career opportunities. Unfortunately there are yearly layoffs which many little job security.
good,Cisco has a great culture in the office. The company has located on multiple continents and workstations. using cutting-edge technologies as an intern in Cisco gain the brilliant knowledge of architecture.
good,"awesome company, awesome people, product vision lacks a bit. workplace culture is good, work is relaxed, management is friendly, can work on new things everyday."
good,"Good company to work. Well work life balance."
good,"Cisco is a great place to start work. You can definitely plan for long term in Cisco. The management is fully supportive when it comes to learning new technology, rattling your brains to come up with new idea and mostly you do get good time to implement your ideas. "
good,"Excellent flexible schedule and perks.  Work life balance can be a challenge, so a healthy relationship with your manager is key.  Compensation is competitive."
good,On the whole Cisco was a challenging and great place to work. The downside(s) were the constant layoffs and limited ability to move around.  I would recommend Cisco as an employer.
good,"Great history and experience.  Doing the right things to remain vibrant and competitive in a changing, global market.  Good people, great products, strong future."
good,"Great people, fun culture.  Sales is competitive and can be stressful, weekly forecasts and aggressive quotas are the trade off for above average compensation"
good,Cisco has great benefits and volunteer give back programs.  Cisco has a great open door policy.  The leadership at Cisco is great. Advancement and changing roles is a bit challenging.
good,"Good place to work with  very smart , bright and collaborative people.   Great work culture and good benefits.   Focus on global, diverse work environment .  Innovative mindsets."
good,"Provides good opportunities to learn, to grow and to go for certifications. Overall a good company to start your career at. Salary is on the lower-end"
good,"Cisco depends heavily on buying than building."
good,This was a great company to work for. In my position I was empowered to go where I needed to with all the resources I required to get critical projects back on track and improve customer relations. With that unfettered authority I was able to quickly resolve issues across the north east and increase sales.
good,"Over all a great experience. I was in the CALO lab as an intern on 2nd shift. Rough starting out as I had been told we would have a month’s training. I got 1 day of real training by someone who had only been there 3 weeks. I ended up being retrained later on. They expect you to hit the ground running. Those with stronger IT backgrounds did fine. I was switching careers and needed more time orienting coming in.  If I had been paired with someone who know what they were doing for a solid 3 days then I think my transition would have been much better. Did better once I was moved to 2nd shift, where more advanced workers were able to correct some of the training gaps I had. Over all experience was good. Just trouble starting out. Managers should not be advertising a month’s training when they are not giving that."
good,"Typical day consists of getting caught up with issues or aftermath of previous day's work. Continue with current tasks at hand before mid-day team meeting to get brief on everyone's statuses and updates. Continue with work after lunch until you choose to leave. Open come-and-go work-life however it is expected that you complete the assigned tasks in a timely manner."
good,"Great experience if you are in the right team and right product"
good,I enjoyed working at Cisco very much. There were highs and lows of workload but whenever there was less to do myself there were always people willing to teach me something else
good,"Cisco is a great company to work for, specially few groups have cutting edge technology project. Its great to learn and expand as it provides great horizon and invest on its employee to grow and collaborate."
good,"The Best thing about Cisco is that we can have great work life Balance and Flexibility."
good,collaborative and innovative atmosphere.  I love working there and hope to be able to get back on with a department there again.  The work life balance is awesome.
good,"I worked with the best of the best Engineers, Marketing and Sales departments, project managers, Senior Management, and participation in Acquisitions and Mergers.  This was very rewarding in a personal way.  The salary followed the success I provided."
good,Cisco is a great place to work.  It has is a fast paced collaborative environment that is very inclusive.  I enjoy the flexibility I have in terms of workplace (home or office).  Very well managed.
good,This job is very flexible with you. The work has a decent pace. You can be busy everyday. It will test your ability of learning things on your own but also in a team.
good,"I found Cisco to have an older, more traditional and serious workforce than I had experienced in previous Silicon Valley jobs.  However, they were skilled and dedicated, and I enjoyed the work and the team interactions. Since my contract position was very focussed within a small team, I was not able to clearly evaluate the broader interactions that I might have experienced as an employee. I would certainly take another contract there if offered."
good,"Good benefits, Advanced Technologies, Collaborative, Career progression, Fun place to work, sports, child care, free sodas, lots of perks, Excellent compensation, training"
good,"Cisco is a massive machine with many opportunities for business, operational, engineering and technical sales.    You will learn a lot.   The culture is very fast paced and competitive."
good,Cisco is a great place to work and I think only a handful company can provide the kind of flexibility Cisco provides. The benefits are excellent and Cisco ensures quality life for the people.
good,"Strong use of Excel was requiredFast paced"
good,High technology Telecommunications company.  Fast paced with frequent acquisitions allowing for the opportunity to move into new markets and work in new areas.
good,"It started off very good but then my manager left and it got very strange. I end up reporting to his manager who was very unfriendly, condescending, and disrespectful. I opted to leave. I would go back under better circumstances. Its a good company."
good,"The people you work with are good for the most part.  Your experience can vary dramatically depending where you are in a company with over 70k FTEs and tens of thousands of contractors.  Within my group, there have been hectic times and relaxed times.  Some groups seem to be pretty low-key while others are nonstop action."
good,"Most groups are very flexible with the work hours. There are some nice amenities like Pool tables, Ping Pong, Fussball, Old School Video games, Fitness center, Snack Bar, Massage Chairs. "
good,"Everyone is highly encouraged to take time for family.  Family emergencies are not frowned upon, and everyone is very warm and caring."
good,Learned new things about Machine Learning and Data storage. Learned new tools for Front-end Development . Was a good time with entire  team and off shore one as well.
good,"Good Working with Cisco, good work life balance,good technology and flexible work hours,working from home option is available and its really helps employee."
good,"Cisco is very laid back as long as you get the job done and deliver for customers.  My role was similar to a freelance position at first where I got to learn many different facets of business and mess around with coding and databases."
good,"Cisco reinvents itself regularly through directed initiatives, organizational changes and acquisitions.  Keeping up with the change is a constant challenge and as the saying goes ""if you don't like the way something is just wait and it will change again soon"".  The employees and management are among the brightest in the business and a pleasure to work with."
good,Cisco has a strong culture of supporting work /life balance and being flexible to employees' needs. It is generally not as cut-throat as many other Valley high tech companies. The downside is that advancement can be tough in such a large company and the compensation and stock value is very average.
good,"Workplace culture is very good and opportunity to learn new things and good exposure to the team. Visibility is good."
good,"Cisco is a good place to work, good work/live balance with many perks for full-time staff members. The culture is innovative with many challenging projects."
good,"Cisco provides exciting opportunities. They encourage life/work balance. The managers I have worked are pretty good and give me flexibility wrt commute so I am productive. They also provide opportunity to learn on the job, if I was missing any secondary skillset needed to accomplish the task. I have enjoyed all the assignments and miss working for Cisco."
good,"Good solid place to work, progress fairly measured, decent communications internally, contract employees held away from company update meetings, some flexible work from home hours available to accommodate global team time zones."
good,"Number driven culture with older workforce typically working from home. "
good,Overall exeperience is Ok at Cisco. I worked more than 6 years in the same team. New technologies implemented and got the opportunity to learn new technologies.
good,Open space offices encouraging collaborative environment.  Friendly culture.  Great internal tools from HR to engineering development to people management.
good,"Transparent & professional job culture. Challenging work environment. "
good,"Cisco has given me great flexibility."
good,"Access to an unlimited and vast amount of information. Potential for career growth is very positive, due to existing and future technologies constantly being introduced to. You can make your own hours"
good,They are very progressive and very professional company that I worked with. They have a really intact strategy on how to be successful in their line of business.
good,"At Cisco, you are on the cutting edge of technology, innovation, and market engagement.  You are given a lot of responsibility, but not always the funds to execute.  It is a high pace environment that can be very rewarding, while very challenging."
good,It is really good to have nice team and very collaborative environment to enhance and learn new skills. I have learned about cloud services and really enjoyed the rapport  between teams
good,"Great work life balance, good use of remote technologies and telecommuting.  A lot of organizational shuffling the last few years, yet without a clear or supportive path to move job levels or positions.  Nearly impossible to transition to another role internally, most people leave when reorg'd out.  It leads to a sad loss of substantial internal knowledge.  In a company of >70K employees, it's pitiful to only have ~500 positions 'open' in the USA, the remaining 900 or less are all out of country."
good,Cisco is a good place to work.   The benefits are good and the environment is productive.  I would recommend  Cisco as a place to work to all of my past co-workers.
good,"Cisco still leads the way.   Yet its marketing teams - too many of them - focus more on internal measurements, and inter-team battles.  Sometimes forget about great marketing and the customer."
good,I got the opportunity to work with best talent and management. Great work life balance culture. Vast scope for learning new technologies at the large scale.
good,"Enjoyed working with the people but never got a pay increase in 4 years. "
good,"Great place to work, with plenty of remote positions. Management is very understanding and follows through with commitments. Lots of room for advancement."
good,I like the company but there is too much job security concern as changes are done every single quarter in the company structure. The company has some excellent benefits but lacks security of job for employees.
good,Good Work culture and work life balance. Good company for learning. Compensation can be better. Nice office infrastructure. Less onsite opportunities.
good,"Buildings are converting to open spaces with desks, hang-out lounge, games center, and shared office rooms.  some building have various snacks and/or healthy fruits at the upper floors.  However, employee prefer to work from home if their role not require them to show up every day."
good,"Work areas are cubicles and sometimes it was hard to concentrate with all the noise.  "
good,Constant communication with Account Managers to ensure you are happy in your current role. Great interaction with the Emerge team! They were very supportive of work/life balance and allowed for a lot of flexibility.
good,"Work life balance is good. Lot of layoffs happening recently. "
good,I was fortunate to be a part of a small team that owned the entire product hence got a Full Stack role and learned a lot. Though the pay was not comparable to my peers in the industry the learning compensated for it.
good,Best Company to work for. You'll be able balance work and personal life efficiently. Depending on your profile you can choose to work from home or office.
good,Fantastic experience and opportunity to work for a company which played a key role in defining the very essence of IOT and so many other groundbreaking and fundamental technology solutions.   Very strong sales teams who partner constructively and productively with their marketing partners.
good,"Cisco is a great place to hone in your skills by learning on the job. I also find it great for actually performing the same job duties as you will learn in their CCNA, CCNP, and CCIE certifications."
good,Cisco is a fine place to work but going through challenges now as it relates to innovation and cloud.  Join if you have a long view of the technology cycle.
good,I was into the case work team and had to contact the Cisco clients to solve their issues. It was a continuous learning experience to solve different problems daily.
good,Goal oriented. Team environment. Employee independence. I enjoy management style. Managers push employees to improve and develope skills. Overall great place to work.
good,"Cisco is dynamically managed from the top down. To stay afloat one must put out 110%, I have been in five large organizations in 30 years and Cisco tops them all by its aggressive leadership and high expectations of all employees."
good,"Security is een zeer dynamisch vakgebied, waarbij constante training een vereiste is. Doorzettingsvermogen en geduld behoren tot de eigenschappen om te slagen in een dergelijke uitdagende werkomgeving. Het leuke van de baan is het internationale aspect en het reseller & klanten relatiebeheer.  tot slot zijn de internationale relaties met collega echt een verrijking."
good,Cisco is great when it comes to work/life balance and has proven to be a great started place for most. The CEO is doing a great job and has introduced a 40-hour volunteer PTO for those who want to volunteer and not take time off.
good,"Always nice to work for a recognised MNC. Office is nice and well stocked with ample support from other departments and facilities management."
good,"Generally, Cisco is full of the smartest, most professional employees I've ever worked with. I constantly benefited from learning from individuals smarter than myself."
good,"Great Work life Balance, Room to innovate and explore. Lots of great people, technologies to learn and experiment in a fast pace environment.Great culture."
good,"Flexible working and great exposure. I learnt big data and managing vendors and working with business stake holders and handled different technology and domains. "
good,"Company has developed a hyper competitive sales culture, which can take a tool on even the most aggressive and die hard sales rep.  Turn over is very high compared to other global technology companies."
good,"Its such agreat place to work as a FTE, Employee oriented company and many benfits are there but all these for permanant employees not for contractors"
good,"I had good experience working for most of the business units."
good,"Worked at Cisco for over 20 years.  Although a great experience, still looking for that company who can take my abilities to the next level."
good,"Working in the CALO lab has given me so much hands on experience in the field with Cisco devices such as switches and routers, and much more. Troubleshooting is needed every single day."
good,"I have worked at Cisco for over 10 years.  The company has been very good to me as it has given me opportunities to grow, stretch, and explore the world through my work.  As the IT industry shifts and changes, Cisco must continue to innovate and stretch its muscles to stay ahead of the competition."
good,"Gained more technical knowledge working with highly skilled technical team."
good,"Cisco is am amazing company to work with intelligent, hard working employees.  Work / Life balance can be a struggle, but Cisco has flexible hours to accommodate lifestyle."
good,"you typically start off with a day of thinking how you can increase the top-line and bottom-line revenue, and make your job relevant to the product(s) in a BG you support by marketing the product to the public domain in which this product is relevant, and then put action behind it to make it happen."
good,"Cisco is focused on doing what is right for the marketplace, the customers, partners and its employees. "
good,"I loved the people I worked with at Cisco.  Great culture, although somewhat hierarchical.  This dedication to hierarchy meant it could be extra challenging to affect change in a timely manner, but if you can handle the slow pace, the work-life balance was excellent."
good,"Good Work environment to be with"
good,"Cisco is a nice place to work as it pays well.  My only concern is with the corporate culture as I quickly became bored.  I was always done my tasks ahead of time and would keep asking for more responsibilities. I was the youngest employee in my department and I felt very unstimulated most of the time there.  It seems like they need more youngsters over there to infuse the culture with some youthful energy.  All in all, it's a good company."
good,"Cisco is one of the leading company in Networking market share."
good,Good experience working with Cisco. Work culture is good. Salary is not adequate some times.Overall its a nice company for any one to work with

good,I have enjoyed my time working at Cisco. I have met a lot of great people who have been supportive and helpful during my time there. You usually have the ability to work from home. If you are a red badge employee you will have a difficult time advancing while there.
good,"Learned only electrical related. Beautiful place, highly cultured persons, tight security, good infrastructure, Enjoying the work, typical day was year end shut down."
good,"Cisco is best company to work for."
good,Awesome experience working for Unilever. Very understanding client and management.Learned more great thing working in unilever account.Great co-workers.
good,"I would be able to come in anytime I would like."
good,Good company to work. It gives ample scope for working. Top management is good. It gives good work life balance. It has flexible work hours
good,"Having been in the Bay Area for some time now, it's very much like most other tech companies, save for its gargantuan size; which is what can make it vulnerable to much smaller, nimbler, agile companies."
good,Technology say company focused on employee development and highly focused on customer needs. Over last decade they have developed some cool technology.
good,"Change the way you live, work and play. Good and productive environment, Good Culture. Productive and fun place to work."
good,"I have started my Job as a Logistics Coordinator. After two three months, my PM told me for additional work for Project planning. This is really hardest time for me. I really appreciate my  PM."
good,There is a good work life balanace. Fun place to work with a good culture of team members. Room to grow into other departments.
good,"APG within Cisco is a new BU, and is extremely fast paced.  Very entrepreneurial atmosphere where a lot is expected of you, and a lot can be learned.  There is a lot opportunity to be creative in solving problems, and blocking issues, but you still have to work within the policies of Cisco, so it may take longer to implement a creative solution.  The people in SPG and APG are awesome to work with, and very accomodating, helpful and friendly."
good,"A challenging environment, with great learning experience. Both from the product enhancement perspective and soft skills perspective."
good,"Was a systems administrator at Cisco for last 4.5 years, working on variety of projects involving systems administration of Linux and Solaris."
good,"Working at Cisco is such an amazing experience.  They are walking the talk and deliver a workplace of the future, empowering employees to drive results anywhere they are."
good,"Day starts happily and having the feel of every day is a new day. I learnt to be more flexible and supportive to my Management on business calls and business development.  My co-workers were very good and supportive.  My hardest part of job was at BALCO, Korba in Chattisgarh where first three months I used carry cash (employees salary) for disbursement to their working place which scattered around 400 KMs.  Most enjoyable part of the job was to get the ESIC Number and EPF number from Govt agencies."
good,"Cisco is a company with a great set of values and new focus on the employee experience. Just recently stopped the stack ranking of employees for annual reviews which is actually demoralizing. Instead managers are encouraged to provide feedback all year. There is an innovative employee recognition program where anyone can recognize anyone and that person, if approved, will get a bonus ( not cash). "
good,"It's a big organisation - 70,000 people, with many products and solutions.  It's like a high tech portfolio and not all areas will function at any one time.  The company has a very successful hardware business and is now focused on Software, Services and Cloud.  The move is not without its challenges."
good,I enjoyed my experience as intern there. People are friendly and easy to work with. The environment was mentally stimulating.
good,A plethora of opportunities for advancement and training.   One year at Cisco equivalent to a BA in computer science.  Very impressed with staff and intelligence level.
good,The company is very dynamic and looking to go in lots of directions which is both interesting to be part of but also a bit disorienting
good,Cisco will help you grow with regard to your career. They will guide and provide training. You even have the option to look for another job within Cisco after you have completed 1.5 to 2 years in your present job. It is a diverse workforce and you don't feel alone. Everybody help and guide each other.
good,"Cisco Capital is my second family. Its the type of Department at Cisco where I can work , live and play.  I love helping my team mates resolving any issues they have aside from doing my normal job. I love the challenge of closing a deal and Amending any deals. I learned how to be patient with my Customer and Sales team, interaction with the Financial sales management and dealing with Customers higher management in answering all their questions regarding the lease. I always look forward to having a one on one meetings with my manager - to talk about  issues  that are delaying the deals and to provide resolutions at the same time."
good,"Worked for Lionbridge which has a long-standing contract with Cisco to provide agency level design work to all executive level managers.  Management was easy to work for and have good communication with employees.  Unfortunately, I experienced a low level of work-place sense of community since most employees worked remotely."
good,"Awesome company with very good work culture, has perfect work life balance. Has the culture of respect, transparency and totally a fun at workplace culture. Has world class gym, box office for movies at weekend, relaxation centre with massage corner, all kinds of outdoor and indoor games and a world class cafeteria which is the largest in corporate India."
good,"Cisco for the most part allows employees to function with minimum supervision. The important thing was getting the projects completed accurately and on time. "
good,"Cisco is one of the few companies in the world that ensure a balance between work and personal life. It is also one of the fun and productive IT tech companies to work with. With over 50 thousand engineers, you are always sure to get a solution to any problem in the world."
good,Hoping the new management will bring in changes which are for good. Some days are very busy. Lot of learning opportunities. Pleasant place to work.
good,"It was a great place to work during the 90s and 2000 decades with several opportunities to explore and excel.  I was able to launch a independent Fraud investigation operation and expand globally,"
good,"Open desk policy, people relaxed. Management team could be better."
good,"This is a great place to work, the only unfortunate thing about Cisco is that it is US based, and all position modelling is based on that mode.  This makes it very difficult for the Admin world at Cisco Canada to feel secure in their work position and can effect productivity.  However, they are one of THE best, outside of using the same US based Admin position model for the last 2o yrs.  For an innovative and VERY intelligent Global company, this is not a smart action.    They are very communicative, resourceful, efficient, they do a good attempt to balance work and life....  They simply need to open their minds to the ""back bone"" of their supporting culture ~ Administration."
good,"Many many years at this company.  Would never utter a bad word (particularly when compared to other environs).  Treat people really well. Obviously great products.  Acquisition growth model works well for it.  Lots of politics, though.  What else would one expect from a company with its history and current size?   Executive management is a mixed bag.  Lots of G.O.B.G. (good ole boy/girl) cronyism.  Again, par for the course.  Finance-driven (this is a good thing, contrary to what many tech folks would imagine).  Outsourcing is a bad mark, if that sort of thing bugs ya (does me, but that's just me - perhaps is unavoidable).  Nonetheless, still a top ranking organization, through and through. "
good,"Lot of learning"
good,"The people are great to work with.  It helps to be a highly motivated person to drive the programs."
good,"Cisco Systems."
good,Good place to work. Good Work Culture. But it is getting bad place to work as there is un-necessary restructuring of workforce and the middle management is not good. It is below average for a company with its stature.

good,"It has been 2.4 years in Cisco Systems. Presently I am working as platform engineer in an acclaimed flagship network switch of Cisco Systems in Power subsystem. During my tenure in Bosch I worked on on A/C service machine project and Device Firmware Upgrade projects. Both the DFU project and A/C service machine project provided me opportunity to gain experience regarding the whole software life cycle development in true sense.

Management was very friendly and co-operative. Co workers are smart, fun and talented. Smart work, internal controls, smooth systems, work flow and very result oriented."
good,"Cisco is an overall great company to work for, and for full time employee's they offer training and support. Co-workers are intelligent, diligent, and for the most part professional. The hardest part of the job is lack of guidance from management. The most enjoyable part of the job are the colleagues. there are good people who work there."
good,"Normal, No over load of work "
good,"Il lavoro era presso il cliente come consulente in Unipol assicurazioni a bologna."
good,Cisco is a good company to work for.  Working remotely is allowed and they are very flexible with times you work.  As long as you are working and getting your deliverables in no one will micro manage you.  Although for a front end engineer adobting new technologies is slow. As far as where I work the BU seems to always be a step behind web standards and technologies on the front-end side.

good,Can learn lot of technical implementation of L2/L3 testing
good,"-Long hours"
good,"overall Cisco is a fun place to work. "
good,"I interned here for two summers during my undergraduate career. The first summer I spent a lot of time learning how to use MS Access and about how databases work. It was a lot of fun learning these extremely relevant tools and concepts. The following summer I worked more with their database, created data access pages for easy access to the database, and automated the updating of contact information in a company handbook."
good,"Design and development of transcoding"
good,"As a contractor I felt like a regular employee except when I wasn't like when regular FTE took vacations and PTO. Ability to work from home a day or two a week was a nice benefit. The 'Manager"" I reported to was very supportive and honest about how I was doing and providing expectations and feedback. All in all it was a very professional environment, people worked hard but had fun too. I enjoyed going to work and engaging with folks from all over the world."

good,It is a great company with good colleagues and technology bar none but Mgmt needs to work on how to move ahead with it's teams.
good,"Was treated with alot of respect and learned about networking, big company culture and EMI solutions. Cisco was a great place to work and learn and I recommend it to anyone looking or an internship or a coop."
good,I always felt included (with the exception of one bad manager in 16 years) and I felt rewarded for my efforts. Enjoyed coming to work and the recognition for a job well done!
good,I was right in the middle of big change in the dept. so going through the emotions they had while learning my job was challenging.  People in my dept. were awesome.
good,"I worked at Cisco for nearly 4 years and I have to say, Cisco is a great place to work. I love the ""we are family culture and the give back to the community culture.Great Work Life Balance as well."

good,Satisfied. Team work. Big Projects. Good customer and partner base. Quality products and team. Treats employees well. Good work-life-family balance which is very much needed.
good,"Cisco is a great company with great people, benefits, culture and solutions.   I do feel like that it is making an effort to become a younger company by rotating out older employees.   If I could do it over again, I would have made more of a consertive effort to manage my career.   Cisco provided great work life-balance which was wonderful as a I raised younger children, but that may have cost me in the end as I was not as attentive to my career path...and being a remote employee, it was harder to build a network."
good,You have lot of facilities at the main campus but the appraisals may not be as expected. Work from home come easy. You can take PTOs with no questions asked
good,"A great learning experience. Learned how to examine the impact that cyber technology has for social, legal, and moral systems. It also evaluates the social policies and laws that have been framed in reply to issues generated by the development and use of cyber technology"
good,"Nice place to work, if you know your part"
good,"Good work-life balance and the work culture is great."

good,"A great place to work as it brings diverse workforces"
good,Working at Cisco gives work life balance. Management is good. No work pressure. Learning growth is little slow at pune office. Technology used is not very much updated.
good,Cisco e' best place to work sia per quanto riguarda l'italia che a livello mondiale...
good,"They have deadlines to meet, support the customers, getting jobs done. Quite environment. You get to take old Cisco equipment home which is retired and throw away. Only for use towards your certifications. Neat and clean buildings. Very customer oriented company to make the customer happy."
good,"A typical day consisted of handling 5-20 tickets per day and following up on cases to close them in a timely manner."
good,"Professional, knowledge sharing environment. Great customers and plenty of opportunity to grow. Worked with plenty of smart people. Would recommend to anyone wanting to be involved in the technology sector."

good,"Big Company to work. Hands on is less , but work life balance is there. Good  exposure especially in the networking side who are in the netowrking domain ."
good,"Cisco is a great place to work, the culture is relaxed and laid back and most of the people are supportive and great to work with.  Cisco offers the option to work from home which is great.  The only downside is the frequent layoffs."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Productive, Fun and excellent workplace culture. I enjoyed the 11 years at Cisco and the interesting roles that i have done"
good,"Great Work life balance. Can come and go as you please, as longas you get your work done. Paid time off, you can log off and not worry. There is no grinding you down to dust. Pipline to leadership needs work however."
good,"- Hectic Work Place"
good,"Great place to work if you want a good work/life balance. However, promotions are few and far between, and there is so much turnover there is little consistency in reviews sometimes."
good,"Amazing and work life balance."
good,"I enjoyed working at Cisco and there management folks I interacted with were stellar.  However, I did not have fun selling hardware.  I am much more of a software sales person."
good,"I worked mostly remote, but had a quiet and private office to work in when I was on campus.  My hiring manager was easy to work with and was open to any questions I had."
good,"Innovative"
good,It was a wonderful place to work at. Everyone was very helpful and the work environment was peaceful. I had the tools to do my job so it made it a better experience.
good,"Bottom line, is that no company is perfect. Cisco works hard to provide an environment where people feel safe and provided for. Total compensation is very good. The downside of Cisco is that we have few natural leaders who lead with passion and purpose. Rather, it is a group of highly competent executives that will never put their extremely lucrative comp-packages at risk by being bold."
good,it is great place to work at cisco. sometimes stressful. work culture is different in each team and some times it is very challenging and tough. overall satisfied
good,"Cisco is a rewarding place to work.  Compensation and benefits are competitive and there is ample opportunity to learn and work in new technologies.  But if an engineer is looking to park their career at Cisco and not grow with the technology, it is possible that they won’t have a long career there."
good,"Cisco provides ample opportunities for career growth by providing exposure to multiple technologies and opportunities to work in different BUs. At the same time, it also provides pretty good work life balance. Overall a great place to work."
good,"I was a Red Badge (contracted) employee. Blue Badge (permanent) have the perks, but we were able to enjoy some fringe benefits as contractors. Pay was decent and collaboration was high."
good,"5 years of experience in Information Technology with strong background in OBIEE, ODI, Oracle Applications, and Data Warehousing Complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) including System Requirements Collection, Architecture, Design, Coding, Development, Testing, Production Support, Maintenance and Enhancement in variety of technological platforms with special emphasis Client/Server, Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence applications in Windows and Unix environments."
good,"I just wished team feedback was more actively sought on wasteful subprojects that could be deferred. Otherwise, scrummasters keep team moving along.   More emphasis could be put on getting a minimum viable product out."
good,The people in any company set the expectations and form the culture for that company. Cisco hires great people who know what to do and will help you get started and up to speed. It's a great place to get work done that helps Cisco move forward while forming bonds with your co-workers as you help each other get things done.
good,"Good company for use your knowledges and backgound , but cisco does not support too much innovation and people are almost senior age there. For young and new graduate people , will feel it is too boring without much challenge"
good,"Hello, Cisco offers a Good work-life balance, job culture. And also Good Benefits. Challenging environment focused on business outcomes. Thank you. Regards."
good,Culture is customer and team focused.  Open to working remote on a regular basis.  Good benefits.  Lots of opportunities to move around to different functional teams and organizations.
good,"The USPS job is great and it offers opportunities if one is able to stick around for them. unfortunately they do not hire full time employers for people who are not yet working within the company. It takes an average of 8 years to get a full time position. If looking for a part time job , it is a great place to work at."
good,Great company to work for. Very relaxed atmosphere. Learning and growing within and outside of your current role is encouraged. Flexibility with scheduling.
good,Cisco has a great culture and is extremely flexible. The collaborative teams making life at work less stressful. I would definitely work for Cisco after graduating if given the opportunity.
good,"overall very positive 12 years. I did not get along with my manager, but that did not effect performance or quota. The typical work day consisted of customer meetings to outline the benefits of Cisco's security products"
good,"great place to work! great culture! "
good,Get on full time and avoid the $$ hungry headhunters as they will just bleed you dry compared to what you really would make and after your hired they have ZERO love for anything but the $$ coming in!
good,Would work here again if given the chance. Cisco is a great place to grow and learn so much from each other. It's a very diverse working environment that promotes a work-life balance.
good,I worked with great people on my immediate team but it was very hard to get help when needed as everyone was so stretched with their time and workloads. Many trial by fire projects that I was thrown into.
good,From people to culture to awesome food - cisco is a great place to work .. a great learning experience for all levels. Only thing is that it cannot manage acquisitions .. its buys good companies and does not know what to do .. and then sells it off or lets it rot .
good,"Good people, lots of fun, cool technology. Many Cool, so special, much awesome. Get a job there if you can. All of your wildest dreams will come true."
good,"Nothing but good things to say about Cisco. If you have a chance to work here, you absolutely should. It isn't nearly as competitive of a tech company as something like Google or Facebook, and work/life balance was excellent"
good,"it gives good opportunities to learn - udemy and another learning tools are freely accessible. employee complaints are taken seriously."
good,I was on a contract role (2 days a week) for almost 2 years and it was always busy but fun. Our HR team was composed of multicultural people but each treated each other as family. My manager was based in Japan and another colleague based in China but communication was never an issue as Cisco has all the high tech devices to be connected. I have enjoyed my stay in this company and would highly recommend it to applicants.
good,"I have supported Cisco's Verizon contracts for seven years.  I have had many challenging assignments, allowing me to enhance my Project and personal management skills"
good,Great to be working remote helps with work life balance. Travel to customer site was a bit of a hassle at times. But i did enjoy taking care of all my customers.
good,"Actually worked for Scientific Atlanta before sold to Cisco.20 year career. 8 good supervisors, 2 bad ones. Bad ones were fired."
good,"Good HR policies and good work-life balance in general within most teams. Lot of restructuring and random layoffs in the past few years."
good,great culture and ability to work from home.  results driven and great team work internally and with partners.  customer focus and provide great customer consultancy and advice
good,"I was a resident entrepreneur in the H-FARM and Cisco Technology accelerator in Venice, Italy."
good,"Good place to work"
good,Heb met veel plezier binnen cisco gewerkt en zou graag nog een keer daar willen werken.
good,"design, implement, configure and troubleshooting network, data center, virtual machine and storage. learn new technology every day. workplace culture is good."
good,"In my 4 years I worked on interesting, challenging service development projects. I worked with high caliber people, global."
good,The part I enjoy the most working at Cisco is the people. We have a fun and collaborative environment. But it also depends on the leadership and manager of the team. I am fortunate to have worked with some great managers and team members over the years at Cisco.
good,"good company culture "
good,Cisco has many business units and many locations therefore it is not possible to write a review about the company when I have only worked in 1 unit at one location. The cultures in the different units and locations vary.
good,"The best part about Cisco was the ability to try/do anything you wanted technically.  In labs, simulated labs, a internal support library resource that was out of this world and tons of great coworkers."
good,"As long as we produce deliverables, Cisco provides flexibility in work from home, timings and etc., "
good,had a great time there people and culture was outstanding everyone was willing to help out one another and did not keep to themselfs from the bosses to the field
good,"Everyday was a new challenge.  Work hard, play hard.  Great work life balance. Culture is amazing, everyone helps each other.  Everyone is treated as family."
good,"The main point I would like to emphasize around the environment that it is face paced, collaborative, and challenging. It takes an open mind to find the best way to virtually integrate within all the resources that a company like Cisco can provide to stretch yourself out to become the best you can be."
good,"The work life balance was excellent in the beginning of my tenure at Cisco. It probably depends on the group one works for. However, the balance shifted to an unhealthy cotntinuous cycle of late nights and weekend work for never ending projects."
good,"•	Manage overall relationship with the suppliers and contingent workforce"
good,"Cisco is innovative company. Good place to work and the employees are helpful. The workplace is enjoyable and dress code is business casual. There is free coffee, water and tea"
good,"Work life balance a plus, company culture great."
good,Good company to work at for SQA.  Stadium Vision department had a startup like work environment.  Work from home opportunity.  SCRUM. They cared about quality.
good,Worked at Cisco for four year in a supportive environment providing the necessary tools and education to perform at a high level.  Providing a culture to collaborate and understand to continually support the business need as it grows.
good,"Best Place to Work!"
good,"Cisco is a dynamic place to work with quality, smart people.  When brought in as a contractor there is missing business context at times due to lack of Cisco specific experience."
good,"Cisco is a leader in networking and continuously transforms itself to stay competitive.  It is a big organization providing opportunities to move around within the company.  Depending on the group you work in, the workplace experience may vary.  Some groups have very hectic schedules and long hours.  Others have a more manageable pace and better work-life harmony.  Benefits are great.  For directors and above, deferred compensation plan is also available.  With Cisco being a tech company, there are opportunities to work on latest technologies.  Cisco also provides good training."
good,"Cisco is an excellent, flexible place to work.  However, annual broad lay-offs have created a culture low on employee trust of leadership's intentions.  They repeatedly preach that employee welfare is a top priority (Employees are biggest asset, etc) while continuing senseless lay-offs."
good,"In general it is quite OK , however there are some teams where a lot could be improved."
good,Cisco is a great company to work with. Working environment is a key differentiator. Problem is that Cisco salaries are below average among Big Companies
good,A great place to explore > Lots of opportunity to drive development across a multitude of business areas. Managers who develop staff are there to help
good,The development work was mostly on enhancement and adding new features to the legacy product to the current marked needs.  Lack of technology advancement for product improvisation and personal development growth.
good,"Offered the opportunity to explore new areas, stretch skills and build new ones. Agile environment with autonomy to go solve identified problems across the company."
good,"Even though the company was experiencing some difficulties based on the commoditization of networking/telecoms hardware, they were very well run and positioned themselves well to compete in that more commoditized future."
good,"Excellent company, strong technology, best-in-class.  If presented with the opportunity to work for Cisco Systems, I would highly recommend.  The company provides tools, training and are very open to remote virtual office environments (provides a considerable amount of flexibility to its empljoyees)"
good,Great place to work. If you stay focused there are many positions within’ company you can advance to. Over all its been positive experience and a good contributor to the community.
good,Cisco is a good place to work.  I recommend it for employees looking for a big company.  There are many roles with growth opportunities .     The headquarters are San Jose.
good,"great work life balance, great benefits."
good,"Its a good place to have your career, you can make it what you want  Technology is evolving at faster paces.  Cisco is doing a good job to stay relevant"
good,"Cisco has great culture to innovate through various events like idea Jam. Play and learn and having Great culture for giving back.  "
good,Every team is different but in my team we provide autonomy in terms of projects you want to work on and skills you want to develop without micromanaging.
good,"Cisco has nailed the work life balance like no other company I've worked at thus far. "
good,"Cisco is a good place to work at. Like any company in a Sales environment, it is fast paced. The culture is good but one will need to know how to navigate a 70k+ employee company. Good pay, a lot of giving back opportunities."
good,"Really like to work with the team however it's hard to become a regular employee since the waiting period to be converted from contract to Cisco employee is so long.  The manager is nice, helpful whenever need help and he could speak up for the team as needed."
good,"Great company to work. Absolutely enjoyed working here."
good,"very good company with very good management, job security is high and culture is very good, it is a great honor to work there, salary is good and bring benefit"
good,A day at work be fun and healthy. I would more about the job as the day go. We all would work as a team to get things done. Wasn't nothing to hard about the job.
good,"Freedom of action and independence make things work better"
good,The company helps you to plan your career and select the projects you are interested in. Managers are very supportive both for full time employees and contractors. Teams very collaborative.
good,Good work life balance with remote teams. Culture is very supportive and work from anywhere. Management is employee friendly and there are many events for family & kids.
good,Work was interesting and fast paced.  Team work was above average.  Customer issues that required immediate attention took good portion of my time.  No issues with work or management
good,Good Company to work with and gives opportunities to build your career.My experience at Cisco helped understanding of requirements and making it a part of the system quality validation helped to deliver quality products
good,"Productivity was analysed for 5 hours a day which is quite good , had time for meeting and developing "
good,"It has been a good experience working with the company, i have learned a lot of new knowledge and gain good techniques when it comes to generating valid leads also i have learned how to evaluate and qualify the needs of a new prospects."
good,Best place for work life balance and learning cutting edge networking technologies. Expectations will be sometimes very high in terms of deliverables and quality.
good,"The company is generally a great place to work, but the employee experience varies from team to team. If you have a good manager and secure team you will love your job. If your team is going through a restructuring, or if your manager feels insecure, you may need to watch your back."
good,"Cisco is a great place to work, but in my particular team there is not much room for advancement beyond the Lead position that I am currently in. They offer health care, 401k, etc."
good,"Great company building great things. The company has pretty good work-life balance. Easy to become complacent though, but it depends on you and the team you are working on."
good,People make this a great place to work. Work flexibility is also a great perk. Experience varies based on projects you are involved and the different group.
good,"Overall it is a great experience working in Cisco. Will get to learn more things, but have to maintain pace. People are good and helpful. Learning depends on project type."
good,"productive and fun workplace..."
good,"Flexible work options and very competitive benefits package. Lots of wicked smart people working here, no wonder the company is so successful. Women in leadership positions is really refreshing. Work / life balance can be a struggle and periodic layoffs aren't fun, these are the trade offs."
good,Good company with great infra. Work is good and on latest technologies. Would love to have more travel opportunities to San Jose Cisco though. Located in a prime location in Bangalore and a hige campus to boot.
good,Cisco is a company where every one wants to work atleast one project because of the way they treat the employee and the benifits it offers.Good support for the one who willing to upgrade his work experience.
good,"La culture d'entreprise est très forte chez Cisco Systems, elle permet de maintenir une grande cohésion, elle unit le personnel autour du nom, des produits, des services, des clients, de l'image de marque. "
good,"This company can be a great place to work.  But so much depends on the group.  Some groups did lots of fun stuff and have great perks.  Whereas other groups didn't do anything fun.  Your job function will also impact life here.  Some jobs you need to be in the office, others, you can work from home 95% of the time.  Opportunity for advancement is odd here.  You won't find many, if any, Mechanical Engineers who are in management positions.  But if you are in sales or marketing, the skies the limit."
good,Cisco provides quite a few amenities to help with employee morale.  The culture provides a solid framework for success at the personal and professional level.  Some matrix teams are dysfunctional and do not have the necessary checks and balances.
good,"This company values employees who work hard and allows work life balance and fun as well. A small con is having IT helpdesk cenralized and not localized to each office location, so IT requests may take a long time to resolve, especially if approvals are needed."
good,"Pros"
good,Cisco does a good job of allowing employees to work remotely using the various collaboration tools.  This allows employees the best way to balance life with work.
good,"When I worked there, though it was the best place to work. People were mostly bright and talented. Managers were very supportive. The company supported innovation. Hours could be long, but enjoyable."
good,I was a consultant at Cisco and not a full time employee. My duties were the day to day project management duties to develop the application for a new product being offered.
good,"""Great place to work with good work life balance"" (in 2227 reviews)"
good,"My day in CISCO starts with standup call to update status of current work and any impediments we discuss , after this call I normally look at agile board and update remaining work hours  currently working story , writing JUNITS and necessary automation tests . everyday we have checklist to check failed jenkins automated tests and analyze why those tests failed , if necessary we need to fix code as it could be potential bug .  every afternoon we have meeting with technical architect and other senior members to discuss groomed user stories and their design . there would be so much learning curve in cisco , day to day activities we need to create new virtual machines and  connecting those nodes to communicate each other , setting up ssh , sftp and  DNS . BRDC and other QA management team contacts developers on their fixes and how to test it . this is where most of the developers will be engaged with different teams . hardest part of the job is sometimes it is hard to find issues as we are dealing with nodes and virtual machines , splunk can be used to find logs in different nodes , we can enable TRACE and find some clues to bugs and recreating problem is not that easy while dealing with docker VMs ."
good,Working for Cisco I gave me work-home balance and flexibility.  My 10 year career at Cisco I was remotely and that gave me the opportunity to attend to my young family.
good,"New work is coming is Cisco, as the company has plan to be a software oriented company. Work culture is good and facilities like work from home is available easily. Helps to maintain a work life balance."
good,"Great company. The working environment is quite open and supportive. A huge company with many opportunities available if you go looking for them that is, nothing will be handed to you. I would recommend anyone to join Cisco, that experience changed my life for the better and i will always carry fond memories of those times."
good,"At Cisco we had to develop our own decision making process based on Company`s rules and policies. This helps employees to develop self learning and self decisions on critical environments, which contributes for great self learning and  experiences for matrix organizations."
good,"One will get to work on a variety of technologies since new projects roll out every now and then, the organization being one of the most known globally."
good,"Cisco was a great place to work at, the management team there was great. If I had the chance to go back there, I would in a heartbeat. The culture there was amazing, good work life balance."

good,"It's a great a opportunity to work here . I learned a lot from seniors ."
good,"It is a great place to work, but I am a bit concerned about their recent lack of focus.  Ability to work at home promotes balance, as long as you can manage the travel"
good,"Company is going through some changes.  New CEO and a refocus to becoming a internet solutions company.  That growth and business focus change has great potential.  Overall I still think Cisco is a good company to work for. Benefits are very good, ability to continue career and education growth are plentiful.  Engineering areas can be intense work schedules.   But overall it depends on exactly what job role you are doing.    Cisco is a large company, was starting to get quite old and stuck in its ways, but they are revamping a lot.  From business strategy and focus to updated workspaces.   I would recommend as a good place to work."
good,"Cisco is a great company which allows for entrepreneurship. You can thrive in this environment, especially if you are self starter and can think innovatively. "
good,Great place to work with lots of interesting work and culture is nice.  I really enjoy my work! My co workers are very nice and willing to help new people come up to speed.

good,"A great place to work with supportive management."
good,I work  for Cisco for 16 years and really had a very good experience. I learned a lot of new skills. My coworkers were great in sourcing information and helping to get the job done.
good,ran the receiving dept. I learned a great deal there to bad in was a contract job every thing was free there food snacks drinks always a function going on great people
good,"challenging work environment ."
good,"Overall Cisco is a great company.  Considering it was built with acquisitions, there are fantastic and talented people onboard.The biggest challenge at Cisco is the lack of management attention span.  If the corporate focus is defined and sustained - it will emerge as an even more successful company."
good,"I was only part time, only teaching 2 or 3 classes per semester. I taught young adults who weren't ready for college level math, so I did not have classroom behaviour issues. There was a 50% drop out rate, so within a few weeks I had all students who wanted to learn. I learned that you have to say all the steps involved in being successful ( bring paper and pencil, take notes, write down this problem and do it on your paper now...) It was an easy job."
good,"At Cisco, I had several roles during my time there but my most recent was a Program Manager Supply Chain Inventory analyst. My core role was an inventory control analyst directing the cycling of obsolete inventory throughout our global service depots. My manager provided guidance and challenging opportunities to excel and learn all the aspects of the business.  I love my coworkers, we have been together off and on for years and we always had laughs and fun in our group. Some of the hardest parts of my job was cross collaboration commitment, getting other teams to buy in and commit to a started project. As far as the most enjoyable, just having a great team to work with and having an onsite health center."
good,"Cisco helps you learn a lot of new things. Management is great, Co-workers are very supportive. "
good,Cisco have more employee flexibility than any other company. the campus infrastructure is employee friendly. There is no discrimination between contract employees and permanent employees.

good,"un dia tipico en el trabajo era al inicio de turno llegar y checar las maquinas su funcionamiento despues ver las metas del dia a cumplir contar con todo lo necesario para el soporte del dia "
good,"Cisco is a good company to work for, however as a contractor (and employee as well as I was once a blue badge) nothing last forever. I was once a very loyal employee, but in this new culture you are just a resource to be used and done away with when the project is done. That said, I do like the flexibility to work remote and currently it is better than the other options that are available.  I'm not sure how long my role will last, and it sucks not having vacation, which I can't take as it hits the cash flow hard, so I send my family on vacation without me.  :(  It's been two years since I took a vacation."
good,"Good Company to work ..I learned RAC,Dataguard,Broker,Golden gate and many other latest technologies which helps me improve professionally and personally.."
good,"The job included development as well bug fixes following agile methodology. "
good,Working with CISCO helped in an overall development. The work culture and the management helped a employees in achieving their personal as well as company goals.

good,"This  was one of the HCL's client."

The concept of the network as the platform for transforming life's experiences is no longer a possibility: "

good,Cisco has a great culture and is fun place to work. It is a good starting place to learn and grow in Cisco technologies.
good,"Cisco is a great company but has lost a lot of agility due to slow decision-making and a top heavy corporate structure. The company is really great about work flexibility and you can mostly work from whatever location works for you. However, because of the global nature of the business you are often taking calls at all hours."
good,Team environment working with various levels of management.
good,"Good work life balance, emerging technologies are being used."
good,"I have loved all the jobs I've held in every company I've worked with. Especially in the rapid growth rate at Nortel. The work was hard, but the rewards of doing a job well were all that was needed. I found the hardest part of all my jobs is that there is so much to do and so little time. Almost always was the last one to go home, trying to stay ahead of the game. The best part was exactly the same as the worst part. Always had great working relationship with all my co-workers."
good,At first it was Scientific Atlanta and then Cisco. I can not stress enough how exiting and challenging my job was at SA and Cisco.
good,"we deals with L1 and L2 incidents , learned the contact center infrastructure , Good management , and strong team ,p1 incidents , MACD"
good,"IT was fun place to work. very casual culture, nothing to worry about coming in and going. Relax environment. Lot of freebee like tea coffee, snacks and soda ets."
good,I like to work at Cisco because it expanse my knowledge and skill and it open up a lot skill to be better as a worker and team player.
good,"Starting out as a contractor I found Cisco to be very good to non-employees and treating them as important as regular employees. Many changes occured during the years as the company grew and spread abroad. Very fast paced and so much to learn as technology evolved. Cisco gets it done in the name of technology advancement and profits, thats for sure. With economic slow-down and flat profits Cisco tries hard to be optimistic and maintain pace and keep employess as long as possible. They do value employees as essential assets. But layoffs do happen unfortunately. And most recenty this happened in the summer of 2011. Some of my colleagues lost their jobs. So, Cisco is a good company to work for, but just not perfect."
good,"You will have a work life balance in this firm. Get to learn many new tools."
good,Great teams to work with. Flexible timing. Cisco constantly introduces industry best practices in every aspects of IT and help teams assimilate and deliver at a faster rate.
good,Very good company that stress inclusion and diversity within the workplace.  Trends on the more advance side of technology and is a forward thinking company.
good,"Cisco follows good work culture"
good,The dedication of the employees to deliver and surpass the customer's needs. The company's goal to be a leader in technology innovation and customer satisfaction
good,It was nice working with Admin team in Cisco.  Cisco employees were very good to us. As a team it was very nice.  They were very good flexible and open minded.
good,"I was happy to be associated with brand Cisco and look forward to be a part of any team in future."
good,"I've made some great acquaintances here. There are some amazing leaders, but also in a company this size, there are teams with not so great leaders. The culture is really nice, and the benefits are fantastic as well. The opportunity to work on a diverse and global team has been a fantastic experience for me as well."
good,"Cisco is an incredible company to work for.  I was consistenly in awe of the level of people I got to work alongside.  I learned something new everyday, whether it be something important to do with my role or something incredible from a co-worker.  I loved what we were doing inside of companies, providing solutions rather than equipment.  It is extremely cut throat though and dog eat dog.  If you know that going in, I think you can be incredibly successful!"
good,"This is the best place for Freshers, so much learning and many opportunities to enroll for corporate training. Relaxd work environment."
good,"Co-workers and supervisor make it a great place to work but constant threats of layoffs (or ""LRs"" - limited restructuring), constant re-orgs (I'm reporting to my 4th new manager in 3 years) and limited promotion opportunities (hiring decision made before the jobs are even posted) make it a bit more lack luster."
good,"Good workplace and great working culture,"
good,"not much to say that cant be answered in my ratings. This landmark company was a great boost in my evolving career. Although I worked with CBRE through a facilities contract, we were still ""one team"""
good,"Role model company of work life balance.  Leader in the industry and willing to take risks to make it to stay innovative.  A typical day at Cisco involves strategic planning meetings, adequate lunch hour, and time to connect with coworkers."
good,"Large company. Must be a self-starter. Demanding high pace. Rewarding. Always learning. Management supportive of risk taking, development of new skills. Culture positive. Find your village within the larger city. Available tools and training. Much job satisfaction and pride to work/represent Cisco products and solutions. Great channel partner eco-system."
good,Cisco encourage self promotion and forward looking to solving problems and solutions. The environment allows room for exploration and investigation but will be on your own time. Managers tend encourage small competitiveness among the teams and individual. The executive and management teams shuffles around every 3 to 5 years to keep everyone from becoming fully settled in.
good,Working for Cisco has really been a pleasure.  Being able to engage on interesting and rewarding projects while maintaining a work life balance working remotely is a huge benefit in my opinion.
good,"Everything looks good, there are ways to grow. Need to explore new to progress. Will definitely recommend. Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning, chatbots would be great to have."
good,"Cisco operates as a bunch of startups within the larger company. However, it is still overseen by the larger company and layoffs are inevitable. They do have a pretty good package if you are laid off, so can't complain about that, but the constant fear of layoffs is not great for the work environment. I cannot fault my direct manager as he had no part in it and was a great person to work under."
good,Good to start your career. You can take online / in-person classes in case you want to learn something. Promotions/hikes are slow. Good work life balance.
good,Good company but large.  Hard to create friendships because a lot is done remotely.  Need more face to face interaction a lot depends on your direct boss.
good,I enjoyed my time at Cisco-- but then as a contractor I was let go and was later replaced by two different people all because I didn't live in the right location.  If they had asked they might have found out I was willing to move.  Instead they paid double the salary what they were paying to keep just me.  Otherwise I really enjoyed my time with the overall time with the company.
good,Let me say first Cisco is a great place to work. I think they created the word TEAM. As everyone is eager to help solve whatever issue you may face. Some of the most brilliant minds in the world work at Cisco.
good,"Good place to work. Well balanced work life. "
good,"Employer, Manager and colleagues were all great. Everyone at that company had a wealth of knowledge in their respective areas. They are great at hiring a diverse experience . They are a great company to work for and work to help meet their employee's needs."
good,It was pleasure working there and lot of good opportunities to excel and perform. There are many talented people within the company. Company always tries to implement new technologies.
good,Great place to work! good work life balance and remote work opportunities. Too many changes in management makes it extra challenging to build rapport fast.
good,Its a great company to be a part of. Good work culture. Good leadership. Flexible place. Though some of this is purely driven bt the leaders in particular organization.
good,"Cisco burns out its employees.  But, they also reward well."
good,Typically come in and check email / messages. Figure out priorities and work accordingly. You will usually have to work with others to proceed with work. I was consistently challenged and there was never a dull moment in this position.
good,"Overall great place to work. Culture is good people are pleasant and management doesn't bother you. I think they acquired to much so a ""restructure"" was needed but a poor review of my position leaves my former team in some hardship. Wish management coordinated things better and we weren't all brought to a large area and told we didn't have jobs."
good,"Very diverse culturally which allows for people to be themselves.  There is a lot of moving parts that make up the whole so it is fast paced in keeping up with all the many training, professional groups, and activities.  The hardest part of the job is that it is very intense in that as an Engineer you will not know everything.  Customers figure out a way to creatively turn up circuits and use equipment so you have to be comfortable with probing and asking questions."
good,There are many of great people developed amazing tools which is helping to grow business in a fast phase . add something new learn even  in small thing in day that helps to grow personally
good,Flexible place to work with good work place benefits such as a great gym and staff. Pool and Ping Pong table for those that can't sit in their cubes for too long. Lots of budget for teams to have fun per quarter. Opportunity to grow as an individual from a technical stand point. In terms of financial growth it can be slow.
good,"working in cisco is really wonderful, its one of the largest company in the word. The work culture is really good. People are corporative. Lot of facilities to employees."
good,good and very interesting.infrastructure is very good.with all sort of games and activities. we are permitted to take our family weekend  and enjoy the facilities there.
good,"Great company until things change in your area, and they inevitably do. Then you have no idea what's going to happen. Management level changes are often opaque at lower levels, and the true reasons changes were made and people let go never are revealed, or are glossed over."
good,"A typical day at work consisted of getting leads in the morning to prospect and have one meeting a day with my team."
good,"Goeie collegas, lekkere sfeer om te werken. Erg behulpzaam."
good,"The childcare facility is very clean and well up to date. A typical day starts with setting up the classroom and activities for the children. Throughout the week, we keep a daily data entry of the children's schedule such as; nap, food, and diaper changes. This is a very face-paced workplace and teachers are always expected to be on their toes. We must ensure that our children are absorbing all of the information as well as ensuring their safety and security which can be the most difficult part of the job. Otherwise, witnessing the children grow within our eyes are the most rewarding feeling working here. I truly love working with children."
good,"drafted by the NY Yankees when i was here. Cisco has been at the forefront of delivering the promise of the internet for almost 30 years. if you have an opportunity to work here, think long and hard, then take it."
good,"Great work life balance, worked as a Automation engineer and had a great experience working with MITG, Pune. Easy to reach the management for any concern."
good,Cisco has a better culture than other places I have worked. There are many opportunities to take your career in just about any direction related to Information Technology. They have great benefits and work conditions.
good,"The manager and the team were great.  The company lays off religiously it's perm people, and the contractors, though treated very well and respectfully, get let go often due to constant, quarterly budgetary fluctuations.  No long term budgetary planning...live by the stock value, quarterly.  Typical telcomm company, but better than the rest...as far as telcomm goes."
good,Good work life balance and decent compensation. middle management is little rusty and sometimes hinder development. Lot of that is changing and is gearing towards technology focus.
good,"Cool people "
good,Great company to work for.  Amazing collaborative culture although it really depends on who your manager is.  Customer-facing positions are the most interesting.
good,"Cisco is a top notched company to work for, with a world-class CEO at the helm. I feel blessed to have had the opportunity to work for them for 10 years. Great benefits and pay and the best talent in the industry. I worked with a very professional group of people and it was the only company I have ever worked for, where there was no politics or drama. We were a remote business unit in Irvine, however the executive management team decided this business unit was no longer needed in their new business model. This was the hardest part about the job, 50 of us never saw it coming. It was a great ride however."
good,"Overall I enjoyed my time as a Cisco Contract worker.  My first team leader was flexible with time, plus or minus 30 minutes per week.  The team and work were both new, so we were free to make decisions and changes.  The environment was friendly and diverse with opportunities to participate in corporate activities.   As a contractor, it was a good place to work."
good,"There was literally no complaints with in the team i was working with."
good,I got a remote position and love it. I am uneasy about job security since Cisco tends to do layoffs annually but overall am happy I decided to work for them. My team mates are a bit competitive though and reluctant to collaborate.
good,"Proud to work for Cisco, they are a great company that tries to make a positive impact in the world. If you love the technology field, definitely strive to work here."
good,"Cisco is one of the best company to work for, it offers a great work life balance. Work environment is quite good, with all the facilities. Work from home is allowed whenever it is needed. Management is quite good and knows how the company is going to move. Predictability is there."
good,"A great place to work and grow. For the short period of time that I have worked here, the exposure has been immense. Work life balance is great, I have always been able to give equal importance to my personal life as well as professional. "
good,"A typical day consist in coming early in the morning, then I dial in to the morning conference call. During that call we go through the daily requirement, then off to work for the rest of the day with a lunch break. I do use the Gym by the end of the day."
good,"Cisco offers a lot of facilities and benefits to employees for entertainment, well-being and networking. However, there is not much in terms of challenging work assignments and career progression is slow"
good,"Cisco is a good place to work, but not the best. Sometimes you will feel stagnated. Sometimes management decisions are slow. Office culture is good and professional"
good,"Excellent place to work, learn and be challenged to succeed. The best part of the job is the people and the culture. The opportunity to see your work make a difference to the world is truly rewarding."
good,"Pros:"
good,"Nice company. A global leader in networks. Managers are nice  and helping. Ample amount of time to learn and explore new technologies. "
good,The people I've worked with at Cisco have been some of the finest and smartest engineers I've ever known. Most understand the value of good team work and will put in the extra effort to get a job done well. I have been fortunate to work on leading edge technology and with using some of the best tools and resources. Telecommuting is widely accepted as long as it doesn't hinder productivity or collaboration but many use it as advantage to gain extra hours from the day by skipping the commute. The downside is company reorganizations and layoffs. They are annual and no one or any group is exempt.
good,I had a great experienced with the entire team. Manager was transparency and opened for communication. It was a flexible workplace that I enjoyed the most.
good,"As global corporation goes, the boxborough office is nice and welcoming. The size of the corporation doesn't allow for a fun work culture however so it can become somewhat monotonous as well. Standard benefits and supporting workplace though. Going above and beyond to help out to those who need help."
good,Great company to work for. The hours were great. The company was very diverse. I love working in Research Triangle Park. The workload was a lot but the time went by fast.
good,"* Good work life balance"
good,"Same as the previous one."
good,"The technology, tools and the practices followed are top notch. Th work culture and the teams are friendlier than expected and compensation along with benefits is good."
good,I absolutely loved working at Cisco over the past 22 years.  We worked hard but we also had time to take off and play hard. The culture at Cisco is like that of a young company.  One of the best parts of the job was being able to work from home or remotely.  The leadership team was constantly changing so that impacted progress in key areas.

good,"Great place to work for a good work life balance but slow and difficult career advancements"
good,"- half of the time was spent working with Sales team in establishing support value and making business proposals commercially viable"
good,Was placed in a team with a Manager that was new to team leadership lacking basic team building skills.  As well there are many layoffs with this company every so many years.  Other than that everything was amazing and would love to rejoin the company on a different team.  Excellent Environment!
good,"Cisco, while going through a major transition from hardware to software and services, continues to be a great place to work.  It has become a large company that is not as nimble as it once was, but remains a great company.  I would go back to Cisco in a heartbeat if the right opportunity arose.  Loved working there."
good,"Competitive networking company in the midst of reinventing itself. Good culture and compensation; challenges in communicating priorities across such a large, global employee base"
good,"I have been working at Novitex Enterprises Solution on Cisco RTP, NC Site handling all shipping and receiving  for 1 year and I am truly excited each day because I have an opportunity to think about my current role, my opportunity to grow and most important my value to the community.

good,"I get to work on a variate of  products that increased my knowledge and experience. I worked on everything from writing embedded linux applications to hardware bring up..."
good,Excellent opportunity for a term but Instability the entire time.  Always worried when will it end.  The turn around is way to high.  Not knowing when your tour may come to an end leaves you in a state of constant worry.  The atmosphere is of two separate worlds Red badge and Blue badge. Its difficult being a Red badge.
good,"Cisco Systems India is a Good place to work. Work life balance is very good. Flexible timings and work from home options present."

good,"Culture of performance. There is flexibility and freedom to pursue what is right for the customer. "
good,decent place to work at...flexible work opportunities which enables a good work-life integration...progress is very slow...process bound so it may take a whole set of approvals to start something new or even get something done...
good,Cisco is an excellent company in the Silicon Valley. It has a vibrant culture of performance and accomplishments. Work-life balance could certainly improve for all employees.
good,"It may be a bit dull sometimes but this company is stable, well paying and looks great on a resume. I recommend spending some time here as they will develop you as an employee."
good,"Cisco is a good place to work, has a good work culture and is focused on collaboration and team work.  Focus of Cisco is changing continuously to suit the market needs and the needs of the customer."

good,"Taught everything there is to know about the workplace and different aspects of a company for example marketing and what the job consists of."
good,"Very good Company, where we can balance both professional and personal life."
good,Working for Cisco has been a phenomenal experience. They invested more in developing me in the first 4 months I was there than any other company has in my entire tenure. Management helps guide you in becoming a successful account manager but you need to take the proactive approach and schedule time with your management team for guidance as they have far too much on their plate. Because of the high pressure and high demands that Cisco puts on their teams there is a lot of turnover overall in the company.
good,"I have worked at Cisco for 15+ years. It's a great company that gives back, has strong moral standards, and produces great products. Smart people and flexible work environment."
good,Transitioning to a software company. Great Work/Life balance. Job security is questionable with the high employee count.
good,"I have been worked for Cisco almost 10 years, I had 13 managers so far. It's a continually change enviroment, everyone in the company has been used to this. Most of them are good, but sometimes not so much. Overall Cisco is a great company, one step ahead in its industry, and I believe one day Cisco will be No 1 IT company in the world."
good,"I loved my time at Cisco. The job was challenging and fun, but the best part about it was my great and talented coworkers and what they achieved."
good,"Cisco has a great culture, and is the leader in their industry.  I enjoyed the 17 years working there, but am ready for new challenges."
good,I have learned about being a team player helps in resolving lot of issues like technical depth will covered and in future i can deliver the requirement on my self. The most exciting part about IT is once you get a feeling that your words are counted then you will achieve confidence in taking risk.
good,I had a great experience all the years I went back and forth to Cisco. The best part was how much they took care of their employee's when needing time off or the chance to work from home. The work life balance was very important and the group of people I worked with were awesome.
good,"Learnt about Supply chain Organization."
good,Cisco has provided me a very good learning experience.It is a great place to work as it inherits an open culture for work. We get a lot of opportunities to work in a client place.I am an early in career candidate and to get this kind of exposure is amazing.
good,Job culture and benefits are great but they have acquired other smaller companies and didn't set good goals to proceed. These companies were doing well on their own and turned out to be closed down by Cisco just a short time later on. It was not because of the products itself bu the lack of skills to manage them
good,"Poste demandant  une disponibilité et du professionnalisme."
good,Cisco is the first company I have worked with after college.For the last 4 years my career with Cisco has been enjoyable and rewarding.
good,"Overall, I would rate Cisco as a great place to work.  Except, that is, when my entire development org was oversea'd to India just to save a few bucks (result was that our development contracts were not met due to the technology transfer).  So, I would rate some of the upper-level management as being too politically motivated instead of focusing on the customer's needs."
good,"-  Great place to learn and advance your technical skills and knowledge"
good,"Interesting work place Good, good for benefits and good place for work. "
good,When working a long day and all your projects are completed it is something to feel good about. Then you wake up feeling that more project to complete the next day.
good,Fun work place with supportive management that allows for additional efforts and self created opportunities which can potentially lead to change.   Complex business culture due to sheer size and diversity of functions.
good,I have a very great and nice finance team here. People are very friendly and always help out each other. I enjoyed very much to work with the team and the company.
good,Work environment is indeed great in Cisco systems.Please are great to work with.Has a great campus and work life balance is great.
good,"Provides an opportunity for great work life balance. Hard work and results are reasonably recognised and rewarded."
good,"Work ranges from functional testing to setting up lab, attending customer issues and troubleshooting the problem; Work with the developers to root cause the issue by reproducing the problem in the local lab.  "
good,"A typical day at work.  Unlock front door, prepare meeting rooms, greet visitors, catering, mail deliveries, coffee orders.  Management was not always consistent.  A little on the micromanagement side at times and then completely the opposite in other issues.  My coworkers were all male engineers and the nicest guys in the world!  Cisco is so huge that some things were difficult to find the answers to in finding the right people to contact.  However, my peers in other cities were extremely helpful and friendly."
good,I enjoyed working at cisco.  Beside one of the managers I enjoyed the environment.
good,"It was a great place to work."
good,Cisco has a very flexible work culture that can help employees balance work life balance.

good,Cisco is one of the easiest interview to crack for a techy. Although the job profile and work load differ on the basis of the team.
good,"Cisco has been an excellent employer."
good,"Cisco is a great company with an incredibly open culture. Opportunities exist for folks to develop themselves by working in different aspects of the business. Co-workers are usually smart and willing to help out regardless of the teams they are in. More recently though, because of the struggles that the business is going through, there seems to be less trust in people. Hopefully, over the next few quarters things will become better and leadership will pay attention to ensuring that the culture does not become one of ""dog eat dog"". Most difficult thing about Cisco is that since it has become a very large company, and given its democratic culture, it takes many conversations to get things moving. But the benefits are well worth it - most managers are willing to give employees a free hand. Positive impacts are acknowledged and rewarded."
good,"I really enjoyed the flexibility and working from home some days.  My Microsoft Excel skills greatly improved while working here.  You stay pretty busy, especially during quarter end, month end and year end trying to process deals quickly so Account Managers can meet their goals.  Otherwise, it is a pretty laid back environment."
good,"Highly motivated organisation with good alignment to their core markets. Work in the credit arena is high pressured, but in an supportive team atmosphere. Transactions for leases, loans, structured finance from small ticket ($50k) up to large corporate facilities into the $100m plus range. Very much a global collaboration, not just from the credit segment, but god support from other departments. Hardest part of the job are the last minute changes to what you though was a completed deal. The best part of the job is dealing with the difficult submission and having it finally agreed by the client."
good,"Interesting work "
good,I am a long time employee and have been very satisfied with the work/life balance and the flexible work environment.
good,"Pros – Great facilities like work from home, cafeteria, cabs. Frequent rewards, good HR policies, great offices. Company encourages you to get as techie as possible and rewards you for research, patents etc."
good,"Typical day started around 7:30 am and ended at 3:30pm"
good,"The work is project-based, and you got to work with different people within the department for different projects. Because each project is different, team members have the opportunity to learn new knowledge about different business processes and systems in the company. Each audit project is quarterly-based, including 3 major phases: planning, fieldwork, reporting. During the planning phase, we will have meetings with clients from multiple departments in charging different functions of the process. Based on our understanding of the process, we will brainstorm the potential risk areas and the risk level. Based on the risk assessment, we will draft the work program. In the fieldwork phase, we will conduct testing based on the program through phone meeting with clients or go onsite to conduct inspection and inquiry. Each week we will present our project progress and potential observations with clients. In the reporting phase, we will draft the audit report and present the findings to our department's director and VPs, as well as to the process owners (clients).Managers will keep track of the implementation of the suggestion or recommendation agreed by the client."
good,"One of the best companies to work in."
good,I worked on a production line and oversaw the production line and tested and aligned circuit boards and soldered a bit. My manager was really nice. Everyone got along great. The hours at the job was tough sometimes. I enjoyed the free cable TV.

good,"Learned a valuable skill with welding, torching, electrical diagnose and repair."
good,"Cisco offers many opportunities for engineers but not much for non-technical individuals, especially if you have an office outside of San Jose. Positions are very demanding and it seems that you are on call 24x7. Between conference calls with customers, India and San Jose, I was working unbelievable hours and work/life balance was a struggle. When I was expected to still maintain my schedule on vacation, I realized that there was more to life than Cisco. If you can handle the pressure and hours, the pay and benefits are good."
good,Paid well and provided with an excellent environment for a work life balance
good,"Fun place to work. Like anywhere, the job is what you make it."
good,"Balanced work life, challenging work, good training infrastructure,"

good,"I have been working at Cisco Systems  for around 2 years.Everything is at the best with great work-life balance."
good,"Pros"
good,"Working as a first-time CX Engineer at Cisco is simply put, ""drinking through a fire hose."" With that said, the teams within CX(formerly TAC) are very helpful and friendly to work with and leadership is generally more that accommodating. The workplace environment needs a face lift from the morbid cubicle lifestyle, but the compensation, pay and free food during the weekdays is a plus. The recreation rooms have pool and ping-pong and the cheap gym is an added bonus as well. If you are prepared to spend 100% of the time with a customer via emails and voice conferencing, while troubleshooting and learning leading-edge technology, Cisco CX is the place for you."
good,"Great place to work"
good,"At Cisco i worked on multiple projects at any given time.  I made sure i took breaks as needed to maintain healthy work balance."
good,"I have been in Cisco for past 5+ years. And, am quite satisfied. The company is stepping up to embrace new technologies. Its Bangalore campus is a very good place to work at."
good,"Loved working at Cisco. The campus is beautiful and the co-workers are great. You quickly feel at home at Cisco. Your work team quickly becomes part of your extended family.

good,"Loved working for Cisco, Best company worked for. Great culture, outstanding management. Wide spectrum of opportunities, Big on diversity and inclusion, compensate generously."
good,"The culture of Cisco has changed over the years, from a start-up attitude to big-company corporate attitude.  Both have their values and the change was inevitable due to the growth of the company."
good,"I have a hard time reconciling some great experiences and growth at Cisco with being hit by the annual ""limited restructuring"" (layoffs) that the company likes to do, especially during a year where my job performance merited a significant raise. So my feelings about it will never quite be the same. But even with that, I would rate my overall time with the company at a 4.5."

good,"Good company to work for. Employees are treated well. Many opportunities to get hands on a lot of new technologies. However, the decision making is mostly top down, rarely bottom up. VP level management is replaced every one or two years. Every new VP has his or her different new vision, and prefer to work with his or her new team instead of previous team. It usually result in total shift of project direction, and lots of fire and hire. Then, before the new team finishes the new project, the new VP get replaced by a newer VP, another round of fire and hire ...    Such frequent changes have lead to many half baked projects being thrown into trash bin, and many talented engineers being pushed to join competitors with a fat layoff package."

good,I would say that my work and creative contribution experience might be unique on the Corporate Social Responsibility team. I can't speak highly enough about the team I work with. I found it to be a very pleasant environment thought the hours can be extensive. They renew their contractors quarterly so that means they like to keep the rope tight and release it quickly if initiatives or budgets change. That is the way they've managed contractors for many years. In addition because of cost containment and other reasons - there will be a news classification system for all contractors and it remains to be seen if it is an efficitnt method for management and cost containment as well as contractor relationships.

good,"I liked my experience at Cisco because I learned a lot by working with a lot of very smart people. It is a very competitive place, so it is not good for someone who seeks work life balance. I was well compensated, but along with it the compensation, I felt obligated t go more than was asked in order to remain relevant within the eyes of management. The hardest part of the job is that I had to work with a lot of cross functional team members, but I had to do a lot of investigation to find out who I need to speak with to get what I need. The company is very disparate, instructions tend to be very vague, and those who can come up with ways to solve things on his own the fastest wins. I was constantly faced with balancing areas that are overly prescriptive with areas that were overly vague, yet management expect very specific outcome, and you don't necessary know what they are up front."

good,"Lots of on job learning opportunities. Gives you lot of resources to train yourself on new skills."
good,"Cisco is an industry leader - and it shows.  Culture is respectful, supportive and competitive.  Managers are mostly supportive, yet in many cases, due to many layers of management, difficult to make change and move with Agility.  Upper management changes too frequently and therefore makes it difficult to see improvement and positive results before the next change .  These comments relate to HR/  and not related to technical roles."

I specialise in developing Brand Identities that position my clients ahead of their competitors, ultimately making client businesses more profitable."

Demand Planning, Consesus Ship Plan and Consesus Book Plan forecasting, Logistics, TAA Tariffs, automating and managing supply chain tools for metrics. Order visibility to MPAs and DPs is paramount. Liaison with customer service counter parts for result achievement on recommits and expedites with the executive. The hardest part of this job is to have all the tools that can tell a complete story of an order from time booked, entered to promise date and ship. The most enjoyable part of this job is its flexibility, company outings from time to time, and working with great, very knowledgeable people who really care."

good,I love and enjoy helping people. Resolving a Cisco employee's computer issue gives me a great sense of purpose. My job is to help others so they can do their job.

good,Productive and great place to work. I would recon as a starting point for anyone looking into Networking. Great place to extend your knowledgeable and experience

good,Great Company Culture and work life balance. The office and people provide a great working environment with a beautiful campus. There is a reason Cisco is a top 10 employer.
good,"Awesome place, good culture."
good,I as a contractor at this company.  I am not particularly interested in writing a review other than Cisco System is a major technology company that supplies millions of organizations with technology solutions.
good,"Good part about Cisco is flexibility. I could work from any where based on my preference. However, work schedule was not under my control.  Most of the days, I had to work for more than 8 hours. Found it hard to balance between family and work life."
good,"Cisco is a really nice company to work for, but recently has started hiring too many people that do not have experience in high technology. The company offers a lot of benefits, a really flexible work environment, fair compensation and career growth opportunities. For someone going in with serious technical talent, it could be a challenge to continue to work effectively in a team that is being managed by people who have never been technical and do not necessarily understand technology."
good,great place to work for WLB if you have families or have to take care of family. the culture is very flexible and people work remote without issues regularly.
good,"If you are lucky to be in right group, you are successful. Too many useless meetings and politics. Half of the time is lost in handling these useless things."

good,I was contacted by YOH to fill a job at Scientific Atlanta. I enjoyed the work and my managers. I was supported to move within the company once hired permanently.
good,Citation Oil was a good place to work plenty of things to learn and grow. Until a new manager was hired that had no idea of what to do in the IT world. When it became apparent and I started to speak out they let me go.

good,"Working as Customer Service Representative was a great opportunity for me to learn how to deal with different customers enquiries under pressure."
good,"Great place to work with Job Work/Life Balance. I have been with Cisco for 2 years and I am truly excited each day because I have an opportunity to think about my current role, my opportunity to grow and most important my value to the community."
good,"Being part of Cisco, I learned great deal on product Culture and Agile Deployment. WorkLife Balance, I enjoyed. Cisco offered world class facility and learning opportunities"
good,"Rarely stressful, very happy work environment.  The compensation is very low compared to other Bay Area companies and no matter how hard you work as a consultant, you will never be rewarded with a full time opportunity or more pay.  The story always revolves around the budget.  Be sure you negotiate a high rate before you start because chances are, you will stay at that rate for a while."
good,"Cisco cares about its employees and its image. Cisco offers much in the way of open collaboration, learning and a diverse work environment that is fun, energizing and empowering"

good,"My day at work is productive and Fun place to be at, learned much about a corporate world and team coordination and multi tasking"
good,Contract workers are almost a majority. Frequent re-organization can often reduce the workforce.
good,"A typical day at work consists of running macros/scripts on 3 different sets of routers to update the IOS and other various software updates to prepare routers for Mechanical, Hardware, and Software quality assurance testing. I learned a lot about navigation through routers and debugging them. The managers were great you could tell they decided on options that would be in the best interest of their own workers. Co-workers were friendly and willing to teach. The hardest part of the job was dealing with the down time when our lab had little to no projects coming in to be worked on. The most enjoyable part of the job was the ability for me to show my skills and talents to the people around and the learning experience and the connections I made with my co-workers."
good,working at cisco was a great experience. the teams and environment is great.
good,"This environment requires very high levels of comittment to the job in time and a high energy job."
good,"Cisco represents worldwide one of the best Companies to work for."
good,"* Friendly work-culture"
good,"Cisco is a good company, and for many that review this comment that would be very nice.  However, Cisco was once a great company. The culture was one of the best for work/life balance, and extremely fun.  Unfortunately, that is not the case so much today.  It still has the potential to be great again, but there needs to be a major management shift at the top with more focus on recovering the positive culture, and more focus on providing their customers solid (tested) products that don't need constant Engineering Special software updates. All in all, I still very positive about the company and feel they have tremendous potential."
good,A very friendly Environment with Lots of potential to learn
good,You learn a lot & are pushed. The work from home option helps with the work/life balance.
good,Typical work day is 9-10 hours. Many opportunities to learn technical and non-technical areas of the business.
good,"Its good place to work, Lots of training sessions are conducted, work-life balance is very much smooth."
good,Great place to work.  If you're service oriented and customer satisfaction is gratifying then Cisco is a great place to work.  There's always new technological advance to keep me growing and ample challenges to keep me growing
good,"Great experience, great people and culture as well as advancement.  Great mentorship program and fantastic leaders.  Yearly company reviews though may leave you layed off even though you were a top performer."
good,"I did like to work at Cisco."
good,"If you are keen to work with cutting edge technology, Cisco is the place for you. Sometimes things can be hectic, but there is an overall sense of responsibility and one can take up and do things that one has interest in, apart from your regular work.Overall experience and career progression depends on your manager and team. There is good competition and it helps bring out the best in everyone."
good,"Cisco is a great place to work at with friendly people and family focus. If I have to reflect any changes is that CISCO, as a company, can be more stablized with Job security. I have seen many loyal workers be let go (With good packages) because their department isn't needed. Instead of CISCO finding another placement for them in its company, they instead let them go which is not a good comfort working there with that risk."
good,"Cisco has been a big part of my working career and it is a great place to work.  Each day brings a new and different challenge. There is a great amount of diversity in my role. "
good,"Cisco is a great place to work and learn from others on your teams. All of my teammates were smart, energetic people who want to get things done. I truly enjoyed my time at Cisco."
good,"Overall a good place to work. Lots of flexibility with where and how you complete your work. Outside of onsite and some sales positions, remote work is the standard. It some roles it may be hard to advance as you are up against a lot of highly motivated and smart people."
good,"This was a good place to work. Their was some politics but that is normal for big companies. Their benefit packages are good, and gives you the ability to self teach."
good,"I loved working at CISCO!! Sure, the work was challenging, but the pay was excellent! They offered free coffee and the opportunity to work anywhere in the building. There were also days that you could work from home, once you were trained. I think there was a great work life balance with this company once you are trained. I would recommend this company to contractors."
good,"It has been a lifetime of experience with amazing learning and personal and professional development."
good,"Enabled Channel Partners and Sales teams in selling the Enterprise Services portfolio into Global & Enterprise accounts across all Cisco solution areas, with the objective of growing and supporting the business.  Responsibilities included Program/Project management."
good,"Strong culture, opportunities to ""make a difference"" due to Cisco's clout in the marketplace.  Tremendous customer base and reputation that definitely furthered my ""personal brand"" and relationships in the industry."
good,"Great Company to work for. However ended up stuck in the customer support role for 4 years. Had to leave so not to be pigeon holed in one role."
good,People and culture were the best.  Work/Life balance was non-existent.  Seemed to work 24/7 until you can get your duties in order and have a back up plan in place.
good,Was very enjoyable and peaceful place to work with all benefits. Enough time was given to complete a work along with which lots of opportunities to improve ourself.
good,"Cisco is a great company to work for.  They have great benefits and a strong portfolio.  It is an ever changing business though and job security is not always there.  On the plus side though having Cisco on your resume makes it easy to find a new job if needed.  The pay is good but not as high as other company's in the same field.  They did just redo how they do compensation though and I think this will now improve.  Overall management is good, of course there are a few that slip through the cracks but most of my experience has been great and I have positions in sales, support and services so I have seen managers across the board."
good,"Valuable work experience, opportunity to work directly with clients utilizing Cisco equipment and resources. I don’t have much more to explain in reference to Cisco"
good,Global meetings with different teams all day and presentations and work still required to be finished and ready to present.  Collaboration with many levels of management and global teams. At times work can be very stressful and depending on management  you can have a work/life balance.  Hardest part will be the manager you end up with and their style of managing. Working in the right environment is key to each individual.  Enjoyed working with my last  manager and the life balance offered.
good,Working for Cisco as a contract status worker was a good experience. Very good working environment for technology products and services.  I would like to work full time.
good,".Flexible timings"
good,"A typical day at Cisco is fairly relaxed, yet busy. In addition to daily duties, there is always a quarterly opportunity to enroll in training courses for career advancement openings. "
good,Great place to work except for the frequent lay offs.  As soon as your group is not the latest greatest thing in IOT you get laid off.  This happens every year some years more than once.
good,"It is Cisco, great technology, Great co-workers"
good,Personally I've had 6 different supervisors in my 3 years of being with the company. Look form a more stable leadership which i can build a relationship with.
good,"Very supportive of work-life balance. Suitable for a person who is looking for stability to focus on other aspects of life (example: family, traveling)."
good,"I worked with a stellar team of smart, collaborative people and loved what I did. I was able to positively impact our business, and improve the customer experience and see measurable results. My manager was proactive and challenged us to perform at a top level – which we did on an ongoing basis. I worked cross functionally with content strategists, copywriters, UX designers, product managers, and development teams."
good,Excellent company to start working for.You just need to be in a good team and you will want to be at work every day.Good Pay but the hours are not always that flexible.
good,"Cisco have really nice work environment and good company culture, and great products, but full off political fight in management team, it will hurt some normal employee."
good,"good company great benefits, home working is a great benefit  but yearly lay offs.and re orgs. are taking there toll. Hard to progress in the engineering side as this is very cost conscious."
good,"Remote management really made things difficult, but as a company they treated us employees with respect and trust. Working hours vary depending on project and location."
good,"Cisco is an excellent company in an important business, with a large variety of talented people, producing top-notch equipment and services. Telecommuting is widespread, and much appreciated."
good,"Employees at Cisco are very friendly. Work is relaxing and timing is flexible. Cisco supports remote working which is very cool. Cisco provides lot of perks at work. Cisco online study tools are great. Changes are constant in Cisco, there will be frequent re-organizations."
good,"Good Salary, Benefits and Culture. Too Many Layoffs. Change is constant and that is a part of most companies but at Cisco change occurs too frequently in my opinion. You align yourself with a variety of objectives and then those objectives change before you can fully accomplish targeted goals. They frequently have what they term ""Limited Restructuring's"", which are essentially Layoffs. They don't claim it as such as they indicate that they hire people in other fields that offset the number of people that get laid off. "
good,"Very professional organization, but someone can get lost within such an enormous organization. I thoroughly my short time with Cisco, wish it had lasted longer."
good,I have been with the company for about 10 years. I have been in various finance roles and learned alot. I hope to work at Cisco again in the near future.
good,"- Flexible working hours"
good,"No hard and fast rule and emotions for the organization. It is  suitable to work here but sometimes hectic too."

good,"Cisco is a really good company to work for. As a college student looking for an internship, this was the only place I really wanted to end up. I loved it then and i love what i do now even more."
good,"•	Solutions oriented IT professional with 4 years of experience in IT Industry; currently associated with Cisco Systems, Bangalore as Senior Software Development Engineer."
good,"A great company built on a foundation and shared global culture of collaboration, flexibility, encouragement."
good,"L'impiego in Cisco Systems è stato il mio primo vero e proprio lavoro impiegatizio; stimolante, sempre in crescita e di responsabilità."
good,Great job but can only advance so high before reaching the ceiling. Great environment but sometimes you get bad apples that do not work out and causes problems.
good,"The thing I loved most about working for Cisco was the people. My co-workers were great and would do whatever they could to help each other out."
good,"I have supported a VP earlier in the carrier, and am now sporting 3 directors. Changes due to Org Changes. I enjoy the environment and love that Cisco offer allot of internal training and benefits to their Full Time Employees."
good,A typical day at work is coming to office start working on service request . you learn with each new request there is always something to learn . As the technology is changing in such a fast est part  everyday you learn . Hardest part is trying to get back to all the customers as each one and everyone is important but there is not enough time.The most  enjoyable part of the work is the thanks you get from some of the customers.That makes the entire day worth while .
good,"	Configuring the Servers as per the customer requirement."
good,"Open and Friendly environment, easy management, Friendly team and management, mobile and flexible schedules. Wifi all over campus let you work from anywhere."
good,Cisco is all about DIY and learn many things which helps in enhansing the inner work skills to handle any kind of work related pressure independently.

good,"Cisco Management is terrific!"
good,"Cisco is a large company that has many different products, services, and organizations.  They have opportunities for those who work hard and deliver results.  I only left due to a great opportunity that came my way."
good,"I would run my badge though the door to enter the building, then the labs to start my day. Open up my laptop, then sign onto Cisco Jabber.  Checked my e-mails before I continued where I left off from the previous day.  I was the first employee at work, my co-workers would show up a few hours later, but they were all friendly and great to work with.  The hardest part of the job was just dealing with the various temperature changes in labs and in certain areas.  Some areas were extremely hot, while a few feet away, it would be extremely cold.  There was also the noise factor.  It was very loud in all the labs, where you needed to either where ear plugs or provide your self with ear-muffs.  Lastly, the one of the hardest parts of the job was trying to squeeze in between racks that weren't spaced out evenly, to look for assets.  I learned a lot of things, like how to remotely access terminal servers and smart PDU's remotely.  Management pretty much left you alone once they felt you knew what you were doing.  We had our meetings every 2 weeks just to check on our progress. The most enjoyable part of the job was actually just doing the work.  It was very fun just working and smiling and seeing everyone else smile."
good,"Fast paced, focused company.  "
good,"Cisco one of the most fortune company in the world, being in this company i had an exposure and also a tough challenge to automate most of the manual testcases, cisco provided me an opportunity not only to strategy and also to gave me to think beyond my skills"

good,Manager was very good.
good,Excellent Employer and I cannot thank Cisco enough for 14 wonderful years. I grew as a person and as a professional. Cisco gave me the opportunity to manage global operations that allowed me to experience appreciate different cultures
good,this company allows you to learn alot about the IT space. Networking with alot of people and have the capability of growing into more important roles within the company.
good,"Good work culture. You can work from home. Benefits are good. "
good,"My management was very supportive, easy to work for, yet demanding in a good way to achieve our goals and cut through red tape, which is common in a big company. Out of the 4 teams I worked for, the team I was recently with was by far the best one I've worked for at Cisco."
good,"Very collaborative, process oriented, results driven environment.  Work from home, travel as requested, good benefits, name recognition, excellent executive leadership."
good,"Good Work life balance in CISCO, and learning phase is very good. They have a competitive environment. In few teams they give good on-site opportunities."

good,It was a great joy and best career I had while in cisco. I had to handle different roles and also work for different business units. I would love to join cisco again.
good,Cisco is a great place to work with competitive benefits.  People are usually friendly and willing to help.   Large organization with lots of silos and can be hard to onboard and navigate.  Breadth of products to support if you are in the generalist sales teams.  The work culture and experience entirely depends on the team you are with.
good,Compensation is good. Opportunity to convert to full time is limited. Exposure to a large variety of technologies and roles. Good opportunities to move into other positions
good,"Productive and fun place to work. Work life balance. Can be stressful at times as there is often a lot required of you . A typical day involved going/working over projects with managers and staff. The culture was great as you could work anywhere there was available space, including quiet rooms. The hardest part of the job was the long strenuous hours of work that your're required to put in each day while meeting deadlines! The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to work from home a couple of days per week and also the free Starbucks coffee! There were also volleyball areas and relaxation areas at the RTP, NC location (**perks**)"
good,"I work in content development, creating online and instructor led courses for our customers. Our team has the support of our managers and the ability to collaborate with our peers and SMEs to make our courseware the best it can be. There is room to grow your career, as well as help drive the learning goals and roadmap for the team. Great environment, and “team space” check-ins help facilitate conversations with your manager."
good,There is a balance of work and fun time. If you get bored there are lots of activities around the campus where you could chat and relax. There lots of people willing to help as they get chance but you need to ask. I had lot of interaction since i was working as the Lab Manager and found very exciting but challenging at times. Work is your responsibility so you need to be very committed otherwise you are your own boss.
good,"Time flexibility is the best thing in this workplace. "

good,"A very good company to learn different technologies and keep yourself up to date with the recents in the market. Gives you lot of opportunities to learn with the job and perform based on your expertise. "
good,"Cisco is a huge compnay and to try and move into a different area of interest is virtually impossible with social relationships rather than skill based qualifications. If you work in a visrtually small business unit not in a major Cisco office locations you do not exist in the greater scope of things. "
good,"Cisco is a wonderful company to work for, but every employee is literally “on” 24/7. Everyone works hard, plays hard and HR provides many opportunities for self development, fun collaborative events. "
good,Great company and great people.  Cisco cares about their employees and empowers them to do great things.  Cisco sometimes allows employees the opportunity to work remotely.
good,Nice place to work and learn. Have a chance to work on some cutting edge products. Lots to learn and have an opportunity to work on different domains.
good,"A good place to start your career. Did a lot of system programming at work and testing on Cisco switches.  Learned a lot about system software implementation in C programming. Okayish Management. The hardest part of working at such a big organization is that sometimes things which are happening around you or your projects will be overwhelming because of scale and size, but use divide and conquer strategy and one would be fine"
good,My time here was pleasant. Learnt a lot on the job. My daily tasks revolved around mobile application tests and OTT. I did a lot of backend tests and AWS related content management
good,"Cisco is a very smart company that continues to grow its reach into the IT marketing in solving customers business challenges and producing positive customer outcomes.  I've always had the greatest admiration for top management at Cisco, and I feel proud to have worked there for almost 9-years over my two (2) tours."

good,A great place to evolve your career and secure excellent compensation. highly collaborative people with amazing industry experience and opportunity to learn from the best. Becoming more silo'd and bureaucratic as time moves on. Many folks resting and vesting and not moving which leads to stagnation unfortunately.
good,"It was nice working at cisco with some new technologies to learn and meeting new people with full of energy and skills."
good,Cisco is good. Learned a lot about soft skills and client facing skills. Dedication and commitment is what I learned from my Cisco Management. They need perfectionists.
good,"I've learned a lot at Cisco"
good,Good place to start a career. Very supportive mentors and good work life balance.  Global company with brand recognition. Company has made measurable improvements to already good benefits. Exciting industry to be in
good,"Flexible hours and able to accomplish and learn at the same time."
good,"Nice to work in Cisco. If you want a work and family balance, you should try work. Cisco gives respect and keeps trust in its employee by giving full access to its resources."
good,"I have been working at Cisco Systems full-time (Less than a year)"
good,"While its a great organization, its very challenging to succeed in an environment of rolling reduction in force or limited restructuring. However if you are effective, make good contacts you will find success. The engineering, technical focus and management is second to none. If you can get in, its a great company."
good,"Cisco is a great place to work. It gives an opportunity to grow as an individual and as a group. Cisco also help their employees to learn new technologies, be proactive and help in shaping their future."
good,Overall a great company to work for.  The false starts for new business markets can be troublesome because the returns demanded by stockholders can prematurely impact success.
good,80% of Cisco's employees are contracted. Most recruiters pay pretty well although they dont offer much in the way of benefits. Apex Systems offers the worst salary of all.
good,"Cisco is a fun place to work.  Their schedules are very flexible.  That give us the opportunity to be more productive.  Managers try to develop team members, so we can advance to the next level."
good,Often times Cisco is quick to release products prior to them being enterprise ready and the support structure is not scaled to handle the workload. This causes issues internally and is confusing on who is accountable to address the customer issues.
good,"Good company to work for.  I learned a lot and got to work with a lot of amazing people.  I learned multiple new technologies such as routing and switching, femtocell, Evolved Packet Core, and element management systems."
good,"Awesome place to work. "
good,"By my opinion, what I am thinking...overall is a good company, pays fairly good, not always super busy, have life work balance,"

good,"Every day was typical for me."
good,Challenging environment supporting the best customers. Work place is clean and energetic. Work location is ideal in that housing is affordable and near by.
good,Cisco was an excellent place to work in. More recently the senior management has lost its focus on their staff and how to re-train their experienced achievers. Really enjoyed myself when there and working for a top brand.
good,Productive place with great work life balance and corp culture. Room to grow. Going through a current transition which is changing the environment a little but move to subscription is challenging right now but correct for the future.
good,"- Learned and applied knowledge of CUCM, CUC, and routing/switching.  "
good,This was my first opportunity at Cisco and loved the work. People were phenomenal and hard work was rewarded.  I have provided other comments on Cisco so will stop here.
good,Thecompany was fair but firm of course.The lead team respected us the same as if we were staff.The company had myself and my children there in different areasI actually had to leave breifly and was able to return.They were professional and polite.
good,"Great company to work for. However, work life balanace is a bit off have to work more hours to keep up with work load missing out on family time. "
good,"The corporate network team is a great team in my opinion.  The management expects results but are also willing to provide support and guidance/mentoring as needed.  As long as employees deliver there was no micro management going on.  In addition the work life balance is great.  People were very supportive of families and life events.  "
good,Strong technical organization.  Management is driven but reasonable.  Cisco values giving back to your community in anyway.
good,"Flexibility, Working from home options, Fun to work and professionalism,Wide exposure to multiple technologies, Job satisfactions, Balanced work and private life"
good,"I learned a ton in this role and enjoyed my time here. This was my first role at Cisco and I learned so much about the company, its customers, data analysis, etc."
good,"Great work life balance"
good,"I was part of an outsourcing company that worked for Cisco. The work was intense but the team make it feel manageable. We were a good team and we typically would help each other with the work load."
good,"the work culture is extremely supportive and promotes a healthy competitive environment. However climbing up the ladder (vertical movement ) is bit of a challenge .One needs to find opportunities yourself and try by himself, no support as such is provided by the senior management"
good,"LTE technology "
good,"The company was great on training and supporting each team member, and have made it easy  to advance in the company."
good,"Productive and Fun place to work. Well did not get chance to work with Cisco in US."
good,"Excellent company to work for, they are head of their time. they allow team members to work from their home and encourage it. I enjoyed working on planning department events and working my the management team."
good,Excellent work life balance. Cisco has some very nice people and some are not. Excellent tools to access things online from anywhere.
good,"Co-workers and Management are all very supportive,  friendly and easy to work with. Collaborating with very knowledgeable engineers on a daily basis was very enriching to my career."
good,wonderful experience that i got while i was working in bangalore. Got exposure into different concepts in networking. Live play work excel!!
good,Excellent flexibility. Highly compensated in the industry
good,"Cisco Systems, Inc. is the worldwide leader in networking for the Internet. Cisco hardware, software, and service offerings are used to create Internet solutions so that individuals, companies, and countries have seamless access to information - regardless of differences in time and place."
good,"Learning and implementing new concepts, it is a good company."
good,"Awesome organization and enjoy working with Cisco. I was challenged in every work assignment and the work was intense, at times, but it was rewarding."
good,"I've spent 6 years at Cisco with evolving roles from Financial Analyst to Sales Professional. I've received extensive, ongoing training and grown to be a self-starter with significant responsibility. As part of the my most recent, and perhaps most relevant role, I've managed multi-million dollar territories, never failed to attain quota, established and grew business relationships with key senior executives, organized and hosted massive marketing events in partnership with key channel partners, recevied multiple awards for team contributions including top Account Manager a multitude of times, and identified Sales as the profession I'd like to continue my career path towards."
good,"Cisco is a great company to work for. A typical day starts off with prioritizing my to do list. It is great to get in the office early and get a head start on email .The boss arrives or calls I will then re-prioritize my list based on the sense of urgency. In between all of this I answer the phone and deal with the immediate needs of customers and co-workers.  As the face of the business, it is important that I handle interruptions to my schedule with graciousness and unruffled efficiency."
good,"Managed day to day administration and communication for Section 125 Cafeteria Welfare plans such as medical/dental coverage, FSA, LTD and STD insurance, group life insurance, supplemental life, 401(k) Plan, pension, Loa’s  and all requirements of federal/state programs such as ERISA and COBRA."
good,Cisco allows the employees to be entitled to make important business decisions on their own.  Cisco has a very results driven culture.
good,"I learned a great deal from my managers to my coworkers. "
good,"Constant communications with customers, the sales and field service teams. You will learn all about hardware and software services that this company provides.

I also work with people from all over the world which has taught me about how Cisco operates with its partners and customers worldwide. This position has given me crucial skills that I can and will apply to future opportunites."
good,"Surrounded by top talent in an environment where we were encouraged to learn, continue education and innovate. It was a great place to work. I learned so much, but the work/life balance did not exist."
good,Buena actitud de los compañeros y retroalimentación de proyectos
good,Hands down the best job I've ever had. Wish i still worked here but unfortunately i took a calculated risk that did not turn out in my favor. Overall i would love to work here again and encourage people to try and get in.
good,Loved my time there. Wonderful culture of giving back to the communities that they serve. Large portion of revenue spent on R&D or acquisition to build platforms and not point products.
good,"I have been with Cisco for quite a small period and I love to be there again as this is the company where you have all of the tools available all the time to support you for any problem you are facing. Either it is a customer issue or your own technical issue. Indeed, management always there for your personal issues."
good,Cisco has expanded to the point and added on acquisitions to the point that it is losing its edge and culture of best place for customer advocacy.  The recent achievement of a 'best place to work' award seems divorced from reality not that it is a bad place just not the best place to work.  Corporate direction and initiatives are consistently being reworked which creates a lot of thrashing without a true north goal.  Remote work and work outside of SJ is harder to get noticed or advancement.
good,Great place to work. Need to push yourself and own your career.  Not too difficult to move around to develop different skills and take on different jobs. Great work/life balance.
good,"Good company to work for, just that there is no annual raise, unless you change your grade level. There are bonuses which are pretty generous. Mgmt is pretty good, culture is open and honest. There are quite a lot of periodic layoffs though."
good,"Cisco is a great company to work for, though advancement opportunities and compensation increases are relatively rare at higher job grades.  There are also frequent layoffs."
good,"If you're a contractor then you're a second class citizen."
good,Learned a lot from highly skilled technicians and was a perfect entry-level job. I learned basic IT skills a long with an extensive breakdown of various hardware throughout a datacenter.
good,"It is a great place to work, especially those new to the industry, as it exposes one to variety of technologies from wireless to enterprise to data center networking."
good,"Great environment, nice people to work with, professional, smart people, friendly people, nice campus, busy, productive, could learn a lot skills, hard working."
good,Cisco has a fast paced environment.  There were always opportunities for growth and I was constantly learning new things.  I was always surrounded by sharp and fun people.
good,"Looking for a new job willing to relocate ."
good,"While it can be fast pace, there is relatively mild pressure on a day to day basis. Expectation is that you can pick things up quickly, and collaborate to make everyone succeed. Overall, a fantastic place to work."
good,"•	Serve as an Agile-Lean Expert providing coaching, mentoring, advising, and education to multiple Scrum and leadership teams across the organization."
good,"Learned a lot at Cisco, gave me all the tools needed to advance my career in other areas.  Strong benefits, ease of working, flexibility to work from home with all the tools needed."
good,I learned a great deal and grew both as a business professional and as a manager.  The company is is full of smart driven people.  Great company to work for.
good,Cisco TAC provides resources in terms of learning that none other company does. and also a very flexible way of working. the only drawback i face is quite less salaries provided to red-batch third party hired Cisco TAC engineers.
good,Fun and exciting place to work. Unfortunately contractors are paid very poorly for the work. Great place to learn and develop new skills and a great launchpad into a network engineering career.
good,"Good boss to work for, help you learn if needed. Buys lunch most of the time, multiple breaks during the day. Hard work outside but riding in a vehicle helps prolong that"
good,"1.- Exigente en lo técnico."
good,"flexible time for entry and exit"
good,"I like the work culture at Cisco. "
good,"Workplace culture was great. Working for Cisco, it laid a great foundation of who I would become in this industry, opening doors that previously may not have been open. Overall, great experience."
good,"I worked there for just over 2 years as a contractor and I loved it. The pay was great and the team treated me like I was one of their own even though I was a contractor. The atmosphere is fast-paced and can be crazy, but the overall company culture is relaxed and completely about the employees. They value everyone - from bottom to top, contractor or employee."
good,"As a contractor at Cisco for 4+ years, I was gifted with an amazing manager, a team focused on helping one another, understanding of our flexible schedules and overall availability, and the opportunity to thrive in a company that hires from within first. It should be noted, that it is difficult to get in as a full-time employee even when you have served 4+ years as a contractor. Many contract roles will remain contract for up to 10 years. Despite the lack of health benefits as a contractor, I enjoyed the freedom overall, which literally saved my life. This has been the single most positive work experience in my life."
good,"Cisco is a great place to work. Typically the work atmosphere is congenial and pleasant. Some of the ""collaborative"" work space layouts can be loud and distracting, but there are quiet spaces available, and many people have the option of working from home."
good,great working in Cisco. I have never seen even any contractor complaining about the culture of the Cisco company. there are good managers and technical people around from whom there is so much to learn from.
good,Good technical career path but only market related layoffs are the negative. Company with great profit margin for its products and try to be associated with its core business - networking.
good,"Excellent opportunity to learn as much as you want in the equipment leasing environment. Great interface with sales, legal and tax departments along with partners and customers."
good,Everything depends on your Manager. If the manager is good your life is good if not then you know the story. I would say if you work and you have a good luck with you. Nobody can stop you from reaching the top.
good,"The culture is hive-like but often teams become disconnected.  I believe this is almost out of necessity.  It is a big machine with lots of moving parts."
good,"Great place to Work but has too many restructuring and Layoffs. "
good,"As a field employee I was not privileged to the culture within the office on a regular basis however the connection you establish with your peers was amazing. I really enjoyed the use of pervasive video both during the interview process but on a regular basis for everyday calls, it makes a big difference in the engagements and knowing your team. I really enjoyed the experience as a vertical architect where we were helping bring opportunity to business leaders outside of IT. It opened up my experiences and allowed much greater autonomy in my thinking process then I had in the past."
good,"Great co-workers and even better management!"
good,Great company making good noise in the market. great engineers to work with. Good life balance and the environment. Managers are friendly and give lot of opportunity.
good,"Excellent company to work with, oppurtunity to improve technical skills, domain expertise and friendly work culture. more fun to work with in challenging environment."
good,"Cisco is an amazing company. For as big as they are they really work to give personal attention to their employees. Great benefits and a flexible work environments add to the value for working here."

good,Great place to work! Great people to work with. I would love to work here full time.  I had a good experience and learned a lot along the way. I would recommend Cisco to anyone as a great company to work for.

good,Very good. I would recommend anyone who is starting their career in IT industry to start with Cisco. You will learn the product and customer support relationship in depth.
good,"I worked in a corporate role; Company is built on its technology, which enables an amazing global workforce.  The flip side is it is a 24x7 job - work follows the sun, but also depends on leaders to show up to maintain global presence and alignment."
good,I enjoyed working at Cisco as they are very welcoming and always keep you busy it's a very close company and everyone treats one another with respect. And it is well organised.
good,"I was a contract programmer for Cisco. I found Cisco to be a wonderful company to work for. Its tools and team spirit have spoiled me. My contract went well, and I can give references from all the people I worked with. Funding for our project was cut, so I and another contractor were let go."
good,"Learn a lot of latest Cisco software & Cisco hardware when I was at Cisco.  Each QA Engineering is required to build their own test lab. "

My first opportunity for full time employment came with the newly formed at the time service division where I was assigned to Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Was-Mart as a customer was very anti Cisco culture and wanted us to live in and adopt their oppressive culture. During my tenure there Wal-Mart became the Fortune Once company and man did the management base get an ego boost from that. They had an internal mantra of; ""Ask for Mars, you just might get the moon.""

There was a threshold for employees that hadn't been there for four years or more and I was not there long enough to put on the 'keeper' list. They built in cutting edge automation and had a great maintenance program. The equipment and mechanical rooms were kept clean and checked regularly. That's the way to do it. So many companies just let the machines run until they break down and that is just not the way to do it. Belts were tight, filters were changed, maintenance was done. Great place!"
