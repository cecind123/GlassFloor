rating,review
bad,It is a difficult company to work for I would not apply for this company they are not flexible and do not care about their employees. They do offer tuition reimbursement
bad,This was a horrible place to work.  If you are a female you can advance and work from home.  Deadlines and workload were overbearing and micromanagement was huge.
bad,"I was a temporary employees, with no benefits, was not included in any company functions, taking days off was not allowed, and they may terminate your employment for doing so"
bad,"It's a sinking ship.  lots of back stabbing, no one sees the handwriting on the wall, but they want to spend time, money, and resources to rearrange the deck furniture."
bad,"hire you as a contractor, do a massive lay off every year, contractors always go first. Laid off folks who had been there for over 15 years - position has been eliminated."
bad,I did not enjoy working for this company because you were not paid for your service. The raises were not based on performance rather if the boss liked you or not.
bad,Genworth Canada is a great place to work. The benefits are great. Lack of opportunities to advance however great environment.
bad,Little to no growth available. Horrible management. Micromanagement. Do not apply for this company.
bad,"Lack of focus, and vision - Projects delayed countless times. FTE seem to know very little about what they are doing."
bad,The only decent thing about this job is the benefits. Management only wants to believe in what they want and listen to know one.  Favoritism is rampid. Racism is bad. They promote people based on who you know and not what you know. Management only cares about making miney and nothing else.
bad,"This job is very stressful there is no place to move up unless ""you know someone"".. The management is poor and micromanaging is horrible! The metrics are ridiculous and inconsistent."
bad,"I should have known the environment was not for me when I found out that there was a gym facility in the building but only Genworth employees were allowed to use (they contract out TP's). To me it gave me the feeling that TP's are looked down upon. Top management confirmed this for me by not speaking or looking at you as they pass right by you and tell you NOT to speak (even if spoken to) to visitors on tour of the facility. Training was individualized and incomplete at best with NO TRAINING MANUAL (no way to back-up/confirm which method(s) is(are) correct to process work when questions arise, with several arguments resulting--yes co-workers openly argued. Watched several associates advance or move to other areas even though their mistakes were absolutely atrocious and unacceptable (watch the movie ""TED"" and the scene where he keeps getting promoted...). Favoritism was VERY prevelant and unprofessional and bad behaviors were not handled appropriately."
bad,This company is all about numbers graphs and not about people .
bad,Company struggling financially and uncertain future for the various departments as far as if there will be jobs available. NO advancement opportunities-shut down completely by corporate and the lower level management only cares about metrics and favoritism abounds extensively. Would not recommend this company to anyone at this time.
bad,They would hire more than they need and then being biased they start firing people from first week. Very hectic environment a big NOO  if they are trying to hire you for temporary employment. They will treat you like a slave.
bad,Genworth valued employees and committed to Community. The do a lot of community service projects. Compensation package and benefits was very good. Good group of people to work with.
bad,"As a contractor being hired you are told there is mega OT, however they don't tell you when business is slow you may only have 6 hours a week or no hours a week . Unstable time schedule as you log in and an hour later you are told to log off . Poor Management . Competition doesn't work the same way. favoritism shown too"
bad,Just did a massive round of layoffs yet hiring that's the genworth way.... No job growth it's who you are and who you know...
bad,"I worked for Genworth for just over a year as a Team Leader as did 2 others. In the final 8 months of my time there, all 3 Team Leaders working under our manager left. There is no work life balance regardless of the ""policy"". I stayed for my staff, who I miss. "
bad,"Very stressful and high turnover employer. Although there are some good employees there, the head of operations = SVP is an immature control freak."
bad,Narrow minded organization with poor leadership. Management team is reactive not proactive which has cost them financially. Leadership team does not recognize the strength of it's staff as a result 100s of valuable employees have walked away.
bad,"I signed on as a temp and the first 2 weeks were great. But once my class learned the job, the manager started treating us like garbage. The manager kept yelling at us to process the payments faster. Also the manger would email everyone, how much work you processed and error's you made."
bad,"Stressful beyond belief. Expected to do 5 things at once, all perfectly.  Management has no clue what their teams do, only if the numbers for their bosses are ok and will chew out the whole team to get there.  Personal insults are common. Coworkers cliuque-ish and rude for the most part, others scared to open their mouths, fearing retribution."
bad,Worked 27 1/2 yrs wwith Genworth.  Every performance review was excellent and I used only 3 sick days during my tenure there. Laid off at age 53 1/2. Genworth gave NO retirement benefits because I wasn't 55 yrs of age at time of lay off. I gave 100% each day.
bad,"If you are in the clique, then you will get promoted no matter how poorly of a worker or employee you are.  If you are a hard worker, they seemed threatened by that and pass you over for promotions while others (for example family members of management) get promoted for being who they are."
bad,When I was hired I was asked if I would be willing to take the series 6 exam. At no time was I ever informed that if I did not pass the exam (which 75% of the people that take it do not pass) that my employment would be terminated.  The day after taking the test and not passing I was let go.
bad,When this company continued being sued and started going down with lay offs this no longer a secure place to work. The company has now been sold to a China based company
bad,"Job was fun and rewarding at first. Was mislead by manager about job security. Employees that were ""favorites"" were rewarded with job advancement over employees that worked hard. Personally have seen employees take 30 min breaks instead of 15 mins repeatedly without any warnings advance over others that get warnings. But others are micromanaged"
bad,Terrible work place. Terrible management. Values and culture are out of line. Older coworkers obnoxious and not helpful. Great salary and benefits. bad life/work balance.
bad,"Genworth keeps many mid level and lower IT positions as contractors and there are no benefits outside of horrible medical that you would expect with a short term contract company. There is no plan or steps to becoming an employee. Many contractors have been there for years with no increase of things like vacation and other earned benefits. Employees have great benefits and there are many things done for employees for team building, but contractors are prohibited from entering. Management tends to place work on a few individuals and holds different people to different work standards. Management will allow some people to bend or break rules while others are held to the rules. While I was there as a contractor, the only way to learn more was to ask and keep myself up to date. There is no training or upward mobility for contractors."
bad,"adults form cliques and are bullies and love to gossip;"
bad,They had no money to hire any help and call volumes would be avg around 60 waiting all day. With many empty desk they couldn’t help us and didn’t care
bad,The team leaders and management were stuck up and thought they were better than everyone else and in order to work there you mainly had to keep kissing their tail!
bad,"I only stayed there for 16months and I was only lucky to find another job so quickly and leave. A lot of legacy issues, management that did not feel comfortable wearing a public suit and a damaged, inherited balance sheet."
bad,"I took on this job as an office assistant, and most of my days were spent randomly surfing the internet.  I always felt awkward and out of place working here, and I was definitely under qualified for what they had originally expected of me."
bad,I enjoyed working for this company in fact the only reason I left to begin with was because the company moved to another location..had it not been for that I would of stayed
bad,"Nepotism is the best job security. No connections? No security! Additionally, know that Genworth Mortgage Insurance is an extremely traditional organization.  That said, leave any new ideas in the lobby. the organization is simply not interested in best practices or simple change, for that matter. Seventy-five percent or more of the workforce is within 10 years of retirement. These team members are uninterested in change. Criticism, rejection, and isolation will color your experience if you offer different thinking."
bad,"Originally this was another insurance company.  Management was good, motivational, and supportive of the agents.  The buyout took place approximately one year after being with them.  At the time of the buy out there was going to be management changes and commission structure changes.  All manager's and agent left the company except for 2 agents.  At that time there was no management or structure.  As for the rating at the end of this I can not say because at the time I would say no because there was no management but that may have changed since.  So my answer will be yes."
bad,The isolation of telephone customer service was not for me. It was a total mismatch of talent.
bad,"You’re hired and promoted on the basis of which “quota box you fall into age sex or race"
bad,"I worked with this company for almost two years and during that time, I was micro-managed, and worked to death. As a permanent employee, I did not get paid overtime, and did not get recognition either. This place reminded me so much of the movie The Firm. My Boss refused to allow their team members to work from home--although many other teams telecommute exclusively. Their employee surveys are a joke too--they really do nothing about their bad managers. There seems to be a 'tenure' policy in place where if you have been around for 20+ years, then you can treat your co-workers/direct reports as bad as you want, and nothing happens, but it makes the morale miserable. If you complain about your lousy boss, then your ousted during the next layoffs. The only thing this company really has going for it is their community outreach--they do a decent job supporting their community. Too bad the company doesn't make management support their empoyees just as well."
bad,"Genworth lived their corporate values till Fall of 2008 when it was financially inconvenient to believe in Diversity, Heart, etc. Two cities in VA fighting for control ie Richmond and Lynchburg."
bad,Boys club!  Women leaders not valued. Normal work week.  Senior leadership does not value subordinates. Annual review process is a joke. If you don’t agree with your managers comments in the review and you make a comment...there will be retaliation by HR and manager. You will be let go within 6 months.
bad,Genworth can be a great company to work for yet it is not they typical old work environment that some are accustomed to.  The hiring process can be rigorous and the job stability isn't promising due to the company going through transitions.
bad,"Genworth has  had and is still facing major layoffs.  This is not the place for job stability.  Genworth was at one time an industry leader"
bad,"Pros:  It's a job - you get pay and average benefits."
bad,I work in the call screening department and it is terrible. The man who runs it is a horrible manager and his philosophy is churn and burn. Only take a job here if you are desperate.
bad,I was employed  with this company for a long time.  This  specific job I last held was the worst position I have ever held within the company.   There are lots of room for improvement.
bad,"This company has flexible work hours."
bad,I liked working at Genworth and it was full of great people that cared about helping others.  They promote volunteering in the community.  Management is not always stable.
bad,Large pay discrepancy between middle management and front line managers especially those who were originally part of the GE Capital. Advancement opportunities are rare. Moral is low because of the financial stress and uncertainty about the future of the company.
bad,"very little structure in providing professional advancement. Layoffs to support meeting annual budget, which means mismanagement of personnel/projects/support."
bad,"Stamford office is full of nice, smart people. The senior management, while intelligent, are very hard to deal with on a daily basis. It is not uncommon for the most senior person to ridicule managers in front of their staff. Advancement is almost unheard of. Company has a big focus on volunteering, which is awesome. While work life balance is given lip service, watch your back. Senior management is very cliquey and acquiesce to the most senior executive on site, even when they disagree vehemently. HR is not employee friendly. Many people leave because of the atmosphere."
bad,"Change is good, but not when it doesn't quite fit with the strategy."
bad,"You are given excellent benefits, but the pay is iffy. The goals and baseline for measuring employee success regularly changes, and seems very randomly chosen. Management never manages to explain the reason for the change."
bad,"The culture at Genworth is difficult to describe, because on the surface it looks like a great place to work with solid benefits and compensation. The problem is with upper management--they are very out of touch with what their employees want from them, leading to a number of situations where they tried to increase morale and employee satisfaction in the middle of a difficult time (lots of layoffs and uncertainty, no bonuses, company not doing well) with things like giveaways and childish parties and team-building games, as well as patronizing general ""training"" offered in lieu of more valuable role-specific training that would actually have benefited employees' careers and made them better at what they do/more flexible in thei roles. The upper management culture is extremely biased towards hardcore, type A, heavily driven people, which is fine, but when the extremely limited number of opportunities for advancement are almost always granted (often without the job posting process mandated by company policy) to people who are like them, it raises questions of nepotism or at least blindness to the daily reality of life for many employees at Genworth who are not the forceful, driven type, but who work hard every day and do their jobs to the best of their abilities, yet leave those jobs where they belong--at the workplace. I guess what I'm saying is, at Genworth, you don't have to bring your job home with you--that is, unless you want to be given the rare opportunities for advancement at the company. This goes quadruple for technical roles."
bad,When I started here management was great and then they opened an office in Virginia and started getting rid of people and replacing them with temps so they did not have to pay permanent employees benefits. There is no HR on site in Mass and they have unethical practices when it comes to employees.
bad,only interaction was with team. if I were in a different area of genworth and/or customer facing i would've enjoyed it more. wasn't able to maximize potential.
bad,I found management to be a little tight nit and uncompromising to those not within their circle.
bad,Insurance is not a big growth market right now.  The mortgage business has been tough with all the foreclosures.  Job stability is not good.
bad,This is a great position for an individual whom has an already established natural market.  Leads are a thing of the past.  Strictly commission is also tough on someone with little savings and in this economy.
bad,"Permanent employees are golden and treated very well. Temps are not permitted to share in any of their many celebrations, parties, catered lunches, etc. Temps are sent home without pay when they have many of these occasions. If you are a permanent employee, it's a good place to work, but they have MANY temp contractors there, many of those have been there for years. They avoid giving them decent pay and benefits."
bad,"Decent pay package depending on how well you negotiate it. Good benefits. "
bad,"Good experience but no work life balance.  Worked with good team and good exposure to other teams within the Company.  Frequent layoff placing too much stress on teams and thus more difficult to meet deadlines, only can with use of extra long hours and with some folks looking to cut corners."
bad,A company that is in trouble.  Financial instability and management instability make this a very difficult place to work.
bad,"I worked with some great people and learned a lot about the long term care insurance business. "
bad,"Accountable for obtaining, identifying, investigating, and evaluating critical information required to accurately and objectively adjudicate Long Term Care Insurance claims. Effectively manage and prioritize work with aggressive deadlines; Working within a structured environment with standard operating procedures to ensure consistency of claims practices and resolution."
bad,"Genworth is a depressing place to work. Management is not trained and do a poor job of running the company."
bad,"I didn't like working there. Employees are rude, you have to work off production and if you don't do things a certain way they will fire you fast. Feels like working at a jail.."
bad,"I worked at Genworth when their Life & Annuity Division was experiencing  both financial challenges and direction.   As a result, most of my selling agreement were lost and sales drastically declined.  I was laid off 9 months later."
bad,This sis not a good environment for closers and loan officers. You are better off going somewhere else. They hire new people and hold up your files.
bad,It is an ok jobit is not what you would think it is.... things are very out of order and the leadership is shot... nothing is processed as it should and they are laying off left and right which makes me very nervous.
bad,"This company recruits people continuously for a week or two at a time, and then releases them. I was signed for a one year contract, released after three weeks, along with my entire class."
good,"The upper management has no idea how to relate to people other than to smile when they think it is appropriate or when something will work to their favor. The employee high school mentality and politics are not worth the stress and while the money is nice, dealing with daily stress from a thankless job is not worth it. Unless you like having someone smile in your face but talk about you behind your back?"
good,"Company as a whole was great. Most co-workers were wonderful and helpful. Compensation was good as well as the benefits.  Most of the managers at the call centers are horrible. They don't even know how to do their job leave alone the Customer Service jobs. If you can get into a corporate position you would be better off, stay away from the call centers."
good,"I love the job I was doing. I loved my co-workers. I made excellent money and enjoyed my 19 years, the opportunities provided and skills that I learned. Management is VERY inconsistent."
good,"Challenging work environment with many talented people."
good,"A typical day at Genworth is exciting because you meet new people and an interesting position.  I learned Long Term Care New Business.  There are many of things that I was trained in doing however there was even more that was not in training and you had to learn on your own.  The co-workers were rude, not friendly or willing to help when you had a question.  I felt eventually like because we were temporary employees like a ""Leper"", that was the hardest part of my job.  The most enjoyable part of this job was meeting new people(THE TEMPS) and learning about LTC NB insurance."
good,Was a temp for a couple months. Was a decent job to have while in school or between jobs. 
good,When I first started working for Genworth I absolutely loved it. But once the insurance rating dropped. So did the pay and employee morale. It was horrible.
good,There is lack of communication between departments and managers to CSRs. Also there is lack of training to beginning CSRs of system and product knowledge.
good,"Was onsite contractor assigned to various investors, learned varieties of underwriting guidelines, excellent training, mortgage investigation work performed"
good,"I enjoyed making a difference in peoples lives every day for the good when our customers truly needed the help. "
good,Enjoyable place to work for the most part.  Middle management works in concert with employees to complete daily assignments.  The current financial status of the company creates a great concern with recent layoffs.  Without that it would be an ideal place to work.
good,"Used to be a great place to work. Good benefits; pay should be better for the low-level people that actually to get the job done, instead of management."
good,There is no room for advancement or job security. The company is not willing to make necessary changes to improve the business.
good,"I expect my experience at Genworth at the lower level would have been more enjoyable had the company not lost so much money in the mortgage insurance industry: the company is so big, and parts of it have lost SO much money, that it is silly not to realize the implications on the lowest of tiers within the company. To top it all off the company partnered with AARP--a move that we were proud of. Of course, now the preferred discount is gone and the couples discount reduced: it isn't that I don't think that was necessary, it's that the company doesn't belong in the mortgage insurance business if it wants to be a major player in long-term care. Mortgage insurance is tied more closely to artificially low interest rates, and thus more apt to sink a company. That is, unless the company affiliates with a giant such as AARP. In that case, I suppose the government will rub your back. Perhaps this is why Genworth is in the mortgage insurance business. With the health care reforms certainly customer service and underwriting will be important to the company. Great benefits, but low room for growth within the company unless one puts in time (a stated mandatory minimum two years in each position--this will be ignored at the company's choosing, but not necessarily based on excellent performance as one would like to think) which resembles enlisting in the military."
good,"I was blessed with a job when I needed one but I must say that it was the most nerve-racking job I had ever had.  I never had anxiety until I worked at Genworth. After I left, of course, it stopped but I would not put this job on the high list for working conditions."
good,"Overall, it was a good place to work.  The biggest concern was job security in the last several years. There was a lot of competition to continually exceed your co-workers in production rather than be the best you can be at your job personally"
good,"Pros"
good,"poor management ,no opportunity for advancement , they try to micro manage, fluctuating shifts each day which makes it hard to have a work life balance."
good,Assist customer with their Long term care policies and solve any issues they are having. Our team is becoming smaller due to lay offs.
good,Working as a temp you were not provided direct answers.  I was lead on to believe I interviewed for a position with Genworth.  However they advised it would still be temp.  A couple days later our group was let go.
good,"If you don't fit in with the click, you're gone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
good,Its a good job could use a few changes I like what I do but I would like to move into a more challenging role
good,"Biggest issue is they allow poor leadership to drain the life of the employees which contributes to poor morale, frustration and nothing getting accomplished."
good,"Company Closed the California office so a review of this office is not applicable. "
good,"The Long Term Care Insurance field is interest work, but Genworth is suffering and my future is unclear.  Each day at work is different and demanding, which I enjoy.  The most enjoyable part of this job is the satisfaction of helping the elderly.  The most difficult part of my day is the managing the caseload. Management is doing the best they can in this difficult environment and I am hopeful we will recover."
good,"In my experience, Genworth did a good job providing a work-life balance and living out its values. However, the insurance industry can be rocky, and many people were hired and let go during my time with the company."
good,"I worked there for 7.5 years. I never advanced to another position. It’s very hard to advance because they are constantly adding more"
good,"The current deal with China Oceanwide has been in process for almost 3 years.  The company has been financially unstable for ~5 years.  A lot of turnover and layoffs.  The transparency between executive leadership and the ""workers"" is not very good.  Not the best at communications or development."
good,"The purpose of the organization is outstanding. Unfortunately, poor management decisions combined with a difficult rate environment have caused a great company to struggle to survive.   These challenges cause it to be a difficult place to work and feel any sense of security."
good,"Enjoyed learning from each team member during turnover reports, also during round robin meetings.  Some of maintenance could have been scheduled better so as to not cause outages,"
good,"Audited mortgage loans that required Mortgage Insurance, and when the loans were in compliance with Genworth Underwriting Guidelines, issued Mortgage Insurance Certificate. If the loans were not in compliance, would contact loan Underwriter to rectify situation in order to issue Mortgage Insurance Certificate."
good,"it is a good place to work."
good,Great company that has a friendly environment with an open door policy. Opportunities to work from home which is good for work life balance.
good,"I worked with Genworth Financial through IT recruiter Randstad.  My review of Randstad is great, there were definitely considerate and very helpful."
good,A fast based customer centric buisness. Strong Leadership team with focus and commitment to their customers.
good,"Management is hit or miss.   Some groups are much stronger than others.   Depending on the group you work for, the work/life balance may differ severely.  "
good,management could better manage resources so that your specific job you were hired for you are able to do without constantly being pulled to fill in on phones b/c of understaffing.
good,Genworth Financial is a good place to work but has its disadvantages. The hardest part of the job is dealing with stress and not actually being treated like you are a grown up that makes mistakes like normal people do. The most enjoyable part of the job is the paycheck.
good,"General Electric past is both a blessing and a curse. GE's culture is a can do style that promotes diversity and systematic problem solving. However, there is aversion to taking responsibility and towards maintaining accountibility."
good,Good company to work for if you are a recent college graduater or willing to enter an internship program.
good,"I was not at this company long enough to make a fair assessment. However, I will say that most of the ladies I worked with had been there or more than 25 years. Each had a tale of benefits that had been taken away over the years. Welcome to America! Where the pension plan is dead!!"
good,Fairly average mid-sized company.  Compensation could have been better.  Politics sometimes got in the way of doing good work quickly.  Limited career advancement prospects depending on your location.
good,This was an in home private duty case. I was paid by the resident and she was reimbursed by Genworth. I know nothing about the corporate setting or life work balance at Genworth
good,"Depending upon the department you work in. The Inforce side, I would not recommend. You are tied to a  phone and score cards are extremely stressful. "
good,"very nice company"
good,"They wanted to provide the benefits the clients paid for but did not see the future for what health care could do to preserve our lives. I learned you have to read the entire contract, fine print, dot all i's and cross all t's. The hardest part of the job was being ""chained"" to my phone and remembering to punch in and out when you went to the bathroom. I enjoyed my manager and team mates."
good,"Good environment"
good,"I loved working there but if the manager wants you out then they will find a way even if its using system issues that you have tickets in for, against you."
good,very difficult to work at. Cold calling and leads given were either wrong numbers and some cases deceased. Person who trained was not outgoing or willing to help
good,"Worked for 2.5 years at Genworth. I advanced from a data analyst to the sales desk. Genworth then in the beginning of 2009, cut the sales team."
good,I was just a contract underwriter working for Genworth.  But I enjoyed working for Genworth as a contractor - you felt like you were one of their employees.
good,"As a temporary contractor I do not really witness too much of the life of the company outside of what I see, but it seems lively enough, especially since they do host parties or gatherings in general from time to time for their lenders."
good,"fair place to work, good people , good environment.llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll"
good,"Cant comment. Good management and overall company. Lots of technologies to learn and work in from java, to oracle to sharepoint."
good,"Management style is old school - top down. Heavy workloads, continual battle to balance quantity against quality due to the demands of the job."
good,"On the job training"
good,"The people I work with are wonderful and while the work is intense, working on a team that is focused on making the best experience for our clients and customers is very rewarding. The great thing about the job is that you learn a new skill everyday. "
good,I am a customer service representative. The monetary compensation is not bad for this area. I am grateful that I am currently employed.
good,"A typical day of work, checking emails boxes that I'm was in charge of. "
good,"Excellent pay for expectations, patience is key!  The work load is definitely manageable, however when working with so many people, be ready for delays from management and when putting in requests. KINDNESS IS KEY to handling policy holder requests and issues. It can definitely be challenging."
good,Very busy days. Benefits are what drive employment. The work environment is flexible. The associates are very giving and provide help when needed.
good,"A typical day at work in this position usually consisted of assisting new and existing customers make changes to or understand their accounts. My co-workers were all extremely friendly and professional at all times. The hardest part of the job was the tedious repetition. The most enjoyable part of the job was knowing that you were helping people receive retirement benefits that they often times didn't even know existed. As a contractor, I didn't receive any of the corporate news or e-mails so I may not have an accurate grasp on the pulse of the company as a whole, but from my time there it has seemed like a friendly and professional place that seems to have many long-term employees."
good,Management is based on length on job and require no managerial skills.
good,I was contract underwriter for them and was placed at WAMU where I eventually was offered full time employment.  They were very good for training and questions as they arose.
good,"A typical day was focused on Service Level Agreement with Clients.  I learned that in a Wealth Management business, time and meeting customers expectations a key.  the hardest part was working in a small closed secure room.  Enjoyable part of the job was that  challenges always turned into key learnings for me.."
good,Required quick learning. Lots of data entry.  It was working with multiple screens. Co-workers was excellent.
good,Have learned to process reverse home mortgage loans. Great relationship with co-workers and management
good,Great company that is a great city. Only spent a summer there though.
good,"Daily activity consisted of timely and accurate execution of client distributions and asset management; reporting to external custodians investment changes; troubleshooting of paperwork and process execution. I was able to learn how to bring million dollar ideas to an international company, and the importance of a sound and structured management team. The team I worked with, both internal and external, were an amazing and diverse group of talents, able to handle the most complex situations on the fly. My biggest obstacle was being able to learn how to present constructive solutions in todays corporate environment. Personally the role I enjoyed most, was being the ""go-to"" person for our internal and external clients, being recognized for being there for those immediate and critical client needs."
good,The typical day at work is checking emails and fixing issues that arise on a reactive basis.  By working for the company it has given me the knowledge on how to ask the right questions.
good,I worked at Genworth for 12 years and really enjoyed my growth within the company. The people they are great and are very focused on improve the quality of our products and offering exceptional customer service to our new and current policy holders.
good,I worked at Genworth 9 years. I loved my job but and my direct manager however I was not a fan of the management team I was assigned to work with. They were very political with there promotions instead of judging of passion and skill.
good,"There is a good overall work feel at the Richmond location.  A feeling you're contributions are valued and needed.  However, some of the products are in a troubled industry making some positions tenuous"
good,"Come in first thing in the day and immediately have things to do, the day goes by so fast do to staying busy the whole time there. This job is very, a little tedious but fun, and I absolutely love it, just don't get hired on as a temp its hard to find out if you get on the team or not being a temp."
good,Leadership is open to developing talent and stretching employees to reach outside of their comfort zones.
good,Pros and cons basically meet to create the average employer. What they have for positive community outreach programs is equaled out by the short breaks and no time between calls.
good,"Flexible work shift. "
good,"Genworth is a nice place to work, but has very limited career growth.  There was speculation about it's longevity as a stand-alone entity. The teams are great to work with, but with limited staff in some areas, the days could be long."
good,"It is mostly nice to be a part of the Genworth, India team. We as a team have started the India operations, right from scratch. Thus this is more like our baby."
good,"Genworth took really good care of their interns. The cohort had a lot of training, and participated in events outside of work."
good,"Customer Service is my passion!  I excel in handling escalated issues and quickly developing strong relationships with internal and external customers."
good,Time was spent studying trends and looking for areas of opportunity. Working closely with project managers and business analysts to implement new processes and technology. Partnered with Sales to drive adoption of our program. Addressed customer issues and concerns and drove for speedy resolution. Worked on yearly budget and monthly accruals and variances. Coaching and mentoring associates to increase productivity and accuracy. The hardest part of the job was dealing with HR issues and providing negative feedback to associates. The most enjoyable part was analyzing data and identifying areas of opportunity and driving changes.

good,Genworth is a decent place to work.  I feel that Genworth invests in their employees and there is a good work/life balance.  Hard to move throughout the company unless you know someone.

The hardest part of the job was having to process work items and man the telephones at the same time.  This situation was very difficult, as quite often the work items were detailed and complex.  To be interrupted by telephone calls made it even harder."

good,"Productive, time sensitive and at times fun during the weekly or monthly meetings with fellow employee's and management as we played a few games for gift certificates, rewarded for being Team Players or contests games and Ice Cream Socials. I learned to keep a great rapport with the team and keep the work flow productive. At times the production could be the hardest because you needed the team to be productive and if someone was missing for the day we all had to pick up the extra work flow and 98% of the time our team did it, and that was the great part of pulling it off and just be ready for the next day. The most enjoyable part of the job was Team Work and having a few laughs through the day to keep everyone positive and to stay on task but enjoy your day at the same time."

good,Genworth was overall a good company to work for. The company cared a lot about the community and encouraged employees to get involved. There was often little incentives like ice cream socials and fall festivals for employees that made you feel valued. The work was challenging yet rewarding. The management team was not the best and the work life balance sucked during year end and quarter close.

good,People have a sense of purpose and highly talented.  Have been going through tough time last few years and hopefully things will soon get back on track once deal goes through.
good,Genworth started me with a competitive salary and developed a vast knowledge of life insurance in me. I had confidence in assuring customers and doing my job. I was promoted and up-trained twice during career there. I decided to leave after making the decision to move to Richmond. Genworth (Richmond) was not hiring at the time so I was unable to transfer. I'd recommend this company to anyone searching for a career in customer service.

In accounting the typical day started with confirming all task for the day and scheduling each to manage them all in one day, reading emails, running reports and uploading journals.  Compliance was key to making sure that all of the customer payments were made as soon as possible.  I have learned so much about the business aspect how to speak to customers, how to satisfy their needs and resolve their issues in order to maintain great business with the company.  My co-workers were a joy to be around and very helpful in my growth.  If any of my co-workers needed help I was more than happy to help and vice versa.

The people are at the heart of this organization working hard to create solutions that really help people at the most critical times in their life.  There was a lot of opportunity to give back to your community and engage in GE educational classes.  The most enjoyable part of my job was speaking with the advisor's every day, building relationships with them and always learning something new.

Everyone would respond with a sense of urgency should a problem arise. A typical day would start with coaching and managing associates on any mentoring they might need.
