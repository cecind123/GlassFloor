rating,review
bad,Great pay. Starts at 13.50/hr and goes up with your experience. It's not the job that sucks. It's the immaturity of those around you. You feel like you're working with a bunch of kids. Apparently none of the employees realize that you're adults trying to make a living.
bad,"As a store manger your resources are limited. The pay is decent but you can’t pay anyone a decent wage. It leaves you with a lot of people who do not respect your goals in relation to the amount of pay they receive. It makes it hard to delegate when people feel they work too hard for too little. Like most retail companies, scheduling is not family friendly. Most stores are focusing more on sales than customer service and people and development. They’re often hiring and or keeping managers that barely know algebra and expect them to understand their business plans and goals."
bad,Terrible management   Need to watch out for layoffs every quarterly e even think of applying or even entertqiimgnthe fact of going here’s.  Will be oir of businedd in on Eysenck
bad,"The discount is fantastic, but I highly recommend to not work for this company. Poor management, poor salary, overworked, bullied, harassment, drama, petty, I could go on and on. It is very stressful and there are not opportunities for growth. Even if you are working part-time and in school it does not matter, and if you work hard, and are over-qualified, that makes it worse because management will hate you for it. "
bad,I will never work there again I was there for 2 years and 3 months did not get hardly any raises but I could sure work my butt off for them if this tells u any anything started out at 13.50 end pay was 14.43
bad,"No hours, management lies, lots of favoritism, you get wrote up or fired for not “hitting a number” everyday, bad stressful environment, not fair, a lot of the supervisors talk badly about their employees on breaks, to much drama, no room for advancement, HR is a joke, they let their employees fight on breaks."
bad,Job sucks they try to fire everyone they have there favorites . Trainers suck supervisors like to gossip . They need to be on there employees . Employees like to talk a lot and cheat on work.
bad,Not a place for a career! You will be lucky if you get 25 hours a week on a 40 hour work week schedule! Management is too busy engaging in extra circular activities with younger employees. They make promises that they don’t keep. If you say anything about it you will be fired or let go. No room for advancement in anyway...this is a dead end job! Upper management sits outside on breaks and trash talks about every associate that crosses their paths.
bad,"Our hours kept changing, last schedule was unrealistic for anyone with children. I worked 3, 12 hour shifts and then we would be called in for Mandatory OT. Production System was flawed I would be over 100% and then drop into the 80s for the same type of production. Write ups for poor production but then they want to give you no work, or cram everyone in the same area. Management is a joke."
bad,"Factory claims that they're all about family, but they stress you to the max, when you do pose a problem they don't even try to fix it, they don't have a set schedule always working overtime at last minute call outs, definitely has harassment and poor management. Would never recommend to anyone who is looking for a good job."
bad,A typical work day would be putting merchandise in a bag and putting a shipping label on the bag and putting it on a conveyor belt as it goes to shipping.  I have not learned anything.  Management is poor they are not family oriented like they say they are.  Culture is all okay. The hardest part is lifting totes and 50 pound boxes.  I do not enjoy this job.
bad,"Don't waste your time. They don't pay very well, file a complaint you're fired. No sick time, show up late your fired. They're closing 650 stores and closing the Catherines brands home office and are cutting people loose in the Maurices clothing brand. The ship is sinking, stay away."
bad,"Company is terrible with moral and doesn't care about employees. Season people got better pay and better bonuses then offered a job. Not fair to the people who work there every day for 4-5 years and still make less than the people here for holiday.l, whom also get the same hours."
bad,"I loved my job... got promoted three times and was praised allnthe time for a job well done. My numbers were high and was considered a top associate and supervisor. Howevee management and hr failed me when I had a problem associate and even after it was proved I  did everything I could,  they fired me. They had previously fired 4 other supervisors and since my departure,  they fired more management which makes the environment unfriendly and nobody is happy anymore. They make everyone feel uneasy and supervisors cant even supervise their associates as they are constantly running reports which take forever.  Its very sad where this company is now considering I grew with it helping bring in 6 of the 8 brands"
bad,"The absolute worst company I have ever worked for. Employees are treated like second class citizens. No room for advancement. Management is incompetent, Hr is absolutely worthless, and the company looks like it's headed for the dumpster. If you are looking for a quality career with a great company than don't even waste your time filling out the application."
bad,"Unless your related to the CFO or CEO dont work here."
bad,The management is shady . They have a number system which is a crock and a joke. Doesnt matter what u do u wont get any further from wherw ur at.  I wouldnt work there not fair at all!
bad,"No chance to advance. Favoritism  upper management "
bad,The manager at the store I worked for would not accommodate for the ankle brace I had to wear to work. I had to wear shoes that weren’t their brand and I was sent home without pay. Expected to buy two entirely new wardrobes after working there for 4 day. Barely two weeks in and missed first payday and I still didn’t have the money two buy the wardrobes and was sent home because of it (shoes for the ankle brace). I have no money and since I wasn’t added to payroll before payday so it’s been two weeks without pay and without the pay I can’t buy the new wardrobes and shoes. I wasn’t told about the dress code until my training was over and was expected to have the new wardrobes by then.
bad,You do not have set hours one day you might work two hours the next day 12 hours and you are always in a diferent dept.one day you are a sorter the next a packer the next building boxes
bad,"Work hours are a joke. The company offers VTO 2-4 times a week depending on the week. You do not have to go home, but if you choose to stay, you may get written up if you do not hit your numbers even though there is not enough work flow to keep you busy. There is no room for advancement. There are people that have worked there for 8+ years and are only making 50 cents more than new hires that are brought in. Management also doesn't tell their employees any information about whats going on for the work day/week everything is kept secret for some reason. When you ask questions about work flow, no one seems to know the answer. Absolutely no communication."
bad,"fast pass work,if you didn't kiss butt you got no where"
bad,"CEO and top executives are awesome. Really good vision and attitude. But somewhere in the middle management it starts to get really bad."
bad,"Not a good place to balance out life with work. It is an environment that makes people want to take a few days off, regardless of the situation a person is facing financially."
bad,The management is the worst. Never in 30 years have I ever had a peer get in my face multiple times and then have the district manager support such behavior.
bad,"A place to avoid.  This retailer will be bankrupt soon.  My position reports to people in different cities.  The home office had over 1,000 employees in the past, but now has less than 100."
bad,Literally the worst. No hours ever. Vto almost everyday of the week except Mondays. If you don't hit your numbers you'll get canned and it's almost impossible to hit them. Managers are no help either and never encourage anyone. This place is a f ing joke.
bad,"Not a good management, Supervisors and leads they have to many favoritism with some people.. That Company it’s good but not who runs it Ascena neds new manangmen the people it’s always stressful there"
bad,Terrible place to work do not work here they only give you 8  minutes for break this company will go down bad if they don’t  straightened up  racist company
bad,It used to be a great company when it started but since then they have made so many changes in supervisors and managment it has since gone down hill they do you dirty there
bad,"Ascena hired too many seasonal employees. We were told in orientation that attendance was very important and that anybody with 3 attendance points would be dismissed. However, the managers seemed to struggle with tracking attendance, so many people slid by with multiple points. There wasn't enough work for everybody, so they started cutting hours. Finally, just two weeks short of my 90 days, I walk into the building and was told to go to the break room for a meeting. They announced that they were letting go anybody who had started after a certain date, regardless of attendance or behavior. They also let go the HR manager responsible for hiring on so many unnecessary employees, so hopefully they'll be a little more organized in the future?"
bad,"The work during Peak (holiday season) was full of fast-paced bursts and periods of struggling to find something to do. Certain areas were always busy, but on the sorters, I fell into a rhythm of finishing one task and moving onto another--without much guidance from the sporadic management--simply to keep the nights from dragging on."
bad,"Clock in and get to work start to end of shift unless a break "
bad,The employees of Ascena are all great people to work with. The co-workers are all great understanding individuals. Most of the managers are easy to talk and ask for help. However the communication between managers and employees is not up to par.
bad,"Hired as a 1st Assistant Manager for Maurice's I was appalled at the treatment of associates, customer profiling, lack of implementation of policies and procedures and training and the deviousness of management as well as the overall the backbiting behavior of other Assistant managers towards each other. I had previously worked for another big box retailer in the same mall for over 6 years with expert knowledge of customer service, sales and credit skill. I had achieved a well known reputation for my accomplishments and skills."
bad,"The people who are in charge there came off as rude and as if they didn’t want to help when you had a question or needed assistance. I quit after a month because most people there were rude and seemed like they didn’t want to be there. Also, the incentive pay was stupid. When you’re a picker picking items you could barely even move through the aisles with a giant cart and other associates would become impatient and angr. Just not  fun place to work."
bad,"experience in costumer service hardest part of my job here was dealing with management, management was not fair with employees. I loved to work on Ascena was I was always busy processing paperwork helping customers, helping receiving with any issues they have with product, I loved to learn management with their reports"
bad,the job became to stressful when they would always change the schedules and at a drop of the hat. it didn't work for my family. promised raises and never got them. to much favoritism with the management staff.
bad,A lot of work for little reward. Managers all had more time logged on youtube than with the actually workers. Co workers were very self oriented . hardest part is working to the pace they set. most enjoyable part was leaving.
bad,"Ascena is not a horrible place to work, however, the hours are not consistent and there seems to be a reoccurring promotion of the cliche group. The production rate is not an across the board to achieve process. Some do try to care about the workers as people however there is a lack of person to person communication. People easily get lost in the shuffle and corners are cut."
bad,Constantly understaffed and over-tasked. Unrealistic expectations of what can be accomplished in a single shift. Reactionary tasking versus proactive planning. Zero work life balance. Intimidation tactics used rather than positive support. Does not provide adequate training opportunity to prepare employee for success.
bad,"It was slow paced working environment. Employees did not know what they were even doing for the company.If you wanted to learn about company, you never got the same answer from management or HR.The most unorganized company i have ever seen or worked for.I would not suggest anyone to work for ascena!"
bad,"This great for a seasonal job, but if you are wanting to be there for a long period of time, I don't recommend it at all. The work is super easy and the pay is pretty good but the people there are often disrespectful and fake as can be. There is almost no sense of job security whatsoever. The communication in this place is almost nonexistent, you are pretty much thrown in the deep end and told to sink or swim. I wouldn't trust anybody there as far as I can throw them."
bad,"It’s not a bad place to work , but management doesn’t have a clue what they are doing . There is no room for advancement , the  incentive pay is a joke , the raises are a joke . Some part time people are paid $1 more on the hour than everyone else . They make you double stack heavy cases ( big safety issue ) You can make your numbers unless the system messes up then you lose your job ."
bad,"tons of reorganization with poor vision"
bad,"There are two areas of where these reviews are coming from, Ohio and Indiana. Ohio and Indiana are not only different as far as the location but in everything else as well. Take the positive statements about Ohio and then flip them to the opposite side, there you have Indiana. The two and only two perks and similarities between both locations are the pay and benefits. Everything else is day and night between the two facilities.  Many others, some being there 15-25 years as well as myself have come to realize that money comes with a price and sometimes that price is worse than a deadly addiction."
bad,"Managers and supervisors do not have the right experience, therefore they do not know what they’re doing. Only the most basic training is provided. When it is not busy, managers and supervisors expect employees to still hit the 100% rate."
bad,This is a shady company that hires people as 'valued employees' around September october.  Only to not disclose the seasonal aspect of the job and then cuts hours to 4 or 8 a week to get people to quit and /or fires people.  There is no warning.  They only put a job description as seasonal in January in indeed after everyone was hired and fired.  They suck and so do their clothes
bad,Stressful place to work due to downsizing. Expected to do more works for same pay in the same amount of hours. Put lots of stress on homelife. Company future is unstable. I would not recommend.
bad,"I didn't like the locations of the corporate hq's, but the company pays well and is filled with good people.  Nice facilities and perks like free bananas in the cafe"
bad,This job was rough. My feet were killing me everyday! I was never able to get my discount at other stores because they were not trained to do so. Work/life balance was hard when my whole body was killing me.
bad,needs better management and work with restrictions. other wise its a good job and you have a peak season that will work your butt off and make killer money.
bad,"Not a lot of room for advancement, the days are long, and tiring. there's a lot of change in management, everyone always acts like they're about to lose their jobs."
bad,"The typical was day was stressful, you didn't really get any proper breaks. I honestly didn't learn much at Ascena. Ascena Retail Group wasn't managed very well at all. I absolutely did not like working at Ascena but it paid my bills."
bad,THe company pays a decent salary but the work life balance in the company is very bad and the resources assigned to each project is less. They want to have people and have more work extracted.
bad,"Replenishers were forced to fill cart as much as possible to stock picking areas. Cart weighs over 100 lbs, plus boxes can weigh up to 50 each. When they decided to limit 6 boxes on the cart at a time, at maximum weight, cart is 100+  lbs add 6 (50 lbs) boxes comes to over 400 lbs to manually push the cart around. The company ignored pain complaints unless you fell or injury was seen."
bad,"Workplace culture is steeply declining in quality. The driving force, the call center, is considered ""non-revenue creating"" and is criminally underpaid and overworked. They make barely more than minimum wage and are expected to be subject matter experts on nearly all software and hardware used by brands."
bad,Tough place to work.  Hours are inconsistent.  Management doesn't apply company standards.  Safety is not a priority. Management is an exclusive team and doesn't encourage participation from others.
bad,"In my time at Ascena, i witnessed a very large and continuous influx in hiring, and by direct result there was less and less work. In the past 2 months there’s has been several “vto”s(voluntary time off) and company wide shutdowns. And still the hiring continues as the work continues to Ebb"
bad,"Great Benefits and work life balance.  Very poor upper management. They offer a 4 day work week which is great.  However, they fail to plan ahead at all on overtime."
bad,They never seem to know what is going on and never tell anyone about overtime until a few minutes before we leave the day before the overtime is mandated. It is physically draining and if you get hurt there they will try their best to not get you compensation. You will need an attorney in order to get one.
bad,"There is poor communication between Area Supervision and Associates. Dont understand why 3 stages to getting hired fulltime. Seasonal, Temp to Hire then Full time Associate.  It can be as long as 6 months to get full-time position."
bad,"This company is in peril. Blurred lines concerning responsibilities, an unnecessary hierarchy, and blatant disrespect. Zero diversity--zero inclusion."
bad,It's ok as a starter job. Don't expect 40 hr weeks or getting paid for your hard work. It won't happen. The team leads seldom are helpful. Promise of incentive  bonuses but never paid for them. They will short you hours if you don't keep on top of them.
bad,"Politics are favored over the advancement of efficiency."
bad,My review was fine but they try to find something to write you on so you don’t get advancments.  They never have anything positive to say about you unless you are a favorite
bad,Not much for caring of their associates. Too high expectations associates do not like working for this company. Changing of shifts constantly. Associates are robots.
bad,I loved that I was able to work remotely. Raises were very minimum though. The best thing was my department was not over managed. We were a small but competent team who were recognized for our ability to work without being micromanaged.
bad,We only had on brand that we were working with out of the eight that we should of been working with. New section called ecom that they hired way to many people for so there was a lot of pushing brooms and standing around.
bad,be very careful about accepting positions there that you really are not interested in. Once you are hired on at the position you really didn't want you may not get an interview for the positions you really hoped for
bad,I was happy working for this company when i first started everything seemed to be what i was looking for within a company. But as time went on i did notice the company was not consistent with rules and policies. Also there were instances of a manager getting into a verbal altercation with another manager and he was still there after it happened twice. The communication was very key to me and that's not what i was getting from management.
bad,"I love what i do for a living, however I wish that the management of e this were more down to earth. I know all jobs have their pros and cons but, I feel as though I shouldn't be disrespected so much at my place of work."
good,"learn alot only if you ask to be teached, supervisors do not communicate with eachother, hardest part is to get used to working with the gladiators, have to be fast with picking orders and packing."
good,a typical work day starts with stretching and then supervisor telling us what we can do better with. we get straight to work mostly going to where the ork is and sending slow people to help you get it done or no one at all. managements sits in there office all day and comes out at end of shift.
good,It's a job. They mismanage people. They'll promote the uneducated over the educated and skilled time and time again. It's great if you just want something temporary before you move onto something better like everyone else there does.
good,Management gossips about employees. Very unprofessional. Lack of advancement opportunities. People in certain position you wonder how the heck they got there.
good,I pack items in a bag or box. How much the don't care about people. The management needs to be fired and have all new management in there because the will not let you get ahead in life. I have lots of friend there that I got along with them great. Driving the crane. When it was time to go home at the end of the day.
good,Lots of seasonal jobs. There is no warning that the r going to let you go. They just call you to desk and let you go.  It is face pace during peck but other then that you r cleaning all the time
good,I had one of the few good supervisors. But most are corrupt and couldn't care less about the ones under them. And HR is a joke. The highschool politics are mentally exhausting.
good,"It was great money.  Like most factories, it is not exempt from the pettiness, bullying, favoritism.  They change the schedules too much, its hard to plan stuff in advance.  "
good,"The concept of e commerce of multiple companies is ideal.  Better equipment, technologies, less management more input from workers. Could use better leaders."
good,I wish the store I worked in lived the talk the corporate environment provided.  I left the company because the manager and district manager continued to schedule me overtime hours and ignored my request for earned time off.  I also suffered verbally abusive treatment from the manager.  The manager was fired shortly after I left and the district manager was also replaced.  I reapplied to work for a different manager and was denied reentry into the company.
good,"The company is good, but they need to invest in some leadership and diversity training. If you are patient and like change, this is a fine place to work."
good,"There have been times i've walked into work and it's super busy. Many of us look to our managers to be levelheaded,  calm, cool and collected,  which they never are. They are always stressed out and they pass their stress onto the employees. We are all GROWN women but are spoken to at times in a very rude manner. For managers that have been apparently working there for years on end, they sure don't know how to carry a team with GENUINE support and guidance."
good,"While working at Justice I was able to learn countless new skills that would benefit me in my future career. Though it was work, being there was still a fun and exciting experience."
good,"I was good at my job. My numbers were great. However the only way to advance at acsena is to sleep with the higher ups, or at least wear tight pants and low cut shirts. If you are a male you really have hardly any chance of moving up. Good luck to future workers. I am glad i got out when i did. "
good,I learned a lot of different department job duties and almost always had something to do. But the lack of communication between department leads/supervisors/managers and across shifts wasnt good. There is always something changing and that information isnt always relayed to the associates it affects. Hard work gets you nowhere. Too many shady things went on in the last 5 years.
good,Point system allows 8 points per year.  if you do not request off ahead of time you get pointed no matter what the reason.  Management are young and shows to much favoritism to friends
good,Lack of correct information given to employee's by administration. It's as if it's purposely done. As well the lack of HR organization. I might add that the new HR Specialist was out of line during orientation several times. I do believe had a person of direct authority been present he would have lost his job.
good,"Ascena retail was a good place to work. Low stress environment and friendly people. The travel distance is a bit out of the way to the facility, which can be troublesome in bad weather."
good,Retail downturn and corporate restructuring led to layoffs and outsourcing of departments.  Formerly good culture was declining prior to outsourcing.  Deadlines were often short and data systems often lacking.
good,A typical day is a 650+ call volume call center with 12-18 employees at a time. I have learned that customer service in a call center means concise and direct info with little room for chit chat. My coworkers fair well in the fact we all know where we are. Some feel content and some others feel trapped. The hardest part is being told there are calls in queue when there's a queue monitor on a 80 inch screen on a wall and chimes also telling you there are calls in queue while your managers also yell or speak loudly there are calls in queue. The most enjoyable part of this job is the wonderful and beautiful onsite restaurant/cafe'. everyday there's new items of food for a very low reasonable cost.
good,"64,000 souls serve in this woman centered retail organization. The majority of middle, upper middle, and senior management are all middle aged men with zero clue on what their customers and employee customers want and are tone deaf about it to the point of absurdity. "
good,"Overall the company is a great place to work, my experience is with the team I started with the work environment was great but once people who was in the startup left and other personalities ensued the whole environment shifted and work started to really feel like work."
good,"Way too competitive for a tween girls store. Working with customers was fun, if they let you help them. Whoever decided ear piercing should be a thing needs to be fired. Earring guns are unsanitary and painful and no kid should go through that. Anyways, it was fun but now I dread working some days."
good,"I loved my job with Ascena but not because of the company.  My district manager was awful.  She failed to answer phone calls, emails, and texts at times when our store needed her most.  In my 2 years of working here we went through more managers than I can count on one hand... not good.  This company is also very wasteful when it comes to packaging items and damaging them out. The only reason I loved my job was because of my coworkers. They were all such fun girls to work with and im happy to be able to call them my friends."
good,"Good place to work "
good,"THE greatest part of this company is the culture. Maybe not in merchandising/buying, but every where else in the company. The company does SO MUCH for the community, and it makes you feel like you are really making a difference in someone's life. The benefits are also very good, for singles and families."
good,The lower you are the worse the hrs are the more nights you get stuck working. No family time even though your told it's going to be a family first job.
good,"I worked here several years, It was difficult to balance life and this job. last minute overtime caused issues with appointments already made on your day off. the occurrence system did not work well for most people. But was horrible for parents especially if they had more than one child. Six times a year is all you can miss. My kids having three were sick that many times in a couple winter months. Then god forbid you got sick. And we could not even use a doctors excuse unless it was more than three days. Had to go through a two week process even still. No room for advancement unless maybe by chance someone is fired or retires oh or dies."
good,"The environment was nice."
good,If you're not friends with managers you're nothing if you don't work you get everything if you work too hard you're punished I personally cared for the job but they obviously don't care about their employees again I was seasonal they keep the people that didn't work and they let the people go that did work
good,It was fast paced but management was slow. They did not get back with the worker in a timely manner however they expected pace to be kept up at a fast rate.
good,"There were a lot of people that I loved to work with that I now miss since I no longer work there. The job was pretty fair but it was also very busy. I would come in and before even logging in for the day I was being asked to login and start helping out. On the other hand, it was so busy that it made the days go by fast."
good,"Fast-paced, typical retail work environment. Highly competitive compensation and benefits packages.  Would recommend to anyone looking for high risk/high reward."
good,"A typical day at work consists of sales, unit per transaction, average dollar sale, and credit card application goals. Those are usually the main focus of the day. Customers are also important. Every customer must be greeted and given personal assistance during their shopping visits. Between tasks tables must be folded and ""go backs"" put away."
good,Upper management was not consistent with overall company direction.  High turnover amongst senior leaders created unclear direction to team members.  This made the position difficult to understand what the expectations were by upper management.  Due to the consistent change also created very tight deadlines which created a lack of work life balance.
good,"During what they call “peak season” they call you off work when there is no work. They also call you in for 12 hours as they need it every Monday it’s mandatory with weekends off. I do believe they over estimaded 2018 peak. There weren’t many orders, and the hours we worked were ridiculous. Ranging from 2-12 hours a day."
good,this place will NOT look at your past experience to qualify you for promotions or other opportunities if you start in any hourly position. Heaven forbid you are over40 and try for any supervisor or lead position
good,"The days could be very boring at times. You stand all day every day transferring merchandise from one box to another, so it's a rather monotonous atmosphere. It is a warehouse, so some employees are going to have a stronger work ethic than others will. This was my first job that required me to stand for 10 hours every day, so I quickly found out just how hard standing for that long is on your feet (I was younger when I worked there)."
good,Multi forest and multi domain Active Directory environment. Significant exposure to vMWare ESXi 6.0. Biggest challenge is implementing DR and reacting to daily retail IT challenges.
good,"Can be a great place to work, good pay and fairly easy work, advancement at any given time, overtime available, paid time off, one on one training along with some in class training. Clean and friendly lunch area"
good,Not my cup of tea. Did the same thing every day and it was so monotonous and boring. I was only seasonal but the pay was decent while it lasted. Decent job if you like factory work.
good,Retail is tough in the shadow of Amazon. This retailer is no different. Hopefully they find a way to stay competitive and carve out a new niche in the market.
good,Very disappointed with the attitude of 'management'.  The skill set was far from current and there seemed to be no desire to consider more current coding techniques.
good,"Great pay but very demanding hours during peak time, Upper management seems incompetent when making changes to meet the needs of the business and when applying changes to work procedures. However the Department ans shift supervisors on the work floor are amazing, it would be a better more efficient work environment if upper management would listen to the employees on the floor."
good,"bad work life balance"
good,ascena is a company composed of several retail brands.  I enjoy that I get to work with multiple organizations from luxury retail to pre-teen girls retail.
good,I don't reccomend this company unless you are looking for short term employment or supplemental income. Otherwise they will work you till death. Enter at your own risk.
good,The working environment was clean. Everyone was very friendly. The jobs in each department was easy to do. The fast pace of replenishing made the day go by faster.
good,"I've liked it at Ascena but I've run into plenty of problems with their management. Poor work to home life ratio, working overtime every week and a sudden change in our work hours."
good,You have to be friends with the manager to progress. Some senior level folks have really poor skills and knowledge. C level folks have made so many poor decisions that company is suffering a lot.
good,"Wear house work is very different then running a cash register. There are so many things to be learned working in a wear house, although you can not have a phone, or take any kind of pictures of the wear house."
good,the work is easy and pay is decent but the negative thoughts and feelings from leads and teammates just makes the job not worth it at times. The overtime is their and does help.
good,"The job was mostly manageable with lots to learn and people willing to teach, but greeting and giving a script to each and every customer got annoying"
good,"Temporary job.  It was okay.  No real issues with Ascena.  "
good,"Not a consistent place to work especially if you need a set schedule, sent employees home a lot, good benefits discounts and raises. Good place to work if you need part time."
good,"Not the best job for someone who is looking to get many hours. It was a part-time job but most weeks I would only be scheduled 3 hours a week. Management was switched around while I was there. Even though the new manager is benefitting the store, I was being scheduled less and my hours that I did have scheduled would often be cut."
good,The work was tough and physical but the tasks given to you were simple. The benefits and company participation was strong. would recommend for a fit person.
good,Good Company to work for but worried about the future of brick and mortar retail. Great workplace culture and has taught me a lot through out the years. 4 day work week is a plus but makes for long days.
good,"This job was a good starter job when i needed to obtain a good work ethic and maintain a life after high school graduation. I used my days with Ascena to work my way eventually from the warehouse floor to the vendor coordination office, however wanted more."
good,"I really liked the culture at justice, the atmosphere is fun and upbeat."
good,"time typical day at work"
good,"my typical work day would be me going to a bay I'll scan boxes and put the items into the box.I learned a lot while being there as far as rf scanning,closing out boxes some forklift here and there Wasn't fully trained on it but i know the basics. as far as management I wasn't a big fan of it because they did favoritism which i didn't think was fair that's why i put my 2 weeks in. Some of the co-workers there abused their power but majority of them were really cool and fun to work with. I wouldn't say anything about the job was hard honestly and I'd say the most enjoyable part about the job was the events they had for the workers."
good,Constant work at this company.  I would work for them again if I had the chance.  The overtime available is an easy way to get ahead.
good,This company focused much of it's energy on pleaseing and taking care of the plus sized customers we styled. This was the most rewarding feeling to help encourage and make HER feel Beautiful
good,Took job while in college. Environment was fun and allowed for advancement. Once I graduated from school I took a job as the lead of department.
good,The title says it all. You walk and walk and walk. People are pretty cool though.
good,"Company has flexible hours and room for advancement. On a typical day I deal with freight, customer service, and selling."
good,good  goodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgoodgood
good,"When I started it was a great company but the last 2 years, management changed and so did the culture and it is sad to see Dress Barn close their stores, since they were the ones who created Ascena Retail Group, Inc,"
good,Packing clothes all day gets repetitive. Worth the pay though. Looking for work on a non busy day is annoying just cause they don't want to send groups home so you just have to wait for work to show up.
good,I really enjoyed this job it was a fun place to work at other thanks the cons which would be terrible with schedules sometimes I worked 4 hours sometimes 12 hours it all varies it was never a set schedule.
good,running around and scanning items and throw it into a bin to send to packers. packers take the bin and scan the items and put them into bags to be shipped.
good,"My direct supervisor was amazing! Her attitude, drive, knowledge, patience, and motivational spirit made Ascena a great place to work. If she was not there it would have been a terrible place to work."
good,"Ascena is a good place to work they, really good care of their associates. I worked there both 2016 and 2017 seasonal. Management is iffy.  Good place."
good,The compensation package was competitive and the employee discounts were great.  My co-workers were like extended family.
good,"*Immediate management was not qualified."
good,Ascena as an organization is growing and offers a tremendous opportunity to individuals to grow with it or bring learnings from their past experiences to the table.
good,"Depending on your Supervisor, Ascena is a fair and flexible place to work especially if you have children. Most days are fast paced. Co-workers are nice. There are picnics and events when the weather is warmer. Have a nice venue to eat. Plenty of parking."
good,"Ascena isn't too bad a company to work for. Management needs fine tuning, most don't seem to know what they are doing and needs better communication between its departments and people. "
good,For being a Loss Prevention Officer it's pretty good pay. The associates that work in the Fullfillment Center also make pretty good money and room for advancement. The company has been around for years and will be around for years to come. Supervisor is easy to get along with and caring of personal needs and time off. The work load is pretty manageable throughout the facility.
good,They are stumbling to keep up with the bigger retailers and they don't want to invest the money to do the business upgrades it would take to keep their leg in the game.
good,"Where I did enjoy my time with Ascena, I couldn't make a life long career with them because the structure for advancement and what they pay verses what they expect is not balanced. A second job became a must which is the only reason I left. I enjoyed my team and I enjoyed the company in other every other way."
good,I only worked there as a consultant for just a few months.  I did like the fact that they provided free Starbucks coffee!  They also allowed some flexibility in work hours.
good,"It was a fairly good place to work. Some days it was impossible to get numbers so if you didn't VTO it would hurt you in the long run. When it's slow you're lucky to get 30 hrs a week, especially if they send you home and it's not voluntary. It wasn't a bad experience but they need to work on their system. Especially if you have people who never call off and always stay who get fired over the people who always go home and goof off. They also need to figure out a system that allows them to know just how much product is going to a certain department. Sending groups home every day and then making weekends mandatory is obnoxious. Educate themselves on policy since many people were told they were rehirable only to find out they were not."
good,I loved that they had group meetings. They always made you feel included on what was going on with the company. They are really strong on knowing who you work with and want the employee to collaborate with one another. Always having company events to be able to socialize with co-workers. And the discounts on clothing was AWESOME!!!
good,Ascena has been a fun place to work. Enjoyed learning the ins and outs of a retail business and all that goes into providing product to a specified target market.
good,The pay matches the work up to a point. There were some policies that could've been changed that would've improved the work life but it is what it is.
good,"Excellent management, good payment, but not too good work environment that do not benefits or health and not good relationship between the associates."
good,"The job is pretty simple, however it gets slow and lack of work however you can stay and walk around looking for work but that gets old. Management is great."
good,Leads and Supervisor's are very strict and doesn't follow the manual provided . They make up rules that are not in the manual when associates ask ?'s.
good,"I love it there! Its so relaxed and the work isn't very hard. Also the gym and cafe is a plus. The management is very understanding, nice, and cooperative.."
good,It’s good and all but turns out you don’t get the breaks you’re legally suppose to be getting. It’s fun being able to talk to new workers and go on break with some people.
good,A great company to work with. Very laid back as long as you were doing the right things and staying on task. Flexible hours and paid time off. Management and communication always in need of improvement though
good,"It was fun working for this company for the amount of time I was there. When Ascena took over the company I worked for, they brought so much more to the table than I could ask for. As a Full Time Sales Lead with the previous company, I hadn't been offered a 401k plan. When Ascena took over, they offered it to all FT Employees. What did suffer at the location I was at was the scheduling management. The scheduling management failed to schedule accordingly so memos could be completed on time. Other members in management also didn't step up to assist when memos were due and just waited for someone else to do them."
good,"Loading and unloaded pieces into boxes for shipment. "
good,"I worked at 4 locations and the first 3 were very well managed and I enjoyed my job greatly but the last one was not good at all! Poorly staffed, poorly managed and the customers were very high maintainence. If we would have been staffed adequately that would have not been an issue though the customer is the reason we have a job!  It was a very stressful situation and the rioting in St. Louis at the time made it dangerous coming and going. The did almost double my hourly wage when coming there but not worth it!"
good,Great place to work if they would get their HR department and Management teams to communicate. 12 hour shifts arent bad until you spend 7 of those hours standing around doing nothing.
good,"In house design is a new initiative for DB and the merchant teams are reluctant to see it succeed. Merchants are still trying to prove they can do it all and don't need design or product development. Designers are hired with the promise of working full time at the NYC office, but actually have to commute to the Mahwah HO several times a month. Merchants do not come to NYC office to work with designers and there is no protocol in place for it. All departments are in the Mahwah home Office except Design... Design is treated as a separate entity and since this company has never had in house design before, so the design leadership can get away with anything: constant overtime, unprofessional behavior, disrespecting/abusing subordinates, and forcing associates to work weekends. There is no time management, no organization, no focus. Merchants are considered more than designers and have control over everything."
good,"Love the job, working with people, dressing manaquins is my focus. Everyone is very friendly and we all get along. The pay is not good and I have been there over a year with no raise."
good,"Most days, this job was the best thing to ever happen to someone. I think HR and higher up people need to ACTUALLY listen and take their employees seriously. But over all it was a fun job, even though it could sometimes be very stressful. Wish more than nothing I could go back and work for Ascena. I would love to promote one day too."
good,Miss this job but don't miss some of the things. The jobs are never really too hard just have to stay busy and do your work. They use to care alot about the employees but that slowly changes over time.
good,A typical day at work tended to involve daily tasks that would keep the store environment clean and visually pleasing in accompaniment to creating genuine connections with each customer that walked through the door.
good,Great people and teams-many have worked at the brands for twenty plus years. Management lacks confidence and is challenged to accommodate current retail environment.
good,Loved it. The people are very respectful and Friendly. The work is easily understandable. Hours are flexible. Staff is friendly and easy to get along with.
good,"Nice place to work, they were willing to work with me on my schedule for school. Would recommend for anyone who enjoys working in a warehouse setting."
good,"Amazing place to learn and grow in the dynamic specialty retail industry space.   We are a collective of several iconic woman and tween girls brands.  Fast paced, ever changing."
good,"I have really enjoyed working at Ascena, I wish I could continue working here. I just don't make enough money to cover everything right now. Almost everyone is nice and helpful, including most of the management team."
good,I took this position for some extra cash. It was a nice environment. However I do wish the retail locations paid better. If they paid better I would still be there.
good,Great customers  friendly staff  the store was always clean and the clothing is very fashion forward. The area was very safe. The  manager was very nice and always helpful.
good,"It is a fast paced work environment where you get to interact with regular customers. I've learned the retail business, the most favorable part of the job is meeting new people."
good,You start your day off with the start of shift meeting telling you what our numbers are and if we are possibly have overtime then you go to get your handheld which is what you scan your barcode with on the boxes in the shelves for your locations so they know the product is and you stock the shelves with the product
good,Everyone is friendly and willing to help. Down season is hard when people do not get their full 40 hour work week. job is very repetitive and easy to learn
good,"Despite Ascena being a great company overall, they are scaling back their IT operations and there is limited growth potential.  I aspire to manage a Service Desk and being in a Lead position was something that I did in the past, so it seemed a good fit while I was job searching.  Unfortunately, after discovering the lack of promotion opportunities, I need to move on to a company that will allow me to develop and start a career I can retire from."
good,a company in transition that embraces change
good,"Great place to work, the atmosphere is good! They have a clean work Invorment,  and climent controlled. They have a full service cafeteria, and provide free drinks."
good,Needs to be more organized. Leads and supervisors should be more prepared for the day. Making sure what needs to be done so the non advanced associates know what to do in regards of work.
good,I left because of one manager. She was fired not long after left thought.  I am planning to reapply.  Pay and benefits were great for ease of work. There will be some days you will be worked to the bone.
good,"Get there hop in my crane and pull packages until shift ends or fix and receive inventory. I learned how to operate cranes and work with computer systems. Management where ok, kind of behind the scenes. They’re awesome people that work there."
good,"I thought Ascena was a great place to work, although it can be very exhausting(mainly during peak). I have worked as a packer & a picker & personally picking was my favorite so far. I hope to go back & actually be able to be hired on full time before peak hits. "
good,"Azucena is a great place to work, one of my favorites. My problem is that the management was kind of subpar to the rest of the company. The communication wasn't very effective between employees and management. I would definitely work there again if possible, but I really would want to go to an area where I'm on my own because it's less complicated on your own. Especially with rumors that surge around like a high school girl's locker room."
good,work life balance is great as the company gives you tools to work remotely if needed. The culture however is a bit lacking. The company needs to encourage it's employees to interact and build a more family environment.
good,"I love working here, it's a super easy and fun job in a good environment, but none of us get paid enough for the work and if you are under 18 there is little to no chance of promotion even if you're perfect for the job."
good,"Ascena is a great place to work, the only downside is having to call in the night before to see how many hours you work, if you work at all. Obviously, this doesn't allow you to schedule any plans. Besides that, it was a great place to work. "
good,I liked the Management that they had there.The employees were as well but since it was seasonal had to leave throwing product into boxes and taping them when they were filled was staying busy when it was slow meeting nice people and management
good,"Project Manager\Network Engineer 1-Project Manager and Lead for transition and migration project from Bensalem, Pa to Pataskala, Ohio.  Ascena Retail purchased Charming Brand for 5.0 billion and needed to procure the systems and services from one location to another.   This included the services, tools and procedures.  In less than 3 weeks we had procured the service side of the Charming Brand to Ascena, and also the Real Estate Activity processes for new and closing stores procedures.  We had to document and thoroughly understand these procedures and service the stores and personnel in 50 states and in Canada including opening and closings protocols."
good,Good company with good communication about work flow. Co workers are friendly and nice. Management actually show interest in employees attitude.
good,Being an Advanced Unit Processor is a very demanding job but company is good to it's employees and offer excellent benefits.
good,Constant need to stay busy unless the overall warehouse is low on work. Had a nice cafeteria with hot foods for breakfast and lunch. Easy to learn the system
good,"Have very good benefits and good facilities.. "
good,"ascena retail group, as is the case with most brick and mortal retailers, is experiencing challenging times in their business model/growth.  As a result, ascena is  undergoing several internal changes. However, when available, corporate can offer a good place to work in an everchanging landscape."
good,"There is continual fluctuation in outbound volume. The management team has done a great job in creating a schedule that manages the volume. Mon-Fri 10,10,6,6,8 schedule. Extra overtime has been minimized because of this schedule. The mgmt. team does a great job of preplanning overtime, however there are a few time where unscheduled overtime is needed. Overall a great place to work especially if you like to pick or pack."
good,Management within our particular was outstanding. Great listener and very accommodating. The staff was also great to work with and it was a family atmosphere
good,"Ascena was a good place to work for. However when their not in peek season, they vto almost every night and you don't reach your 80 hours every two weeks."
good,"Quick paced retail environment, collaborative environment. Lack of understanding of career growth and upward mobility within the company. Overall good place to work."
good,"Ascena is a fast paced distribution center; They provide a number of perks for their employees; excellent cafeteria, a work-out gym and game room. Friendly and helpful management and HR, department provide training and information. New job posting give Opportunity to work in different departments. It can be very challenging physically at first with the fast pace, lifting and long hours, but your body adjust.  I liked knowing that I might be sent to a different department for a day or even a few hours because the work can be redundant but Over all a nice place to work."
good,"Decent workplace overall, nice cafeteria and free fountain drinks, The whole building had central air conditioning so working in the summer actually wasn't bad at all"
good,Customer focused company with a great culture and significant potential to gain plus size market share. Team selling culture that is all about providing the customer with the very best experience making her feel beautiful.
good,Its fast past work as long as  your moving you will meet production.the hardest part about this job is waking up.
good,It’s not something I’d recommend for long term unless you want to become district manager. Good job for younger teens looking to get a first job though.
good,"One of the good work place to work along with people from different background. Great place for learners. Fun place as there is a game room. Since its a new company set in India, the management is not that great in setting the rules."
good,"I was a seasonal replinisher and the job was very easy. There were times that were stressful during their ""peak"", but there wasn't anything that I would consider hard about the job. The only thing i wish they would've done differently is to haven given an estimate of when off boarding would be for seasonal associates so you would have a chance to apply for other jobs."
good,"I was placed into Replenishment and was told that I would have to unpack and sort out 23 boxes of clothes per hour to maintain rate. Unfortunately, the two trainers who worked with me  failed to do their job as trainers and did not show me the proper procedure for not just scanning the clothes and boxes, but emphasizing the proper procedure which would've enabled me to maintain rate.  The sad part is that Replenishment is a relatively easy job to do.  This also reflects poorly on Ascena; it appears that Ascena doesn't really care about their associates and their success. I would only consider Order Processing at Ascena as a seasonal job, never as a full-time career position.  "
good,"Ascena was a good place to work. I never had any problems with management, leads, or advances. Benefits were very good with annual raises as well as incentive pay if quota was met."
good,"Typical work day, "
good,"Casual laid back yet, fast paced work environment. Flexible sick days and paid time off.  Opportunities to advance in the company if hard work is shown."
good,"Fast paced, good pay, great discounts, awesome café, game room, work out facility, easy work, climate controlled, music is played."
good,"The Benefits were great medically, but you could tell there was so much pressure on the DM's that all you heard was negative feedback.  Not all DM's are like that though.  Where I was there is still  after 3 years, so much pressure on that market. Maybe go somewhere less busy..."
good,ascena retail is a good place to work if you don't have a social life. they really have some good and amazing people that work there. ascena pays good and I love working there its just very hard for me to work there. its an ok place to work but in some ways its also not
good,"working for Ascena Retail  group has been a great experience so far, Ive learned any things and as for coworkers they are always playing as a team when needed."
good,Great Culture to work in. frequent development and feedback purposed for internal growth. Leadership cares about its employees. Monthly associate recognition.
good,"Very childish, it was unfortunate. it was easy going at work which was very nice, and part timers got a paid 15 min. lunch, but my manager was unfair and threatened to give me ""strikes"" when i could not show up for work as i had to go to Iowa because a family member had passed. I showed her a eulogy and all."
good,"The company has many good qualities but unfortunately the Retail industry is currently struggling.  In it effort to quickly react to the changing environment, decisions are sometimes without fully assessing the impact."
good,"Fast past environment, many learning opportunities. Good teamwork and team players. Work load is consistently increased. Many opportunities to learn and continue training."
good,Maurices creates a challenging yet fun customer focused environment. Customer service is the main focus and distinguishes this company from other retail stores. This focus creates personal relationships between employees and customers.
good,"The overall experience at Ascena was very good.  Strong senior leadership, above average mid-level leadership. The culture changes frequently due to company acquisitions."
good,My day was very busy with multiple deadlines to complete.  My fellow coworkers were fun to work with and I learned a great deal from many of them
good,"Order picking and packing, operations at DMS, sorting, tote reorganizing and handling. Picking orders from location and packing to be sent out to customers"
good,"This was my first role in help. desk schedule is 4 day on 3 off and 10 hour days. training really set me up to succeed at work. the hardest part for me was getting used to systems, but you gotta understand it take s time. over all it was a great experience."
good,as long as you do what you are told working here is a breeze. they play music which helps the time go by a bit faster.started off slow but the sales made the hours
good,I have had many opportunities for advancement with ascena. You have to be willing to work and come to the table with a point of view and new ideas. I like it
good,Ascena Retail Group was a great employer for the majority of my tenure at the company. The last few years have been a challenge for them as it has for most brick and mortar retailers. They began a company wide assessment of the brands and the corporate structure which unfortunately led to some decisions to close or sell off some of their brands.
good,Ascena is a wonderful retail warehouse. The managers are absolutely amazing and the company works with you to ensure your ready to work. The benefits and discounts the company provides are also nice.
good,"Has great people to work with, calming and relaxing environment, holidays/sales events are the busiest, request lifting things and pulling carts, you can be trained in multiple areas."
good,"I've been trained in Retail packing, Retail LPAS, & Ecommerce Picking. A typical day at work is smooth going. You met & work with a lot of intelligent and nice people. Management is great as well. The worst part about the job is the walking, but the work is super easy to learn."
good,Helped set the stage for what was needed of someone in a retail field. The pay was a little too little for what we were doing but it wasn't anything crazy.
good,I enjoy getting up each day to come into work. Management is very respectful to its employees. The company as a whole treats its employees very decent. The culture that we have here is we value our people and love our customers and we live by that. The hardest part of the job is getting ready for peak and working 12-14 hours a day 6 days a week. I have enjoyed working here and meeting a tremendous amount of new people and having the ability to work with a team that respects one another. Not a day goes by that I have not learned something from someone.
good,"I really enjoyed working here. Employees and management were very friendly. Hours were 3, 12-hour shifts which left you plenty of time off. Rewarded with pizza quite often for reaching productivity goals."
good,"Overall Great Company "
good,Great place to work at. The management encourages you to better yourself and move up in the company. They are also extremely understanding of personal issues and home life.
good,"I worked there temporarily, when my hours changed from 4 5hr days to 2 10hr days I quit due to the pain in my upper back for working the long hrs. I immediately regretted it and tried to get my job back to no avail. I hopefully will be picked up as a seasonal employee this year."
good,Good work life balance and good learning. Support employees in a better way. Food is not good out here no free coffee machines for employees working in shifts.
good,"Teaches you great selling skills and challenges you to develop as a person. Would recommend."
good,"Fun place to work. Cafeteria, gym and gameroom. Great energy and employees. Advancement opportunities available for go getters. Discounts at major clothing retailers."
good,The job is not hard but it is physical. It is very fast paced and you are on your feet all the time. You keep busy so time goes by pretty fast. I am part time so I don't get some of the benefits but seems good from what I read. You do accumulate time off for every hour you work as part time. You get discounts at the stores we ship items for.
good,"The Ascena Brands are a solid company with great character.  I enjoy working there because of the unique culture and openness to address even the smallest of concerns from the customer or the employee,"
good,"You work Monday through Friday, 10 hour days.  Decent wages and weekends off.  Rarely do you work overtime.  You are more likely to get VTO.  A nice cafeteria and overall environment.  You also have access to the gym upstairs.  The biggest downfall is how loud the work area is, though earplugs are provided."
good,typical day consists of a team meeting then all of the employees are released to start working their shift. there are a lot of perks with this job such as free gym access during and outside of work hours. and very healthy meals
good,"you will scan b oxes to see what item needs to hgo in so the box can be shipped to the store. also the ,management team they have is very wonderful they will try their best to help you to be sucessful at your job."
good,"Very upbeat, play music all day. Work down conveyors putting product in boxes along with co-workers. In reserve pull boxes out of racks with stock picker putting them on line feeding work to associates. Ive learned alot about how to operated a whole building to get the products getting shipped out of building. Most enjoyable part is co-workers and paychecks."
good,"Super laid back and easy work, you got to wear regular everyday clothes and they paid really God’s too. Would really recommend working here it’s a great place"
good,"Good place to work"
good,"Working at ascena comes with many perks: onsite gym, onsite café, coffee, fruit, popcorn, outdoor areas for meetings or relaxing, competitive benefits packages, and discounts to all of the brands. The upper management team is invested in providing transparency when communicating with their employees. The culture within the company is collaborative and supportive."
good,"I had 8 great years with the brand. I was able to built a team from scratch, implemented new processes and saved cost of goods. "
good,"Although the concept of working 3 days a week and still being able to obtain full time hours sounds nice, I would rather work 5 days of 8 hours than 3 days of 12 hours. 5am-5pm consumes most of the day, starting at a very early time for someone who lives 45 minutes away. I also have a young child who is up until midnight most nights, so I end up only getting 3 hours of sleep. The people I have worked with are great, the overall culture and work-flow is great, and could not be an easier job. I feel comfortable speaking with HR and Management as they are very welcoming and open to whatever it is I have to say. Ascena is also really great for offering extra hours nearly every day of each week, so those who want to work closer to 80-100 hours per week can do so based on weekly demand."
good,"ascena provides a safe and fun work environment. Management focusses a great deal on associates engagement through consistent feedback, consistency, caring, communication. The company provides weekly and monthly updates to all employees. The safety of the associates is very important to the management and Asset Protection teams. "
good,I enjoy working for Ascena Retail Group but I’ve always looked towards Criminal justice as a career path and a dream goal. And I cant wait to start my career by becoming a juvenile correctional officer.
good,Very repetetive but not too straining mentally or physically. Overall i enjoyed it. The supervisors there were very understanding and helpful in case i found myself confused about something .
good,"ascena is a good place to work. they have good benefits and good insurance. overall a good company to work for, and is good pay. they have flexible hours and different shifts that they can help you with."
good,Love working here. Couldnt have asked for a better first job especially for young girls! Postive message for girls and great work/personal life balance!
good,Very laid back and fun place to work. Easy schedule and very reasonable with scheduling requests. Awesome management team and associate relationships.
good,"Friendly lead, position were easy but have to work in fast paced. Just enjoy packing clothing and accessories, labeling, taped boxes. Do computer work Microsoft & Word."
good,I think that was the only thing that had me looking forward to going to work was the kids. There was always drama with the employees and managers. The ambiance wasn’t very pleasing.
good,"Was a decent job, paid for overtime, paid the bills.got to use my forklift experience. Did get a discount for several stores with a daughter that came in handy."
good,"This was hands down probably the best job I've ever had. I know it's my favorite I've ever worked. It was fun and easy, but in a good way. It was an enjoyable job. I'd still be there if I hadn't gotten I'll and pointed out!"
good,I absolutely loved my job at Ascena. It was so layed back. I was able to be on my own and it was easy to get things done. They did everything they could to help you if you needed it. I loved the gym.
good,"Always clean factory,  needed help you got it. To quick to put on floor by yourself before making sure you have understood and learned everything including skills ect."
good,"There were a lot of perks when I worked there.  Exp:  Ascena provided a free carnival, trips to zoo and Cosi.  Christmas parties, bowling tournament's"
good,This job has been great I'm a truck gate attendant apart of AP and tbh I love it. My manager is kind and treats us as family. The pay rate is great associates get paid 15.50 starting or 14 I think.
good,"It was a great place to work. They promoted family and work life balance, offered many programs to support this balance. They encouraged self promotion."
good,Very friendly atmosphere. Good benefits and company always has activities for employees.
good,"The people were great, the job wasn't hard and the pay was good. HR people weren't the best, but you didn't have to deal with them that much. Certain team leads were awesome and some weren't. They wanted you to succeed in whatever job you were placed in. Cross training is a must and the turn over rate is insane."
good,"The work hours are long but only 3 to 4 days a week. The work is not quickly paced but not so fast that you can't easily keep up. I have worked in a few different areas and have enjoyed learning the differences in the areas. the Team leads and Managers are really good people. "
good,Great company overall. Upper management is great but not so much on the lower end. They like to promote within but it is a little harder for contractors to get hired on full time.
good,Loved working there . loved the people . the job was fast paced but easy. Breaks were fair . they provided meals on occasions. Love the regular 3 days on 4 days off .
good,"I enjoyed my time at Lowes. I find that the New Iberia location, at the time was very team oriented and everyone got along for the most part. As long as you did your job and believed in team building, you had no problem at Lowes. Yes, you do work hard, but with great team building and goals, challenging tasks could be easily achieved."
good,It's a great place to work and plenty of room for advancement but work long exhausting hours puts a toll on home life. Long hours sometimes and other times no hours
good,"Best experience ever, best boss that truly had my best interest in growing with the company.  Taught me everything I know about store facilities. I loved my job."
good,"My typical day consits of running proxy reports for employees within Maurice's and Justice stores.  I am in charge of entering expense reports for all Maurice's employees within the US and Canada.  I also process invoices for Maurices, handle rejected invoices, and audit expense reports on a weekly basis."
good,"Good employer, fallen on hard times. It is now selling assets and closing unprofitable brands. Oh, what more is there to say. Mahwah office is closing."

good,we always have a start up meeting where they tell you how much there is to do. I was in packing and it was really easy. the hardest part of they job is not having music to listen to. the most enjoyable was that you are to yourself and its easy.
good,"I was the receiving lead for second shift. I was one of the few who opened the building. We came along way. I loved my job even though it felt I didnt have a life I was able to get my own place and a new car. I worked many hours weekends and didnt mind one bit. Management when I was there was okay. Yes there was favoritism, and challenges between shifts but thats everywhere. Just do your job and you will be left alone. I would love to go back"

I had an experienced and wonderful store manager and upper management as well. I thoroughly enjoyed my time there and would recommend this company to anyone who wants a career in retail."
good,"Great place to work, awesome facility with onsite fitness center, cafeteria and free snacks.  Only drawback was the ""very casual"" dress code.  While I agree with a casual dress code for a distribution center, some of the employees take it to the max.  I find the following unprofessional and distracting:  spaghetti strap tops, ripped jeans, spandex leggings, short shorts and tank tops.  This is a place of work not the bar, club or street corner."

good,"very nice environment under very good management. "
good,"Ascena Retail was an easy going work place that wasn't too fast paced for a new employee, and you're able to talk to great employees of the retail world every day.
