rating,review
bad,"compensation here is horrible run far and fast, There is no room to move up within the company at all for the most part. There is no proper career plan in place, and often times people have to leave the company to get promotions."
bad,I worked there from 2011 to 2019 on a 12 on 3 off contract basis. They SILENTLY instituted a 3 contract limit April of this year and have started 3 month contracts.
bad,"Ti se invadeaza spatiul si viata personala in general atat de catre colegi cat si de catre management, te cauta pe toate platformele si te barfesc. Comportament neadecvat si lipsa motivatiei la munca. Salariu foarte prost cu sanse minime de promovare. Se face reclama la un mediu de lucru care in romania nu este implementat si au impresia ca ne incanta pozele cu biroul in sine cand defapt in multe dintre camerele respective nici nu ai acces. Munca unor leads era facuta de anumiti angajati iar majoritatea sedintelor erau facute in scop negativ unde te cam “amenintau” ca te dau afara, ceea ce este o mare prostie cand esti tanar si esti in cautare de experienta asa ceva nu are cum sa te deranjeze doar sa te amuze abordarea. Nu cred ca treburile se vor schimba prea curand in aceasta companie."
bad,"I worked at EA customer service. No part of the job was intended to help customers, we just try to get rid of them as soon as possible. Awful company."
bad,"people were rude and clicky. I would not recommend working there. it was a temp job. the site has a cafeteria people must pay for food, it's not free like others."
bad,Really just not very good.  No room to move up and poor choices on the part of management.  Really more of a glorified babysitter.
bad,"The discounts on EA games was the only thing worth this job."
bad,"Nu degeaba a fost votata “Worst company to work for” doi ani la rand, isi merita titlul pe deplin."
bad,"To specify, this is for the Baton Rouge Testing Facility."
bad,"two psychopathic managers in a row. this place fosters evil and rewards inertia. technically bankrupt, organizationally anti-human, fiscally precarious"
bad,"I felt the time there was slow. I learn how to take care of my computer when its having issues. Hardest part was the time on the phones. The company doesn't care if the issue is solved or not, as long as the job was done with in 14 minutes. They care for the custromer, as long as they don't lose money over it. You have o be really cold hearted at times."
bad,"Working at EA is a lie. I was hired as a contractor and wasn't actually given the benefits I signed up for, and the company that hired us out as contractors provided none of the benefits I was expecting from EA, which were necessary for my health needs. I was forced into a position that I specifically said I didn't want and was unable to move until the end of the project, and was frequently criticized by my manager for my personal skills."
bad,"EA is a game publishing company, not a game company. They don't make games anymore. During my year there, I was only taking key art and rearranging it for different promos. Would not consider working there again. Hard to tell what the vision is, what's going on, infinite email senders but only a few designers who do actual work. Typical corporation vibe and feel."
bad,"Great office, location, pay and perks.  But they need all of that to make up for the total and complete $hitshow the entire company is.  Everything is great until the moment your recruiter hands you off to the people you actually work with."
bad,"Terrible leadership, no transparency, no employee development. The culture is one of exclusivity and it is most important to be a part of the ""in"" crowd."
bad,"EA moved me from Chicago to Prince Edward Island to work at their Red Crow studio. 10 months later, I was told I was being laid off and not being relocated back to the States. Real professional, EA."
bad,Working here was great in the sense that the work itself was interesting and engaging but the pay is just way too low. Having to be forced to take a furlough because the company wants to avoid paying insurance and benefits to regular full time (RFT) employees so we work as contractors. Avoid if you're looking to advance quickly and aiming to make any sort of livable wages on.
bad,"Incompetent managers, constant restructuring, unprofessional directors, lack of organization.. Good vision, but their duty to the player failed long ago, and their duty to even their own employees has been failed as well."
bad,"You could very well join EA and have an experience that is completely positive. The company is so large that individual experience will vary wildly. In my case, the job was not a good fit, and I found several team members' conducts to be completely unprofessional, aggressive and rude."
bad,"Compensation is bad and benefits non-existent, but it was a very easy job with extremely low expectations. It's an entry-level job with an extremely low ceiling. Very little opportunity for advancement."
bad,The work was interesting but the continual crunch and poor product management made EA difficult to work at for long stretches of time.
bad,Hard place to work  You will work a lot of hours and ca be political.
bad,Worked for a IT team of a division which doesn't produce games.
bad,"It's not all fun and games working at a gaming company. A lot of us grew up playing EA games and that sense of nostalgia pulls hard when considering a role there. My advice is to think twice about what you are looking for and be truthful with yourself about if EA will help you get there."
bad,"I've heard things have improved since I worked at EA back in the early-to-mid 2000's.  But even with all of the perks and prestige of working on AAA titles for one of the best known game developers in the business, the time that I was there was the most exhausting, disheartening, and discouraging period of my professional career.  It left me extremely jaded and cynical, and had me questioning continuing on in video game development."
bad,"Low paying jobs with low chances of significant promotion. Can be ok to start here to get some experience but after a while many people leave for a better salary. In the past promotions were based on friendships not merit so your superior can happen to be mean, incompetent and treating you like dirt but he is friends with the manager so you better shut up. There are very busy periods but also less busy ones where there is a lot of playing."
bad,"You are expected to be on call 24/7. The company restructures every two years, so there is no job security. People that don’t deliver within the company are not held responsible and those that make up for their inadequacies pay the price. People with no management experience are left leading teams, creating a toxic environment where bullying is prevalent. And the company is so male heavy, it might as well be a fraternity house."
bad,Doesn’t care about employees whatsoever. All about bottom line and making money for the top 6 people in the company. Fired thousands of employees with no warning and is outsourcing jobs to India.
bad,The hours can be long and the work can be stressful and competitive as you are always trying to compete for most bugs found.  Your opinion in certain regards can fall on deaf hears as you are the low man on the totem pole in regards to the developers. You also are not afforded any time off hardly or benefits to take care of yourself.
bad,"My workday was mostly herding cats. Trying to get a dozen people with a dozen different agendas to get in the same room at the same time to get them to agree on something so I could move the project forward. Impossible."
bad,"Management never knew what to do, policies changed all the time, not about helping customers, hard to adapt to what they want from you. I felt miserable in the last few months there, as I couldn't get out of the role they put me in. I knew they were gonna get rid of PC/MAC tech support, and ultimately they fired all of us."
bad,People working there are bunch of egoistic people.people will pull you down to climb ladder. work will be easy. i don't recommend this company. play games.
bad,"EA Sports is a division of Electronic Arts that develops and publishes sports video games. Formerly a marketing gimmick of Electronic Arts, in which they tried to imitate real-life sports networks"
bad,One of 19 original technical support representatives to begin their Austin sector and withing severa months all of us were laid off one by one once they were fully up to speed and fully staffed.  A shame.
bad,"If you love video games, start here. You will work crazy hours and not-so crazy hours for little pay but you get to be immersed in the video gaming culture, process, development and ultimately rewarding experience of making something that can last a long, long time."
bad,"EA is a good company to join to introduce yourself to basic software development and project management elements, however the general environment does not foster progressive growth as an employee, requires excessive amounts of social and political maneuvering within the management structure, and historically falls below expectations for compensation at most lower-to-middle management levels."
bad,"I love EA but they still continue an expansion/contraction staffing model that punishes their developers, results in significant knowledge loss and inconsistent results."
bad,"there are layoffs almost every year, and management is really terrible."
bad,"- Give different people different guidelines in selecting leaders.  Not as inclusive nor equal as they are advertising.  "
bad,"imbalance of workload from department to department, cool company, fun surroundings, some really hard working people, tough to figure out who is who and what is ""right"" answer when there are many versions"
bad,"Ok place to work at, plenty of good perks.  Free games and lunch was always provided.  I traveled frequently across the country and learned about gaming."
bad,"If you love video games and need a place to get to possibly a supervisory position EA would suffice."
bad,"A day of work for me at Electronic Arts always started with arriving at the office and immediately starting to set up the software and hardware needed for today's tasks such as regression and bug finding."
bad,"Benefits are good but compensation was not competitive for my role. Managers often seem unaware of project status and take a lot of time off. Job security non-existent, they will replace you with someone cheaper at the first opportunity."
bad,What once was a fun workplace with advancement opportunities has changed over the years to a rather stale office with little advancement opportunity. Management changes regularly and will often totally reverse old policies without notice. You're paid at a flat rate with no raises no matter how many contracts you return for.
bad,"There is a disconnect between senior management and front line employees. There isn't clear direction from senior leadership. The people you talk to every day in your role are like family, but departments are very siloed. The pay is not comparable to the industry standard for the work you do, and work/life balance is nonexistent for most."
bad,"About 13 employees in the department, but with a true workload worthy of perhaps 7-8 (people), hence a 60% or so true workload."
bad,The company really doesn't put any real value in its employees.  The only raise outside of being hired on full-time is 50 cents after 1500 hours (not including over time).
bad,I played xbox and got paid for it... reported bugs and played more xbox. Very low on the totem pole with little room to advance
good,I worked through a third party employer doing customer service for EA's Legends remote customer service team. I have little experience with the actual culture or experience of working for Electronic Arts
good,"I worked the day shift from 7-4. Testers arrive before the ""Full Time"" EA employees and would start and end the day with shift reports, emails from the game developers as well as keeping track of testing times. Each tester was assigned a specific area to test and would have a checklist from Pre-Alpha, Alpha, Beta, and Final testing stages during the development process."
good,"Easy work for minimum wage, There is no room for advancement unless you are favored by superiors, and the only incentives to work harder are a position that has a strict head count to adhere by, you might have to compete with people on completely different projects to secure the position"
good,"Each studio at EA is different, but the corporate culture influences everything.  This means that ultimately you're pretty faceless, unless you're a big enough name to be a selling point for a game."
good,"Very fast paced, very process oriented production. Lots of great people to work with. Management can be too concerned about the bottom line."
good,We would get a game title and test it for bugs and see what it could add-on to make the game better.
good,"day at work is hardest."
good,"work can be managed well, learned how to meet the deadlines on/before time, time management,"
good,"When I started working there it was a great place, with a lot of room of advancement. Over the last few months, that has completely disappeared and management skills have plummeted."
good,Studio management has No empathy towards employee. High stress level but good work culture. The company policies are good but local management doesn't follow them.
good,"Everything dealing with promotion or higher job opportunity was always vague."
good,"Falta posibilidades de promoción, contratos de 2 semanas, horario de las 10 hasta las 19 rompe todo el día, bastante lejos desde el centro (1 hora en el metro)."
good,"The job was a 9 month contract that starts at minimum wage, with opportunity for $0.50 raises after starting your second contract employment.  Average work day consists of the same smoke test routines with the remaining parts of the day spent on testing bug fixes and finding bugs."
good,Its a fun place to start if your not expecting drastic growth in your process and salary. Good qork culture and people. Projects are amazing and you get to learn a lot. Studio teams are better at having benefits. Testers are hired on a contract basis and therefor provides them with no benefits.
good,"During my time at Electronic Arts I implemented multiple training programs and agent assistance training. I created and led multiple customer satisfaction improvement projects as well. While Electronic Arts is relatively new it the customer support industry, the lack of room for advancement was a hinderance."
good,"A very big team."
good,"Electronic Arts is a fantastic company to work for, if you are a full time employee.  The temp contracts that they use are generally full of false hope.  I had a great time working for this company, and met some awesome people, that will likely develop into life long friendships.  As mentioned above the worst part about working for them is the fact that you are on a contract for a year, and even though they give illusions of grandeur, it is mostly false hope.  At the end, none of the hard work that I put out mattered."
good,"This is an analyst job, lots of charts and graphs. Credit reviews are done 2x year and collections is done out of India. Lots of process issues that make for lots of manual double-checking and that slows everything down to a crawl. Better have a very thick skin if you plan on applying for this job."
good,"Most of the times there could be little to do in terms of task. People are generally pretty nice and time is flexible. I learned to what it is to work with different departments at once (programmers, testers, certification). The hardest part of the job is probably to get everyone together on the same page as some tasks require a lot of different people and devices."
good,"Ambiguous question, it always depend on your role and desire."
good,"As a contractor, there were not many benefits to being employed under EA. Working for PRO Unlimited, we were given a different set of standards than actual Electronic Arts employees. This included less pay, and less health benefits. The company itself was wonderful to work at. It helped employees build communication skills as well as learn many different things about quality assurance. "
good,"What I do on a typical day at work/have learned:"
good,"pay is low, job is fun. people are great, but a big business and treats people as such. A lot of work for a little pay and appreciation. Great work environment though"
good,EA is a fast paced company with people that really want to excel in the video game business. It's a great environment when things are going well.
good,The job was really good with a lot of chance to move up however staying employed is the hard part. If ea finds a way to out source what you do they will. 
good,"I never had one performace review and was under the impression i was doing very well and then one day i was just fired and not given reason, i have been unable to get my belongings from my desk and they still use my xbox gamer tag that i pay for for troubleshooting purposes at work. great while i was there, but they have a black mask firing policy, no ne sees it comming then you are gone. i worked there for over 8 months and then i got called when i got home one day and fired."
good,"Pros"
good,"This could be a great company to work for if they would re-balance their pay structure. Working there full time is not enough to even make it on your own, and with a 3 month layoff between contracts it leaves you in a bind every time."
good,Lack of decision making ability causes a lot of anxiety and fear within the organization. Poor mentorship and development plans for current employees and extreme lack of growth opportunities.
good,EA is a fun place to work but it is like perpetual collage finals.  You are either cramming for your finals or blowing off steam between finals.
good,"Pros	"
good,"I've almost always had fun while i was at work. Everyday we had a great time working and while doing so, we were quite faster than usual. Almost all projects with deadlines were delivered on time, sometimes even earlier. "
good,"Fun place to work and learn new technologies."
good,Quem nunca quis realizar o desejo de trabalhar com jogos ? otimo lugar para se começar a carreira e aprender como as coisas fora do pais funcionam e adquirir um conhecimento de varias novidades tecnologicas que ainda estão por vir.
good,"EA is a storied company with an incredible heritage. It's a privilege to work among folks who created The Sims, Madden and California Games. On the other hand EA is a massive corporation that attempts to productize game development to death. It's a creative process and that needs to be respected."
good,"The culture is fun, but annual raises are minimal and base pay for several positions is no longer competitive. It's difficult to advance - the culture around advancing in the company is a strange one, based on ""internal internships"" called ""secondments"". You perform in the job role that you hope to move into with no pay increase, and after 6 months, a year, a year and a half in some instances, you must still interview for the position against external candidates. Keep in mind, secondments can be terminated at any time, so if you've been in a secondment for a year and a half, your performance has been exceptional - still, no guarantee that you will be moved into that role."
good,"The culture at EA is very top heavy. Execs aren't attune to the every day experience for their employees. They make decisions for employees without understanding the intricacies. They speak a lot about change, with no actual change being made. Not a great culture for women either."
good,It was an alright company. only worked there for one contract term of 6 months or little less. Good environment with some decent people. not the greatest pay.
good,"Young, fun, fits well with the Austin culture. Opportunity for personal growth and development. Strong team collaboration and working on creating an inclusive work enviornment."
good,"it was alright.  I worked there only for a summer job while in school, but I wouldn't recommend it as a career job.  The team leads would shout at the team for not reaching their bug quota.  That wasn't fun."
good,its an ok place to work at. not really that exciting. could be better. i would not be opposed to working there again. it is good place to work at. a lot of good things there
good,"Un lucru care m-a surprins la E.A. este faptul ca, desi rasplatiti extrem de putin, in mod deosebit oamenii de la QA isi luau munca foarte in serios. Lucrul in echipa acolo era excelent, desi erau echipe de peste 60 de oameni, cu totii erau foarte uniti."
good,Work produced and impact always overridden by relationships. Very slow to respond to external changes or push through any much needed culture transformation.
good,I thought this was an amazing experience. I was given all the props of a great employee and really enjoyed it. Most people love it so this is not uncommon.
good,"Working in the mobile department has helped me understand mobile devices more deeply. It was a great part time job. It was a bit hard a t first since testing was always done on a different device, but you get used to it."
good,"open attitude, friendly management, open source, cutting edge technology, work life balance, this is a great place to work and grow."
good,This job was very enjoyable because of the working environment and the satisfaction gained while working on numerous projects.  I gained  knowledge about computers and multiple software that I can use in future jobs.  All of the employees were very friendly and motivated because of the common goal everyone shared which was to give the customer the best product possible.  The hardest part of the job was to learn the computer software.  The most enjoyable part was testing the video games.
good,"a leading global interactive entertainment software company - develops, publishes, and distributes interactive software worldwide for video game systems, personal computers, wireless devices and the Internet.  Wanted to leave this company for better prospects"
good,"The typical work day would start at 9 am and end at 6 pm. While people might thing that a job in the game industry might seem easy, it is in fact very stressful. The job involved doing the same task each day for weeks or months. At fist it might seem very hard, but as times goes on you get accustomed to it and the task no longer seem as tiring and repetitive. The job is very dependent on team work and making friends with everybody involved in the project. Since in order for the project to succeed everybody needs to work as one and communication is a must."
good,"•	Tested EA video games from Alpha test phase to finished product, assuring that the game was performing at optimal quality levels once testing was completed."
good,"Learned a lot of technical skills."
good,You're duty as a QA is to find any bugs within the software you're testng and then write a report to send to the developers.
good,"Work really had a balance between work hard and play fun. The Culture of EA really shines, as they reward their employees for hard work through fun times. The entire studio is basking with inspiration, surrounded by the video games and art of which cause us to be who we are. Really nothing but good things to say about this environment. However, the job security and salary distribution is very selective."
good,Interesting to say the least . So overwhelming and fun. Watching the developers build out games was awesome
good,Opent kontorlandskap med eit bredt spekter av kulturskilnadar. Profesjonelle kollegaer med ulik kulturell bakgrunn og språk.
good,"Nice staff, great company , very productive , its very nice to work in that kind of enviroment and good rules. The people are team members ans they have a strong bond at work."
good,The work environment is very stress free. The only down size it many people are really standoff for new worker that are trying to prove themselves. Management can sometime be like skills in locating high performance employees.
good,"Advancement can be difficult and there is also a question of job security; they have let go of large numbers of people, seemingly out of the blue. Upper management harps on building from the ground up, but still makes important decisions from the top down, causing friction between employees and teams."
good,Great casual environment and wonderful team. Contractor furlough system is a nightmare. Compensation is low. Not enough remote or other opportunities.
good,Learned about porting Unity to the unreleased 3DS. Worked on the huge Sims 3 franchise. Unfortunately the studio lost it's way and had to lay off almost the entire company.
good,"The money at EA was so unbelievably bad I just had to leave. I hated this job, who would have ever thought playing video games all day would turn out to be such a torture."
good,People are very nice to help you if you meet any questions. But the employee does not care about his/her staff too much. And there are not too many team activies.
good,"I honestly love the people that work here as they genuinely love what they do and they are definitely good at it. Very smart and innovative co-workers just makes for better team dynamic as it challenges yet motivates eachother to do better everyday. "
good,"Its an interesting place to work, fun atmosphere with a laid back culture.  A lot of work on a day to day basis but business partners are friendly and easy to work with.  I believe the company is headed in the right direction for future growth."
good,Fun environment. Great people. Poor pay if starting at the bottom. Great benefits. Bad hours.
good,"Working in the video game industry is demanding, but it can be very fulfilling. The company as a whole is great with great benefits, a fantastic culture, and great people. However, each team operates at a very individual level and seeing the company as one whole unit is a struggle. On the good days, we are praised, and on the bad days, leadership makes sure you know it; but again, this is team dependent."
good,"Leads are highly understanding of external work circumstances and will often allow employees to go outside of the already flexible schedule with enough advance notice.  While some of the work might be tedious, the relaxed and friendly atmosphere helps the time go by."
good,"Good low to mid-level management, but there is no loyalty within the company. You could be working there doing an excellent job for years, but if they can find a way to cut you out or outsouce your position to save some money in their budget, they will do it without hesitation. BE WARNED!!!"
good,"J'apprécie mon travail et je me suis donné à fond, relever le défi pour bien évoluer  dans le domaine de la comptabilité."
good,"Provides good work/life balance. Competitive salary and benefits. Provides employees with multiple concierge services on campus."
good,"Hard place to work - working lots of hours, taking call after call. Customers are not very nice over the phone."
good,"Muy buena cultura de empresa, pero el problema es la temporalidad."
good,"Electronic Arts was ok to work for.  Their HR department was very good at handling workplace issues, and having a structured schedule was good.  However, advancement was difficult, and management would sometimes take too long to handle issues."
good,"I went into this job knowing it wasn't going to be a permeant thing, but for what it was it paid really well (nine dollars an hour isn't ideal but it was fair for the ""labor"" you do) and the hours flew by. I really liked the management there, and the flow of the building."
good,Great place to work.  Great work environment.  Management has somewhat changed so leadership is being solidified and once it is I think the studio will be even better. Pay could be better.
good,EA offers a very flexable work schedule. the work environment is very fun and very diverse. They are also a very laid back company to work for. i love EA
good,"For beginners its a very good company for entering into mobile application testing arena. Though Pay is less for beginners, learning work should be satisfactory."
good,Job Duties:
good,"Working here has taught me many things. Some good, some bad. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. Management can be hit or miss, but that is similar to any other place of employment. The workplace culture and benefits were always great."
good,"The company is ok to work for but short contract lengths"
good,QA is an exellent job to start learning networking skills and the stages of development. Work as a team daily.
good,"While it was fun to work at EAC on good days, bad days consisted of mass layoffs, rushed designs and inadequate staffing."
good,"The work place and management was decent overall, there wasn't too much to complain about. The pay rate and contractual agreements were the only things I had a problem with, being you have to work for the contractor rather than the company."
good,"A normal day at work consists of providing the information needed of the products to perform well, taking care that the platforms are in working well and up to the tasks. In this position i have learned to use the programs like JIRA and DevTest, to have the patience required to run a simulation for as many times is seem needed to gain the result desired. "
good,It was a great place to work at... at first.  After a couple years the studio took itself too seriously and became super corporate.  Lots all of the enjoyment of working there. 
good,I personally loved my job. they did not pay us whatsoever what we deserved. 9 an hr when others were making 12 for less the work i was doing.
good,EA has a very relaxing working environment. Co-workers are fun to work with. This job require attention to detail to ensure the tasks are done correctly.
good,"1 year contract with no advancement. Was told 4 days before my contract ended it wouldn't be renewed. Management was/is harsh, no opportunities to advance."
good,"While working for EA, there were many times that I was moved from one project to the next.  There was never a feeling of belonging to a project since it never lasted more than a few months."
good,"I really enjoyed my time at EA. However, I could not support my family on minimum wage by working there. And advancing there is not as easy as the job description would lead you to believe. If I was still a student, or not supporting kids I would still be there. My star rating is what I will let speak for me concerning management. My experience with one manager is what keeps it from being a 2 star rating."
good,"Sadly, even with incredibly hard work, it is extremely hard to advance,"
good,"I thoroughly would recommend working for this company. They are very fair and loyal to their employees, however it is hard to land a full time long term position here."
good,"Hard to get recognized for achievements. Setbacks on the other hand are quickly pointed out and used against advancement. "
good,"The majority of the company is full of hard-working, smart and passionate people (mostly gamers) that have a strong desire to make EA a great place to work and to make great games to play. That said, the majority of stumblings from the company come from pressure to continue short-term revenue that EA has previously enjoyed, vs long-term marketplace position/strength. This doesn't impact day-to-day work for most, but does impact final products and strategic decision made for dev cycles."
good,Une expérience professionnelle qui m'a permis de développer mes compétences sociales
good,I spent 4 years at EA and for the most part I loved it. Each team has a different culture so be sure to ask about work life balance and team health within the unit you're considering joining. My business unit was a great place to be!
good,"Its goo to work with them and workplace is nice and friendly people."
good,"I had the pleasure of being an intern at Electronic Arts for a full year."
good,"Overall enjoyed the experience there. People were nice, nice campus. Learn about how the company is divided up into studios and departments. Overall a good company but a more conservative old school type of company."
good,"I've been here for 10 years for a reason.  It's a good place to work and has good benefits.  Salary could be better, and sometimes corporate mentality takes over for management decisions, forgetting that the employees are people, although the first leadership principle is to ""Be Human First""."
good,"work life balance is good"
good,"The app is 4.5 stars in both the iOS App Store and the Google Play Game Store and proves that my coworkers are an amazingly talented group of people who are dedicated, passionate, and good at what they do."
good,I spend two years working in EA. It is a great opportunity for me to work there. I learned a lot in that company. Although I did not play so many video games during my life. I heard a lot from my friends about how enjoy when they are playing video games. The company have great leadership and life work balance. I learned a lot from my co-workers who like to play video games.
good,"Technology road map due diligence"
good,Projects are challenging yet rewarding. Company has really turned a corner as a whole to better the experience for the employee as well as the consumer.
good,"Job responsibilities included product testing and evaluation for computer based gaming software, fault detection and isolation, and data collection and reporting."
good,Great employees making some of the biggest sports video games in the industry.  Tough hours.  Tough work environment.
good,"I have been with EA for 4 months, it was a great experience overall. I happened to be there when they have lost their CEO. We were without new CEO for several months. Thus it was a transitional time within the company."
good,"This job varied from tedium to fun. A typical day involved testing computer games for faults. Sometimes this was to written test sheet, sometimes we were given free reign to test how we would like. When faults were found they were entered into an online database called devtrack, which the developers used to fix them. After fixing we tested the fixes and updated the issue. I also did language testing and third party requirement testing."
good,"i was a playtest member at EA games which basically was a volunteer job."
good,Good employer to get experience in Project/People management
good,Nice working environment and lot of developmental activities are being carried out by the company which is really very nice.
good,Electronic Arts/PopCap Games was a rewarding place to work. I was really able to learn a lot about the video game industry during my two years here.
good,"The environment at EA is great - very fast paced and demanding, but extremely rewarding. "
good,"Team leaders are understanding and very caring about their team."
good,"Casual work atmosphere, Got to learn about all the major mobile platforms and mobile game development to be precise.Management is still emerging from loopholes and bias which was predominant in past years,Hardest part in EA is that you are never satisfied with what you get paid at the end of the day. Most enjoyable : Gaming, Mobiles, Casual work atmosphere "
good,Easily applied software development and project management experience in this industry.  Learned business development and general management as I brought to market a digital business for The Sims 3 franchise.
good,"Typical day at work: Spearheaded the EA 'Action' games portfolio in Europe launching two new products in FY13"
good,"Electronic Arts is full of talented and hard working people, but while they do their best to keep you out of the office more than necessary there will be times where you have to put in the extra time needed to make the best game possible."
good,The work culture here is really good. Provided with the cooperative teams and friendly work environment. Good place to start off with a first job in career.
good,My years at EA were spent in a fast paced and stressful enviroment. Management was fair and the benefits were decent. The digital world is limiting the people who have been in the company from the early days.
good,"A typical day at EA involves walking in, sitting down at your desk and checking emails for important information, being assigned a task and doing it until it is done, I learned how to work as a team to get quite daunting task done efficiently. The work culture there is very relax but does have its stressful moments."
good,"Overall, I had a good experience with this cool company. I was curious at first, but then I got caught in and I did learn my job pretty easy. I've also wrote a bug-finding manual, multiple techniques broken down.Games are fun, no doubt, but I'm older now. All my respect for game-testers!"
good,"Great place to work, good benefits great culture. work life balance can get out of proportion but the company has done a lot over the last 6 years to try and improve it. Studio stability in the mobile space is a concern."
good,A typical work day is go to work turn on your work computer and wait for build to be distributed to the team then start working. I learned how to use their bugging programs and I learned how to keep a eye out for problems in a game that can work in other work areas. The management that me and my team was in was not to bad. I liked my coworkers. The hardest part of the job is just trying to find bugs. I like the part where you play and test games
good,"Great company to work for."
good,"If you love video games or consumer electronics than Electronic Arts is the place for you. A very fun and focused work environment. EA is a relax and comfortable place to work. There are lots of amenities on the campus such as a gym, dry cleaning, weekly car washes etc. Lots of opportunity to grow as the company is transitioning many of its titles for the online platform."
good,"Aprendí comunicar con todos los géneros de clientes, que sea impacientes o enojados hasta los clientes pacientes o felices. Al final de los 6 meses, me quede con la capacidad de controlar la conversación y hacer con que los clientes se queden siempre satisfechos con el servicio."
good,In a typical day you will talk to a lot of people and make a lot of connections.  I learned how to effective plan and execute events.  Management was very good.  Made the internship program fun.  Co-workers made the job easier with sharing ideas.  The hardest part of the job was reaching out to every part of the campus.  The most enjoyable part of the job was people's reactions after they won prizes.
good,Nice working environment and lot of developmental activities are being carried out by the company which is really very nice.
good,"Long, but rewarding work days"
good,EA is a very cool place to work. You work hard and play hard.It is full of great people.
good,"The work was not quite what you would expect if you were never a game tester or in the industry yourself. Lots of building test cases, running test programs, and repetition of the same little section of a game, not actually playing it. But the office life was enjoyable and relaxed, Nerf seemed to be a sponsor of the building from the number of Nerf weapons that abounded in that place..."
good,"Pretty good working conditions, good place to learn and have fun while working."
good,A typical work day was receiving phone calls about customers and their video games glitching or unable to register their Xbox Live Account or their Playstation ID to their EA ID or Origin ID. My co-workers were really helpful when they weren't busy with a call they were more than happy to assist me with whatever questions I had whenever I first started the job. The hardest part of the job was the constant changes in policy.
good,work independently....I learn how to put up ceiling fans...put in plugs..etc….never around management...hardest thing is cleanin up...enjoyable going on top of the room
good,"Working at the Burnaby campus came with a lot of perks. Employees were able to bring dogs to work. Access to really nice gym, very convenient. It’s fast paced and a good place to learn and grow."
good,"Job culture is fun, with lots of engagement and Employee Resource Groups available."
good,"The best part about working for Electronic Arts was that every day presented something new, interesting and usually challenging - boredom was rarely an issue! The organisational culture was something to treasure; open and unheirarchical, a junior analyst could chat with a senior director and it wouldn't be uncommon. Unfortunately, where I felt a little let down was in the organisational structure of the Customer Service Organisation, or more specifically the lack thereof. "
good,"I spent 2 months as a localisation tester at the Madrid office testing a triple A game. It was an amazing experience, the working environment was really friendly, the parties were great and I also learned a lot since the quality standards of the products are very high."
good,"Over several years at EA I had some pretty amazing experiences. I was able to explore many paths and roles with quite a bit of support. As with any corporation, making any types of large scale changes is difficult and slow, but possible with the proper support. "
good,"Working for such a large company, there is obviously lots of opportunity. The hours are long, however, since there are strict deadlines, and constant pressure improve reviews."
good,"I absolutely loved working here. The people were amazing, the office was nice, and the growth potential is endless. Lots of interesting challenges, and useful training is available."
good,"J'ai bien aimé travailler à EA à Madrid, connecté de près au monde des jeux vidéo et dans un environnement international plutôt relaxé. Le côté négatif était un salaire assez modeste et le fait qu'on n'avait pas assez des possibilités d'évoluer sur une base de contrats temporels toujours renouvelés."
good,"While I knew I couldn't work there for much longer than the summer because I am a full time student at LSU, it was a great experience working with colleagues to work hard and figure out the bugs in the builds. I learned how to manage my time, where to look for bugs, how to use TestRail and JIRA, tracking in X-Code, and communicating with my team and the developers."
good,"in het begin een uitdaging, veel zelf moeten doen, alleen remote management, de site gebouwd door veel zelf te moeten ontwerpen ,bouwen en programmeren door zeer regelmatig wisselen van management en directie een wisselend beleid en ideeën over wat er wordt verwacht. Het was een  leuke baan waar ik veel energie in heb gestoken, zoek ik nu een uitdaging in een organisatie ,"
good,In electronic arts it was difficult to work as a customer service specialist. The work life balance is difficult to get use to as there is no steady rotation in the office.
good,"A typical day at Electronic Arts consisted of my supervisors giving me the software and electronics needed to preform my test cases and then i was to report the results directly to them before entering the information into our international database so other development testers in labs around the world were able to learn what the information entered. "
good,"A typical day at work represented me going on the testing floor and searching for errors in games (bugs) which was difficult at times since I have started working there near the end of many games but it was not impossible for a person with a long history of gaming such as myself. I have learned many things at this company including discipline, listening, team-leading , punctuality and more."
good,"trabaje agusto durante 4 años"
good,"Working at Electronic Arts was a fun environment with a fun team that worked well together. There were a lot of fun perks such as Breakfast Fridays or a lot of Parties. The hardest part of the job was the stress of it, over-time was expected, there was less respect for the QA members from development, deadlines were always stressful and often had to work until 3-4AM. The other difficult thing about working there is you never have job security, even when you become a regular full-time employee there is still the fear that your project can be canceled and you will get laid off. The most enjoyable part of the job was being able to create something viewed worldwide and work in such a laid-back fun environment."
good,"The Salt Lake office has a good feel to it.  A work week is typically 40-50 hours. As a designer you spend about 50% of your time filtering and transcripting design input from everyone in management positions above you."
good,"Working at a gaming company is great and being part of gaming production is a great work experience. At WW Customer Experience, the senior leadership is lacking in communication and overall strategy to its staff. Decisions are made that affect the direction of staff and fiscal goals and make work challenging as employees are constantly reprioritizing deliverables without clear sight of how jobs are benefiting leadership direction. Ability to get free games is a definite bonus."
good,"Friendly team and management, large building suited for all types of lifestyles, and great perks and benefits. I've learned a lot from EA, things that schools just can't teach you. My co-workers are helpful and nice, management listens to you and care for your personal life as well. Although, there are hard times. I have to do over-time quite frequently and many times, there are extremely tight deadlines. But work does provide many things that definitely make up for that. Such as: discount movie passes, a gym and etc."
good,"An excellent place to work and develop your skills. You get the chance to work with so many people across the world for example Russia, Romania, India, Brazil, Canada etc."
good,"After 12.5 years working at EA, I can honestly say I have enjoyed my work experience here.  I know there are many rumors out there about a total lack of work/life balance at EA.  I have never found that to be the case at all.  There are crunch times as in any company, but the rumors in my opinion are greatly exaggerated.  The Redwood City campus includes day care, a well appointed, fully staffed fitness center, coffee bar, 2 cafeterias, bocce ball court, and video and arcade games throughout the campus."
good,Working at EA was very educational on the gaming side of the industry.  The marketing partners are very strategic and I enjoyed my time with the company.
good,"EA's commitment to a great employee and customer experience is evident in everything they do. "
good,"EA is a great place to work especially when you're just starting out.  It's not the most creative game company, but it always pushes for the best quality in everything it makes. Good work life balance, management is a bit stiff.  Hardest part of the job is dealing with sometimes slow decision making. Most enjoyable part of the job is the people you get to work with."
good,"I worked at EABR for a few years and enjoyed my time there for the most part. The day to day is coming in, following a set of procedures to see if a certain project's build is having any issues(bugs) and reporting them. You learn to navigate problem solving databases, there is a very nice work environment that allows for a good balance between work and play, and the management is not too bad. The hardest part of the job is running tasks over and over, eventually you get tired of testing, but that's the job. It's work. The most enjoyable part is being a part of the operations - whether you're reporting to developers or making the game itself, you are still participating in the development of a project."
good,"I worked in a small EA office outside the US, therefore my experience cannot be used to judge life in American campuses. It was more akin to working at a small startup (about 30 employees). Culture is relaxed and fun, felt a lot like working with college friends. The pay is usually atrocious, but they can get away with it because there will always be people wanting to work with video-games. I left because, at the time, the video games market was very small in my country and I had to become more resilient to market changes. My advice: it's easy to get stuck on the idea of working on video-games. Be a grown-up, educate yourself and treat video-games as just one of the types of software you can work with. You'll do fine at EA and elsewhere and they won't be able to game you on your dreams."
good,"The entry jobs are not very demanding when it comes to knowledge, which can be frustrating and boring at times, but you have to be a disciplined ""corporate"" type to thrive here. You have to put up with very repetitive work. If you're not good at networking, you will stay in your (entry) position for a very long time, as your abilities beyond what is necessary for everyday work are completely irrelevant. Also there are so-called ""blackouts"" for vacation and the company has little regard to whether you have a family or not, so it's best suited for singles without attachments. I wouldn't say it's a bad company, because I had a nice time there, but you have to be a certain type of person to be happy with the jobs they offer."
good,"Very fast paced environment and stressful but the people are amazing. I spend over 15 Years here and loved working at EA. I recommend working there anytime, would love to go back."
good,"Productive,good place to learn more it good place to explore our skills, good working hours,more over its giving good benefits to employees"
good,Demanding at times but there were many break areas. Fine work environment with state of the art computers. Very strict regarding the security.
good,fun place to work. good vendor relations. good employee relationships. productive work environment. good events for employees and families.
good,Nice place to work but not good for a fresher to start up working with EA
good,"I spent many years with EA and enjoyed the experience of working on AAA video games immensely. Through 11 years of ups and downs in the market, EA always took care of their employees for the extra hours we were willing to work during crunch-time. I wore many hats in my years there from Designer, Lead Designer, and Producer and I can say it was fantastic to be able to see the world, do numerous TV and Web interviews whie representing my team and the games we were developing. I believe my experience working for such a large corporation for so many years can compliment any project that comes my way."
good,"I frankly loved and miss this job. I have never in my life worked with such an amazing group of intelligent, hard working, incredible people. Sadly, the communication and management structure is the biggest shortcoming. The phrase ""the right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing"" is very applicable."
good,"What a great, fun place to work! Work on games with a great team. EA understands personal life is more important than work and this creates happy employees that want to work hard. no problems with 5-10 minutes late on occasion. Learned a lot about development of video games and QA. CONTRACT positions is a bummer, but that is the nature of the game industry. I took a pay cut to work at EA and it was the best Job I have ever had. Ping pong table in the break room, free coffee."
good,Work environment is good. Co workers are supportive and also help in learning curve. The management has a normal influence but overall it is a good productive place to work
good,I find EA to be a great place to work.
good,"fast paced environment, fun culture, great people"
good,"Games have always been a fascinating part of my childhood. My interest in 8-bit games slowly grew into an insatiable hunger for challenges and lead me to the world of Player Automation. In EA, I was charged with the responsibility of mimicking real-time player behavior  using simple bots and scale them upwards. The slogan ""Anticipate the player"", became etched in my mind, which led to countless hours of brainstorming , player feedback and incremental coding. It was a fast-paced, unforgiving and yet enjoyable experience. Flexible work hours and fancy game rooms provide respite when needed."
good,"It was nice working with the team, the management was good and supportive. "
good,The company is a leader in the gaming industry and changing the way we interact with video games. The company is driven to produce results and provides a substantial compensation package.
good,"I enjoyed being a tester for a big gaming company, I learned to take my job a step further and tackle problems in a much different ways to find glitches. Hardest part of the job is finding new things and ways to find problems. Most enjoyable part of the job is me playing in the comfort of my home playing a video game for a company I grew up with."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job is seeing and playing all of the new games that EA develops. The one team culture enables teams to work across typical silos or boundaries.
good,"Casual, laid back work environment of like minded individuals. This opportunity provided many opportunities to learn about the games industry both on the business and development side."
good,"First and foremost, I can honestly say that I truly loved my job at Electronic Arts. There are many great people, the environment is welcoming and inclusive, and benefits such as paid time off and health insurance are among the best in the industry. As a large company, it can be difficult to stand out, and even if you excel at your job it is always possible for budget cuts or other pitfalls to hamper your progress. Even so, I have no regrets about my time there."
good,"Working here is really nice. No formals and people are generous in general. Work is done in an organized and professional way and there is time for fun too. A bit of language problem because of the high number of locals but overall, a great experience and a lot to learn."
good,"My work is to test the mobile builds manually. We use tools like JIRA and DEVTRACK for reporting bugs. I am having the knowledge of writing test cases and test scenarios. I am having the platform knowledge of iOS, Android and Kindle. I have also worked on MYSql. Right now my work is to test the builds which are live in market."
good,"Good work life balance. Lots of perks, like free games and end of year week long leave. Good benefits. Exposure to a variety of roles."
good,I can honestly say that working at Electronic Arts was most definitely the best job I have ever had. The work at times was long and hard and the overtime would make you want to pull your hair out but the people I got to work with and the work I got to do was so great. Despite what everyone on the internet think Electronic Arts is a great company and they are great to work for. They take care of the employees they have and the work environment is great.
good,Management is strong and enjoyable to work with.  They have a strong partnership with one another.
good,This job was great and i loved every minute of it. I got to work in an industry i'm good at for a company that I was a huge fan of.  The only down sides were management didn't always seem competent and there was a no real advancement beyond my position.
good,Working as a Quality Assurance Tester is an outstanding entry-level experience for those with interests in software development. This is especially true for those that are interested in the video game industry. I had a great time working with several teams ensuring the quality of various video games and software features. You really get an introduction to working within a corporation while enjoying all the perks of being able to take a first look at some of the up and coming new games within the industry. The work is done in a very professional manner while working closely with the developers and managers ensuring everyone is on the same page with the intricacies of how the game should work. A typical day at work would involve being updated by your project lead on any changes to the software's design along with various assigned tasks to be completed while working closely with your team. When these tasks are completed you may have time to really get into the game or software while paying close attention to any problems that may have a negative impact on the end user. The pay is pretty low but typical for the entry-level video game industry.
good,"The day consists of doing tasks to make sure functions in the Apex Legends game are working, adhoc and writing bugs, 3-hour playtest where you play the game as it's intended, and retesting bugs (specific night shifters only). When performing tasks, you will need to talk to other testers and ask for their help (eg verifying something looks ok in third person). By talk, I mean you use a chatting service called Slack. Sometimes the other person isn't paying attention, so you have to tell them in person."
good,Overall a good company to be such a giant! The most enjoyable part is that your working on video games with great people. The worst was how corporate they have become you loose the great development feel.
good,"During my time at Electronic Arts, I happened to enjoy myself. The people were great to be around, and there was a lot less drama than one would expect at a place that requires Quality Assurance testing. I worked with some amazing people, and the things I learned from there, like how to pay even closer attention to detail, will really pay off for me in the future."
good,"Its fun if you're on staff, sucks if you are a contractor.  The corporate culture is great.  However if you are a contractor, they keep dangling conversion in front of you but never grant it."
good,Best video game company to work for.  Hard work but generous PTO to help you recharge.  People I worked with were great.  Excellent benefits.  Fun projects.
good,"While EA's culture and policies can vary from team to team, within my organization, there is a very limited amount of hand-holding or overhead rules; you are mostly free to accomplish your tasks as you see fit, which is rare in large companies. This also means you need to be extremely self-motivated and organized without relying on others for inputs or guidance. You can also work from home pretty much as much as you want."
good,"Some of the most amazing thinkers in the gaming industry come from EA. They build on past performance, encourage employees to be their best and support the growth of the team."
good,"For a first experience as a professional artist, EA Mobile was a great experience. Located in the heart of downtown Montreal, EA mobile used to be thriving with multiple mobile game project team, creative talents, great producers and managers. Unfortunately, for reasons no one could control, the studio was shut down a few years ago.  The great news is that EA is now back in Montreal, on Stanley street."
good,"The job is easy, most people are nice and the culture around the office is quite good. Don´t expect fast or any career development, be ready to spend years in an entry level position."
good,"Good environment, friendly co-workers, most time don't have to work overtime . Salary and insurance is good conpare to Chinese local companies and the management is nice"
good,"I enjoyed everything about working at Electronic Arts. It was an added bonus to be able to play video games as part of my Job. The culture promoted creativity, fun and an overall fantastic atmosphere."
good,EA can be a great workplace if you are proactive and need little guidance from leadership. They have great benefits and a great campus with state of the art facilities.
good,Electronic Arts is a great place to work. It is a fun and exciting place with great management. Great place to build a career that will last for ever.
good,Fast-paced environment. Flat organization. Entrepreneurial. Tenured team. Expertise in industry. Market leader. Respected by clients.
good,"Busy,never a dull moment, Fast Paced, Co-Workers are great, Typical day at work is repairing, fabricating and enjoying the company"
good,"In all my years of being with EA, I'm still with EA because it really understands the importance of its team members.  We treat each other with respect and the attitude is always professional and we foster working as a team.  "
good,"Playing sets of the video game for 4 hours, running through ""metrics"" to test for game stability. Learned valuable lessons in teamwork. Management was great, lots of time speaking to project leads and developers. Co-workers were all friendly and fun people to talk to. After being off work for months, I still talk to many of them. Hardest part of the job was getting used to the lingo used and the Devtracker program. The most enjoyable part was it felt like, for the most part, that you were just playing games with your buddies for a few hours everyday."
good,Fund culture with great people to work with.  Management are supportive and understanding.  There are definitely room for growth within the company.
good,"I'd start my day receiving a device (cell phone, tablet etc.) with a specific application to test. Once the app has been played through, we were required to complete checklists making sure they were fit to be released to the public. The atmosphere was nice and quiet, and my coworkers were also very helpful. We worked at our own paces, and we were able to do some internet browsing in between tasks and on our breaks. Sadly the department closed down due to a lot bad decision making made by EA."
good,"Great place to work, amazing amenities (gym, pilates/yoga classes, cafeteria, arcades on-campus).  Some of my best mentors are from EA, they have great managers and leaders there.  Every year the franchised product needs to get out the door, so there is no room for ""time wasting"" which taught be a lot about failing fast and recovering quickly. Making mistakes was encouraged as long as they were learned from.  Amazing coworkers and team camaraderie and team building activities to ensure people were ""gelling"" throughout the project lifecycle.  Work/life balanced has improved incredibly at EA, they're not given enough credit for this."
good,If you looking to work for a good video game company then EA Sports is the place to work
good,"I worked for EA at 3 different locations during my 10 years with the company. I worked with some very passionate and talented individuals. "
good,"I have had a great experience so far at Electronic Arts. I was offered a contract position after my internship in June 2012 where I was put on a transitional program where I spent 3 months in Store Operations, 3 months in the Merchandising department and 3+ months in Marketing for Origin - EA's digital platform service. "
good,"Productive workplace with a range of tasks"
good,Very good place to work with a strong game culture behind it.
good,"shuttle bus from downtown San Francisco(fantastic!), good benefit, good people there."
good,Had a great time at EA. Nice workplace with multicultural environment.
good,Very exciting and challenging place to work. Excellent global IT team and business team.
good,"Based on the heart of Guildford, EA (Electronic Arts Ltd) is a pleasure to work for with its relaxed environment, plenty of social events (including board games night, summer & Christmas party and generally a nice creative vibe)."
good,"I earnestly can say that the people I've met there are wonderful, friendly, and great to work with, but management took a plunge after a while, and project direction was never really set in stone. Communication between the team was limited to just direct messaging other employees to figure out what was going on most of the time. This was my experience with day shift, and it seems like night shift was better off with more management-tester communication."
good,"This was my dream job. But the late nights and long hours, and the three different positions I held simultaneously became to stressful to manage. Ending in mass layoffs when the company pulled out of their contract with AOL"
good,"EA is a great place to work.  Their benefits are stellar (401k, employee stock purchase program).  Also, the compensation is fair, but a bit lower than other companies in the same business (i.e. Apple).  The campus is fantastic and includes massage rooms, a gym, an on-site cafe and much more.  Leadership is positive and driven."
good,"Responsabilitati: "
good,It is a great time to work here and the managment is willing to work with you and your schedule and it's easy to manage a life here and be happy with yourself.
good,"At the beginning when I realized this wasn't mostly Game Testing, it became disappointing, then I learned QA is actually a bit more fun. The Managers and work culture is progressive. Everyone is very understanding."
good,"As a whole, I was very happy with my experience at EA. Managers work with you as best as they can, and there are plenty of perks. I do feel some things should be revised, but I do understand that at the core of it all, they do have a business to run. I would highly recommend this company and position to a friend."
good,"Great people, always challenging the status quo, supportive of growth.  The video games industry is fun and always-exciting.  Lot's of room for growth."
good,Excellent work environment. Engineers work hard to solve difficult problems while maintaining the quality of the products. Work hours are flexible. Most teams operate with an agile mindset and iterative lifecycle.
good,"Muy buenos horarios, empresa muy juvenil, un trato entre compañeros estupendo, trabajaba como editor de video que me encanta, multicultural...etc"
good,EA is a fun place to work of course there is stressful times but for the most part employees like to have fun and work hard. The management team really cares about their people and try hard to make sure that people are enjoying work.
good,Work hard play hard. A great mantra for EA. Management is some of the best in the industry. Great group of diversity and talents. Long hours but the reward is seeing our creations take shape.
good,"You come in and your day is what you make it! You can either treat this as a job, or a professional career. "
good,"There were multiple shifts to make hours very flexible, and there were strict behavioral guidelines to keep the workplace peaceful and kind, there were great accommodations, sizesble breakroom, vending machines, free coffee/tea, ice maker. Toaster, dishwasher, microwave."
good,"Great company, great people. It can get super intense when release cycle happens.  My direct manager is super nice and good to us. However, big company problem.  The higher up management need to know what they are doing."
good,"I enjoyed working at EA for a long period of time, from the hardest to the brightest of the company. It's fun and professional working environment. The benefit package is awesome. It's a great company to work for."
good,"There was a team, consisted from 40 people, and all of them was different. But because of working style it was not a problem to perform like a great team"
good,"This was a fun place for me to work taking inbound chat and phone calls from fellow gamers. There was a policy in place for every single thing however so sometimes it got a bit tricky but you always had a chat room available to ask any questions you had and management or tenured reps would answer within seconds or minutes."
good,As far i know a guy working at EA will never like to quit the organisation....
good,"Au cours d'une année aussi intéressante qu'enrichissante passée chez Electronic Arts en tant qu'assistant Marketing EA SPORTS, j’ai eu la chance de pouvoir mener plusieurs projets de front ce qui m’a"
good,Had the best work/life balance at EA. Good healthcare and perks. Great people and team spirits all year long! Love the cafe and the daycare onsite.
good,Gaming industry itself is a chill industry. Working in a gaming industry doesn't feel like working in a typical IT company. EA ha s a great workspace...stressfree...24/7 chill work environment.
good,"Great work environment with happy, energetic people. Also very cool up to date offices, it is a game development studio so theres all kinds of gaming software surrounding you. Management is solid and the pay is decent enough. Nice little office job if you're looking for full time contract work. Contracts are annual and you have the ability to renew them, which many people do."
good,"Learned valuable skills used for bug detection in games/mobile apps in a fun, relaxed work environment. Friendly and informative co-works and team leads allow for expedited learning where applicable."
good,"I've been with EA for 5 months and it feels like I've been there a lifetime. The environment is amazing. We're all a big family who helpand support eachother in every way. Our lead is almost a father figure and we work efficiently while still having fun and enjoying our time at work. I've learned a lot and as long as you are willing to speak up for it, advancement is easy. I highly recommend EA if you are looking to break into the industry!"
good,"Values are more than a list of soft, fluffy words. EA values permeate throughout all layers of the organization, from the CEO to the newest graduate intern. They are the bonds which unite EA together in creating the world's greatest interactive entertainment."
good,"game testing sounds like fun until you're testing candy crush or hidden object games for 40 hours a week.  You do get an employee discount but that doesnt necessarily make 9$/hr a living wage, particularly within Baton Rouge."
good,I worked for EA for a little over a year and a half. The work itself was usually rewarding and interesting. The culture is shifting though and many roles on the retail level are being phased out making g advancement difficult
good,aprendi muito fiz amigos e fopi muito divertido recomendo
good,"EA Canada is a massive studio, but the people I have meet are great and the Artists are very talented. I enjoyed my time there and I would recommend it to anyone who is thinking about applying. Overtime seemed to be optional."
good,Great place to work. The workplace culture is very welcoming and relaxed. There is a great sense of teamwork and collaboration at EA. It is great to work alongside people who are passionate about what they do.
good,I had a really nice time and knowing a lot of young people in this company. They are all students in IT or Mathematics. All of them are looking to grow up into the company!
good,"At Electronic Arts, you get to work on creating games. At Electronic arts, you get to work on both existing and upcoming projects. Sometimes, you get to play games."
good,"Electronic arts was by far the best place i have worked the management was amazing my co workers were friendly, It helped teach me how to work well with others as part of a team."
good,"Few places come close to the atmosphere present at Electronic Arts. Everywhere you look, you are constantly reminded where you work and why."
good,"This is not a job where you go in and play video games all day.  that is not your job!  Your job is to do things over and over again trying different things to try and make the game do something unexpected. If its to cause a crash, a soft lock, or a graphical glitch."
good,"The typical day would include me arriving at 15 minutes before a scheduled time to sign in with the front desk, then going on to participate in surveys as well as play new content and give feedback which may help game developers."
good,"The work day at EA starts by reading all tasks that you may be required to manage. You learn to use 'bug' tracking data base tools and track all issues that may arise in the development process. Training is provided so that you can rapidly spot any defects the software might have and report it. Management is very strict and expects a great deal from every employee, by using a merit based reward system. All teams that participate in a project, have strong knowledge about every aspect of software capabilities at all times. "
good,Excellent work environment and good people generally. There is quite a lot of management though not a lot of micromanaging. Typical Scrum style.
good,A lot of dedication to quality and providing the best product for the end user.
good,"Worked on Crysis, Medal of honor: Airborne, Mercanaries 2, Boom Blox, C&C 3 and expansion. Tested these games for many of hours, and led a specialized small team for PC hardware testing configurations."
good,A typical day at work involved nine hours of intensive quality assurance work related assignments.
good,EA is great company to working with. I got changing and innovative work environment in EA as developer. Learn lots of new technology and working with all kind of people.  
good,"Learned to manage time and learned how to pay attention. The main goal was to make sure that games were published free of errors. Learned to be flexible as game play included PCs, and all types of handheld devices. Learned to remain focused in an environment with many people and lots of activity. The hardest part of the job was staying focused on playing the game and finding errors in the company of lot of people, noise and potential distractions. The most enjoyable part was experimenting with new games and devices and assisting to identify problems and errors."
good,As part of the QA department I spend most of the day testing pre-release software and researching database for bugs.
good,good pay
good,"Great place to learn, and be trained. The management team is top notch. "
good,"This job could be really fun if you are really into video games as I am. The positives are that you get to work in a very fun environment, with a stable schedule, and good pay."
good,"I love working at EA. Everything about the culture and people here create a great work environment. I've always been a fan of our games, so working here was a dream come true!"
good,The company moves very fast so you need to be okay with change and lot's of different ;challenges.  The people are amazing to work with and talented. Always fun but intense at the same time.  It's truly a relationship focused company.  I would recommend to anyone looking for a fun challenging environment to work in.
good,I had heard a lot of mixed reviews going into EA about how hard they treat their employees and how demanding the work would be. After about a week I was surprised at how off those horror stories were. Everyone I worked with was really supportive and had good general sense of humor. Its gotten to the point where myself and a couple other artists started a sculpt club every Wed night. Yeah contract work is always rough because there will never be a guaranteed job at the end but after being out near LA and trying to hunt for freelance this was a nice change of pace.
good,"Mi trabajo en EA consistía en comprobar la localización de un videojuego ya traducido al español. Para ello, había que ir probando las diferentes demos del juego y escribiendo informes con los errores detectados. El ambiente de trabajo era insuperable, con gente joven de diferentes países, aportando multiculturalidad y buen rollo a la empresa. Sin embargo, el trabajo en sí era demasiado monótono y en muchas ocasiones, por problemas técnicos, no había nada que hacer, con lo cual el tiempo real del trabajo era mínimo y tener que estar en la empresa sin hacer nada durante el horario de trabajo (de 10 a 7) era muy frustrante."
good,"a typical day is fast paced."
good,I loved working at Electronic Arts and wished that I was not part of reduction in force.  Preformed and HR work.
good,1)EA gives lot of opportunities to learn and Grow..
good,"EALA was one of my favorite places to work, if not my favorite, ever! I worked alongside a fun and friendly group of people, many of which I still keep in touch with, even though I haven't worked for the company in 5 years. I was lucky to work on several excellent games and learned so much about the development process while I was there."
good,"Big company with so much potential that is realized through large, well organized teams committed to making the best games they can."
good,Working in Electrnoic Arts is great Experience - We can learn End to End activites
good,"They say that if you can get on as a Regular Fulltime Employee -- fantastic! The employee health benefits and perks are great. However, landing a RFT job isn't easy. Mine was a TFT job and it came with all the bells and whistles -- access to everything I needed to get my job done. Cool tech, cool toys. Cool people."
good,"Great place to work! Wonderful culture, management clearly cares for their employees and players. Scheduling can be a bit of a hassle if you are set on a M-F 9 to 5."
good,"Electronic Arts Madrid est une boîte formidable où on a plaisir à venir travailler. En lui même, le job de testeur LT est agréable et les conditions de travail le sont également, mais là où l'entreprise brille c'est pas le choix de ses managers, toujours à l'écoute très pros et surtout très sympathiques. Ca a été un plaisir de travailler avec eux tous mais malheureusement il est difficile de renouveler l'expérience car l'entreprise distribue les CDI (ou les renouvellements de contrat) au compte gouttes. Dommage."
good,"A nnew challlenge everyday, It was very hhelpfl for me to learn new things in my relevvent field. Different projects and different strategies, each project gives a new learning experience. The role involves a lot of interaction with people, the locals as well as international employees of the company"
good,"Get to work, continue on previous product or began on a new device. Everything I tested gave me more knowledge on device or new product that was coming out. We were always pushed to recreate as well as make Electronic Arts the top selling."
good,"Our creative work environment rewards new and different ideas. It's an environment that attracts brilliant talent from around the globe. No matter which of our studio locations you are located at, you'll feel the energy and support of EA's global brand, while thriving on our world-class campuses. At EA, the excitement you feel throughout each workday is made possible by a culture that inspires you to do the best work of your career."
good,The most enjoyable part is the work atmosphere where you get to interact with your co-workers as a co-operative team and achieve the task.
good,"Great perks, awesome location, great people."
good,"It was always nice to wake and want to go to work, I loved my job. I learned so much much about PC technical support and customer relations and support. The management was okay but there was always something we were not being told or there was always some form of miscommunication that would greatly affect workflow for many other agents including myself. I loved all of my co workers, they were all extremely supportive, hard working, attention to detail, game loving individuals. I could not have asked for a better team in my entire professional career. Also, the most enjoyable part would of course have to be all the free games, that is always a plus for any real gamer."
good,Awesome place to work.  lots of great people who work hard.  I have worked for several big companies and enjoy the culture here the best.  Laid back and let's us just work instead of worrying about small stuff.  Benefits are great
good,Quality assurance testing is where the bugs for the software being pushed out into the app store are found and quashed out before the user receives the final product.
good,"Working at Electronic Arts has been a highlight of my career. The people are fantastic, fun and highly intelligent. The company itself is worthy of respect for the sheer entertainment value it has brought to the world."
good,I worked as a office assistant and help with anything my supervisor needed and did data entry.
good,"A typical day involves building the files, playing the game, and checking ofn task performance.  The culture was great as their is a game/break room and its very collaborative.  The hardest part of the job for me was sometimes the equipment didn't work or headsets were missing.  Also, it was difficult to find other testers to collaborate with. I enjoyed working with other creative individuals who were animation experts or game fans."
good,"Worked at EA under a yearly contract and was very pleased. Prior to working here, I heard a lot of negative things about the company, but none of that was present on the team I was on. I can't say the same about every team though and there are a ton of them. The team I was surrounded with was amazingly helpful. Hours were okay for the most part, there were moments were the team had to kick it into another gear and work more than expected (varies team to team though)."
good,"Phone, email, and chat supported environment to help players back to enjoying their games.  The tough times are when there are issues that are not able to be resolved upon a first contact. Management has gotten better about being pro active about helping fellow employees with a career path. Also the upper management seem to have a buy in to help with career development as well. The most enjoyable part for me is the events that EA has like launch parties with plenty of food and drinks for each game that comes out. The benefits are nice as well good health plans."
good,I was often just recruited for a day or a few hours to complete a project. Sometimes a project would last for a week or two. I was always treated very well and compensated fairly for my time.
good,Typically everyone in the work place came in with a positive attitude and ready to work. Everyone was efficient and really worked as a team. Anytime help was needed you could ask a team member for help with no problems. The break room was the best having the xbox one and PS4 but nothing can compare to SMASH BROS. during break!
good,"I loved my job here at EA, my main issue is that you do not get a raise for more responsibility.  I could do the bare minimum and still get paid as much as someone who is running devices and database managing or a CTL. There was very little room to grow, and you were constantly training and losing experienced people."
good,"Really enjoyed the job culture here, sense of ambition and comraderie amongst everyone here. High sense of gaming culture intermixed with a passion for everything games. My experience here was as a contractor and I have made some indelible friendships."
good,It was one of the best jobs i've ever had... The environment was great and the staff were even better.  Very professional and a pleasant place to work.
good,"EA is a great place to work. The people are passionate about games and creating the best experience for their players. Everyone strives to help one another and keep the environment fun. If you are a gamer and enjoy helping others, customer support is a great way to get in the door. It is a contact center, however, so player contacts can be stressful and your work schedule is primarily dictated by what the company needs. Take every opportunity to develop yourself (game design, quality assurance, project management, etc) and remember to let customer support is a path towards your true goals."
good,I learned to have a good eye for details and I developed my team work in a friendly environment. I learned how to prioritise important work from less important work
good,"Electronic arts has learned that happy employees are productive employees. Studios have recreation centers, snacks, free foods, cheap sodas and relaxed environments. Time in and out is not strictly monitored. As long as you get your work done and it is done on time and good, then they don't mind."
good,Great company to work for especially if you love video games. The culture is fun and fast. Management seemed to be improving by the day.
good,"The atmosphere is very friendly. Everyone I worked with was positive and constructive in working toward a common goal. No one was unhappy, only if their contract was up and they had to move on from the company."
good,"Flexible work hours, and it's great fun to work on games. The team has got a great culture of looking out for each other. You can be sure that everyone's got your back. Managers are great, they are good people who really listen to your needs."
good,"About my previous company i learnt so many skills, like testing knowledge, project management skills, how to work with the other colleagues, team management, time management, project on time deliveries. etc.,   So i can say it's very good company."
good,"Free coffee and tea, vending machines with an AWESOME selection, a TV with a console to use during breaks. Hour long lunch break, great hours, hardly ever work on weekends."
good,"Overall, Electronic Arts Tiburon studio is a fine location and great place to work with constant team communication, great facilities and nearby cafes where you don't ever have to leave work and drive to get lunch. The management was always friendly and my co-workers were always ready to help and even just chat. The most difficult part of the job was learning the company's standards and proprietary software, but once you get the hang of it, you progress like you never knew you could."
good,A great work environment for game testers with highly supportive management and great colleagues .
good,A great company to work for. They provide flexibility as long as the work gets done. The appreciate work hard and play hard.
good,I had fun while there. Can't complain as I worked with a talented team of individuals and was given the opportunity to learn. Everyday we were given the opportunity to work on something new.
good,Working for Electronic Arts was deeply engaging and truly inspiring due to the creativity that is forced on its employees to guarantee we’re making a high quality game that seeks to entertain their fans as well as those simply testing. Being able to be a part or a massive team of developers and creators adds a layer of understanding when it comes to building something from the ground up to be enjoyed by those seeking to be entertained.
good,"If you are a die hard core gamer, please join the firm, excellent team work, Excellent management, Linen team leaders, Low tempered managers, Highly motivated teams, No targets, average income good timing."
good,"Disfruté cada día que trabajé en EA, incluso cuando al estallar la crisis el ambiente se veía ensombrecido por los continuos recortes de puestos de trabajo. Un ambiente relajado pero exigente, muy al estilo internacional donde se asume que el empleado es responsable y sabe lo que tiene que hacer (algo atípico en la empresa media española)."
good,"I will not soon forget the lessons I have been instilled with and the amazing moments I had whilst working for Electronic Arts. I had the luck to be assigned to a very welcoming team filled with generous and kind folks, the likes of which one rarely comes by."
good,"Mi experiencia con Electronic Arts ha sido en su mayor parte positiva, no puedo tener queja. Una empresa muy profesional con gente igual de profesional. No me gusta la política que tiene la empresa para gestionar la estabilidad laboral, contratos de pocos meses y prácticamente nula la opción de un contrato indefinido o de larga duración."
good,"- No Dress code, can wear shorts, jeans to work place"
good,Its a great place with lots of great people.  Lots of dogs around so if your into that its a real plus. Beer fridays were always welcome. Fantastic facility.
good,"I really appreciate my time at EA. Working at EA allowed me the opportunity to learn the industry, while also growing in the industry. only being a part time gamer prior to joining EA, I learned the skill of bug finding, and the whole QA process. Good managers take their time to teach, and co-workers, make it feel like a family."
good,Ir a trabajar en EA era tan divertido como se puede imaginar. Había gente de todo el mundo; jóvenes interesados en videojuegos y diferentes culturas. Lo más difícil era saber que era un contracto temporal.
good,"A normal workday will be to go through specific areas of one of the games being worked on and find every little bug or text error and report it or fix it yourself."
good,The only thing the management cares about is completion of daily / weekly reports with in the time with best quality. Great place to work and enjoyed working with the team. I learned a lot in terms of technical and functional things. Team is awesome to work with and never failed to deliver the reports in the specified time.
good,"My growth from freshers to a POC (point of contact) to one of the biggest game title, Pet Society happened in a span of 2 years."
good,Working at EA was a very fulfilling and exciting job. I was a part of a big team made up of great co workers. My typical work day consisted of collaborating with multiple team members and finishing my day to day tasks. I learned a lot about the inner workings of the video game industry and working with a team.
good,Electronic Arts was a great place to work for 12 years.  I loved every minute of what I did.  The work is extremely challenging and rewarding.  The people are some of the best I have ever known.  I will really miss working with them.  Sadly I was part of a mass layoff.
good,"1.  A typical day at work starts off with checking my email.  Responding to file requests or any support needed by the A/R department.  Sorting and distributing the mail 2-3 times a day.  Filing away the A/R Invoices. Mailing out invoices.  "
good,- kreative Freiheiten
good,One of the best work experiences I've had in my adult life. Everyone is so open and willing to be there for one another. the CEO's and upper management do their best to know everyone they can on a personal and first name basis and it's greatly appreciated and doesn't go unnoticed. There is always constant movement around the building when it comes to making sure lower level workers have everything needed to be comfortable in their positions.
good,"Tiburon was a great place to work.  Lots of amazing people to collaborate with and learn from.  Benefits were great, and a lot of company and team building events hosted regularly at the studio."
good,"Dream job, for a gamer! Requires a lot of hours but the pay off is great if you are into teamwork and accomplishing goals. "
good,I loved  for that working company all the guys were super friendly and we always met are deadlines. It was really busy during deadline time but the down time made up for it. It was one of the most fun places I have ever worked at.
good,"The cool thing about working in this industry is that you work with people with the same interest. And when working on a team towards one goal, you feel important. It's also surprisingly mature for a work place. Not only can you raise concerns with management, but they'll actually look into it. Overall, excellent experience."
good,"Most work days consisted of adjusting the temperature/HVAC vents for at least one or more co-workers. LOL!! "
good,"I loved being a part of EA Games:"
good,Enjoyable work environment.  Very easygoing.  Management is genuinely interested in their employees.  Work time is generally flexible and allows for time away or vacations.
good,"It is a very nice place to work if you enjoy gaming and gamers. The atmosphere is very inviting. The area is very nice."
good,"- A typical day at work is sitting at your desk and testing your assigned game and find bugs, on average you will write down 3-5 bug reports(depending on the project you are assigned)."
good,"Great company, I would recommend them to anyone. I sincerely hope to have the opportunity to work with them again. I'd recommend them to those interested in publishing."
good,"For my first industry job this was a blessing of a place to work at. The employees are extremely friendly, patient, and talented. Everyday things got done no matter the tasks that were at hand. Benefits were great and they really understand work life balance."
good,"Great place to work and grow. The campus is large and has ping pong tables, pool tables, and there's even an indoor gym. Full of self-driven employees."
good,"I am, very grateful for had this amazing opportunity to work at this AAA big giant of the Market."
good,"Typical day starts off fast. Each analyst was assigned a studio to manage over 500 contracts. It was day to day of calculations and entering journal entries.  When new license or developer contracts came in, it had to be reviewed and escalate to corporate counsel of any questions or discrepancies regarding royalty structure."
good,"EA was a fantastic place to work. The environment is nice and relaxed. As a woman in a male dominated industry, I never once felt uncomfortable. Equality is very important to the company."
good,"Fantastic company to work with. Best for freshers. Enjoyed a lot. Good working environment. "
good,Very happy with the work/life balance as well as management styles. Hardest part would be knowledge transfer from previous employees and maintaining that.
good,"Working for Electronic Arts opened my eyes to the gaming community and I was able to talk to fellow players and help them with their jobs. Getting excited for up coming games and enjoying the atmosphere and fellow employees and team. "
good,"Challenge me such that I continue to grow and improve within the company."
good,Best job ever and awesome co workers. A place where you look forward going everyday
good,EA is an amazing job to have. although it was only work xperience they showed me what its like to be part of the EA team and this was rally welcoming. the attitude around the work area is relaxed but not lazy. infact everyone their is very har working and my definition of relaxed their is just its stress free and fun.
good,"Everything about this job is awesome. Not to sound mean, but Electronic Arts spoils their employees. You have a fixed Monday through Friday schedule, and the hours are the same everyday. There are opportunities for overtime as well if you are on a team that constantly needs it. The only cons are that the job is contracted for one year, and although you are off for holidays, the company doesn't pay during that time. The only paid time off opportunities employees receive are during uncontrollable weather conditions that disable all or most employees from going to work."
good,"Job culture is fun, with lots of engagement and Employee Resource Groups available."
good,"Great company, great environment.  young, dynamic and fast-growing studio, team members have the unique opportunity to help shape its culture into one aligned with their own. It also offers the best of two worlds"
good,It was like working on the the set of the movie gramas boy. So cool. Got paid to play video games all day. I would wish this job on anybody. such a cool experience
good,"It's every person's dream to work at a gaming firm. And if not for a gaming giant like EA, where else would you love to be? EA has by far been the most relaxed and at the same time the most competitive place I've worked at. This is because you put your entire focus on delivering the best quality of the game and in the process, everyone tends to be on their toes to catch the best defects. I loved working at EA and would definitely want to go back."
good,"Managment helps you adavance your career, relevant training to keep you up to date on changes. Fun and laid back atmosphere. Amazing place to be! Always a party happening"
good,I worked as a contractor for this company. I enjoyed every minute of working there. I was give lots of opportunity to learn things to advance my career. I will be looking forward to continuing my career with this awesome company.
good,"Love it HereI have been working at Electronic Arts full-time (More than a year). Lot of learning opportunities, get to work in the gaming industry. Software testing for Video Games is a good way to break into the industry."
good,"During my time working for EA I was involved in many different aspects of multiple exciting titles.  I was given the opportunity to expand my skillset into multiple areas of expertise including: Modeling, Texturing, and Animation.  I enjoyed my time spent there and would do it all over again if I could."
good,"They're committed to their employees' experience. Besides a challenging, engaging workplace, they believe in giving back to our local communities, reducing our environmental footprint, and helping to put safer drivers on their roads. Here’s what you’ll find working at EA."
good,"Great, supportive managment, terrific work/life balance, amazing perks. Awesome team environment and work atmosphere. I would highly recommend this as a place to work."
good,"Electronic Arts is a big company and you have all the advantages working with them. Unfortunately, in my case, the kind of games they develop at Tiburon (mainly Sport games) are not my prefered kind of games."
good,"Ambiente multicultural y jovén. "
good,Amazing place to work with a diverse group of creative individuals. Excellent work/life balance. Extremely fun culture with great leadership and supportive team enviroment!
good,Excellent Team Members with supportive attitude. I enjoy working here as the work environment is enthusiastic and motivating. Great Management. Excellent services.

good,"EA is a fun gaming organization that cares about their employees. They provide discount lunches, lots of events and games for the staff to play along side with progressive managing tactics"
good,"It was the perfect workplace, if not for the fact that I had to move from the Country I would have stayed there and grow in the hierarchy scheme ."
good,"Really enjoy my time here and learn't a lot from the management team and as a benefit had one of the best teams I had the pleasure to manage."
good,"I loved working at EA, I worked as a QA tester and it was fun. Mostly young co-workers and the gaming atmosphere added to the fun."
good,Background designs were done daily. Loved the pace and challenge of the production and the people were great.
good,"Definitely a place for computer savvy, or technologically inclined workers. Gamers are treated with great respect and constantly motivated and rewarded."
good,"I worked at EA for a little over 3 months, right out of the gate from VFS, I have nothing but good memories of them, people from other teams were always polite, the facilities were phenomenal, and it was always such a great feeling to pull into the parking lot everyday, as a work place EA Burnaby is easily on top of all others."
good,"A typical day has started with project assignment, we were assigned 2 games for our 8 hour shifts, as being a tester learned all the test development cycle and test scenarios, management was the best group of people who shared passion for gaming as every employee, co-workers were friends who shared the passion for gaming and were extremely helpful in making sure that all areas of the games has been tested, the hardest part was to make sure that we don't post the default bug in the game and the most enjoyable part would be the gaming time that we used to get between our testing."
good,"One of my first jobs out of high school.  Had lots of friends that worked here.  Fun place to work but very high call volume and impatient customers, but I was always able to make them smile & laugh by the end of the call."
good,"Manage and drive revenue while simultaneously bringing brands to life within EA games across multiple platforms. "
good,"Whilst it was just a 6 month contract, I had the best tie working at EA.  They are so much fun! Whilst taking each aspect of game development seriously with impeccable attention to detail, they never lose sight of making the office a home from home and keeping their employees happy."
good,"A company that looks after their employee and let them grow. I have absolutely no complaint on the company itself. I was in Galway though, the city is not great, if they were based in Dublin I would have never left the company."
good,"Relaxed schedule, competitive environment, great place to work while pursuing outside interests. I have enjoyed my time working at Electronic Arts"
good,"It was, by far, my favourite job. I learned so much and the co-workers and management were especially nice and understanding. "
good,Perform various test on the project assigned. Reported any issues in the ea database to be reviewed by the developers of the project.
good,"The management and co-workers are like your best friends, the cafeteria had great food every day, and the work was really rewarding"
good,"Nice place to work"
good,Really takes good care of its employees. It was the best place i ever worked
good,-great employees
