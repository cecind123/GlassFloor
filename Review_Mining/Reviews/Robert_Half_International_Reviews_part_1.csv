rating,review
bad,"Nur die Belange von Robert Half sind relevant."
bad,They blacklist individuals with no valid reasons and proactively create and recycle 5-star reviews to burry those that don't speak well of this place. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere for your job needs. I decided to quit after witnessing major unethical practices and being sent to interviews for positions I had no relevant experience
bad,Robert Half was not transparent with me as they should’ve been. This led me into a bad position of having to wait 90 days to be hired on and then another 90 days with my employer before I would receive benefits.
bad,They were unfair and unappreciative. They forced me to threaten to take legal action to get paid. I believe they practice age discrimination. They require interviewing with an employer before being placed on short temporary assignments which is absurd because some assignments might only be for a day or a week.
bad,"Employee lie, do not help find work and are rude. Not sure what they do, but very badly ran temp service I was very disappointed. They are a waste of time. Set me up for interview 3 times and every time cancelled 30 min before I was scheduled to be there. Bad management. Dont care about helping find real work . They are a scam"
bad,Poorly run unresponsive unprofessional unorganized advertising several jobs with minimal open positions.I was sent to several different desks with very unprofessional folks. I'd never go back.
bad,"They don’t care about the temp employee  they care more about their client  "
bad,Robert Half and its subsidiaries systematically under pay their candidates. This is a huge problem and should be addressed ASAP. RH will charge companies over $50 per hour for talent but pay the candidate $12 - $15 per hour. When you ask for a decent wage for your work they will say they have to reach out to the employer. Why not just stop ripping off candidates.
bad,"Consultant en recrutement hautain , lorsque vous évoquez votre minimum salariale , il n’en prenne pas compte . Vous font déplacez pour rien ."
bad,"I can't believe they NEVER contact you for positions you apply for that reflect your skills and experience.  I was not a perfect match for the first company I was assigned to due to their teaching style and they just flat out do not contact me again for any other assignments I applied for.  It was like pulling teeth to get anyone after that and when I did (which I had to threaten speaking to a manager first), she forwarded my info to someone else, I guess due to my last name being in her jurisdiction, however, she NEVER returned my emails or calls.  I have a lot of experience and my assessments were great but it seems none of that matters.  I never knew temp agencies could / would become like this one.  I had to write a review after someone else, who is working permanently at another temp agency, felt the same way and mentioned Robert Half as being very stand-offish even though I did not while discussing temp agencies.  They are a snobbish agency.  Not like temp agencies of the past who work with people."
bad,"It's temp agency so you make the bare minimum. There are no benefits to this job so if you don't work you don't get paid. You make less because they get their share from whatever the company is paying them,"
bad,Their compensation structure fosters unethical behavior in candidate placement. There are very few skilled recruiters that work here. Upper management is out of touch with middle management.
bad,I worked for Robert half for the first time and the Walnut Creek office is very unprofessional if you ever make a complaint to them on your current assignment they wont try to help they will just get rid of you and hire someone else. They have no ethic your just always temporary to them in this company. Trash
bad,"Push you into a job that is temp to perm, then you get removed from 3 weeks and are notified by email."
bad,I didn't like working with them. They never contacted me or help me with my needs. They only found me on job and have never be able to help or call back when you call them.
bad,"This is a place to work.  I worked here, it was ok - culture is not good. Would not recommend, would continue to look elsewhere.  Staffing firm, good location."
bad,"Robert Half of San Antonio DID NOT support me in the MIS TREATMENT  in my temporary assignment. TIGER WASTE was rude and treated the ""TEMPS"" like leprosy. Reported the struggles to the ROBERT HALF STAFF, but NO ONE ever assisted. The Robert Half Account representative, changed ONCE A MONTH... NEVER figured out WHO COULD ACTUALLY HELP ME w/ the CONTINUAL MISTREATMENT."
bad,"with all my experience they do not follow my career goals, place me in non positions that use non of my skills.  Very unhappy with Robert Half, to bad they have more openings so they show on their website."
bad,"The associate I worked with was a liar and was horrible to work with.. I would never refer anyone to this company. I was treated unfairly, the communication was horrendous."
bad,"Really nothing good about the company. There's no communication within their team. The employees know next to nothing, thus giving you the wrong information. Then they try to withhold money you're owed. Never providing actual documentation with guidelines. "
bad,"Where do I start? First off, biggest waste of time will be spending your time at Robert Half. Don't even bother wasting your experience, professional life etc. This is absolutely the worst place I ever worked. No one in the Southfield, MI office likes one another, and the second an employee leaves the room - all of the other employees will talk poorly about that individual.  I've never met a group of humans that treat one another so poorly. There were so many occasions where I was in shock on how they treat, talk about etc one another. The 'division-director's' are even worse, along with all other management. They have every other person listed as a ""manager"" and it's normally picked on favoritism. The technology/creative team is probably the worst. The leaders are absolutely horrible, and I promise I'm not exaggerating. The leadership will talk poorly about you to other staff members. They will indirectly put you down in team meetings, create drama in the workplace, lie to you, etc."
bad,"They found me a job that was Temporary to Hire.  What they don't tell you is that they charge the company you go and work for, Robert Half pays you one amount, but they charge the company you are working for $9 an hour more than what Robert Half was paying you.  And the company I was working for wanted to hire me permanently, but, for them to do that they would have had to pay Robert Half $8,000.00 to buy out the contract that was with them.  Or, you have to wait 1 year until your contract was over with Robert Half.  They do find you work, but if you want a permanent job, try to avoid temporary services."
bad,The pay is extremely low and no benefits until you work an incredible amount of hours. Recruiters are only there when they need you. No advancement only use you for positions that will never become permanent.
bad,"Very fast paced environment, you need to be able to multitask and be pulled into multiple directions at any moment no matter what you are currently working on."
bad,"But since leaving my last assignment, no assistance what so ever. I tot passed along and didn’t get the service I got when I worked an assignment that they ended up getting kicked off, leaving their employees with no assistance."
bad,"The ones who choose to stay are not hy choice. I wouldn't give this company any consideration. Because of poor management, 0 respect for HR, no team synergy, politics and gossip, no career progression and just a bad place to work."
bad,Ze beloven je de wereld maar gooien je er zo weer uit. Onrealistische doelstellingen en management wat alleen aan zichzelf denkt. Een hypocriete bedoening.
bad,Just your standard cold calling company but they will sell you on it being much more advanced just remember youre replaceable and you better sell or else
bad,"I was hired by Robert Half for temp to perm position in December 2018. The working environment they placed me in was at best horrible! I made the decision to leave that position in April 2019, and have yet to be placed again. They are horrible at what they do! They are on companies sides, not placing people. Robert Half is a joke!"
bad,"after doing recent some research of my own, I feel better in knowing that OfficeTeam does indeed blacklist candidates and that I'm not the only one wondering whats going on when don't hear back."
bad,I was thrown into a job with little or no information of position. Impossible to reach your supervisor constant changing of supervisors. No leadership. I left my last position in Oct. 2018 and never heard from the company again. I called repeatedly looking for new position and was given different directions on using the website to find positions on 5 different occasions.
bad,I was sent to a place that wasn't a good fit however they wouldn't replace me. I needed a job to make ends meet. I offered to stay as long as needed to be replaced and reassigned however they wouldn't do anything for me until my assignment was over and I was out of a job. I remained professional and suffered through the assignment.
bad,Worst work experience ever. I would not go through their process again. You never know what you will get. I was sent on interviews outside of my experience level and drove over 50 miles for said interviews.
bad,Robert Half discrimiates against people with disabilities. I would not recommend working there. It was a horrible experience from beginning to end. They really should know California's employment laws.
bad,"I have been working with Robert Half for 10 months already. Since my second assignment, I have got really bad companies. The culture that doesn't accept diversity, don't accept gays and always make us feel incapable. You never have any right to talk, give feedback. If they make you feel uncomfortable, you can't say anything. Most of the assignments are temporary, this way you don't have any benefits on holidays. The payments are always a pain. You have to call, make sure that you are going to be paid. They make you call, send emails asking for the money. Some recruiters are amazing, other, just talk to you like you have no options in the market to get a job. They call you for any job without asking for your experience. Is, unfortunately, a company that I don't want to call ""my job"" anymore. I hope they can understand better the human being and be more respectful, support, no racism or discrimination, everything change when you give your point when you are not happy at work. So I don't understand why you need to give feedback if you cant."
bad,"This company gets you excited about opportunities and never follows up with concrete and viable jobs.  In this day and age, most contact should be via email and internet,  they call to discuss and if you cant answer phone, do not follow up with u via email or on message?!  They act like they doin somthin and nothin is done.  Communication is awful and people are fake."
bad,"Account Managers come and go all the time. Very low pay as they want most of it even though you are doing the work. Don't waste your time asking for a raise."
bad,"I worked for Robert Half at various times of my 20+ years of administrative employment and between permanent jobs and most of my experience was excellent; however, in 2018, I noticed that management changed for the worse.  I had to leave a position for personal reasons and gave notice, yet a manager blocked me from getting other work after this experience because she ultimately did not want me to leave the position because of the way it reflected on Robert Half, despite my giving a long advance notice so that I could seamlessly be replaced which was unfair to me."
bad,"They don't return phone calls. Sent me assessments which I scored 'above average' on and then I called back to talk about my plan to begin with them, and no call back. Very unprofessional, and unethical to blow off people and waste peoples VALUABLE time! Having worked with them in the past also, they are not easy to work with as they don't help with targeting the right jobs for the person. Not interested in finding long term work for people as a service offered to you, just shuffling you around jobs to take their cut from the employer and make themselves money. They call you 1 hr before an interview and rush you. Not worth the time and it's demonstrated in their unprofessional conduct."
bad,"They don't return phone calls. Sent me assessments which I scored 'above average' on and then I called back to talk about my plan to begin with them, and no call back. Very unprofessional, and unethical to blow off people and waste VALUABLE time! They are not easy to work with either as they don't help with targeting the right jobs for the person. Not interested in finding long term work for people, just shuffling you around jobs to take their cut from the employer. Not worth the time since they don't return calls."
bad,"I don't know what happened. I used to have a working relationship with Robert Half Technolgy and they used to professional. "
bad,"Low payment - They do not appreciate your skills."
bad,PA offices horrible. No communication. Like all PA offices . Will will call and then go rogue. No follow-up. Horrible customer service. Must be a Gen X thing. Treat others ho you want to be treated.  Use another recruiter. No wonder employees GHOST
bad,"Robert Half's mission is ""ethics first"" but their reality is the opposite. They do not have ethics, treat candidates horribly, lie to them, take opportunities from them."
bad,"Most of the people here treat you like a complete idiot that has no idea what normal market rates are for contracting. The jobs they will place you in are the worst in the city. They have the worst rates for contractors and the worst rates for company's to contract out to."
bad,"Absolutely horrible place to work. The management team is extremely petty and they bully employees, even the ones still employed there. The management team whispers about other staff members in the office while they’re sitting a cube away. I experienced coworkers talk so poorly about other coworkers- as far as physically/mentally making fun of others. Favoritism is how they prefer to work- and how you advance within the company. No structure, training is horrible (they make you watch videos on your own), and they’ll lie straight to your face about compensation/salary etc. "
bad,Do not care about contract workers. They pay their contract workers the bare minimum. And do not try to match the contract worker with E their skill set. Just want a warm body in the position so they can receive the contract..
bad,I have worked on and off for office team for over a decade and each time they change recruiters it becomes worse and worse. They have you come in only to tell you that have many jobs yet you never hear from them. They post jobs as simple as receptionist yet will not consider you and tell you the job posting has been filled an hour after it was put up. I always have given 100% for this company at every assignment and will not recommend this company again. People that honestly want to work they don’t seem interested in. My location in Tulsa never even returns emails and when they do they are rude. Very disappointed
bad,"This place has never looked out for my best interest in a job! I would get a few phone calls and then nothing, when I would call them they would say oh we have something you are perfect for but then silence!"
bad,"My Robert Half recruiter never once helped me when I let them know of problems on the assignment I was work. They ignored phone calls and emails."
bad,"Management not great at communicating with you,they only care about themselves and no one else, Only if it means getting promotions on there end I would tell you like others don't use this staffing company and look else where."
bad,"They will put you on assignement , advice you that tomorrow do not come back at work because the contract with the customer has ended. They will lie to you and tell you your contract will be for 6 months , but it won't go over 1 month. Your job description has nothing to see with your job title. After your assignment has ended they will leave you to find your next job by yourself. They will never contact you again, when you call they will tell you i'm working for you just wait. Worst agency ever. Will never work for them again."
bad,"I have gone through 2 interviews with Accountemp staff, have only been sent on one interview and it seems that since I didn’t get that one I can’t even get replies to emails from the Akron Office anymore. I have received several emails from other offices and when I reply to them I never hear another word. They don’t do what they say their going to do to help you secure employment. You’re just a number to them. I don’t recommend wasting all the time to be registered with this company. They pass you around from employee to employee and eventually just ignore you no matter how motivated you are to work. Their a waste of time."
bad,"Just stay away.  You'll be misled my fresh college grads trying to place you in skill sets they know nothing about to customers they don't really know that have business models and requirements they don't understand."
bad,"There is no work/life balance, the actual job was not what was presented in the hiring process"
bad,"Long hours, take forever to get hired full time and i wasn't a fan of tempting. perferredto take my skills and services elsewhere but location was a key in me staying so long."
bad,Just not a good experience with the temp agency. Did not give all information for the job that you were posted to. Also you get paid less and no benefits through a temp agency.
bad,They do not seem to be very organized and seem to lose lots of things in the temp processes. They will help find a job but don't seem to care once they find one.
bad,"I worked as a contractor for another location and had very little contact with Robert Half, who was the agency.  I was released from the contract I feel because they sent over to many individuals for the positions the the company had to fill."
bad,"They offer temp to hire positions but is a lie. They offer to increase your salary, another lie. They don't represent or defend the employee rights, they only want to collect money from the contracting company"
bad,"I've been with this agency for years.  Seen ALOT of turnover there.  It USED to be a GOOD AGENCY but it fell off something serious. I would have AN AWESOME RECRUITER then ""suddenly"" that recruiter is GONE. You fill out a ton of paperwork. They don't return calls or emails. They don't answer their phone. You get the impression they are avoiding you bcz most likely they are.  IF you get thru,  they'll say they have NOTHING or they'll tell you they have ""A GREAT OPPORTUNITY"" & promise you this nice pay rate,  then you dont her back from them. A TOTAL WASTE OF TIME & VERY FRUSTRATING. DONT EVEN BOTHER WITH THEM, TRUST ME!!!"
bad,"I've had two nightmare experiences with this company! They stuck me in positions that were suppose to ""lead to permanent"" and when it didn't after the 3 months I thought it may have been something that I had done at the job even though I was told I was doing quite well. 4 months later I got a call from someone else at Robert Half asking if I would be interested in a temp position that may lead to permanent at the same company! 4 months later & they haven't found a suitable candidate? that is hard to believe! They use temps to not have to pay for benefits. Robert Half employees I'm sure knew this info of the company as well. The second job they sent me to the manager was a screaming psycho path! Save your time and just look for your own positions you will be better off than going through this company who take a portion of your pay."
bad,"I  was put in two job positions First one, Admin Asst, and I didn't hardly do any work. Except make labels, binders and file....file ….file....file......most boring job ever! Then the next assignment they put me on was for data entry, and well yes that is my main background, except the job wasn't data entry, it was for someone advanced in Microsoft Excel. And the IT lady training was awful and didn't accept that I wasn't advanced, and when i'd asked questions she was ugly about it, so they let me go because I was confused on day 3! SERIOUSLY 3 DAYS TO LEARN SOMETHING NEW! First of all Office Team shouldn't have put me in that position to begin with. But they don't care, all they care about is that they are making the $$$$"
bad,"This was a temporary job.  I was steadily busy processing payroll on an off site location that used an outdated system.  Co workers were friendly, but the job only lasted for a few weeks."
bad,"Interesting experience. Smoke and mirrors ! More of a sales pitch  than actually casting about placement.  Although I have been on assignment as long as you are a pet to them as a s temp you're fine. "
bad,Worked as Financial Analyst for another company.  Leadership was terrible.  Was not given information I needed for the job. Everything was last minute and everything was disorganized.
bad,"Horrible place - avoid at all costs. It would be better to be homeless in Baltimore than employed by Robert Half! My opinion of RHI is it is by far the worst place I have ever worked, and I will never work for them again."
bad,Stay far away from this employer. They will over work you to benefit their own. Belittle you and manipulate you to work harder then randomly get rid of you. They wouldn’t let me take any vacation or sick time and if you called off they retaliate against you. By far one of the worst companies I’ve ever worked for
bad,"I was required to work off the clock. It was so stressful I got very ill. It is a terrible place to work. Then when I applied for worker's comp because I became so ill from stress, they denied the claim."
bad,"I agree with most of the reviews which i have found to be true.  They post alot of fake jobs to get people to come in and register with them.  They will always tell you that the position was just filled but they can definetly find something for you.  Even if you tell them you are only interested in permanent positions they will still try to convince you to take temp jobs. Now really we all know this is how they make their money. Every hour you work a temp position they are making around $10 per hr off of you paid to them by the employer.  For a permanent placement they make a large one time payment as a finder fee from the employer that could be anywhere from $5000-$10000.  Let that sink in."
bad,not recommeneded I will not recommend this company to any one. they will advertise for positions and when you apply they do not have any position available.
bad,"Management at Robert Half dropped the ball and waited too long to set me up on the interview with their client.  I was available, but the staff at Robert Half too busy or disorganized to set up the interview with myself and their client.  They told me their client finally found someone else to hire on their own.  Then someone at Robert Half called me about another open position in accounting with another client, and I told them I didn't have experience in accounting, nor with the particular app they asked me about.  I have more than 20 years experience as an administrative assistant, but I got absolutely nowhere with this company for over a year and a half I was with them.  They are very disorganized or overworked and understaffed.  No follow up.  No response when I leave messages, and no assistance in placing me in available positions that I qualify for.  I am not impressed.  Aren't they a staffing agency?!  Why are they not pursuing placing a qualified applicant?  I'm very disappointed in the lack of professionalism and work ethic in the management of this company.  These 20 some year olds managing this company seem very overwhelmed or understaffed to do the job."
bad,"The position was sugar coated in the interview process, when really the job is telemarketing. The work environment is grey and depressing and employees are cramped into the office like sardines, which they refer to as the ""Bull Pen"". Certainly accurate if you want your employees to feel like cattle, as there is barely any room to move in that office. "
bad,Robert half dropped the ball with communication. Before starting my job I let both Robert half and the company I was assigned to know that I had an upcoming surgery. Submitted all the paperwork and everything was good or so I thought. Surgery day came and I called kin and email to remind them of my surgery as a courtesy seeing as I had already given them all the paperwork. They never answered. When I was discharged I also called to let them know and sent them the discharge papers. When it was time to go back to work I no longer had a job. Robert Half had FORGOTTEN to give notice to the company I was assigned to. They never sent them the discharge papers or anything. I lost my job just like that. Robert half gave me an apology but the damage was done. They also told me not to worry because they had somewhere else to place me and that they would do so fast because none of it was my fault. Its been a month and no calls or emails on their part. I am super disappointed.
bad,"It seems there are many issues with Robert Half. Many of the Representatives at the branches don't submit the correct documents to the home offices for temporary candidates bonuses/pay. There is always issues with the candidates pay. Management doesn't lead by example, they micromanage, and advise the employees not to be on their cell phones while they are on theirs, no one really holds them accountable in the customer Service Department at least. It seems as of their payroll system is geared to not pay their temporary candidates on time. Someone should really look into their systems and how they are run."
bad,"Will find you little to NO WORK.I have a  bachelors  degree and was continually sent to level entry jobs that lasted a total of a day or two with no real job placement.Reps are rude and nasty and don’t do anything to help find work."
bad,"I was not treat as part of the team.  "
bad,"I have tried going through this staffing company twice. They completely ghost you. They bring you in for like an interview, get to know you, find out what your looking for, show you several jobs that fit what your looking for. They confirm that your interested in those places and then tell you they are going to set up interviews for you with those companies and then you never hear from them again. Except advertisement emails. If you are serious about finding yourself a career and don't have all the time in the world to waste, then don't even bother with this company. They are a complete JOKE!"
bad,"there was no guidance in the company, everyone was out for themselves to gain people to hire, not a good company to work for.  The days were long and no help was given to help you get more recruits."
bad,"poor management, my manager clearly didnt care about my experience there, terrible time commuting didnt enjoy working there at all and office culture was not a match"
bad,Without a doubt the worst agency to work with. I've worked with many different staffing places and Robert Half TCG Office Team are the worst. Do not use them. None of the recruiters will get back to you ever. Any position you see posted and apply or call about they will not help you what so ever. Worked with them before and still can not get my emails or voicemails returned. Worked with them over a year ago and still haven't been help with a new position. Go to another company do not use them its a waste of your time.

Go to another company do not use them its a waste of your time.
bad,"They promise you so much when your hired and you quickly see they lie about everything, the turn over is weekly there they have no clue how to manage, the leadership has no clue what there doing bc they promote people who have been there years regardless if they have no clue what there doin still."
bad,"They don't try to find you a job, only call you if they need you. They don't return phone calls. I wish they would really try to locate you to a stable job, or at least keep you in mind and helping you to find one, as soon as the other assignment is over."
bad,I will never work here again. They are the middle man in between qualified people and the firms looking for them. They are causing inflation by over charging firms for what skilled people could be paid for.
bad,"Would not send me out on work assignments. The management was age, culture and personally discriminating.  The management sent me out on assignments that paid $11.00 to $13.00 per hour which is not sufficient enough to support oneself in the North San Diego County.  With 40 years of Office experience, and used to earning $20 to $25.00 per hour it was a true slap in the face!  Wouldn't recommend Robert Half and Co/Office Team to anyone!"
bad,I had never been so disappointed in trying to get back into the workforce after taking time off to have children. I went months in between jobs and there was a terrible lack of communication.
bad,"They are very money minded person, do not keep employees secret, do not follow up with the documents signed. Failed to do their job properly.  I basically don't want to work for them."
bad,They pay extremely low compared to what the job is worth. They are very rude and they will end your assignment without telling you. They lie and don’t care about your well being at all
bad,I worked for Robert Half Legal as an independent contractor also known as a temp. I went on assignments as told to by my recruiter. I would recommend.
bad,"You sign up for one position, then they offer you telemarketing jobs instead of the promised $17/hour job you initially contacted them about. No thanks."
bad,This place does not offer any benefits at all and the wages are not enough to survive as a single person in this region. Temp jobs are common here because employers do not want to pay for benefits.
bad,I applied at this temp place several times no phone calls unanswered emails and they post jobs every week. I apply at all of them because the ones I was qualified for I wasn’t getting any phone calls. I’m convinced since we are in Savannah GA thy hire a certain kind which is sad cause we face this everyday people wanting to do better but you got people in positions that don’t want to help people. COst of living is high and they acting this way. Shame on them. We will be blessed to those they don’t hire.
bad,"I turned down a position because the pay was too low, and I ended up finding a job outside of Robert Half. The notes on my profile stated I was let go for attendance. I left them for another job. They didn’t leave me. If the Recruiter would have taken some time she could have looked at my time sheets. Clearly it was not for attendance. The previous person was just trying to cover their behind because I left unhappy, and the company also had to find another temp. With another agency. "
bad,The agency only cares about making a profit off your hard work. And you are just a temporary employee. They only call you if they need to fill clients request. They ignore phone calls and do not consider your feedback. Only consider  about clients feedback.
bad,"The job placements are unreliable. The assignments can end at anytime without notice, but you are asked to give a notice. Poor communication between the office and employees."
bad,The management is poor no good assignments.  No good job leads. Don't call back on status of clients. Call you out of desperation with little pay.Not good
bad,I did not like working for them. Told them I needed a different position never got called back and was let go but they failed to tell me before the following Monday of showing up for work.
bad,Don't believe what they post. They are just looking to build there data base. Job postings are there just to bait you in. Look elsewhere as you have to pass a test. What a joke
bad,The only reason I ever found employment through them is because the employer which hired me only used them for every new hire. My interview and everything else happened with the employer. Office team was just my paperwork. Unfortunately the company closed 3 years later. My whole employment I had zero contact with office team.  Thank God I was hired on within a few months. They have been no help since then however
bad,horrible. i didnt like it . i wouldnt tell anyone about it. the communication is off and they dont pay enough for the cost of living .blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blaj=h
bad,"This Company only cares about holding on to their Clients. They never checked on me or how I was doing.  I was thrown in a job where the company was clueless and the employees could NOT train me on what should have been simple explanations because every time I asked a question they look at me like I was an alien. It was constant confusion from them. Most of the data was incorrect and I would spend time trying to figure out what to do on my own, then ask my trainer and she would say ""Oh that wasn't suppose to be in that data"" EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING. I knew enough about the job to wing it for a few weeks but when the training employee was extremely rude to me that was it. The company Robert Half sent me to had low level staff and management all in one room and the misogyny was choking. I didn't even sit with the people who were doing the job I was doing and I had to listen to MEN berate people all day long on the phone.  Last straw was when some management guy said ""Did you check and see if she had taken her meds?""  about someone who worked their permanently.   I got up, went outside, called Robert Half and asked if I could be reassigned. They said no and if I quit this job they would not ever reassign me.  EVEN after I explained the situation. In so many words I was told if I would just ""take it"" they would probably hire me permanently. UH Really?  I would rather clean toilets.  I am POSITIVE that Robert Half knew of these problems and did not care about what I was about to get into. Very Deceptive in my opinion."
bad,"Office team is a third party agency that help you find employment. The company that you work pays office team directly. Office team will pay you a minimum of what they are making, and that is how you get paid. For example if office team is getting paid a 2,000.00 a month from a company your hourly pay will be between 8-10.00 an hour. Office team will keep the majority and you don’t get paid the way the company would pay you as a real employee. That is why the have a temporary payment of 8-11.00 and when you get hired you pay will be 12-15 an hour. Keeping that in mind the company that you are working for can call office team anytime and fire you. It can be for any reason. Office team will call you that day without asking you any questions and they will tell you the company no longer needs you. They will not give you a reason of why you were fired. The office team in Miami does not take you for consideration. You may want something close to your home and they will give you something further away. For example you may live in homestead and you want something in homestead and the Kendall area. They will call you to work in Doral, Hialeah, Pembroke Pines; but never in the area you requested. Keep in mind the traffic in Miami is no joke. They do not care. The payroll is different your managers have to approve your hours. They can dispute them to office team for any reason. Let’s say you work regularly 40 hours, but you stayed 4 hours extra the following week. The company that you are working for can dispute your hours and you won’t get paid overtime. You get paid weekly instead of"
bad,"I was told they had a perfect role for me that was to start right away. After passing an extensive bg check I was completely blown off. Just tell people no, don't waste their time."
bad,"This company is extremely racist/sexist. They put you at a job site where the manager tells/asks you ""is it ok, Or will up take it personal if one of the men that work there put their hands around you and maybe touch your breast"". ""Would you take it personal if the men called you baby, honey, sugar or made anysexualAre you serious?"
bad,Je vous déconseille cette agence perte de temps...
bad,I would not advise any young people to work for Robert Half at the beginning of their careers.  Try to score a full-time job at a larger institution as an employee.
bad,"This company attempts to low ball you with the salary. Do not take the bait. After I called them out that the salary posted online was different for several positions they offered me, they acted as if they knew nothing that I was referring to then stopped calling me with offers. They are cut throat."
bad,Haven't worked enough to comment .Every day was different so hard to make judgement.. Can't get me jobs that I have asked for and always want to send me downtown..
bad,"My opinion is that company has hired and put young and unknowledgeable people in positions and it has driven the company down. It’s just not a good place to work for anymore, I think it’s some racist things going on within the company as well."
bad,"Robert half is only interested in hiring people that are not people of color.  If you are black, they will dodge you or ignore you and give your position to whites."
bad,"Hiring Agency is one reason the pay scale in America are not equal. "
bad,"Just a huge waste of time.  Like people are on Sale for their talents.  Make a profit while people work for outrageous rates."
bad,"Not a very professional place to work for if you are a contractor, management does absolutely nothing to help you either advance your career or help you find a new career in your chosen field. If you are under a contract with them in a division, there is absolutely ZERO chance they will try to help you get a different position within a different division within Robert Half. I would never recommend working for this company to anyone, ever."
bad,Offieteam placed me in a position with an amazing team and wonderful work environment. however they were given a 2 week advance notice that my job would be ending as it was a temp position. They waited until the morning of to call me and notify me. The company ended up keeping me on longer until I could find placement myself.
bad,"Very disappointed. No one would get in contact with you to follow up with you if you like your assignment, you always have to call your rep, they keep changing your rep with out anyone letting you know. No good communications"
bad,"Only worked one job for them. They did not have much work available for employees. I was supposed to receive a call from them regarding additional work and they never contacted me, poor communication."
bad,Really nothing positive.  Honestly still goes a long way. Very cut throat.  Child like games.  Like spoiled high school girls.  Extremely uncomfortable to a normal person with a brain.
bad,"My position  at The Creative Group was a learning experience but not in a mentored, fostering growth kind of way.  Buckle up and enjoy the ride but it was ride or die my your numbers every Friday."
bad,Complete disgrace.  Save your time and important time for someone else.  Promotes the idea of getting mystery jobs.  Extremely disappointed.  Down right SHAMEFUL !
bad,"I had some bad experiences with this company in Braintree too. It is a temp agency and either it has a very small client base or their industry is just dying out. They have almost no assignments and one they sent me on in Canton, MA I ended up filing a complaint against with the USDOL the first day"
bad,"After applying for several jobs online, the only response every received was the auto response acknowledging my submission. "
bad,"Recruiters ignore emails and phone calls when you inquire about how the job search is going for you. Spoke with a manager and she was not very helpful either, supported the recruiter and the decisions they made. Very poor service. Do not go with them."
bad,"I was working a customer service position with weird hours from 11:30-8pm which is all they could get me even though, I had requested 8:30-5pm, normal hours.  This position was contract only and they never communicated when it would end.  After 2 months the employer started laying off people at random when work slowed down under the guise of them being poor employees.  I eventually got laid off, not to mention all those laid off were women in their 20's.  I was placed at a different assignment one week later that didn't fit with my wants or needs or schedule at all, this one required weekend work.  I then after one week quit without notice due to getting another job and was told that I burned a bridge with the agency and that they'd never work with me again.  Really???  Low pay, no growth, no benefits, temporary and I'm expected to give 2 weeks???"
bad,"at the creative group, you are just a number.  you sit at your desk all day long, pursuing mind numbingly boring tasks.  the culture is TERRIBLE.  you check your personality at the door.  "
bad,"My position was coming to an end and they told me it was extended.  2 days later I had no job.  They then told me not to worry and I havent heard from again.  They also told me, "" I have a job and I am not worried about  you. ""  This is an absolute  aweful place to put your trust into."
bad,If you like abuse and being screamed at then go work for them.  If want to be respected and treated like a human being then this is not the place for you.  The place is built on a culture of fear with the constant threat of being fired even if you are on your game.  The intake process is a joke.  The expect you to sink or swim.  Some of the people are cool but management is typically concerned with covering them selves as opposed to getting the job done.
bad,"Robert Half is not a good company to work for, The contracts are short and the pay is not sufficient for denver,co. Also, the contracts are few and far between."
bad,they had no set guidelines and occasionally changed rules on a daily basis.it was fun on some days and stressful other days. the pros about it you didn't work on the weekends.
bad,I can't believe I worked with this company for two years.  It is the Columbia MD office.  They tell lies.  That is not professional at all.  Run away!
bad,"The management is terrible, they are rude , lazy, overworked, and they do not have good Customer relations skills with temporary workers.  Temps are treated like trash, and they do not show them any consideration. They barely give them enough time to learn the job, and they decide to throw quite a bit of work in their face after the first day. I don't like to be mistreated and picked on and that is exactly the way Mouthpiece Communication treat the temporary workers like nothing."
bad,"This place will get your hopes up thinking they client want you, only to find out you didn't get the job. You can forget calling the office for feedback, they will not answer calls after u been denied employment."
bad,I was in the business development side. When I started there was a new on boarding process starting. Training was awful! Management did not train at all everything was pushed to the side or at a later date. The lack of management not training new hires. They pick who they want to train. There is backstabbing going on from management. They never tell you when you start to pay for parking. Management needs to be better in Houston!
bad,No sales training. You're competing against the person (your manager) responsible for giving out leads. The turnover was extremely high and the atmosphere very depressing.
bad,"Management has poor skill sets to run a successful, productive office environment. Division Directors and Managers are spending half of their days behind closed doors gossiping about employees."
bad,"I was lied to about a the positions being temp to perm. These jobs never became perm due to the contract was to much money to buy out. "
bad,"Robert Half Accountemps recruiters consistently posts fake jobs to lure in new candidates just to build their own database, the jobs do not exist and if they do, you won't be considered for them with any number of excuses given"
bad,I did not feel this company did a good job of placement. They simply try to fill empty labor roles marketed to tech folk. I feel this company is more focused on making a quick buck rather than helping people advance their career.
bad,"kann ich leider keinem empfehlen, "
bad,Left me out to dry after my first assignment ended. Never returned my calls or emails about further placement. Never explained why this was the case. I felt like I was doing their job for them.
bad,"The company makes false promises to employ, provides no benefits, and do not care if employers are sexually harassed in the work place. Maybe they'll improve."
bad,"I took the time to make an appointment because I had heard they are a reputable company.  I interviewed.  They did nothing.  I have over 40 years experience and they did not even make a call to me about any positions.  Very, very disappointing.  I'm thinking age discrimination!"
bad,"They will place you anywhere there is a need whether you like it or not, and if you ever refuse an assignment, they will black ball you and never call you again for jobs.  The last job I went on was for Admin Assistant, and that job had me cleaning the whole week.  At one time they had me in the kitchen opening up expired beer and poring it out.  That was an all time low for me, but I needed work. Robert Half asked me if I wanted to stay another week on that assignment.  When I said ""No"", they stopped taking my calls."
bad,"Title says it all and this review is about Office Team (Robert Half). The recruiters never reach out to you and when you call them they will transfer you over to three different help until I one of them decides to ""help"" you."
bad,"The company doesn't care about you."
bad,Robert Half is a huge temporary placement agency that basically treats their employees like slaves. Pay for a large metropolitan area is well below cost of living.
bad,There was only on rep who ensured I stayed working through RH. Any other time with any other rep has been the worse. I was release off a mistake that the RH staff made with the client and the contract they placed me on. Did RH even try to get me placed due to their mess up? NO! They are only about the money! They do not represent or advocate for the employees they place in unfavorable positions.
bad,"Highly exploitative company. They take away almost 50% of whatever the client is paying so that you get paid close to minimum wage. You cannot live off their salaries. Aside from that, you're given duties outside of the job description and they turn a blind eye."
bad,This company's ability to pay attention to its employees before hiring is appalling. I would never take a job from them again. They handled hired employees that were not legally able to work for a contract.
bad,Not a good place to work!  There is high turn over and you work in a shark tank. There is high turn over with management also and very little training.
bad,"the management has no respect for experienced professionals."
bad,"They call you in, test you, interview you and then you never hear from them again. I have called multiple times and only gotten the voicemail of the person that is supposed to send me out for work. Don't waste your time on them, look for a real job."
bad,"I always got the worse assignment only calculated to black list me and put me on their radar not to be hired for future assignments. "
bad,company had too many changes in human resources which made things difficult.  They have lot of temporary work available and that's good.  Need to focus more.
bad,"I've given Robert Half several opportunities and each city and every office I've had the same results.  Overall lack of enthusiasm, poor management,  not working on your behalf,  will allow you to be released from an assignment, then black list you from getting other jobs.  If you do get a job they will put you places where you will fail or give you  lower pay as punishment. "
bad,"They claim they will place you... Then you have to do this or that. Send you to a position and then when you show up to an assignment they suddenly misplaced paperwork. So, you try to call the office and see what happened 3 to 4 days till they return your call."
bad,Poor Communication.  Lacks with finding job assignments after the old one ends. Do not commucate with the employees about their concerns and needs. Following up with employees to see if they're still seeking for employment.
bad,Was called and set up an interview time via Skype. No contact. Makes me wonder if they are legitimate like other reviewers have mentioned. A waste of my time.
bad,"Metrics, KPIs, Lots of calls, inter office competition and intense team competition make this a difficult place to survive. "
bad,"When I was hired it was promised to me to work in advance accounting positions, instead they offered me the clerical job with minimum compensation.  The work atmosphere is very hectic and tense."
bad,"Got sick the same day from something I eat, then they gave me a bad reference because I was sick.  They say me in person and told me to go home and get some rest and I get a bad review."
bad,"Temp jobs never pay enough and we have to work 2000+ hours just to get holidays paid.  not a nice business, but most people have no choice and need to make funds quickly."
bad,"This workflow shows how we answer the question: ""Which product do we build?"" It shows the path from validating solution (Value Sprint) to designing the product with customer in mind (Design Sprint) and, finally, creating the technology platform by defining architecture, data modeling, and tooling for the proposed solution (Foundation Sprint.). Once this is completed, the teams start sprinting (see InRhythm Scrum Framework). Hover over Tap any point below to view more information about our process."
bad,"A fast past growing company that really relys on long hours,  focus & little room for error. This was a good company as for as just work. The people ( co-workers) unfriendly and don't really communicate with other co- workers. Another thing is that there was many all contract employees."
bad,I learned alot from robert half but i eventually had to end up quitting because the work life balance was horrible and couldnt get a nights rest. i didnt like it there.
bad,There was a high turnover rate for the recruitment staff.  It was always difficult to get in touch with them.  They were not a very friendly group to deal with.
bad,"Dreadful culture, infantilises employees. Hours are too long. KPI's are too harshly enforced. Clients are not the top priority only fees. Did not enjoy working there."
bad,"Was hired on the fact that its a temporary placement with the potential of leading into a permanent. I quit a secure job I had and declined two interviews. Within the first 30 minutes of my first day in the new job I was told by the company I was assigned to work for that the position was actually offered to someone a week ago and they just need someone to cover until this person starts, maybe two days or one week at maximum. By the end of the day, I was called to the controller office to be told thank you for your service we don't need you anymore. People have families to support so be upfront from the beginning!"
bad,Recruiters with Account temps will not help you. They have a quota to get so they will be very deceptive in their practices.  Go elsewhere.  Do not work with this company
bad,I cannot give an adequate review for Accounttemps as this was an employment agency and I find that some employment agencies misrepresent you by informing their prospective client that you are equipped with skills that in reality you don't have.
bad,I wouldn't work for Accountemps ever again.  
bad,Management was very poor with employee relations. Their way or the highway regarding application/processes. Small office so managers would yell to colleagues instead of using phone system.
bad,"Accountemps do NOT know how to vet their employers well at all.  They will stick you in a situation which is not productive work wise nor health wise."
bad,"Choose other staffing companies to work please. "
bad,"I was placed in a position that was temporary. I kept telling OfficeTeam that the company was getting ready to let me go, and would need another job. They ignored me. That was back in December. The 13th. They haven't found me work since."
bad,"Recruit people that are desperate to find work. Sell service contracts to clients. Charge the client maximum.  Pay the talent minimum. "
bad,"They do not care about their contracted employees.  They do not try to negotiate for more money for contracted employees, they try to pay them the least amount possible to have a higher commission.  They also do not try to find the perfect for their contracted employees. They just put you in a position just to feel a job and they do not check on you once you are placed.  They also do not return calls, when you have an issue or need to communicate with them about problems."
bad,"Very ""dog eat dog"" environment. Intimidating, uncomfortable to work in. Lack of professionalism. Unfriendly staff. Lack of concern for client well-being- money was all that mattered."
bad,"The ""managers"" are more sales competitive against you then other sales people!  They lie, they change things in the computer that were accomplished by me, so it reflects on them!  Terrible place to work!  They expected me to lie to recruits, it was just an awful experience."
bad,Robert Half posts fake job ads to attract candidates and then tries to pressure them to take low paid short-term contract jobs without benefits. They require reference checks before they have any real job opportunity and never follow up.
bad,"If they have a contact that fits, fine. They basically had me sent to a site to work independently. It was up to me to make it work out and find new work. That lasted 4 years. "
bad,"Don't waste your time applying to this company, they don't care about people it's all about the money. Management is terrible, there is no HR department to bring any concerns to despite the fact that it's an ""HR Consultant"" company. Recruiters are allowed to do whatever they want and there are no repercussions for harassment or demeaning behaviour. There is so much unethical behaviour, you are better of not working here."
bad,"•	Processed invoices and  issued payments in a timely fashion"
bad,I worked as a temporary employee of this company.  I always had work.  I did not have any issues with the company or the job assignment I was given...
bad,"Be prepared to be sold short. You'll be underpaid by at least $15 and you'll have to be thankful for it because let's face it, if you could get a job elsewhere you would."
bad,"Having utilized them in the past as both an employer and employee, I used to highly recommend.  Can no longer do so due to the current environment in the local office."
bad,"No paid holidays, that is unless you work 2188 hours in the previous 12 months. Which means that unless you work a full week of OT in a year, you won't get a single paid holiday. Therefore, no paid holidays."
bad,"While I was working contract for Accountemps, I felt like the only way I get my question answered by Accountemps is by having my manager contact them because they do not take phone calls, text, or from their clients. When I needed to go back to the workforce, they would ignore you like you are nothing."
bad,"They told me I will get 40hrs per week, but the companies they placed me only made me work for less than 20 - 30 hr. They only want profits from temps"
bad,"Both Temp Agencies get you a job and then you never hear from them again.  They don't check in to see how you are doing or to see if you are liking the job.  They don't assist if there are questions or concerns; they want you to contact their client instead, which is uncomfortable and unprofessional.  Was not given a clear understanding of the job duties and what was expected of me."
bad,Took inbound and outbound calls from customers on Best buy business Advantage customers. On there cards helping them out in any type of way I can be assistance
bad,This company is not reputable. They will take advantage of you so someone else up line makes commission off of you. 
bad,I didn't have to go to this office everything was done over the phone. This picked and chose who they sent out on the jobs so if you didn't have a degree you didn't go far at this company.
bad,"This was a temporary to permanent position with Essex Crane Rental Corp. in Fontana, Ca.  Unfortunately, this facility was closed in September of 2016."
bad,Racism and sexist remarks run amok at will from top senior management and honestly this place was kind of disgusting and I was a top producer! Who even cares about this place other than the database which has been established from 1947. Other than that this firm should be shut down!
bad,"Was a temp job and didn't expect much.  Was placed in a great company, however the recruiter at Robert Half was not so nice and or helpful with answering questions."
bad,"It's all about the company, not about the employee. Does not offer career advancement or competitive benefits. Look at it as a transition job and nothing more."
bad,This office team company is unprofessional and Is not up front with you. They waited till the last moment to tell me I was fired and could not return the the job they placed me at.  Beware of this shady company they also assign u to low level jobs only paying $ 11.00 per hr. They pick and choose who they give the better jobs to training also was minimal which set me up to fail. They are horrible and you are better off finding your own job or going through a more professional staffing agency.
bad,"This job I care not to elaborate on in details.  It just wasn't the fit for me.  To many chiefs and no Indians, and the level of which they talk to you is belittling to a human being."
bad,i worked with Robert half technology two years with same pay some time i get call other time not for months they don't call. if handler quite they leave you hanging.
bad,I went for an interview and filled all paperwork out to start a job when they found placement. It has been 4 months I have yet to get a call. I have emailed the case manager and I got a electronic reply stating she was on vacation. I have never heard anything back from the company. Not good for someone willing and eager to work
bad,Take forever to find you a new job and their communication between you and them is very little. I would have to blow up their email constantly just to be updated
bad,Candidates truly get phenomenal service from the staffing managers at RH Accountemps. They go out and find or create positions for members of the community.
bad,Temporary rotated employees by lying about future opportunities. If they was an opportunity it was last minute with no time to flex schedule. If car trouble due to lack of finances rotating. There was no give and take. I actually thought I might be 5 minutes late and left a message with the front desk because my recruiter was not present. Then showed up on time. That recruiter later argued with me that I was fired for being late when I was actually late one time. Since she didn't know first hand.
bad,"Not professional at all. "
bad,"It was ok.... but who really wants to work for a temp agency. Ok if you are desperate for work and are here on limited work permits etc, but otherwise not a good long term solution"
bad,"I thought this would be a great place to work then about 3 months in the negativity started. There is no positive reinforcement. There are unrealistic metrics that are hammered down and you are held accountable to meet. It's virtually impossible. The successful people here have had clients for years and have been there for years. It takes a good 2 years before you can start getting the repeat business from clients and during that time you are ridiculed and humiliated during ""board"" meetings about where all of your candidates and job orders are. It's a very exhausting place to work. You are drained mentally and emotionally. There are no competitive benefits. The only thing good that comes from this job is you can go to any job and do anything because there has been no training and you're running a full desk all by yourself. You gain time management skills, and are able to work in any start up or fast paced environment."
bad,"Short assignments and no replacement. Then if there is a new job, office team will rather hire new people for the job and leave the old applicant hanging."
bad,"People should stay far from this and many other Temp Agencies. They prevent you from getting hired permanent, by imposing fines for their clients hiring early."
bad,"The Chattanooga, TN office is very unprofessional. ""They"" do not return phone calls or emails. It is though its High School Girl eat world all over again. Prepare the brown nosing and let the games begin!"
bad,"Very unhappy with the office I worked with.  They were very understanding regarding my phobia of crossing bridges and driving distance to a job at first....After being asked 3 times (same job)  if I would work at a location over a period of a month.  The last time they asked I said no because I drove the route and realized it was too far from my home...I no longer received calls for temp jobs.  I continue to see them post the same position, so it looks like there may be a problem with the employer."
bad,"seldom called with assignments"
bad,"Overall good place to work extensive hours and travel required, just needed a change of pace, too much travel for me and my family. Overall very satisfied"
bad,"Very competitive, cut throat, unfair employer; expectations are to work 12 hour days, no breaks or lunch, unfair pay"
bad,They dont pay peiod!!  $11 an hour--what a JOKE!!!! They expect people to work for less than $12 an hour for Professional positions. Are you kidding me??? Who wants to work here!  Poor management team.
bad,"treat employees like children, micro management and terrible culture. Rude employees and even ruder and more arrogant managers, who do not know how to manage people. Most managers have progressed up from sales so usually have zero management skills. Very bad culture with high staff turnover."
bad,The office in richmond va is stealing information. They have you register collect your social and personal information and never call you back or follow up. Voicemails go un answered
bad,"People here are rude never returned any phones calls and sometimes would hang up in my face, now in the beginning everything was great everyone was very professional but they seem to have gotten a little too comfortable."
bad,"For temporary agency, they are wonderful to work with.  They check in with you to make sure the position they place you is going well."
bad,"There was no typical ""day at work"" because there was no work available but once! The office location in Philadelphia will take in anyone to meet their weekly quotas but do not truly care to assist and help indidviduals find work. There are too many temp agencies forming contracts with companies which forces people to have to apply through poor companies as this one. They will give you the lowest amount possible to work, find you something once and never hear from them again, and never consistent with anything. Very disappointing. I honestly wish I had the experience from the offices as some of the other comments are stating in their states. Go with another agency or at least try to go to companies direct sites to apply. Or even better, start your own business. Good luck!"
bad,stressful worked for concentra in Oakland. NEVER AGAIN. Some times no one was there to be able to help you when it got a little crazy. No one would help answer the phones when you were busy with patients.
bad,"At least the Dayton office is poor, can't speak for the others. They allow all. Kinds of abuses to be heaped on their employees and refuse. To listen to employees when they are told of this. Pay is below average when compared with the local pay scale."
bad,"this company does alot of training to place you and then leaves you and doesnt aid you in finding a career you are looking for but what they have, no direction"
bad,Robert Half as a company is only concerned with client not it's temporary employee's.  I was having issues and I made the decision to end my temp job and I was yelled at by RH agent.
bad,"This agency does not find you work unless they have run out of friends and favorites of theirs. The other situation I found was that my fabulous agent was looking for a job  for herself and was focused on that. Once she found one, she left."
bad,"I found that they gave the run around and would never give a straight answer.  Would say they are interested but would never get a call back for many assignments.  Needless to say, I no longer have anything to do with them"
bad,took the time to do the FaceTime call and submit all my information  been 6 months... haven't hear a word from the  on any employment opportunities was a complete waste of time
bad,would never recommend them. its horrible to work at a temporary agency. they tell you last minute when they done need you to work for them anymore. have
bad,"My day to day duties are varied and interesting. I have learned many new things about the franchising business, The management at First Light are friendly and always eager to answer questions. This is a smal company where everyone helps others."
bad,"Not So friendly coworkers, Low Pay, No Organization for training what so ever. Not only do they have no organization but the training was over a computer and when I acknowledged the issues I had encountered with the training I was released from the position."
bad,A typical day at work was great and educational; the management area was great too.  The people were personable.  I really enjoyed working there.  it most enjoyable.
bad,"I also have been applying for jobs there and different people calls me from that office and nothing positive as of now since 2014, I tried to talk to them about an assignment and they never listen to me so f--- them"
bad,Hated my job with them. Never got paid for the 2 weeks I put in and I couldn't fight with HR to get my payment. I don't recommend these guys at all. Avoid at all costs.
bad,"I would not ever recommend working for them to anyone."
bad,"They are snobby and all work off of you just coming in to get a position.   Not professional."
bad,I was interviewed by the agent at Robert Half. They post fake postings. They don't have any jobs. They will send you to work for few days here and there. The interviewer was rude and very unprofessional. No benefits and no guarantees.
bad,"This was a legal temp job with a sweatshop like environment. It's fine if you are desperate for work out of law school, but there is certainly no long term enjoyment to be found here."
bad,"they worked hard to get you into the right fit for a position.  Staffing agents had great follow up while under contract with companies and they really wanted you to succeed where they placed you .  If you weren't comfortable, they would place you in another position"
bad,I have very credentials and I have applied for a job and they told me they would help me find an opportunity. They get a certain amount from what you are getting paid hourly for recruiting.
bad,This is a temporary agency that places you into jobs on a short term to full term basis depending on the Company and employer you are placed with and you must work a minimum of 6 months before the employer will hire you.
bad,"The experience here has been pretty good. Pay is a little low but you do only work from 9-5. Typical Monday-Friday position. If you are coming from a fast paced environment probably not the place for you. "
bad,"Save yourself some time and just find a permanent job yourself. They will bring you in with promises of all these temp offers and advise you to contact the manager in a week or two to see if there are any jobs. Three weeks and no word. I even emailed the manager and never heard back. Don't waste your time with their ""interview"", it doesn't benefit you and it probably makes their numbers look better."
bad,"I had the worst representative to help me get a temp to hire position.  He would always send me to jobs that I did not have experience for and I look really inadequate, no experience do to this.  I would never recommend anyone to be hired through to agency."
bad,"Worst decision ever for anyone wanting a soul that isn't tainted forever. You don't learn recruiting, you learn everything not to do in talent acquisition. You will be that person who judges everyone by appearance and how easily you can sell them to a client. Manager is a complete moron."
bad,"A typical day at work. Worked as part time receptionhist. Each position had different equipment. Worked at 10 places. The training was necessary, and the hardest part of the job."
bad,"Based off of my experience with Office Team in San Diego, this company is a waste of time. When you initially go in for you interview, they act as though it's going to be a piece of cake finding you something when in actuality, they don't have many opportunities... which to me, was a surprise because San Diego is a large city. I was able to find a job without their help within a month. Within that month, not once did they contact me. They contacted me over a YEAR later to tell me they have a position available that I'm qualified for. I'm finding it hard to believe that they didn't have not one opportunity for me that entire time. They're just not attentive or consistent. Mind you I type 50/wpm and have a good deal ofclerical/office experience. I see they have plenty of opportunities listed on indeed and though I'm apprehensive, I'll be seeing what they have in store now that I'm in a new location. As I'm reading all these other reviews though, I can already tell it'll be a waste of time once again."
bad,There is nothing good to say about the company. It was sold to me one way and was nothing I have ever seen in the world of sales and marketing. There are better firms than this one.
bad,"Sent to various businesses.  Not hired on, Not called for jobs anymore, Went to safety warehouse.  only good thing is if you work hard for those companies you could be hired on permanently with them."
bad,"I must say they was fast, I was contacted on a Tuesday and working on a Thursday... However the catch was the job description was not what I applied for and the job site was just as bad. The pay is not worth the hassle, and the recruiters are horrible they only care for their checks. My best advice go find you own path they aren't worth the hassle or anxiety of trying to find another. I wouldn't dare send a recommendation."
bad,"Robert Half does not provide a good work/life balance, nor do you ever feel secure in your position.  The turnover is extremely high, and you are constantly being micromanaged."
bad,I've work for this company where you work for someone who tells you have a job and in the end it become a waste of time after passing there screening while someone sit behind a desk taking half your wage.  making someone look good on a temporary bases
bad,Had me come in for a 2 hr interview only to never call me for a job. One year later (guess it was somebody job to update there report)call me to come in for a interview and I let the have it. Don't waste your time they won't call
bad,They do not tell you about the postings they truly have available. They try to fill the low paying jobs and jobs no one wants but the jobs that are worth something they keep for the people they want to offer them to. This temp agency does not work in the favor of the person lookiing for a job who is supposed to be their client they are more so advicating for the company looking for someone to hire. They have poor attitudes and terrible customer service. I think they care more about how many people they can get to fill out paperwork and sign up than about actually doing their job and finding people work. Worst temp agency around!
bad,"RHI is a terrible company to work for.  I have never been paid for work that I did while on assignment.  This is despite the fact that I have documentation proving that I worked after the time on my time card.  If there was a star rating lower than one, I would choose it."
bad,"I hated this accounts payable assignment. there were too many people in too little space. the management wasn't pleasant either."
bad,"This is not a good nor a professional place to work.  US bank next to CBS Group is the location. There are temps who have been there for 2 years n still have not been hired on.  No benefits,  no raises.  The supervisor there is not the up most honest person n when asking a question team leaders walk away being rude.  They require NO talking among u n ur Co workers,  however US bank employees are allowed to talk loud,  accept phone calls at their work station,  laugh n stand around doing nothing.  Of course this is just my opinion n my views of this place as a temp worker working there."
bad,This was my favorite workplace in my career. Co-workers were very much like family to me.Unfortunately management was not open to new ideas and the temp agency didn't help at all.
bad,"The first interview is great and they spend lots of time with you.  After that, it's been a poor response and even though qualified, I never heard back.   In talking with others, I have found out that others experience the same.   They told me you had to call in each day to let them know your available."
bad,They only send you to different locations that are not even close to the job you actually applied. They don't care about the employee.
bad,"Most unfriendly work atmosphere to work in ever - worked for 5 accountants and had no assistance for all the typing and data entry that was required along with copying, billing and mailing tax forms to clients"
bad,I asked for feedback wondering maybe i was doing something wrong at least help me correct the issue. I was never late to an assignment or called out. The agency just stop calling with jobs.
bad,"They were able to find me employment opportunities where I mostly provided short-term project assistance. The jobs themselves were nothing special or anything worth writing home about, but as short-lived as they were, they fulfilled a need."
bad,"Jobs were typically not as described.  Enjoyed the flexibility of being able to work as little or as much as possible.  What I did not like was the positions were advertised, I would apply, and then when I got to the temp office, they were ""no longer available"".  Another time I was given inaccurate information of the employer's position."
bad,"Broken promises of being hired and then let go once they hired someone new. "
bad,"The office in Beachwood Ohio is the worst. They never call you back, they're never able to come to the phone, positions get cancelled by the companies before placement even starts, and they never try to place you with employment. I don't know how they're still in business."
bad,"I did a lot of contract work for Office Team through Robert Half. Was good a few years ago, now has really died down. Would not recommend!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
bad,Worst company ever worked for and high turnover.  Most persons last 9 months and then are terminated or leave due to burn out.  Meetings just to have meetings.  Metrics over quality.  All about volume
bad,"Most assignments environment were hostile, unclean, unsafe, and unfriendly. I found out that the agency had never viewed the working sites to verify the safety and surroundings of where they were sending their employees. Turn over for employees, replacing prior employees in those surroundings were high, so much that employees would go to lunch and never go back, sometimes work one day and never return, allowing for a third or fourth employee to be replaced on the assignment. You are just a body to go out on assignments to create revenue for the agency regardless of the working condition."
bad,"Was interviewed and hired immediately in August, did all the paperwork and questionnaires and received no responses from the staff regarding any new assignments. It's now October and still no one answers my emails with requests for new assignments. Not only that but they don't bothering emailing you back when you send them your updated resume either. Don't bother with this company, they promise new daily assignments and then forget about you."
bad,"I'm still registered with both sides of Robert Half and have only managed to get ONE job from Office Teams, and that was for an 8 hour shift for $9.00 an hour.  NOT IMPRESSED!"
bad,"OfficeTeam offers a specialized approach to administrative staffing. With a global database of highly skilled administrative professionals, OfficeTeam has the resources, experience and expertise necessary for the right match, right now. OfficeTeam places positions from administrative assistants and executive assistants to customer service representatives and receptionists. Our customers are so satisfied with our services that 9 out of 10 would recommend OfficeTeam to a colleague."
bad,"After taking the Microsoft Office program tests online, and scoring well, I never heard back from them. I called but could not reach my agent. I am very disappointed in this company as I really expected more!"
bad,They did not match me well in the beginning and they paid horribly. I feel as though most of the money they charged the company was kept and I was not given too much compensation. They did match me with a great company in the end but I would not work with this agency again.
bad,I was given the run around and one of the client`s ID I actually had a manager there that called me a n!! $$ When I expressed how I felt to the manager I was terminated when my infant got sick. This company was suppose to get my belongings but I had to call every day with no luck. Worst experience ever would not recommend to anyone....
bad,"I worked for Accretive Health through Accountemps. Both companies are unethical and races. Accountemps conducts unethical background checks and I will never work for them ever again because of their dirty tactics not too employ African-Americans. Truthfully, the good reviews are the Accountemps Recruiters and not their employees. Disgruntle, I’m not but unethical Accountemps are!!!! I am going to most definitely post this review on Glassdoor.com as well."
bad,"I was placed with a company that does not allow breaks and people eat their lunch at their desk so work can continue.  Plus, the place was ran by a narcissist who would train you to do something and then ask you why you did it.   When I asked to be placed somewhere else, I was told to shut my mouth and do my job."
bad,They hounded me to apply for two jobs. I went on one interview and never heard from them again. I just wanted some feedback on how I could better myself but they wouldn't take the time to return calls or emails.
bad,"After multiple attempts to engage the placement staff, I simply gave up. They do not respond to emails or messages and they create your pitch profile to companies without allowing you to preview the information.  Applicants beware."
bad,This company is useless they give you the run around  they have you thinking you'll be placed with an assignment but you always have to call them and they still dont place you with anything the Richmond Va location sucks WHAT A TRUE WASTE OF TIME
bad,"I have been applying for  paralegal positions and calling in order to know the statute of my applications. They do not get my phone calls."
bad,Easily the worst place I've ever worked in my life. I'll choose to not go into detail... Upper management was terrible. I wouldn't recommend this company to anyone.
bad,"Not a good plAce to work at. They are very unorganized."
bad,"This is a company that asks for so much upfront, but gives you nothing in return. Work for the them if you like to have your time wasted. Avoid them."
bad,"Robert Half agency ""half"" is correct, they do not place employees to match well with qualifications or personality of person. I strongly discourage anyone applying to this agency."
bad,People are rude and miserable.  Traffic was awful.  Pay scale is way below my range. The weather was good.  Lots of activities if you have money.  I'm a CUBS fan.
bad,"Robert half employees are extremely rude. To make more than half of what they charge employers, you would think they would be nicer. They also lie to get their way, Stay away from this company"
bad,"I wouldn't even recommend working for this company to my worst nightmare. ""Ethics first"" is supposedly the companies number one priority, but Robert Half is not ethical at all."
bad,"Was not what i expected. Terrible customer service, did not give much preparation for temporary position. After temporary position expires, they never call you again."
bad,"I got one good assignment, then nothing. After calling again, everyone I knew had left, no one knew me there. I had to start all over again. They don't return phone calls and don't pick up when you call.  Not a good vibe in general there, unfriendly. Not sure about other cities but the office in Denver sucks."
bad,"I worked for 5 months at a horrible assignment. I emailed office team multiple times about finding me another assignment. I called and told asked them to find something else and was told they were working on it. I made several complaints about the company they placed me at without them ever doing anything. The company ended the assignment. Once they did, the people at office team refused to speak to me on the phone. They promised they would call me back. I never heard from them. Then when a job called and asked about me they gave me a bad reference and cost me the job. At first, they seemed like they cared and once they placed me it was like forget you."
bad,The company makes a lot of money from the company the contract with but pay their employees next to nothing.  They send you on interviews where company's do not hire you. The manager are very rude and blunt.
bad,"Unhappy there is more sitting at home -- not enough work for me at least. No daily, weekly or monthly follow-up.  I have not been given enough work to rate this job."
bad,"Worse company ever, waste of time, extremely unprofessional, horrible people!!! Don't keep their promises and they expect you to run for them but they will not do it for you! They should be shut down!!!"
bad,"The people that work there are clueless! No work, waste of time! I found them to be arrogant selfish recruiters that don't care about you once you sign up with them. Stay away!"
bad,Its a fun place to work for. The company offers opportunities to learn and grow. The company offers a variety of field to chose from.
bad,"no interviews for a CPA with 20 years experience, unqualified workers, gave me accounting test, unprofessional, did not seem to recognize my background to hit the ground running"
bad,This company has high reviews but don't fall for that because once you start a job for them they pretty much abandon you they are only in it for the money.  If you happen to make any mistakes on the job even just small ones their mentality is we can easily replace you with someone else and they have no empathy at all should you have issues with the job.  Do not work for them definitely try another staffing agency.
bad,I have a very strong resume. This people are arrogant recruiters that see you as merchandise and treat you like garbage. Stay away from them!!!!!
bad,"If you like menial office labor with almost no opportunity for gaining a full time position in toxic office environments, then go them for assignments.  Extremely fickle environment, they can forget about you just as quickly as they accept you in the first place."
bad,The recruiter don't seems like actively finding me a job. Even if I already signed the contract last month. Just lose my hope in agencies. WORST EVER!
bad,I loved the  coworkers  because we  were in the same  boat. The jobs  are not  hard but the Robert Half managers make them impossible since the only focus is KPIs.
bad,"I have worked with Accountemps for over a year. Their pay scale is terrible compared to other temp agency. I would not recommend anyone to work for them. Especially, the Buckhead GA office. They keep all the money for themselves and offer you pennies. How can Accountemps get paid more money than the individual doing the work? We are the ones putting wear and tear on our vechiles and doing the work. While the recruiters are sitting in their offices getting over! I hate this company!!!"
bad,"Overworked, underpaid, recruiters that don't care....dare I say typical? If you've ever worked for RH then you know. They employ you but take half of your pay cheque - hence the name."
bad,Its a temp agency they dont pay me enough money to live just enought to pay my cell phone bill and my car insurance most of the jobs they send me to are only 4 hrs im looking for a full time job
bad,The position often time are beneath you and the wage are low. You'll work here and there but not enough income to pay your bills on a constant basis.
bad,"My first experience with a temp agency. After working with recruiter I will never recommend this company. Very unprofessional manager in Northern Virginia.  Never paid according to schedule. Pay rate was less than half of what RHI charged for placement. Account Manager discussed personal information with insubordinat staff and upon resignation of employment,  I  filed a complaint with corporate office. "
bad,"answer phones, "
bad,"amazing place to work with supportive management. Its not all about  numbers but how you personally grow and develop. but this expect from a big company . the most enjoyable part about this company is working with my colleagues and learning from them , about team work"
bad,It was a very bad experience with Account temps! They don't tell you anything in advanced. I will not ever use them for a job placement.
bad,Obtained a lot of different experiences while working in several different companies.  Majority of them were manufacturing companies that had me produce several invoices for customer payment.
bad,It was very hard to work for a temp agency with out the stability of a job and knowing that you could be laid off for the job at anytime.
bad,"Good people, pleasant atmosphere, willing to work with the individual in finding the right job for them. They have open availability to make appointments when needed."
bad,Their training for their positions aren't very professional and don't have any programs in place for their training. Their management isn't very respectful or supportive toward their employees.
bad,This job is best for those who are not looking to commit to a permanent position.  Beware though because some assignments are not in your line of work.
bad,Temp work for customer service jobs.  Hours were good and pay was okay for a temp agency.  The people at the office were a little impatient with providing any assistance with questions unless speaking directly with a manager.
bad,"Terrible place to work hands down, no one spoke English. I was working with illegals that couldn't understand me when I spoke English and didn''t even try. Customers would get upset that the cashiers were pushy and rude it was frustrating apologizing for there lack of manners."
bad,"I have found that working for them, they are paid $50-$75hr for yoru contract but they pay you $17-$20 no matter how much experience you have or how much work is required of you.  They make you feel more like a number than they do a person."
bad,"I feel that a have much more value to bring to an employer than the number of calls I can make a day.  The emphasis was on ""quantity"" over ""quality"" which is not aligned with what I believe makes both an employee and a company successful, or promote a culture of professional growth."
bad,Micro managed to death. They could care less about staff. More interested in activity than results.Management had no idea how to manage or motive or incent staff.
bad,"I'm an experienced Admin Asst with recent CSR/Call Center experience. I can not get a nibble out of the sweatshop call center mode. They sent me a form letter saying IF I'm found to be a fit, they will contact me and sent me a link to UK based jobs."
bad,"I was warned prior to my assignment to stay away from these guys."
bad,"After going through the interview process and the TESTS they require which are designed for much higher positions that pay a lot more than they are willing to do, they will use all of your knowledge and eagerness to make them look good.  It is to their advantage to keep you as a low paid temporary employee so they don't have to pay benefits, vacation time, sick leave, retirement funding, etc.  I would not recommend working for this temporary service.  "
bad,Working there taught me simple people skills and how to interact with customers on a day to day basis. These skills have allowed me to become the professional that I am today!
bad,"12 hour workdays and negative workplace. Lots of hostility between the different teams.  A few employees consistently caused trouble, but were considered leaders in the workplace. Something I had never before seen in a workplace to this extent."
bad,Robert Half staffing agency is one of the best staffing companies to work for. They value their employees as well as their clients. I have been sent out on assignments to some great companies that have lasted a year or so. They also offer a bonus after so many hours of service.
bad,"Very unorganized systems, no training, poor work life balance, have to work long hours, you are expected to work through lunch and stay late if your numbers aren't met"
bad,i would recommend this company to junior and intern people not mid level sr and for sure not for architects
bad,"I loved multi-tasking, assuming responsibilities and duties while coaching other employees and managing people.  I learned a lot of new skills to the benefit of the company. This establishment  promises professional growth and was  proven to be an important factor in retaining and satisfying employees, and I found that extremely interesting."
bad,Staff is rude and unhelpful. So glad to hear their company is in trouble.
bad,"DONT DO BUISNESS WITH THESE PEOPLE. THEY TAKE MORE THEN HALF OF YOUR PAY. I WAS GETTING PAID 9 AN HOUR AND FOUND OUT THE COMPANY WAS PAYING 17 AN HOUR....THATS LIKE WORKING A SIDE JOB FOR THEM. AND THEY MADE AN AGREEMENT TO KEEP ME AT THAT RATE FOR MORE THEN 2 YEARS AND REFUSED TO WORK WITH THEM TO GET ME HIRED ON SOONER. "
bad,"They are messed up, they do not communicate between themselves let alone with clients or contract help. They are out for the buck not the long run."
bad,"I was hired as a ""temp to hire"" for a non-profit, via Office Team/Robert Half.  I was advised that they did not have any employees on staff who were bilingual and that I would be a great asset to fill a vacant position.  When I arrived at the job site, it was a SURPRISE to the current and bilingual employee who had the position, that she was being replaced!  It was a hostile take over, and we (the temps) were put into an uncomfortable position.  I in no way wanted to be associated with such a dishonest company!  If they did that to their loyal employees who had been there 7+ years or more, they would have done it to me.  I relinquished my position and the Office Team/Robert Half recruiter was so unprofessional!  If she would have done her job and found out the background information on the company, then it would have been a nice temp position, but unfortunately, it turned into a nightmare!  Not very professional Office Team!  :("
bad,A typical day at work would be going to the job that they assigned you for either that week or month and doing that task until they come up with another one to give you.  I have learned the many different task because of being assigned to so many different jobs with the agency.  The hardest part if the job is maybe getting use to one assignment and then called to do another once adjusted.  The most enjoyable part of the job was  working with so many other different companies.
bad,"After several times of being dragged into their multiple offices, Denver, Chicago, Columbus, and Milwaukee, I get the same result.  We are going to submit you to jobs XYZ and you call a week later to ask for a status and they play stupid and do not recall your name."
bad,Bad experience with OT.  Jobs on the internet DO NOT EXIST.  Worked at one placement for low pay and was fired and accused of theft.
bad,Robert Half is a thief employment agency. They rip off the employees. I had interview for a technical support position and I had to sign a contract for one year with Robert Half and the pay was $13.00/hr. Another employment agency the same position were paying $15.00/hr. I guess the actual pay was $17.00/hr.
bad,The temp service will help place you in a great job. The pay is kind of low but if your in need of something to get started great temp. service to start with.
bad,The office in FFX is horrible.  They kept telling me 7 months ago that they would call back for a position.  After 7 months they told me that I don't have a recent work experience!!!!  I called the office manager in FFX but they never returned my call!!!!  It just made me feel like I was ignored !!!!  Never call them or contact them again
bad,"Search all day for companies to work with, get chased by union thugs, sell, sell, sell, build your territory, have territory split in half after you grow it."
bad,"Robert Half Legal found me a decent placement that helped me reenter the legal profession.  It has not, however, taken responsibility for making sure the pay rate reflects my job description."
bad,"This was my first experience with OfficeTeam.  I noticed in the reception area several applicants arrived after me, but were called for interviews ahead of me.  Finally, I interviewed with a very hostile young lady.  Everything about her was negative and unprofessional.  No smile, just a glare and a slew of negative comments.  Unfortunately, I must agree this organization does not welcome people of color.  This was by far the worst experience I have encountered in the workplace."
bad,Have had more interviews on my own then through this company... Every time I call them they are either in a meeting or out of the office... Never return phone calls... If I call about a job they listed its always taken or they have no idea what I am taking about.
bad,"I was given this assignment immediately (long-term position) after registering with OfficeTeam. The commute was great even though I took the train (one stop away). I was trained with a crash course on Monday, filing and lifting heavy boxes by Wednesday and by the end of the week, Friday, I said my good nights & have a good weekend to all. Only to later receive a call from my recruiter stating I was no longer needed due to the errors I made. I was there a week and worked on something other than what I was hired for but was let go as quickly as I started. "
bad,"If you try to work for them a second time FOR GET IT!!!!!  I was told we should have something in no time.  That was 3 months ago.  I have sent emails and called. Nothing.  I don't know what has changed other than my age.  I guess they are like every other company, if you are over 50 they don't want you."
bad,"The work environment was good, and I learn about Accounting."
bad,"If you are like me, and genuinely want to start your career. I reccomend doing everything except working with Office Team. They hardly explain the position before you get to the interview, so you show up unprepared. They mainly contract with awful companies regardless. You have to follow up with them, they act like you are their number one priority but it couldn't be further from the truth. I felt like I was searching harder than them."
bad,"I loved to work with Officeteam for 5 years they provided me with temporary work. Then they brought on new staff and they do not return calls now, never have any assignments worth working at. The Manager at this branch is rude and lies when you call her saying that she is not there when she answers the phone.. I would not waste my time working with any of them."
bad,The job assignment ended within a month with no warning. I wasn't placed with another assignment and no follow up call was made to see if I found another job.
bad,"There were 3 different positions, I had with Robert Half. All had data entry with Payroll, A/P, and A/R.  A little bit of receptionist work  was included with all 3.All the co-workers were extremely considerate, helpful and willing to assist in all areas."
bad,"Terrible, Bad, very Bad treatment of Consulting!"
bad,"The Davenport, Iowa branch manager (Erin) is AWFUL!!!  This place was absolutely terrible to work for.  I have never been treated so poorly in my life!!!  If you're looking for work, go to another staffing service in the Quad Cities.  Trust me, you'll be glad that you did!!"
bad,"This was the worst place I have ever worked! They only call on a select few for the jobs listed."
bad,"I'm an IT/ Computer Support Tech with 18 years of experience. Did a face to face interview in November and never heard anything else from these totally unprofessional guys. I called numerous times and couldn't ever speak to my so-called representative (they apparently screen your calls) and when I applied for numerous positions, I got an initial call-back, but when I called them back I never got a response. Not sure what is up with this branch,but in my opinion they are USELESS! Good luck to others, because they did nothing for me and I am more than qualified. As soon as I discussed salaries, I was informed not to expect over $50,000 (although I just left a job making over $60,000) so that was discouraging from the start. I won't waste any more of my time answering any of their job ads!"
bad,"I left my current employer which was a private university with full time  benefits for a job at Robert Half Technologies. Robert Half offered me a job at Hospital Corporation of America (HCA). I was given 6 months to become permanent and was guaranteed a full time position at HCA. I informed my recruiter and the HCA manager at both interviews that I am not leaving my current position at a whim and that I take my career seriously. I started at HCA on Oct. 14, 2013 and my contract was terminated on Dec. 06, 2013. I was there for only 3 months. I was terminated 2 weeks before Christmas. I was not given a reason and no discussion about my employment performance, no evaluation, no chance or meeting to see how I could improve my performance at HCA. When I asked Robert Half Technologies about my termination they told me there was no information given by HCA. When you are terminated for poor performance then you are told you are not a good employee. I don't hold Robert Half Technologies wholly responsible but Robert Half Technologies has not made good, after a month of being unemployed and can not trust them or HCA to offer me reliable employment. Texas jobs"
bad,"Ok if you want to temp"
bad,"Once you have worked for a temporary company, it is NOT Wise use them to weed out people who need Long term, dependable employment."
bad,"In 5 months, I've had two interviews. I was well qualified for both positions. I know how lax recruiter is with me - does not communicate well and will call at last minute to say an interview has been set up. She will say that she will call me right back and never does.  For some reason, I am working with a recruiter that I did not originally interview with and she gives off a ""I really don't care about you feeling"".  I get the impression that once the interview is over with, she does not communicate well with the prospective employer to try to reinforce my experience and qualifications or advising of my excellent employment references."
bad,"I was given an assignment through this company at the most unfriendliest real estate company."
bad,"Office Team Hawaii Staffing including the managers and directors are very unresponsive to any my questions and concerns about, time sheet inquiries and other possible job position availabilities. I got the feeling that they care more about how many contracts they can get and money and not caring about the employees (me). Unprofessional, unfriendly, and non productive management. I asked Office Team if my part-time temp to hire position would be considered soon and no one replied back to me as I continued to work for the client Native Hawaiian Veterans for 5 months straight without sick leave. "
bad,NO guarantee.......this will go FT....the recruiters tell you it may go FT..not the case. I was tired of this....Contract...Temp work...  FT is what I want...
bad,"I had a job with them for one whole week the whole time everyone was saying what an amazing job i was doing and how good i was, yet a week later i get home and get a phone call sayig that although i was doing very good they were going to have to let me go. And that was the last i heard from them. All the time they had me spend filling out paperwork so that they could help me find a good job was for nothing because i never got a call back from any of them. I called and left messages and still nothing. I have worked with temp agencies before and they never treated me like this! I hope that no one is treated like i was because it stinks to be treated like you are not important to a company that specializes in helping people."
bad,"Not only was I offered a low rate for the position but then the company wanted to buy-out my contract (hire me on permanently as their own employee). I, personally, contacted the office to inform them that my supervisor wanted to negotiate their ""finders fee"" of 35% of MY ENTIRE ANNUAL INCOME (YES, THEY DO NOT TELL YOU THAT USING THIS METHOD THEY EFFECTIVE PROHIBIT ANY PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYERS FROM HIRING YOU PERMANENTLY BECAUSE EMPLOYERS DO NOT WANT TO PAY THIS EXORBITANT AMOUNT! IF THAT AMOUNT IS PAID, IT COMES DIRECTLY FROM YOUR INCOME AND LEAVES YOU MAKING LESS THAN IF YOU STOOD TEMPING FOR THE AGENCY!!)  THEY NEVER EVEN CALLED MY SUPERVISOR TO WRAP-UP THE PROCESS!!!"
bad,I had a job that unexpectedly ended and the agency refused to pick up my things from the office for a week.
bad,"They ask you to write down the requested amount you would like to be paid and the lowest amount you are willing to accept. When I was called for interview for a financial institution, she tried to pay me $2.00 les than I asked for. I advised her that that was not what I agreed to. She stated she would try to get me more. I went to the job interview on a Thursday. The guy wanted me to start on Monday. I asked if I could start a week later and he said, ""sure"". This staffing agency never returned my calls and avoided me."
bad,"The Colorado Springs location was extremly helpful in placement and followed through with questions even after I left this location. I would give them 5 stars across the chart. I can never say enough great things about the recruiters at Accountemps and Office Team. They are extremely missed. "
bad,"If you're a job seeker with gaps mainly by a few years, they'll question you about it and decide if you're a good enough worker to partake in jobs through Officeteam. Caution, they don't always make the right choice."
bad,"One of the worst Companies to find you a job. The recruiters are uneducated and some are very rude. They never did or will care about the candidates. Please, please DO NOT waste your time calling them and having them find you a good job. TRUST ME, I KNOW they WILL NOT help me. THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL EMPLOYMENT AGENCY AND TOTALLY USELESS. Move forward and do NOT try to use them in order to find a job. They are AWFUL."
bad,"no positive comment, made promises for jobs and never followed through."
bad,they where very inconsistent with work. they would call you the day of 2 hours before you where suppose to be at a job. which means your rushing no time to get ready an no notice.
bad,"OK on the perm side, temp side pays far below market. Working in house may be the worst job I have ever been at including a car wash in the winter."
bad,"-rarely get calls for jobs, even though I am eligible and apply online AND call their offices regularly!"
bad,"I had an interview with this company. When I got there they guy told me that they don’t have any open positions for the position I came to interview for. I asked myself why the heck you would waste someone’s time like this. To find out the, guy really wanted was me to give up connections in my current company so he could contact them for recruiting. This is an unethical business practice. "
bad,Been trying to find a decent opportunity for about 2 years to no avail. Interviews and testing is how they make their $$. Don't waste your time.
bad,"Very Smug staff, your truly are just a number and extremely low pay! I recently started my own firm and this is the last of the recruiters I would ever use. Really need to do more research on the companies you send people to. The place I and 4 others reported to was horrible!! We all found other employment outside of Robert Half. Will NEVER use this firm again."
bad,Compensation was horrible with no benefits. No sense of job security and no way to advance.
bad,...pretend that they don't exist.
bad,Unbearable. Oppressive and depressing environment. Stay away.
bad,"I was swayed into returning to Borders (which ultimately went out of business) by a recruit. They promise the world and after they get their commission, they vanish like a ghost."
bad,"low pay, no proper training, pushy, poor management. only focused on sales and pushing what you could do but never stopped to recongize what you were already doing. focused on numbers. HIGH turnover, saw 5 people get fired in 6 months for NO reason"
bad,"I didn't care for the way they treated their employees, like we were easily replaceable. It's okay if you just need a quick job until you find another, but don't keep working for them. My duties at my temp assignment included paying Robert Half for my time, and they made double my pay. It makes you feel sick in your stomach."
bad,I interviewed and took the standard clerical aptitude test. I scored at least 85% on all aspects. The first assignment was for one day @ $8.50. The assignments that followed were very similar. I felt like I was a second class citizen that could barely speak English.
bad,"I worked for three years ago and they paid me 21. Loved the recruiter, she always placed me fast and I always had good reviews turned back to them. Working for the clients is great it is the fact that they charge their clients an 80% markup to have you. Then the Recruiting Manager tries to tell you its the economy or that you need to lower your expectations in pay. Seeing that I made 21 before my degree I dont see why I should settle for 16 after obtaining my masters. By the time I pay taxes and daycare I would be working for 11,000 a year! Thaks but no thanks!"
bad,Called in by multiple recruiters so they can make their 'weekly quota' even when no jobs are available.
bad,"Worked in the Woodbridge, NJ office for the Technology Division and had the worst experience of my career. Do not bother."
bad,Robert Half cares more about it's clients than it's employees. I would only work for them as a last option.
bad,"I was at a position for over 3 weeks with great reviews then one lady came back from holidays and within 1 hour I was horrible, how can you go from great to bad in 1 hour because one person comes back from holidays, and rather than take the 3 weeks prior great results and reports, they took the side of the company, did not stand by me what so ever."
bad,Great company
bad,"I find the office Milwaukee, WI to be very unprofessional and robotic."
bad,They send me out on a job and lied to the company and said that knew the job. I never did that kind of job. At the end they made sure I didn't get unemployment. I called to talk to higher ups with no straight answers you don't even give you a chance. They are the worst company to work for. Office team Oakland.
bad,I was kept on a job until my background check came back and then I was treated unfairly at Robert Half.
bad,"I was with them for 7 months, they finally found me a job BUT they didn't check all the skills the company wanted and, after 3 weeks, I was let go because I didn't have a required skill. So they promised to find me something within a week. That was 3 months ago. I am still not working."
bad,They are charging 70%-80% over what they pay the temporary and they are told to pay them as low as they can.
bad,"I applied with Robert Half in 2009, re-applied in 2011 and finally got a job. After the job ended, have not heard from them. Just like any other agency, they really don't care about you. I do not recommend them. The pay is low the hours are short."
bad,"I have recently found I job and it had nothing to do with Accountemps or Robert Half. I will say this about the Knoxville, TN. office, if they call you and say that they have a job possibility for you and you tell them that you are not interested they will never call you again for a job. They will not even answer your emails, even if a job on their website matches your abilities. So if they call you about a job you better say that it sounds like something you are interested in, otherwise they will completely ignore emails and phone calls. I know from experience because I have dealt with them twice in the past eight years and this has happened twice. I both cases I was working as a temp though another agency and the Temp job was better than the job they were offering so I stayed with a temp job and I never heard from them again in both cases. So if you live in the Knoxville area and need a job in accounting industry, you better not turn down a job they think is good for you because once you say no they will act like you never existed."
bad,See Robert Half Review-It was too stressful and I didn't enjoy working there
bad,"They say that they will find you work, but they do not!!!!! I have never gotten a temp job through this company for more than three days."
bad,"Robert Half /Account Temps job Fair in West wood Do NOT GO WASTE OF TIME, i can tell you that their business model is based on purely numbers and creating fake job orders to lure candidates for leads, collect resumes and feed their resume database. And due to the high internal turnover, if you're not in front of a recruiter, then you'll get lost in the shuffle when that recruiter is gone. Then you have to rebuild that relationship all over again 2-3 times in a year. Their employee morale is extremely low and it is one of the lowest paying staffing organizations in business with the highest mark up to their clients. Senior managers themselves admit they don't follow half of the advice they put out on corporate marketing brochures which are used as tools to gain appointments and drum up business from hiring managers"
bad,"21st century slavery. Make more on the project than their consultant.They take complete advantage of you and think if they do it with a smile you won't realize. Lied to me about compensation structure, about the way the contract with employer is built, solicited business to my references and tried to get phone numbers of the hiring mangers I worked with before to solicit to them too. Sleazy practices and greedy salespeople who don't realize people they talk to are not fools. We need some serious regulation in this industry. This has to stop. People need to be aware."
bad,"I feel there is a huge age discrimination at the Indian Wells, Accountemps. I do not believe that they actually look at a job requirements versus your abilities and wage requested and locations."
bad,"Robert Half (Office Team - Sewickley) is the worst temp. agency I ever worked for. Their recuiters are definitely ""Bottom of Barrel"". They lied to me and treated me terribly while on assignment. They will lie to you and stab you in the back to make themselves look good to the company. They DO NOT look out for your interest !"
bad,worked odd jobs.
bad,"They only found me a few places to work. I was put in a place that I was the only female and I was uncomfrontable, working there. They did not keep me busy."
bad,"The Oxnard, CA office used to be one of the best agencies around this area, but no more. The last two times I went in to interview with them everything was grand. Both times I was told how wonderfully qualified I was and how I ""deserved a better job"". Both times, after I left, I heard NOTHING from them even though I continue to apply for job I EASILY qualify to fill."
bad,"I found the staff to be a revolving door, they pay you as little as possible and are only interested in the clients not your happiness. If you turn down a $12 hour assignment they will never call you again even if you are a $50,000+ candidate."
bad,"PHONE PHONE PHONE! If you dont bleed half, they have no respect. Also, its cut throat. Everyone, even your bosses, are ready to steal accounts and hours from you!"
bad,"Robert Half Legal posts a lot of advertisements for jobs that they don't have. Me and a few of my girlfriends agree that we strongly dislike Robert Half Legal. The staff is rude and extremely unprofessional - they're slow at finding you work and if they do - the pay is very very low. Most of the advertisements they post do not exist - they don't have those jobs available - they're looking for new prospective job seekers who recently just left their old job - so they can send other people resumes to your old job . I know the recruiting game - I have being working temporary for a very long time, and I have worked with a lot of emplyment agencies and Robert Half Legal, Michigan Avenue, Chicago, IL is the WORST! I have not heard from them in about a year for an assignment! When you call the agency looking for work - they just transfer you to the recuiter's voice mail. If they do call you its a low paying assignment that you can't afford to take - they're very friendly and very phony because they want you to take the assignment knowing the salary is too low. When you first call them you might think it is a nice agency to work for - but after working for them you find out how phony they really are. In my opinion Robert Half Legal, Chicago, IL is unprofessional and rude!"
bad,"Like most companies in Philadelphia, as long as you're not white they will hire you. Philly has been known for years to not hire black men, and get away with it. Brotherly love ha. I applied, passed all 64 tests administered and when I called back they said,"" Who are you?"" ""We have no record of you ever applying!"" Philly where hidden racism is the norm. I didn't even bother to pursue a complaint because this city favors big business and nothing else. Quite sad indeed. Only apply is you are white or you will never get a call back, you'd be really wasting about 6 hours of your time, that's how long it takes to take all of the tests and paperwork. If your white it's a great place to work."
bad,Not customer service oriented toward the clients. No repsect toward
bad,"I find Robert Half very disappointing. Since I have become available on a part-time level, Robert Half, nor Accountemps, have been to submit me successfully to a part-time position,"
bad,"Pay was terrible based on the job scope. communication between myself, Robert half as well as employer was sub par. All other jobs I was contacted after my assignment was finished were below my abilities with pay being very close to minimum wage."
bad,"Overall I spent 5 years with this company and was a top producer, attending there reach for the stars event. This company treated me very poorly due to the color of my skin. I feel the Regional Manageres are the most unprofessional group in the staffing industry."
bad,They promise you the world when they bring you in. They state they are working on several job opening and they will get back with you. That does not happen. I found a job on my own and feel I wasted my time with them.
bad,"I made the biggest mistake working for RHI. Serveral hiring managers at large companies have told me that they refuse to do business with RHI. Now my resume is an embarrasment with RHI on it. I am an actual employee of RHI as a ""Salaried Professional"" and I feel that this has been a horrible experience, the management is below satisfactory and the people in the Houston office or the most unprofessional I have ever delt with."
bad,I contacted the Accountemps people with hopes they could really get me started on a career or at least some experience in a position that would pay well and offer at least a nice learning experience.
bad,"I have been reading several reviews from different sites, and the complaints are bad. I was working with them for 6 months, nothing but lies and treating you like a second class citizen. My assignment ended very poorly. I will never work for this place ever again. Take the time to read the complaints and you will see the pattern to be the same with everyone. I just wish I read the reviews before they used me."
bad,"I worked for Office Team in Albany, NY a few years ago. I left the assignment after a few weeks because I wasn't getting paid. I had to call their payroll department, on my own time, in order to receive my paychecks. Recently, (2012) one of their recruiters called me saying that they had interesting assignments opening up. I didn't want to return the call, but I could use the work. When I returned the phone call, I was told that the person who called me wasn't ""on the desk"" that day. Whatever, that means. Well, I spoke to someone else who requested that I ""re-register and send in another resume."" I stated ""that I would not re-register""; as I have worked for them in the past. It seems that all of the management and staff of the past have left, and the office is filled with all new people. Well, I have sent two e-mails with my updated resume and have not received a response. Unless you have no other choice, I would not utilize this firm."
bad,"If you're interested in legal work, definitely do not contact this company. I am specifically referring to the New Orleans area."
bad,"At its core company lacks real interest in candidate they interview. I don't sense a champion for the candidate. Constant reminders of inability to pay higher salary in relation to unreasonably high position requirements. I get the sense that profitability for Office Team outweighs interest in candidate getting paid a fair salary in relationship to experience, background and skills."
bad,I would not recommend this agency in Spokane. They have a supervisor named Dee who is extremely unprofessional and underqualified to be in that position. They sent me to a job where the people smoked and yelled at the customers so I asked to be removed and they actually were mad at me for not staying there. I am a professional who will not lower myself simply because they needed to fill a position. They treat you like cattle.
bad,"I interviewed with a recuiter for about 20 minutes since she told me she had to jump right in and get it done -- I think she just wanted to go to lunch -- so I did not get much of a feel for the job prospects she had for me, nor did she want to talk about anything other than remaking my resume (to ""vomit everything up"" that I had done in a certain line of work) to fit the one job I came in for and to hide the fact that I am an older worker. After the interview, I did what she asked and sent the revised resume to her, but after a month's time, 4 emails asking if she had looked it over, and 2 phone calls that have not been returned, I am giving up on this company. The lack of professionalism is incredible. One would think that the recruiter would at least tell me she received the revised resume. I hate to think what type of job she would have placed me into!"
bad,"Was nice but spent two years there, 'under contract,' and no one mentioned that that work was for nothing. In that sense, I mean that I called my 'site' for a reference and they said technically you weren't an employee of ours, but one of Robert Half.  You can how that can become difficult. Your contact at Robert Half can only do so much to vouch for you. So, TLDR, the longer you work may for not as advancement in another job may want but is unable to hear how you did at your previous job. I got around this by adding colleagues."
bad,"Poor communication between recruiters and management. I would suggest using an alternative agency before trying Robert Half. They dodge your calls and provide little to no updates, you literally have to hound them for a call back."
bad,"No return calls when issues with assignment, they do not care  - well - they do care about $$$ in their pockets. "
bad,Only results driven and not a friendly environment. They dont mention you cant make commission until after 1-2 years of time there. Highly recommend not to work there.
bad,"Just  the worst company for considering the needs of employees.  They know you can't quit, as you will quit the job you have. Barest minimum legal requirement so as not to be sued.  They do not care about  you at all."
bad,I have been doing IT Security for over 10 years and I needed a remote position. The client decided that they didn't want to pay for my fte 9 months into a 2 year contract and I was let go without warning and Robert Half did not even attempt to find me a new position. Terrible agency. Totally incompetent management.
bad,Don't expect him to have your back. Don't expect them to go to bat for you when it comes to negotiations of your salary. They look out for themselves.
bad,I've been placed on assignments with RH three times and each time RH has either left me hanging or tried to convince me to stay in very toxic environments. I've written them off completely.
bad,I was placed in a diff dept and job than what I was told I was being sent to. It was a hostile work environment and that dept wasn't hiring at all. RH refused to find other work for me.
bad,Not a place you want to make a career. Most assignments do not pay well. You must work a year to get a week off. They are terrible at returning your calls. If you at an assignment they forget about you until your assignment is over.
bad,"Other than the fun office environment they promote, there's not much more I would say about Robert Half. The management is poor, there is little to no career advancement (they don't look at your tenure/management skills/knowledge of the job, they look at your sales numbers only regardless of your poor management skills). They promise you all this money when you are interviewing but the commission structure is a joke. There is no work life balance, they claim you can work from home but management makes you feel bad if you do as if you're not doing your job. You work 10-12 hour days, and you are expected to work outside the office too if your getting emails or calls. I would not recommend or go back."
bad,"Did not enjoy working for this company. I would not recommend working here. The staffing agents will lead you to believe that the ""contract assignments"" will become ""permanent employment"". This is usually not true."
bad,Robert Half is a very cut-throat environment and is essential a cold-calling call center with suits. I would never recommend anyone to work in this environment.
bad,Applied on-line for a job.  The salary range was between $22-$27 er hour.  Met with the recruiter and was told the job paid no more than 422 an hour. What Office Team does is they bill the client/employer at a higher rate and pay the temp the lower rate so their cut is bigger. When I passed on the job I was then not called for any other jobs.  When I re-apply online and I tell them I am already registered with their agency all of a sudden the jobs are filled and they have nothing for me at this time.  They got called out on their BS and then they do not call you for jobs.
bad,Robert Half provides a lot of training and the opportunity to run your own business.  Each division of each office is like it's own little organization.  Some are great places to work and some have turnover through the roof.  It's a blast if you're on a team that gives you freedom to find your approach.  You're setup for failure if your team does not feel comfortable watching you do well.  Equally bad is a boss with little patience.  It takes time to ramp up.  Be selective if you can before signing up.
bad,"I had six different managers (division directors/branch managers) and over eight different team members in my two years at Robert Half. "
bad,The staff seems to be very busy and sometimes rude when answering the phone . I know that they cannot be that busy . It seems like they might fool around a little to much . Not tentative to their employees or giving fair and professional treatment .
bad,"Don't waste you time at the Las Vegas AccountTemp/Robert Half. They are horrible when it comes to calling you or getting you anything. Never had a problem in another state,  When I call they always have an excuse for everything. Working for the company in another state was fine but Las Vegas is complete a waste of your time."
bad,"Management is terrible, training is worse. Favoritism runs rampant and if your manager seems you unworthy then there is nothing you can do to overcome it. Manager was completely useless and seemed to think negative reinforcement was a great way to drive the moral of the team. Turnover was also atrocious yet management never wanted to look in the mirror and admit they are the problem. Some teams are killing it because of great leadership. I was not lucky."
bad,"While I admire the work ethics and drive that many at Robert Half have there is a cultural tendency of putting individualistic goals over team goals.  A typical day is spending the majority of it on the phone.  I cannot express more the level of training you receive while there though.  It is top notch in my opinion and the most enjoyable part of the organization.  However, the hardest part of the job is attempting to get other recruiters to work with you as a team.  Placing your own candidates on your own job order pays a lot more than placing a candidate on a team members job order.  So, there is a habit by recruiters of hoarding ones candidates for personal gain.  So the workplace environment is one of mistrust, disassociation of the team mentality, and denial of these issues by the veteran establishment."
bad,"Robert Half is known in the staffing industry to be very cut throat, and this was my experience.  This is a great company to work for to get a good foundation in the staffing industry, and is even better for folks coming straight out of college to teach them a good work ethic.  This is not a company that I would recommend for someone who is at a mid to senior level in their career.  The management style here is to micro-manage the employees.  These rolls are 100% inside sales, and the focus is to be on the phone all day; constant dialing."
bad,"Was promised an 180 day assignment, only to find out, once I was there, that the assignment was for 30 days. They made every process difficult and required me to jump through numerous hoops, once I was on assignment, in order to get payed."
bad,"You are in, then out."
bad,I completed one job assignment for them. They needed more ppl at my assignment and i referred 3 people to them. They tested and interviewed for the assignment and never got called for that one but was told they would start in a few days. Then upon completion i was told i would be put on another assignment and wasnt. Ive called and left voicemails and asked for another recruiter and was told i had to stick with that recruiter. A complete waste of time.
bad,"No growth opportunity. Above market pay, but below average benefits. My account: VERY poor senior management. Great place to work at if you are afraid to share constructive ideas to improve the business. VERY cut throat."
bad,"While I was working on an assignment, not once did the account rep check on me or the company I worked for.  When I share d to RH that it was discussions of me being hired, they dropped the ball and several weeks went by.  I reached out to them and they asked me what was the discussion that was transpired in the email.  Very minimal support."
bad,"Robert Half, known as Office Team is a contractor for employment. "
bad,"Have been told numerous times its a trial hire job and later find out the boss likes to go thru and fire people based on tantrums. So, just grabbing for contracts with out investigating the integrity of the employer or the culture of the companies. Also, ganging up on people in the name of rumor spreading and lies. Thought at first it was my imagination then realized it was true. Typical female cattiness. They need to actually investigate rumors and lies and complaints before reacting."
bad,Just an overall awful place to work.  Have 3-4 meetings and 2 conference calls per day and still required to achieve unrealistic goals relating to call production.  Certain reps are spoon fed prime accounts.  Technology is greatly lacking.
bad,"AccounTemps did not keep my busy with assignments, nor did their Management Recruiters contact with regards to a perm placement.  I do not recommend them."
bad,"Worst Job I ever had!  I worked internally, not as a temp. They lure you in with a promise of work Life balance, but NOT SO! A 10 or day is not enough for them.  BEWARE!!!!"
bad,"They are like used car sales people, they will tell you anything to make money.  "
bad,I worked for a call center through Office Team and once my assignment ending I have never received a call back from any assignments I apply for and that was in 2011 when I did work for them. Jobs are usually decent if you can get them to call you to work. Also when I have gone to the office they seem snobby and not interested in speaking to you.
bad,"Just horrible on helping you find a job and when they do it's not even relatively close to you and it's not even something you like or are interested in. Takes them forever to find you a job, When they place you with a job that you don't like or are uncomfortable at they tell you that you must stay since you accepted the position"
bad,"This is the most micromanaged job you will find. Your boss sits across from you yelling at you for not making enough calls. You work in a bullpen call center."
bad,Worst company I have ever worked for. Horrible upper management and co-workers. All of my bosses treated me awfully and spread rumors about me behind my back. A total lack of professionalism.
bad,"The recruiters do not support anyone in a placement. They refuse to let you leave even if the hostile workforce is intolerable. "
bad,"My story behind my past relationship with RH (Office Team Burnsville, MN) is lengthy. To shorten it considerably, this company is the sleaziest, on multiple levels, that I've encountered. And I've dealt with 5 total firms many years ago after a layoff. There are too many ways to describe the incomprehensible policies adapted by past employees of this office. "
bad,"If you want to be ignored and be treated like a piece of meat, this is the place for you. They are no better than any other contractor company, which is exactly the problem."
bad,Corporate culture was difficult for me to deal with long term.
bad,"Good company for the employer.  Does not advocate for their temporary employees.  All about placing a person in a job and getting paid.  If there is an issue on the job, they tend to believe and accept anything that the employer states and have total disregard for the temporary (their actual employee).  Not a win-win relationship for the person who is working as the contract employee.  Once finished with the contract employee - you are tossed away like a used sheet.  Very demoralizing."
bad,"An agency that allowed 1 temp to arrive late the 1st day and most days. They and company allowed her to whine and be childish and obnoxious. The agency cut my job short, because I politely asked the agency how if any way they would perfer I handle her. "
bad,"A horrible place to work. "
bad,"Don't lose your time. This company never work for find oportunities to his candidates."
bad,This company only sent me on one assignment. It only lasted 2 months. The staff is very hard to get a hold of don't return your calls or respond to emails. I called about an assignment they sent to me by email to inquire about the assignment. And the recruiter must have been having a bad day because she was very rude in responding about the position that they sent me an email about. Manager and  staff are very unprofessional. Can not understand why a company would protray their selves to say they want to help people when they don't. I will never use this company again.
bad,"I am not happy with this staffing agency. I have been with them since late September. In the beginning, I was very pleased with how they were so helpful to me and they would constantly check up on me. That started to die down in November after I was let go from my first assignment for leaving an hour early one day, despite me being 2 hours early every day and doing overtime 3 days out the week. I was told it was because of a lapse in communication (I emailed my supervisor and I left before she could respond because it was an emergency). I took the loss on that one though and chopped it up as a learned experience, despite me feeling strongly about how petty it was."
bad,"I blew a whistle to the SEC on them for poor internal controls that dramatically increase expenses and manipulate the gross margin % so that they pay less in taxes and repurchase millions of shares annually at reduced stock value. Company culture speaks very poorly of candidates and clients behind their back. I experienced 75%+ turnover at the branch level that compromises client and candidate security. They leave candidate folders out in the open with SSN, name, address, etc... for the cleaning crew to have a gander at. Liability nightmare at this company and also the most expensive on the client side. Not worth the $$$ if you catch my drift. Stay clear if their ""ethics first"" slogan is a selling point."
bad,"If you are out of a job, looking for work and running out of money, this is the company for you."
bad,"I learned from Robert Half what it feels like to be chattel. I was pressured into taking jobs that I didn't feel like I had the right background for, and also pressured into jobs that were ridiculously far away - the last one was 70 miles one way!"
bad,"I was first one in and last one to leave, met all requirements of my position and was let go before 90 days was up. I had a horrible time trying to collect my reimbursements, and seperation pay. Management here has no clue how to manage. Workers are hired and let go on a weekly basis, the long 8-6 hours were grinding. Constant direction to not work a territory only to see management happen to have sales come out of that territory. They require you to pay in to them $8000 of your first commisions before you see a dime of any of it."
bad,I will never work for Robert Half again. I have been a working professional administrative assistant for 20 years and have never been treated so poorly and with such disrespect until I worked on an assignment for Robert Half in Albuquerque. Never again will I set foot into an OfficeTeam location anywhere in the world; regardless of how many jobs they have to offer.
bad,"It is Robert Half, enough said, it is a mill poor leadership. As a matter of a fact, the only good boss I had there quit."
bad,Disorganized: sent me to the wrong department and no one knew where to send me after that; couldn't get their billing right -- their own client had to have me intervene and make sure they got their information corrected and after my contract was over they would be looking into other services.
bad,"Won't return calls and will say they are helping to get you something but you hear nothing."
bad,"This company don't care about there employees, they just hired lost of people and send to work in other companies that take advantage of you, an well they are taking advantage too in the process. They will cheat and lie about compensation and what really you have to do in the job, after your done with your contract they promise you to find you another but they don't."
bad,"Work and duration was based on contracts.  Various industries, various roles - it was always something new to learn.  The only downside was a lot of bench time and never knowing when your next job would start."
bad,"The Canton, OH office will not listen when you voice concerns about any assignment. If you are released from an assignment, good luck getting a return call from that office. I called them 3 days in a row with no return call, finally spoke with someone a week later when I called again - was then told to call another office for assignments. DO NOT TRUST THEM"
bad,"I was contacted via email about a temp assignment using eDiscovery.  I followed directions and confirmed that I would accept the assignment and be there as instructed.  When I arrived there were over 100 people in a huge room that had been hired.  They gave us instructions and we started to enter information into eDiscovery.  There were a lot of ""issues"" and it was so strange but people were like watching us which I guess was normal.  I followed the instructions and did my work and I was there for about 1.5 weeks.  One evening on my way home I received an email saying that I should not come back.  I was kind of shocked because I usually get a good review from just about any company I worked for.  My experience with Robert Half has been that they seem young and unable to handle situations in a professional manner."
bad,Although Robert Half has given me many job opportunities over the years none lead to any permanent work which is ultimately what I wanted from employment some stability and permanent location.
bad,They are concerned with filling seats at unwanted job positions at difficult companies. Although they may be a good resource for getting bottom line experience at otherwise difficult jobs to get a foot hold.
bad,"I left a full time position to work with Robert Half Legal and they found a position for me but it was temporary.  They were not understanding when I had health issues due to the environment at my temp assignment.  First I was told the assignment was two weeks, then five weeks.  The assignment ended August 30th.  They haven’t sent me on any new assignments, not contacted me, even after I sent two emails, and I would never want anyone else to have to go through this."
bad,"They will act like you are going to have an assignment for months, but then drop you like a bad habit saying you completed the assignment MUCH sooner than you expect.  At first, I had background check issues (meanwhile, you aren't getting paid - just waiting on them to get it done), then I had pay issues, then I had communication issues...and this wasn't just me.  Many Robert Half employees had the same problems at the same time.  The client was constantly furious with Robert Half and took it out on the employees because of the constant screw-ups above our level.  Overall, a horrible experience that was tough to recover from financially."
bad,Horrible co makes you think you have a Great job ... until you find out how much the job normally gets paid and the rest of that money is going to ROBERT HALF
bad,Did not follow up. The recruiters were rude and strung me out. Sent me to interviews just to pad the number of available persons. Made me take tests that had no real life applications.
bad,"- no consistency, leadership is all over the place and not qualified for the positions that they are in"
bad,The pay is not enough for the area that you live in ( they will low ball you) and you don't have  benefits or PTO. They also do not care to fix job placements when you tell them that the employer is too far from you. I basically had to quit my temp position in order to even be given a shot at being placed someplace else.
bad,"Terrible work life balance, though they try to tell you in the interview process they have it. Everything I was told in the interview was a lie to get you in the seat. No room for growth. They don’t look at how hard you work, your management skills, or what you do for others (I.e. training new employees), they look at your sales numbers only and the person making more money for the company gets the job, even if they have zero management qualities. They try to sell you on all the money you will make but their commission structure is awful. The managers take all the best clients and dont let you try your own ideas on your clients as if they know them better. They could care less about what is right for the candidate (and their colleagues also involved in the sale) as long as they make a sale. The office can be fun with games and such but the management overall is very poor and the overall company is a scam. Would not recommend the company to anyone."
bad,Robert Half est une belle entreprise quand on correspond à la mentalité américaine véhiculée par le management.
bad,"Not a good experience.  No respect, no communication.  I understand that the recruiters work for the companies they place you in, however I was intentionally misled and it cost me a position with another company."
bad,"My Staff agent, was non-responsive, and upper management even more so, once the contract ended; they did not even reach to follow-up, to inform us of the end of contract."
bad,"This establishment is a joke and I would not recommend it to anyone. Do not waste your time. They do not listen to the cares and concerns of their employees, they lie about the expectations and hours that you will be working, they do not support you at the agency if you have a problem with the place they have assigned you to work."
bad,"Recruiters seek past employment history, credit history and background check. They don't care about the truth. They are woefully unskilled at finding employees with values and the ability to treat others as they wish to be treated."
bad,If you're looking for temporary employment Robert Half is right for you. If you're looking for employment with a lot of down time in between job offers Robert Half will accommodate your schedule.
bad,These people/recruiters have zero regard or respect for people trying to find work.  All smoke and mirrors then they jusy ignore you after jumping through all their hoops.
bad,"Ausbeutung pur, auf gleiches Stellenangebot hat anderer Personaldienstleister gleich 5 Euro mehr pro Stunde geboten, ohne Verhandlungen. Nach Ausscheiden keine Arbeitsbescheinigung erstellt, musste erst Druck machen. Positiv war die Fahrtkostenübernahme."
bad,"Company I was placed with was ok, No further comments is necessary,If this company feels you CAN make them alot of money then they will further assist you."
bad,Robert Half has always been in my court.  I have obtained more than 10 temporary contracts with this organization and 1 permanent placement.  I would highly recommend their services to anyone.
bad,"People in the company are robots. Very number driven. Doesn't matter how hard you work, they don't see anything past your numbers (the mentality is to learn on your own. Everyone is concerned about making their monthly bonus). The company only talks about work life-balance but nobody actually follows it. If you go on vacation, they ask you to take your work laptop with you. On the weekend they expect you to reply to your client emails. Very high turnover rate due to the nature and stress of this job. People don't last here very long. Below basic benefits, don't believe in work from home, no flex schedule, no free lunches, no 401k matching."
bad,Employer that I was placed with was verbally abusive to the employees.  Robert Half was supposed to find me other employment it never happened.  The employer that I was placed with was very un-professional.  Everyone cussed and used vulgar language including upper management.
bad,"..is how you'll be regarded if you're not exactly what they're seeking at the exact moment.  Geared only towards the clients desires, a day after your assignment is done, they move on.  Hard.  No followup, no referrals, nothing!  The next assignment you apply for, it's like they run down a checklist, and you having 75% of an assignment's required skills/experience isn't good enough.  You're starting all over-so what if you ran downtown at the last minute to verify your identity and had brought that project in under deadline.  You won't hear a word back if you apply and aren't chosen for an assignment; I've experienced that several times."
bad,Recruiters don't get back to potential candidate. Unprofessional. Unreliable. Poorly manage.  Don't recommend to family and friends. Lots of jobs opportunity.
bad,"They told me for weeks that they would keep me in mind if there were any positions and never considered me,even though I more than qualified. They wouldn’t even tell me why. Don’t return phone calls either."
bad,I have been placed on assignments from a few different offices one was a great experience the other was a horrible experience so I guess it just depends on who you get to represent you.
bad,awful company with management that only cares about their people making them money to make them look good. Like to train for about 5 minutes then expect results. Garbage company.
bad,"If you are looking for a job where your manager looks over your shoulder and there is a revolving door hiring process, then you'll love this place. Also, I literally witnessed an awesome salesperson close a sale, then she got fired because the manager wanted her commissions. Worst place you can work in my opinion. Not sure how I survived as long as I did."
bad,"if you become personal friends with your manager you will get good assignments, other wise you will get the stuff that nobody wants.  There are lots of promises and no delivery.  The managers lie to you to get you to assignments outside the contracted area and then threaten you when you refuse.  They will not have your back in a hostile situation, again if you are treated poorly at an assignment they will threaten your job."
bad,"Terrible place, not worth the time, way too much office politics.  working for this company has nothing to do with the actual job, only how much of a snake you can be.  Extremely high turnover ratio, terrible example of a good company."
bad,"Unprofessional, untrustworthy,and lacks respect for individual employees. They lie about what their job positions pay explaining it away as a number they have to submit as a pay, but no one ever receives the pay posted. This is an excellent indicator of how they will lie about you in order not to pay unemployment compensation."
bad,Accountemps need to do what they advertise.   Their associates; if you're not liked; they don't call.  Not impress with Accountemps nor their other company/locations.
bad,"Office team placed me in a temporary job scanning documents. It was a very easy job, and the pay was great! The placement for this job was fairly quick. Never had any problem with the companies I was contracted to. Office Team was very difficult to get ahold of, and their turnover rate was intense. Within the year I was with Office Team I had 4 different representatives. However, the pay and hours were awesome."
bad,"1 day of work for every 5 or 6 months of waiting. It's a great way to get networking and recommended to other companies. If only the contracts had more than one client and if we could actually get contracts more often. Granted, not the company's fault if there aren't enough contracts and/or clients to work for, but that was from my point of view."
bad,"Accountemps is a good company. My only complaint is that after they place you, they forget about you. I have not heard from a manager in almost a year."
bad,The tension when you walk in the office could be cut with a knife! The places we add clients and candidates are great but the turnover rate is HORRIBLE internally...would not recommend to anyone.
bad,"Don't bother going in to meet anyone in the Stamford Location."
bad,"The company relocated me from Michigan, after working 50 hour weeks for almost 3 months and getting their accounting department automated and brought up to GAAP standards they decided that they didn't need a full time bookkeeper."
bad,"Limited chance for commission, management is out of touch with market, senior reps making 6 figures walked away because of management. I would not recommend this company to anyone"
bad,"Was fired because I came in 5 minutes late 3 times."
bad,"two different assignments, they did not allow me to put my time in i needed assistance never got any. and never paid me for almost 13-20 hours. be careful job seekers!"
bad,"awful job,technically not a dispatcher position. You are really a phone service tech who dispatches a mechanic to a screaming truck driver because you have to ask him a series of stupid questions that have nothing to do with his breakdown issue"
bad,"The recruiters do not have your best interest.   God forbid that your just coming into the market as entry level.  They send you on jobs that don't help you grow.  They basically fulfill the contract for their general purpose.  Most of them are not technical and do not know how to place you with the credential that you have.  "
bad,"They only seem to care about getting their service fee!"
bad,"If in desperate need of a job, contact them otherwise stay away. I would not recommend otherwise. Contracting firm that is very unprofessional and only cares about the money that they make off you."
bad,"No opinion at this time.  The company is not what they once were. I used them in the past for 2 other positions that worked well.  But, I would not use them again."
bad,"They lied about the assignment details. They didn't return any phone calls. When they were in the office, they never picked up their phones and it always went to voicemail. One of the recruiter promised to call me back, and she never did. One of the new recruiter over there was extremely rude and wasn't prepared for anything. They didn't care about their employees. They always kept some people for temp assignments rather than the direct-hire or temp-to-hire positions. Even if they knew the assignment would end early, they didn't tell their employees and left the employees there for weeks without paychecks. They should work hard to find another assignment for those employees, but they didn't."
bad,"Unless you pleasure yourself while watching movies like ""Boiler Room"" or ""Wolf of Wall St."" do not apply here! The culture is of greed, and management does not care about employees. "
bad,Horrible place to work. Robert Half places employees in hostile environments and fire you without hearing your side of the story. The companies you are placed in micromanage and treat you unfairly. Do yourself a favor and work directly for a company. Forget temping.
bad,"This  is a Temp Agency that got me the job at Hudson City Savings Bank.  I didn't specifically work for Accountemps."
bad,"I keep getting told ""It's been a weird year. The new year will bring in more jobs"" Really? Haven't heard anything yet. They don't pay what a position normally pays. It's considerably less. I find it hard to believe with my qualifications that there isn't any positions for me."
bad,"Entered invoices receive via email, internet, mail, fax and hand delivery in Yardi. Answer phones and or inquiries.  My worse part of the job is that I was expected to enter a volume of invoices and that volume was not coming in daily to process.  Data system was down  or running slow most of the time."
bad,They will get you a job but don't care if it's not working out for you.  They will tell you that they are there for you but they are being paid by their client so no matter what they won't put your best interest first.
bad,"Terrible contracting firm. They dont attempt to develop staff, communicate poorly, and regularly pass by weeks without giving assignments. Would not recommend to any but the most desperate."
bad,"Temporary Staffing did not enjoy the job because I one work very few time. When I did has to pay for parking, and took to long to get paid. I had to keep on them about it. did not work with people. Did job that I did that was not in the clerical field"
bad,"It was a great place to work, I really enjoyed working with the staff."
bad,"I got fired from RHT with no notice that I was even doing badly.  My division as a whole was struggling, but as the newest rep I received a lot of gratitude from both clients and candidates.  I was fired completely out of the blue with two deals set to close the following week.  My colleagues seemed shocked, but I was the third termed employee that week."
bad,Upper Level Management lacks skills and only has got to positions by being there the longest.
bad,"RHT has one account manager who told me that I am salaried employee , but when my project is over from Deloitte, they refused to consider me as salaried employee and stop giving me salary. Although I have all emails from the person who hired me & told me that I am salaried person. I was never thought that RHT can do this."
bad,"A typical day at work was going to my assignment and performing customer service duties. Management was very unorganized and liked to play favorites."
bad,First they bring you in to interview with 2 different ppl. Once that over it took over 3 months to fine a job. All they said was it was during the hoilday season. I gave them 1 wk notices wheb I found a permanent job! They were very rude said I was unprofessional. Theyll never with me again and even sent me an nasty email. I would never recommd them to someone. If it doesn't work for them then they treat you like yesterday garbage.
bad,Ok if you want to be used and abused by a company they are right for you.
bad,Overall the recruting and management needs work they never give good information in reference to the job sites and have no credit ability when it come to keeping and employee to work. They also have really short assignments.
bad,This company does not care about you. If you want to work in Sales or Staffing choose a better company!
bad,"These folks really are bad people. After working at a nice company for over four years, and then being laid off, I worked for RHI Consulting and the worked hard for the assigned company. Temp to perm after 4 weeks was promised. I inquired and was told to keep my head down and work harder after 6 weeks passed. I called my RHI recruiter to ask for another assignment when I knew this assignment was not right and a lie. I had to just leave the assignment after being berated by my RHI guy. Now, RHI is appealing my UI benefits. BEWARE OF THIS SCAM OF AN AGENCY!!!!  Carma works both ways.."
bad,Hardly found any jobs with this agency. No one available to speak to if the job isn't what they described once offered. 
bad,"Assignment\project was not accurately described, and the compensation package was abysmal."
bad,"Robert Half ignores phone calls and has not placed me for 2 years now. This was at the Hartford, CT office."
bad,•Increased market share by 35% in the local market
bad,"Horrible company to work for, other employees treated temp workers Poorly and as if they were disposable."
bad,"I relocated for a permanent position obtained through Robert Half. They stayed in contact weekly. A few weeks into the job, the interim Controller decided to stay and I was let go. I had told the recruiter on a few occasions before this that I felt like I was not wanted at the company where they placed me. I was treated like an outsider and was very disrespected at the job where they placed me. They told me to be patient. When I called to tell them that I was let go, the recruiter at Robert Half only cared about if they lost their $16k fee that they received for my placement. They did not apologize, nor did they try to help place me somewhere else. I have contacted them twice since then in hopes of some help to find a job....they treat me like I have the plague. Conclusion for me, all they cared about was the $16,500 fee they got from placing me. Not sure if they had to refund it. I was devastated for losing that job. Robert Half was not in the least bit concerned that they placed me in a position that fell through. I even took a major cut in pay because I was desparate."
bad,Hired on as an accountant in the Shared Services division. Recruiter called with a potential opportunity and mislead me about the location. Recruiter has not called back since I called him on this.
bad,"They're headhunters, and they'll try to cheat you out of raises that are in your contract."
bad,"This company cares more about making money then their employees. They advertise Job Security but don't provide job security. Once they place you at a job, they forget you exist."
bad,Very high employee turn over. Very poor work environment. High stress in all departments. Poor work life balance. Poor culture and valules. Poor management.
bad,"One of their Tulsa representatives contacted me for a potential position in my industry. I went for the interview & discovered the opportunity wasn't suitable. I reported this to him and gave my reason(s) why. He became verbally aggressive & abusive with me. He closed the conversation by threatening never to send me to another interview. Evidentially, he has kept his promise because I have not heard from them in over one year."
bad,"Management at the Troy, MI location is horrible. Was placed in a hospitals payroll department and made to believe it was a long term assignment. Was told by management that I should not ask for a reference from the vendor."
bad,Not a very stable place to work as they do not assist with stable job and employment. Jobs are short and temporary and you have to travel to many different locations.
bad,It is a great place for kids out of college to learn and grow in the workforce. If you are currently in the middle of your career and contemplating a new career this might be for you.
bad,I had a great job through RHT and I thought it would where I could have retired but my spouse relocated to another state. I contacted a RHT recruiter via email  before I moved so that they could start looking for a job because I knew Virginia VEC would not grant me unemployment.  It turned out tgat RHT staff gave VEC some wrong information about my departure which had nothing to do with my family situation ( fathers illness). And no one contacred me to confirm anything so this has left a bad taste in my mouth about robert half. And not only did they present misinformation the recruiter in Dallas office never contacted me even after I  emailed them my resume
bad,Leider werden die Absprachen nicht eingehalten. Informationen an die Vorgesetzen werden ignoriert und Wünsche werden nicht berücksichtigt. Sehr schade
bad,"They were quick to place me with a job that paid decent.  Once I was working, there was no communication between me and OfficeTeam until the company I was sent to decided to end my contract with no notice whatsoever. Remember, this is a TEMP agency. Their goal is to place you in a job as quick as possible so they can get paid quickly.  They don't care about the people they send to jobs, all they care about is money.  "
bad,"Robert Half repeatedly drops their consultants into difficult business situations with no preparation, apparently any contract is perfect regardless of what is happening in the business.  They do not make any attempt to understand the environment, expecting the consultant to dance their way thru minefields with absolutely no support.   They are not interested in helpful feedback, they do not trust their employees, they will not have your back, they will attack their employee for suggesting improvements.  Unless they are the last alternative, move on to some other agency."
bad,"Schlechter Teamleiter."
bad,"I was led to believe that this contract would go permanent for the sole purpose to help me make my decision to work for this role. Weeks before I was to role permanent I was even given a rollover date in writing. This is shady and unprofessional. When I spoke to this recruitment lead he tried to make this issue about me and not the false expectations he set before we even took the position. The recruitment lead for this role and many others in the Jacksonville area lied to me and 3 others( 3 of 4 have quit this role). This would in most cases be considered Breach of Contract. I would not have taken this role if there weren't the level of expectations set by the RHT representative. I will never work for RHT as long is this rep works for them. As a small token they gave me (not any of the others) paid 2 day vacation, a spit in the face when considering that my family would have been taken care of by me rolling permanent."
bad,"If you have problems with the company they placed you with, the headhunter doesn't care if you have problems if it affects their commission.  Get everything in writing before the first day on the job."
bad,"Good training and marketing materials. Diverse working culture with a range of some helpful and some questionable sales tactics."
bad,I worked with a team on a contract project. There were about 20 of us in the group. Management would not respond to employee issues or discuss job advancement for anyone on the team.
bad,I experience Robert Half clients have outdated software. But only tests on new software. over all this was a down fall and it made me look bad when the should have asked the client to update there software so we can better fit your needs
bad,I had a position with office team but had an altercation at my assignment and didn’t feel safe to return the next day and instead of helping me find more work they just dropped me as a client and no one from the company wants to assign me to anything I apply for. Remind you I was attacked!
bad,Colleagues were so competitive that they would steal candidates from each other in order to get commission. The work life balance was non-existent. Long hours. Candidates complained constantly about forms of communication via email or phone calls.
bad,Culture promotes the undervaluing of sales support and overlooks the operations side of the recruiting. Poor work life balance. Higher management looks the other way on unsavory behavior. Very high turnover.
bad,I believe they pick & choose who they want to work for certain assignments which I feel like is totally unfair & unprofessional! You're better off looking for a job on your own! They post a lot of good job postings but never do I get a call with the ones they post it's always a one day assignment!
bad,"I did not like the ours here, the pay stinks, the training stinks, and I am glad I only worked here as a temp, I don't have much more to say about this place, glad I left"
bad,"Bad Communication Practices"
bad,"Job placements are few and far between. 3 months and only 3 job opportunities. Neither of which were a fit. Misaligned skills set vs client needs. They sent me to a client that needed web design work, I explained that I have very little web design experience but TCG assured me that it wouldn't be a problem and that the client was willing to train. However, the client was not willing to train and the job lasted 3 days. On another job placement, the client would have required me to incur licensing cost of software & use my own materials."
bad,"My typical day at work for Waste management for my assignment was very hectic from start to finish however; this was not a difficult position the environment turned out to be the disruption. I did gain some very life altering experience, to not entrust in everyone to be as honest as I am. Management for Robert Half proved to be on the side of negligence as I have still yet to receive my personal belongings from my desk at waste management.The most enjoyable part of my time with Robert Half was the thought that I might have been able to move up the ladder however; this too proved to be no more than a tall tale"
bad,I enjoyed my tenure with the Flint Auto Auction. I was with the company before many changes and it remain a professional and a great place to work.
bad,"I've read the other reviews and management in other cities sounds head and shoulders above what is reality in Kansas City."
bad,When I recieved work it was great.  The staff was always friendly.  The hardest part was trying to balance when I was working with my family schedule.  Never new when I was going to get work.
bad,"no job security, super salesy, all about your stats, terrible training, turn and burn, have to make 50 dials a day, 150 connects a week, 15 interviews, 5 submittals."
bad,"Company has a culture that does the opposite of embrace change. Divergent thinkers NEED NOT APPLY. High margins make it difficult to compete. This place is good at sales, and that's ALL they are good for. When a company is all about sales, you end up with a very frat/sorority like culture. "
bad,"Definitely not one of the better recruiters.  Dishonest to candidates, shifty behaviour, focused on the quick payout - if you register for both temp and permanent work, don't bother even dreaming they will find you something permanent.  Don't care about behaviour of their clients towards candidates, just as long as they are getting income.  Their commission rates are ridiculous compared to other recruiters so you will be scrutinized that much more and less likely to get extended and/or hired in a full-time role."
bad,If you like to work 60 hours a week in a confrontational and contentious environment then this is a good place for you. Everyone else should look elsewhere.
bad,If you want a place that will be ok to get you just any like of Jon this is for you. I specified I wanted an AP position and they told me I got one. I start the job and it had nothing to do with accounting. When I called to tell them they said “ they might not work with a regular GL but I’m sure they have one or something equivalent” I wanted to move and they said no to stick through it. I left and decided to get a job on my own.
bad,"First, I'd like to clarify, the company I was contracted to was wonderful and supportive. Robert Half, however, was not."
bad,"les locaux, les moyens, les discours .. c'est de la poudre aux yeux"
bad,"As a contractor working for Robert Half for over three years, I found the salary to be low and as a contractor there are limited career advancement opportunities."
bad,Being staffing i understand how employment may work. I worked with SEVERAL receuiters and all of them did not truly care with placing me where im valued. My experience and professionalism wasnt truly examined so they try to place you wherever there is SERIOUS needs. Communication was inconsistent and hardly taken serious. Make sure you express your concerns right away so you wont waste your time with recruiters who hardly care about you being employed in general.
bad,"Can not understand why there is a Marketing Manager running the show, it's a woodshop. Marketing Manager is rude, and gets in the way. To many chiefs."
bad,They only care about receiving their commissions.  They could care less if they put you in a position and change all the original agreed-upon conditions.
bad,"Unprofessional recruiters; condescending, pushy jerks really.  You will be scolded if you turn down anything."
bad,"I would say Robert Half would be the best fit for people ok with temporary short term assignments at a lower pay rate.  I had a bad experience trying to find permanent placement.  They charge their clients a very large fee on top of your hourly rate and a large fee to hire a contract person directly from them, and I suspect this is definitely a disadvantage to scoring a permanent job.  Their job ads use a lot of puffing to attract applicants but beware of smoke and mirrors.  Apply to direct hire ads if you want a secure permanent job."
bad,"The Gurnee & Northbrook office, are not at all Professional and the recruiters never return phone calls."
bad,"This company was not the best to work for, they cut corners and even cost me the job where they had placed some of the contracted IT workers because they had hired on someone to work in a place that they were not legally allowed to work."
bad,"I went above and beyond, the agency I worked for gave me excellent reviews. Office Team had more than 2 weeks to find me other employment (while I searched on my own also) and promised I wouldn't be without work. My last day comes around and they haven't replied to any emails or returned calls, have not helped me find other employment even though I was guaranteed to not be without work. The one in Lexington KY is the absolute worst; they have no passion about their work. They promise jobs to everyone and send you on interviews for jobs that you're not qualified for just to say they tried. I do not recommend."
bad,"I have found in most positions that a typical day on the job would be a learning experience everyday.  A typical day at work should be busy and steady, but not so that a person can not keep up causing errors in applying work skills.  The hardest part of the job would be to not have enough work to keep busy throughout the day."
bad,More drama then I have ever had to deal with in my life. Learned new software which I enjoyed immensely. Management wanted to bury their head in the sand when complaints where made. Culture at this placement was very stand offish. Hardest part of this job was having to walk on eggshells as to not upset anyone. Most enjoyable part of this job was going home.
bad,The assignments I have had (2) were awful. I have concluded companies get chumps (like me) to work for these temporary agencies because their own employees are either too stupid to do the job or the job is so menial that their own employees will not do it. There is zero chance of advancement. Management @ Accountemps  thinks culture is in yogurt. I rate them an F-.
bad,"Work was 8-5 or 7-4. Business record affidavits were copied and I would separate each client, attorney or judge. I organize them and scan though the computer. I would print off labels and put the correct information in each envelope as needed and put the labels on them."
bad,They are ok to work for but they take half of your pay and management rarely addresses your issues with employers. Good hours flexible start times depending on client's needs.
bad,"The environment is terrible. You not only deal with rude candidates, but also rude coworkers. If you can work here, you can work anywhere. Most enjoyable thing is getting to go to lunch, although there is no break room."
bad,"Id registered with the Uniondale New York office and interviewed and was promised that they had plenty of assignments to send me out on with a strong possibility of going permanent.None of that even came close to materializing. They are totally unprofessional and inept.  My recruiter and the location manager, both, tell me to check in regularly while they are looking for me.  I see their positions posted everywhere, I notify them of it, and dont hear back from them for days if at all.  Its horrible. I got a complete run around and I believe they just want to build a pool of applicants without enough positions  to fil.l All I got was lip service and a load of frustration, and still don't have an assignment from them.stay away from this company and this office in particular."
bad,I have worked for Accountemps in the past and was placed at a good job. I was a perfect fit and was hired quickly. The pay was average and once hired in they offered more per hour. After several years I decide to seek new opportunities and sign on again with them and it's been the worst experience ever. I'm in total shock. I had such high opinion of them but not now. They shuffled me around to different recruiters and never respond to calls or emails ever. When i get a call it's to tell me they are passing me over again. Totally unprofessional. I have all but begged for advise on my job search and what may be the issue all but to be ignored and no response.
bad,"After two years they finally called me for an assignment.  It was very boring and not the position for me.  When I got there I realized why I had not been called for a position.  There were five of us at this job, and all of them were young, except me.  I am in my late 50's and felt like the only reason they called me was because they had no other qualified young people. It was like they had to scramble to find someone, they called me on Wednesday and wanted me to start Monday. They told me to call if it did not work out and they would find another assignment.  Well I called them and they gave me the run around and still haven't given me another assignment.  These people do not know what they are doing."
bad,"Terrible place to work.  They are only concerned with commissions, not the temporaries who work for them.  Job of last resort; work here only if you're desperate and in need of immediate income.  If there are on-the-job issues, they won't be supportive.  Mismatch of temps skills to employers' needs.  Very discriminatory employer; I don't know how they get the ""Best Employer"" distinction--they get all the ""crazy"" employer-clients that no one wants to work for."
bad,"Accountemps sent me to a company and told me that it was a   temp-to-hire position. After working for the company for 2 months I was let go for no reason only to tell me that the company I was working for was cutting back in their department.  Meanwhile while I was working for this company I noticed they were training another person who worked for this company in another department the same job I was doing. So Accountemps lied to me.  Then they sent me on another assignment and the same thing. I left a part-time job to work for Accountemps hoping they would get me a good job in my field but all they did was screw mel"
bad,They do not seem to be too concerned with whether they find you something or not. I'm unsure how they make their money as many people that I've spoken to feel the same way.
bad,I've worked numerous assignments always following thru and completing. They are not very good at matching your skill-set to assignments. I was out sick one day and an assignment was terminated. After that I was informed that Office Team could no longer represent me.
bad,Working at the Papastrovs can be a very positive experience. Working as a team helps as far as work load and creating a very flexible schedule. The biggest downside to the job is that there is little to no opportunity for advancing either in position or salary.
bad,Without an interview at the worksite I was placed by the Office Team division. The employer did not specify one critical item in the job description that would have disqualified me. On the first day they asked me what experience I had in a certain area of expertise. I haad to honestly state that I had none. I lasted four days before they decided they really DID need that experience. (And I agreed.)
bad,I learned not to work for a temp agency. Every day you were expected to meet goals but not given the tools to get there. The expectations were high and the management was weak.
bad,"They have very poor information on you. Every time I had completed an assignment 6 to 18 month past the original contract period with the client demanding you be paid more, I had to re-confirm my value with each NEW contract co-ordinator. They didn't seem to want to read your file. Because my contracts were extended because the client wanted be to do more because of my work. This didn't seem to matter with the co-ordinators. The fact that they made a lot of money because of me with little or no effort didn't matter. The clients were great."
bad,This staffing agency is the worst place ever do not have them employ you. The women are catty and racist and work ethic is terrible. Someone need to revamp this company and hire people of different ethnic backgrounds to be diverse.
bad,Not a good. Company to work for if you have a problem and reach out to them thwy never call you back when you assignment ends they called me as i was in route to work
bad,The last place I worked the employees were not very nice to the temps.   To many people doing the same job and not enough work to go around.   Even with work in other areas got sent home at least once a week.
bad,"Extremely disappointed with Staffing Director, Emily- she made several mistakes and clearly is concerned with employers and not employees. I'd advise going with Hatch Staffing instead."
bad,I have had a very dynamic and learning process throughout my career. Each and every position has presented its own process for advancement. I would definitely recommend Robert Half
bad,I have had a very dynamic and learning process throughout my career. Each and every position has presented its own process for advancement. I would definitely recommend Robert Half
bad,"Great place to work.  Fast-paced environment.  Litigation department is very busy, the attorneys are great to work with as well as the staff members.  Office management is incredible, caring, on point.  The firm keeps up with technology, which makes your job easier rather than laborious"
bad,Management and co-workers were friendly and helpful in educating on different work processes. Built additional skills in the SAP Inventory System.  High volume work environment.
bad,"Really disappointed in them,  My experience in Portland was nice, but the Eugene branch is a sorry example of RH.  Quantum and other agencies are much better"
bad,"How can you offer $7.19 per hour if minimum wage is $9. Seems kinda wrong if you ask me."
bad,"If you find a job qualified for, you'll be called.  From that point, you'll never hear back once in the system."
bad,"Did some assignments for Accountemps years ago and was very happy with the company.  Got some exposure to a couple of different industries.  Earlier this year went back to Accountemps after leaving a company due to poor management where I was a staff accountant/property controller anticipating the same experience as in the past (quickly receiving an assignment or calls regarding possible assignments/positions).  Since January, I have only received ONE call regarding a possible assignment yet there are numerous jobs showing on the website that I am qualified for.  Can't seem to get anyone from the office to contact me regarding the positions even after I let them know I am available and interested in the assignment."
bad,"I was temping they kept me busy during my down time."
bad,They act like they care about you u til they have you on assignment and then they dont care about you at all anymore and leave you to the wolfs when you contact them with concerns.
bad,This company is more worried about their commissions due to their culture than they are about finding a true good fit for folks. At least the Sac office.
bad,"I had the opportunity to work with a recruiter from their downtown office, who was very nice and engaged at the beginning. However, since the beginning of the year, I've made multiple attempts to reconnect with the recruiter both via phone and email, and she has yet to contact me back. Each time I call, they say she's either on a call or in a meeting, and connect you to her VM just to never hear back. I asked to work with another recruiter in the same office, and the operator refuses to connect me with someone who is available and insists I talk this recruiter only. "
bad,The job is very dependent on your manager. Lots of rules that are not enforced; only enforced on employees that do not conform to their rules. The “division directors” do the same role as recruiting managers but get access to all warm leads.
bad,Good place to work at if you like to kiss up to management. If you’re in an admin position you will constantly be overlooked for advancement. If you’re over 40 you’ll be pushed out. Terrible place to work. Would not recommend to anyone.
bad,Typical day at work is calling on your multiple accounts. The role is very independent until you do something wrong. You will never be clear on procedures and is an environment where favoritism plays heavy vs. work ethic. Difficult to grow. Will sell you on the idea that you can be making so much money but in reality only upper management is making the money and does not focus on the heavy turnover. Most tenured person in the team was 6 months in. I do not recommend the technology team.
bad,"I was not offered enough jobs/income to be able to manage my modest lifestyle. Most of these jobs I felt were ones no one else wanted with odd hours, part-time, etc., or they would send in my resume and not even follow-up to give any feedback. "
bad,"They advertise high paying positions but your job offer will be MUCH different than what was advertised and for A LOT less and if you don't take the job offered, you will be blacklisted from their list. If you don't need to support yourself and don't mind brainless work this is the place for you."
bad,"No skill required. Low pay and no benefit. This job is good for new graduated accounting student to gain experience and network. However, DO NOT hope you can get a full time job with high pay from it."
bad,"While working for Robert Half, the managers seem to side with the client company.  Not really taking ownership of their employees.  They would also be lousy following up with potential positions.  The company seemed like a head hunter, but I beg to differ since I was the one hunting or putting myself on their radar."
bad,"If there are issues with the company where you are placed, please know that you will be thrown under the bus by Robert Half employees.  Their concern is to retain the client -- not you so plan and act accordingly."
bad,"If you need or want to work regularly, look for something else somwhere else. The assignments are few and far between with a dearth of long-term assignments, particularly during the past year."
bad,"The New Orleans office is horrid. While I've applied to mulitple job openings through them, many of which I am more than qualified for, I have not heard anything since our initial contact. I was told after the interview that I would be contacted when they have openings I am qualified for, but that is apparently not the case. I wish the companies using them would advertise their own postings, as Accountemps in New Orleans does nothing to help people get back to work."
bad,"They used to be good. Now the play a lot of favoritism. I've applied for jobs that I clearly qualify for, buy they always call me back with very cheap pay. I've called the one of the girls at office team about a position I applied for she told me she's saving it for one of friends. They butter you up and screw you over. Like someone else said you try to get in contact with them and it's voicemail. Office team, account temps are a last option. "
bad,"Office Team specializes in temporary and temp-to-hire placements."
bad,"The environment was good but I was expecting streamlined training and management, as I was promised. I like when management doesn't micro manage but they were detrimentally hands off and unable to provide timely constructive criticism. As a local employee you get a sense of friendship but you still like just another number to the company."
bad,"The people who work at this company don't care about your work experience. They simply place people based on how ""polished"" they look. The ladies who work at this office are shallow and fake. They give people mind numbing jobs like feeding papers to a machine."
bad,I am placed at Landstar Supply Chain Solutions.
bad,I kept applying for jobs and leaving my phone # etc but
bad,"Took a long term assignment that was ended after a few weeks due to the company’s reorganization.    TCG sent me on 1 interview after first assignment ended.  The only job they had for me was 1 hour away and a 3 month assignment only.  Then 1 year later, TCG called me for a short term assignment.  Took that assignment and now no work or calls for 10 months.  Not very stable work and jobs are not with stable companies"
bad,"The first 5 days of training was very good and learned a lot that was applicable to the job. However, when was put on the job, I soon discovered that I was thrown in a role that was responsible for getting information for a very large portion of the country where customers were rude, wouldn't return calls, or provided us with email addresses. Because of this, I was unable to take both incoming calls and make outgoing calls to customers. Overall, I do not recommend working with this company as it gives a parent company plausible deniability and allows the parent company to let you go for any reason."
bad,"I worked here for only a short period of time after they recruited me from a competitor. I thought the grass may be greener based on what they were telling me. It was worse. They switched their offer to me and my role, increased numbers on me, and it just wasn't enjoyable work, and they worked you very hard with very little breaks in the day. Would not recommend."
bad,This is a great employment service that has a variety of positions to suite any situation. The management and workplace culture are insightful and will teach anyone the importance of good customer service.
bad,"All i was getting calls for was for clerical duties irrelevant to a career, but it was good in a sense that i was kept with a job."
bad,"From the outside looking in, Robert Half International is a respected company that provides a great service in staffing for companies finance and accounting, technology, financial analysis, creative, legal, and office management departments. However, when you are an employee you can see how the company truly operates. There is no actual strategy when it comes to the way of doing business, mostly in sales. It is simply a numbers game with the thought process that if you come in at 7:30am, blast out 100 calls, and leave at 6:00pm, you should be able to generate new business. The hardest part of the job is that there is no room for innovation. Unfortunately, I have been with the company for a month and haven't come to enjoy one aspect of my position."
bad,"Good foot in the door, but they siphon WAY too much salary away from you. Make sure working with these recruiters are are not your first option. Whenever possible, find the role (or similar roles) they are recruiting for and apply independently"
bad,"I worked 3 weeks before I was paid, because the recruiter waited until the after I started to send me the onboarding paperwork. Terrible communication!!"
bad,It was a daily grind and not worth the stress. The company is a revolving door and provides no actual value in pursuing a career. The bonus incentives are awful and no one will actually make money working there.
bad,"I had applied for an HR position with the company and specified that i am looking for a temp to hire position to both managers in the office and the placed me in a company that is very wonderful in Boston i have nothing bad with the company where i was placed great hours great work environment and great pay. "
bad,"OfficeTeam seems to cater to the more well-to-do companies, which, in my experience, tend to have very cliquey atmospheres. If you’re not like them, you don’t fit in. The last place I worked for OfficeTeam, I was more uncomfortable in the office than I’ve ever been in any job. The people there would talk about each other in the worst ways. I could hear people talking about me when I walked into the office. It was a very backstabby, gossipy environment, and my rep at OfficeTeam did nothing to help."
bad,"They are not there for you through the complete contract. They do not listen or care about what you are looking for, they just want to fill their open position as quickly as possible. There is no COMMUNICATION, if you do not like a company you are placed in they will not relocate, find or move you to another company, they are all about their reputation and their clients, they do not care about the people they are placing at these jobs."
bad,"Not productive to find a permanent career, temp work only. "
bad,Save your time and energy - After a very good interview and followup call referring to a potential placement - I have left numerous messages (one per day for 5 days) and have never received a call back
bad,Need to go through the agent to find temp positions
bad,I find that they are sometimes very difficult to work with when it comes to keeping in contact with they're clients
bad,"The RH offices in Dallas, especially the North Dallas office, is a JOKE. Rude and very unprofessional, and the staff turns over very quickly so if you had an interview with one recruiter, they will probably be gone in 60 days, then another recruiter comes in and you have to go BACK to meet with them. Then the cycle keeps repeating itself."
bad,"My review will be based off the experience i had with the federal way location. First i was placed in a position for less pay than the position required. I was advised i would be a collector but instead i was a credit analyst, which paid almost 16000 more than what they were paying me. When i addressed that i was mislead about the position and that all i was requesting was a pay increased. They blamed their client for misleading them."
bad,"I was excited when I got on with accountemps. They helped me find a job so fast... however, I was under qualified and wasn’t the pay as I requested.. I needed a job so this was better than no pay. I told my recruiter I wasn’t happy there and wanted something different multiple times. I called in sick with the flu and had drs notes and they “had to let me go”. No one spoke with me and said I couldn’t miss, they even closed my case. I feel that it was handled very unprofessionally."
bad,"Worked as a temp and exceeded expectations above and beyond,then something traumatic happen at the assignment, reported through the chain all the way up to corporate and they didn't follow through with their workplace related assistance. Assignement became hostile and bias when I reported the issue and no support from Robert Half, they tried to say they were not going to place me at another assignment then backtracked once I made it known what they were doing was unethical and all parties involved including the company were viscious in the way they handled the entire issue. Keep everything in writing on and off your assignments, report every issue, and don't allow any recruiter/management team to try to tell you something over the phone you don't have in writing."
bad,"I had bad experience working with Robert Half for just 2 months. Mistreated by their unprofessional recruiters and other temp also from Robert Half. I regret to accept temp position from them."
bad,"HATE THEM.  The recruiter I was unfortunate enough to work with was a total tool!  Most dishonest, sleezy character I ever met.  Set me up at a job  that was an hour drive from home, was $10 a day in toll fees for 15K under my standard pay, with promises of a permanent job and a big raise. "
bad,"j'aime pas trop cette agence. Les agents un peu arrogants. Je me rappelle une fois j'ai eu une entrevue avec une agent puis faire un suivi elle ne voulais même pas me répondre puis après insistance elle m'a dit trop junior pour ses postes, daccord mais au moins réponds au courriels et au appels puis dis moi j'ai pas de poste pour toi. Ensuite j'ai eu d'autres entrevue avec eux puis mon CV les intéresse ensuite quand je les rencontre ils sont pas intéressés il me pose 2 à 2 questions pour faire jor ils me disent bye...donc est-ce ma face le problème. bref je  ne ferais pas affaires avec eux"
bad,"Interviewed with (young) recruiter after getting passed along by two other staffers. Since that time, not contacted *at all* for job opportunities by that person, in spite of emailing a couple times. Company ignorance / Poor culture / Low priority of knowing / understanding their talent pool."
bad,"I don't recommend working for this company if you are planning to be a consultant to other companies. Benefits are terrible and I had to pay out my medical care because it wasn't enough to get the medications I needed."
bad,"This company has sent me to work for attorneys who are really did not expect anyone to show up from Robert Half."
bad,"Every position they gave me, I quickly learned why it was available. I do not recommend. You are just a number to them. I would only use them if you are desperate or looking for something short term and don't mind the trouble. When I asked about benefits I was ignored. "
bad,"Robert Half does not pay well, they take between 46 to 48% of your pay.  They do not look for jobs on your behalf, you do that by the mandatory check on their website every week or you are not considered for employment."
bad,"All staffing agencies are in business to promote their business, which is not always conducive to employee considerations, but the staff is very friendly, and nice."
bad,"So I've been working with this company to find placement for the past month and a half ( mind you I'm at a director level, Sr. Executive) with all the "" your a great fit for out team"" I've been getting ghosted for the longest. I have to call them to all the time to follow up and when I do they find all these amazing jobs placements, then I get ghosted again. The person I work with on placement, I had hoped for that person to keep on touch all the time seeing how they bosted about what a great fit I am, when a potential great place opens, another recruiter calls me to tell me I'm too experienced, it's kinda a slap in the face when the main person you deal with cannot follow up with you with the news and a better resolution. "
bad,I work for office team for over 15 years as a tempt this was my choice as i had small chidren and i wanted to spend more time with them. I used to be called for work on a regular basis not any more. They stop calling me and when i call i get they voice machine then i would not hear from them despite leaving a message. I am disappointed in office team the way they treated me. I would not recommend office team to no one.
bad,"I have been employed in accounting and finance for well of 20 years.  During the rare times when I've been between jobs, I've tried to utilize the services of Robert Half, both the offices in Overland Park, KS and the office in Atlanta, GA. It appears that they are alike in there non responsiveness regardless of where they are located.  It begs the question why bother running non stop job postings if you don't ACTUALLY HAVE JOBS. I would strongly encourage candidates to try other agencies believe me there are some that will respond to your application, this is NOT the one."
bad,"I submitted a resume on July 16th and met with Tiffany H. on July 18th. After a very short meeting with her about how everything works I was told I would be contacted when something comes available.  After not hearing anything I emailed her back on Sept  19th asking what was going on, to which I was told that there was nothing yet... I wish Roberthalf spend just a little time and effort to help since I was told good things about them. Glad there are other agencies out there."
bad,Great staff company for future advancement try and learn new things jobs are not always available just something to do until you find a real job that pays
bad,terrible place too work. their office motto is fake it to make it. Management uses that phrase when talking to employees. unprofessional management...all are friends and have a high school clique mentality.
bad,"As an experienced contractor, I have had numerous interactions with RH over the years. In short, they're useless. I gave up on them quite some time ago, but found myself looking for work in recent times and thought I would re-visit them in hope of a different experience this round. Not so. I am not alone in this experience either, as I've been contracting for years to include meeting and working with other contractors/consultants over the years and whenever RH enters the conversation, negative feedback always ensues. In turn, if you find yourself in the job market, I cannot recommend RH. Even more so with the plethora of ever increasing staffing firms also available. "
bad,"I have tried several times to give this place a chance. Each time I have taken the time to go meet or speak with management about a job opportunity they never follow up. As much as you try to call, email, walk in, etc they will not communicate back about the original opportunity or future ones that may be available. I would not recommend working with them for full time positions, who knows maybe the temporary side of their business may be better."
bad,"I did not like this temp agency because when one assignment is over, they do not find more work for the client. The supervisor, during the time of this assignment, was a pleasure to work with and for."
bad,"I have been registered with Robert Half Legal for years. I have never been placed anywhere to work. This company is so unprofessional."
bad,"Terrible company, I was treated like a warm body and not human being.  the staff was only interested in meeting sales quotas and I was aggressively pushed into a job I did't want."
bad,Robert Half posts fake jobs ads to attract candidates and build a database after. They don't have any real job opportunity and never follow up. They won´t reply your emails or calls. DO NOT provide names or contact information from the company you are currently working for as It's not a two-way help. Be careful and DO NOT waste your time.
bad,Plusieurs RV chez ROBERT HALF à PARIS ou en banlieue sans aucun suivi. Aucun respect pour les candidats qu'ils font déplacer sans état d'âme. Les salaires laissent à désirer.
bad,Put you through a lot as if they are a premier staffing agency and then you're offered a low salary. They have you jump through hoops getting references and then have nothing of real value to offer. Penny ante jobs.
bad,"This is a very hard place to work, very salesy. A lot of turn over. Everyone gets promoted after being there for 6 months, very strange culture. Not for me."
bad,"This is the first temp agency I have worked for, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I was very unimpressed with this company. "
bad,"I would not recommend this employer for any positions. They will require you work overtime, and once the work is caught up they let you go. Customer service to vendors is not encouraged, and the only people they do encourage customer service to is the mortgage salespeople who are incompetent."
bad,"I have not obtained a job through Office Team, because I have never heard back from them after applying to over 1 dozen positions. I will never respond to a job ad from Office Team again. As far as I'm concerned, they are a sham."
bad,Just want to apply for a job and get this done and fine another job because I am borke and want ajon fo just get it on to wahere I can find a noh and money
bad,"Every day I was checked emails under the name of Accounts Payable, where the company received invoices to be print and/or save in files for approved.."
bad,"Atuei na área de temporários é uma boa empresa, não tem atrazos de salários, a empresa e bem segura e os benefícios são bons."
bad,"can be a very demanding work environment with no real training in the office space from any managers"
bad,Very helpful in finding temporary and fulltime employment. Very attentive to all my needs as a temporary employee. Hardest part of working for this company is not knowing whether the companies you are working at may hire you fulltime or not.
bad,Did not enjoy management's quick decision without a thorough investigation. People in general were great. QC Reviewers were a bit sensitive and insecure about themselves.
bad,"I did not like working here because it was a negative work environment. Staff was unfriendly; not appreciative of the work you do and only focuses on what you ""didn't do"". Hard work is not recognized."
bad,Excellent scource of job opportunites. They are willing to help you and match with the best jobs. Rate the Great  Enjoy working with them. A+
bad,They're terrible.  Never keep in contact with job seekers.  Never submit resumes to companies or get interviews for job seekers.
bad,"Slow at providing assignments. I could write more if they worked for me more,"
bad,These recruiters only call you back if they like you and will just keep sending you to voicemail if they dont like you. A bunch of little girls trying to sound professional.
bad,"Good if you ave no other work."
bad,Would not recommend this job or company. Very bad management.
bad,"I drove about 1 hour away just to waste gas. They had made me think I was going to start working the following Monday. they did not send me to work. I email them so they would say it was just a miscommunication. I fill up papers, show them my social ID etc. it is not fair! I wish they could have been more clear."
bad,"You're better off finding another temp agency that will help place you in a job.  The rep I have for RHI is a joke.  She never responds to emails or phone calls.  What's worse is no one else will help you if you interviewed with a rep but that rep.  You will have to work with whom you met with and if they suck like mine does, you'll never find a good job."
bad,"In the era of IT sourcing, RHT does not know who it is.  It solicits work at the expense of the employees.  Most employers are only using the service to find employees and cut RHT out."
bad,Sign up with RH almost 4 months ago - and STILL have yet to receive any jobs listing from them.... I was better off doing it on my own!!!! DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS AGENCY!!! The interviews I have been doing on have been me finding them. Thanks RH
bad,"I worked for OfficeTeam for a few assignments and then, suddenly, they stopped booking me and would not tell me anything other than I had no complaints against me. "
bad,"I hated it here. The hours were hard, the training was bad, and management never took responsibility for their mistakes. Don't go here!"
bad,"This was a temp agency that had no work I would not recomend this company,"
bad,"This agency is a joke! My first recruiter was ok, he would at least call and tell me about some jobs he found. Then he transferred to another department and i was stuck with one of his colleagues. What a joke she was! I saw jobs online myself and would try and try to contact her only to get her voice mail everytime! She would never return my calls! I finally got her to respond after I had to basically send her a nasty email. She had the nerve to tell me that it made her look bad to send my resume to potential employers! That was why she never responded! I have over 25 years experience in the IT field and this is what she says! I made her look like she wasnt doing her job. Hell...as far as I am concern she wasnt! I guess if youre already worth some money they may deal with you, but dont be down and out needing a job cause you will starve to death waiting on RHT to hook you up! I am glad I wasnt paying for their services! If so, I would have sued the hell out of em! Stay away! and btw....the Ettain group is about as bad!"
bad,"I would never ever recommend Robert Half/Office Team! I registered with them years ago and registered a few years ago. They have never contacted me, nor do they never return my calls for bogus jobs they post. They advertise jobs that don't exist, wasted my time by having me do hours worth of testing and then filed my file in the twilight zone. I know someone who works there and she told me that RB/OT was more focused on populating their database than actually placing people. They are known as the worst placement agency in the city of Calgary."
bad,"If you have experience and an education in your IT field, and you do your research and due diligence and apply for a job that your qualified for.....expect them to downplay your qualifications and experience and ask you to ignore that career opportunity (which would be a perfect fit not only for you, but for the employer looking for that qualified individual as well) and take a low paying contract position instead."
bad,Bad assignments. Poor recruiting staff. Low pay. Very arrogant recruiters.Would not take any offer from them was asked to be removed from prospective candidate list. First assignment had trouble getting payed.
bad,Consultants are not professional. Don't bother to return calls. Worked for them for a number of years so I am surprised that they don't even bother to acknowledge your calls or emails.
bad,"I worked for RH for maybe a month and a half and it was a really bad experience. My recruiter did find me a job - making $8.50 an hour! I had been working in the legal field for 6 years so it was insulting working for that kind of money. Then I had trouble getting them to pay me, they sent my check to an address that I had not lived at for years even though I had given them my new address. Very unprofessional."
bad,"I have worked for Robert Half as a consultant in several accountant roles related to taxation for medium to large companies. These roles  were contracts that extended over a one to two year period. In each role I was able to provide immediate assistance in completing daily workload needs as well as problem solving and implementation of new compliance demands as required by law. "
bad,"I like working for this company because I get along well with the Director who sends me out on assignments."
bad,There was never a supervisor around to answer questions that more often than not requiring immediate answers.  Co-workers goofed off quite a bit without supervision nearby.
bad,"This was a Staffing Agency so my typical day changed daily."
bad,A typical day at work overall went efficient and fast. Prepared 300 files for a future HUD audit. The co-workers were friendly and they were willing to assist me in areas where assistance was needed.
bad,"I hear that the management team improved since I left - hoping so.  Comp plans kept decreasing, hours kept increasing, very unprofessional management team at the time.  I said I was going to go back to school for my masters and my manager asked why i shouldn't be fired on the spot.  Great way to keep your employees motivated to better themselves."
bad,get you a contract and then never talk to you again.  when contract ends they drop you like a hot potatoe and then never call you back no matter how good a job you do
bad,"offered position at major insurance company. too many associates working on same position. company would not communicate with each other find out if the position was ending, etc."
bad,There was no follow-up once you were placed on an assignment. You didn't know exactly when or if your assignment was over and you never received a pay increase unless you asked for one. Very disorganized.
bad,"You are paid less than 50% of the fee they get from the client.  I know this for a fact because I was the one that sent all the temp hours over to Robert half on behalf of the company and received the invoice in return.  There were 4 of us at the same location, doing the exact same job and we all 4 made a different rate, which didn't even meet industry standards."
bad,"High pressure from management with little to no support. 8AM-6PM 10 hour work days. Bully and intimidation tactics such as ignoring employees, only emailing instead of speaking to people."
bad,I was hired for a job that I had no experience in and the transition has been terrible. The company isn't able to take the time to provide adequate training and as a result I feel demoralized and ridiculed for the lack of experience although it was clearly evident from my resume and the conversation I had with the company before moving forward. I believe that anyone can be trained to do a job but it is very necessary for the training to be up to par.  My confidence and professional attitude has diminished tremendously.
bad,I have been in touch with this company several times since working there and they have not been in touch with me. I am still seeking employment and have applied for several jobs and have heard nothing.
bad,"Make 100 dials a day. Get micro managed. Get paid penny's."
bad,very unhappy with the lack of professionalism in the Tampa Highland Oaks office. I would not recommend them to my clients or contract employees
bad,The Staff were big liars. Unable to keep me working in my field. Once I was hired through a Sister Company. They intervened and blocked my start date on a Friday and I was supposed to begin gainful employment on that following Monday. Highly unprofessional!!!!
bad,temp agancy that never called for a job and when i called them they never answered and when i left a message they never returned my call
bad,"I would recommend RH to any college graduate, good for starters, however in my experience there is a fast turnaround of personnel in charge which affects its employees. They placed me in a kind of environment I have asked for and fast which is only why I give two stars."
bad,"Over the years I've worked with Accountemps on a number of occasions. I even got a permanent job through them once. Every time I've found myself unemployed I've found them to be a good resource to fill in the gaps while doing a job search. However, I have to say that they know who pays the bills, so don't expect them to ever take your side if there is a dispute with whatever client they send you to."
bad,They never can find me long term work. Im looking for something perm
bad,"learning and being able to do my job, Management was there to answer questions. I learned what temp work intails, My co-workers in the places that I worked were kind. The worst part of the job was filinlg all day."
bad,They need to take some of the people who are serious about working. I have been on jobs where the other temps are lazy and dont care even if it is on a job at tech show handing out bags or doing labels.
bad,Would not recommend this company to anyone. The company I was sent to had poor6 hiring practices and age discriminatory.. And upon trying to persue further employment opportunities I received no response.
bad,"First they claim they have a job and when you're ready for it.. Oops ""position has been filled"""
bad,New management in Fayetteville.  They never return your call or answer emails anymore.  I’m looking for permanent or temp work & they have not been able to help me.
bad,"This company is was a temporary employee company that hires people for other companies. This review has no reflection on the company it self, I have no facts about how the actual company works."
bad,"Robert Half did not help me or my colleagues when we were laid off."
bad,"Ok for a temp company. I liked my assignment, can be disorganized, pay is low. Benefits are terrible. lack of security, even if a company wants to direct hire you the finders fee is steep it deters employers from hiring you"
bad,"Even though you tell them you are looking for a permanent position, they do not even try to find you anything.  The hours you have to work to become permanent is totally ridiculous.  I can see maybe 60 days tops."
bad,Leider behandelt Robert Half seine MitarbeiterInnen nicht gut. Deswegen bleibt kaum jemand lange dort angestellt.
bad,"Working as a consultant for Robert Half on a client's worksite was rather interesting. When I gave my bottom # for compensation, my hourly rate was lower than that but the expected ""hire"" rate was my low number. They were not clear on the time line of the contract nor if it was to be a contract to hire. Insurance offered for consultants is laughable."
bad,The staffing company charges a lot of money to the companies but the pay very low to their employees. They don't care about you.  They are there just to make money. No benefits. Send you usually to bad companies.
bad,typical 8 hr day. Robert half did nothing to help any of us find other work at the end of the assignment. The team was great to work with. The benefits were horrible.
bad,"Horrrrrible management. They will send you on interviews only to get there and find out the agency was supposed to inform you it had been cancelled. DAYS AGO. They will mislead you, I've actually even had the employers in my interviews say how difficult they are to work with. They suck at communication and will even lie about having contacted you. They won't notify you if they get new positions so make sure you check on your own daily! And all this BS so they can rip off your paycheck in the end. Never again."
bad,I felt that the recruiters at Robert Half did not genuinely understand what type of work I am looking for and have not placed in in a work situation where I can see myself staying on long term.
bad,"Most of the management treats you like nothing. You have to earn your way to career related contract positions by never calling off (even if you're sick), dealing with pompus/snooty placement reps, and commuting in severe weather conditions. They try to pay you as low as possible and offer extremely high rate insurance plans. If you bend over backwards enough you may eventually get chosen for one of there ""golden clients"" but don't expect that coming in the gate even if you do have the experience. The best thing I can say is that you'll gain experience as an administrative professional that'll help you find a better career opportunity else where."
bad,"This is a temp service. They get you into a temporary position to get your foot in the door but if you do a very good job, don't expect to get a temp to hire position."
bad,"I became a full time employee as a temporary. The jobs came more often but sometimes came out of the bottom of a barrel for companies who had a lot of turn over. Once I moved from north Seattle to south Seattle, I was let go from this program as I had no idea where I was. The only assignment I went on was 10 miles away and took 45 minutes to get there. There wasn't much work and I sat around for hours on end before they called Accountemps to tell them they, ""didn't think I was happy there"". Not a fan at all."
bad,The turnover rates at Robert Half is unbelievable. Poor management style and hostile work environment. Bias is also very obvious there
bad,RHT has a lack of integrity and morals within their corporate culture.  I would only suggest you work here to get sales experience.
bad,"When I was hired I was assured that there would be contact between myself and my manager at least every two weeks. It had been 6 weeks and I heard nothing from them until they called to tell me that the assignment was being terminated by the company and that all temps were being reassigned. Not even so much as a 24 hour notice. I realize they don't have control over the notification from the company, but they should require the companies they work with to give a proper notice."
bad,"Would never want to work here again or refer anyone to Robert Half, poor management and environment. Unrealistic expectations and unprofessional, with you can be replaced attitude."
bad,"I worked a year and a half with Accounttemps as a bookkeeping.  "
bad,"vos compétences ne seront pas toujours mises a profit et N'espérez pas l'employeur vous embauche, ca n'Arrive pas très souvent."
bad,"Have applied to this company, worked with some great recruiters at one time. Then they transferred out to other out of state of DE branches. Answered ads through the new team, had to go back in and re-apply and go through the testing and interview process which took up over 2 hours of time, and then never heard from them, now that they're looking for someone with a specific software program, they had to go back into the archives and pull people they ignored, and then they contact me. So basically it's when they want something they'll contact you, when you want a job, your just another number for the big list, they can say they have of job applicants. When I called back to ask about more specifics from the job, it's oh, this person was covering for this person, and you want so and so, I guess they don't like you asking about location, salary, hours and such. After all, you want to a job to be good for you, as the employer would like the person to be good for the job."
bad,"To keep it simple, use this opportunity as a stepping stone to get where you want to be. There are to many negatives for me to write them all. Low pay, bad hours, passive aggressive management, no career advancement structure, training is terrible etc. "
bad,"They start off helping you and getting you jobs. When it comes to following through on their promises or helping you get permanent jobs they never come through. I have been lied to on several occasions, finally I was let go and there was no communication before or after that. "
bad,"Positives; I was able to meet lots of different employers and gain insight into the world of Temporary Employment."
bad,Management is challenging. Employees not valued. I wish not to elaborate.
bad,"I was interested in working a short-term temporary position, as a result, I contacted Robert Half. After submitting my resume of qualifications, I was immediately contacted to come in. I E-mailed the company's representative in order to inquire what positions she had in mind for my skill set. She didn't answer my E-mail, so I showed up for an interview. While there, I found out there weren't any openings and I was called in to build their numbers in case a bank they work closely with needed applicants, they would have people ready for work. Needless to say, I was angry and I felt ""duped"" that I was called under the guise that jobs were available. Had she communicated to me, there weren't any openings, she would have saved me a wasted trip!"
bad,"It's temp work and by that nature--temporary. The staff manager's only concern (or at least is preoccupied) with maintaining clients and deploying temps not with finding you true employment. You're co-workers mostly treat you as a temp, and if they don't outright dismiss your credibility entirely, they are extremely condescending. Compensation is usually low."
bad,"Not a favorite place by most present and past workers. Low salary, no benefits,no consideration,low morale,severe punishment for any critics or ideas."
bad,"Took almost 3 years to get an interview after submitting an application...Got one, two week job and was promised more work that never came through...Since working the two week job have never heard from them...I never want to work for them again."
bad,I was very disappointed in this job. They seemed like an upstanding company but when they promised to hire me and dragged it out for months and then was told they decided not to hire us full time
bad,"Regional management was hostile (to be kind), and inconsistent in their message. You can make good money there, but there's no tolerance for a single off month. Be prepared to be dressed down in the middle of the bullpen if you work at RHT."
bad,"Misrepresentation - they say your compensation is salary plus Commission, but it's really 100% commission or draw versus commission.  It's an EXTREMELY click-ish work environment.  Meaning, your job is based more on who personally likes you rather than your actual job performance.  If management likes you, then you're good - job performance doesn't matter at all.  Also, there's a ton of nepotism in the work place.  Meaning, co-workers are romantically involved and management is fully aware - surprisingly, it's not frowned upon.  Depending on which group you work in, you will experience borderline harassment - inappropriate comments, vulgar language, and behavior.  I still cannot believe the level of unprofessional-ism I encountered on a daily basis in a billion-dollar company.  Candidates BEWARE - the turnover rate is extremely high due to most of the aforementioned.  The only benefit of working there is... the experience looks good on your resume - good or bad, people recognize the brand."
bad,"I thought I would’ve been respected and valued as a professional. My hopes were to grow a career. Instead my supervisor had pink hair, a cocaine addiction and was grossly unprofessional. I voiced my disdain and I was fired in a few weeks for “errors”. It was a relief as my management was sandbagging my performance to coerce me to quit. Overall the worst professional experience I’ve had."
bad,They do not care about their workers.  This used to be a nice company years ago but now you are only a number.   They don't follow up with you.  They will deceive you to get you to their not so good jobs and then never follow through on the good ones they promised you.
bad,perform.  You are assigned position that you are over qualified for.  Management does not listen to concerns.  You are under paid for assignments.  You told you are being place temp to hire but you don’t get hired
bad,Als Einstieg nach einem Studium für die ersten Erfahrungen zu sammeln nicht verkehrt.
bad,"I prefer to use other Job Placement companies because RHI issues with overhead is passed down to their Recruits.  The wage and salary structure of positions is as much as 45% less than being placed with another Company.  Individuals who depend upon their income to support their livelihood are not employed here.  The brief experience I had with this service helped me develop a presence in my new neighborhood after relocating from another state."
bad,It was temporary work and no job security until your permanently hired on. you will never know if you will be let go. Account temps dint even notify when my contract was over until last minute. I was working one day and jobless the next day.
bad,"Good company, decent leadership, friendly team environment, stressful due to commission based salary, nice comradery, pleasant office setting, the dress code is strict."
bad,"I called every week for work, and they sent me which was good, I started an assignment and I finished the assignment. I worked for doctors, attorneys, all kinds of people, even Palm Beach"
bad,Hired as a temporary supervisor for PMO.  Onboarding was non-existent.  Not enough staff from Robert Half to manage project.  Was led astray regarding help after project in finding further employment - Manager told us we would be on bench time between assignments.  This did not happen.  Don't expect help.
bad,"This is a company that places emphasis on their clients rather than there and employees, don’t trust them to keep track of of things for you because they won’t"
bad,"I had been placed fulltime perm, 5 mnths later I was let go & RH would not help me find another Perm or Temp job. This was awful for me because I had NO FAMILY to help support me for the time I got my next job.  Then I went to RH for the SPP. that lasted 3 mths. Then I didn't want to travel 3 hrs away for an assigmt., made me understand if I didn't take the job of committing back and forth and weekends come home, they would let me go (which they Sold me on the fact that I would likely stay in the Bama area for work). Now I feel they have black balled me and WILL NOT HELP OR DID NOT HELP ME FIND A NEW JOB...THEY ARE AWFUL!"
bad,"Long drive for the small wages."
bad,"Every job assignment taken, takes you out of the running for a potentially favorable one. Imagine being between jobs and hoping to get a job that fits closely your qualifications in the interim. RHF will first try to match qualifications for jobs (word for word, like a computer) and not entertain anything else. Sometimes it feels like the staff is just pushing job assignments that you wouldn't normally take for some incentive to them. If you refuse, you'll notice that they stop calling you when a lead comes up. More importantly, in case of a conflict at a job site that will not fix itself...the best option is to leave. No matter how egregious an offense by a manager or employee at a job site, RHF's staff will not even attempt to be an advocate."
bad,Great way to get foot in door to any company for test driving employer/employee fit. Can be successful for the right fit based on skill level and the employers needs.
bad,"The lack of communication is disturbing when one assignment has ended and I am currently without a job. I have called and left messages, but no one has returned any of my calls. It is very discouraging."
bad,I wasn't impressed with them. One person doesn't know what the other person is doing. I received calls about a job I was already doing and calls from many people about jobs I was already talking to somebody about. They screwed up the pay and blamed me for it and then wouldn't put me anywhere else.I was less then satisfied with their business practices.
bad,"They will be nice to you at first, then dump you if you don't accept an immediate assignment you don't want, just because they're desperate to fill it. They give you a bad attitude if you ask to interview with a client again for another available opening. As with most recruiters in temp agencies, they apparently only care about getting their commissions, not about what you want. Very disappointed."
bad,"I explained  that I wanted full time and that I didn't want to work temporary on a long-term contract. I was told 3 1/2 months to 4 months I would be offered full-time. Now the company doesn't want to follow through and RH is not offering to place me in a position that will be permanent or direct hire. There is no way I can afford the insurance on what they offer me and it takes too many hours to gain any benefit of working there with paid holidays, vacation etc."
bad,On my temporary assignment I was placed into a hostile work environment. Before I was placed I was given a speech about how careful they are with placing staff into the right positions. After my assignment ended there was no communication at all.  I was sent an email letting me know the position ended and to call for placement opportunities  I left messages and received nothing. The recruiter has failed to return any calls or emails  Not professional by any means.
bad,Did not received any support from management. Did not make any effort in keeping a good employee. I would stay with the company if I had received help to keep me employed once my first assignment was finished.
bad,typical day was go through the papers in cases and decipher what was to be public information and what was not. The management was a bit one sided. I liked the job and wished I could have stayed longer.
bad,"Very wolf of wall street in terms of work culture. There are a lot of grey areas. What matters most to management is surpassing monetary goals, not so much quality of life or balance. May be a great position for someone who is driven and does not have many outside obligations in other areas of their life."
bad,"Great for experience and training but they do not value their employees and very few grow to have long term careers. Management will change the comp plan on a regular basis, so nothing is guaranteed.  High turnover, low pay, and no work life balance. Most employees quit, burn out, or are let go within months."
bad,Empresa com gestão muito centralizadora e gestores juniores. Perfil retrogrado e sem autonomia.
bad,Can help you find jobs but is not always reliable. You need to be on top of them to show you are serious about your job search. Not able to reach someone when you want.
bad,Worked hard with no benefits and didn't get hired as told. It was very long hours for not much pay. CFO was a workaholic who slept at the office. Gave me no notice when wanting me to work late.
bad,"Break down systems, remove malfunctioning hardware, and install new parts"
bad,"I found temporary assignment while looking for a permanent job."
bad,They are very slow in finding work I rather look for employment on my own. When your Assignment about to end instead of them looking for you a job they will say oh we will call you it would be months before the call
bad,"Always with place work for 2 days, then you get 10 days off.  According to management there was nothing they can do, just not enough work for everyone.  They beg you to sign up, don't worry there's plenty of work for everyone, but things change one week after you start.  What choice did I have I had to go to other employment agencies that had more work.  Don't go there there are better places to work."
bad,"I spent nearly my entire job experience in retail and needed to find a job outside of that field. I was hopeful when Robert Half found me an assignment with an ecommerce company that I could build more experience and new work in the future. Except in my case it didn't pan out that way. I'm considered disabled under the Americans with Disability Act, but when my disability became exasperated and I began to suffer from severe negative symptoms I wasn't exactly provided much in the way of accommodations I needed to be able to perform the assignment as well as I did when I first started - by Robert Half or the company I was assigned to. They elected not to find me another position due to my ""poor job performance,"" though there were extenuating circumstances behind that."
bad,The job was in line with my career path but the workplace culture was not.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with the lack of management involment.
bad,Company's system was completely wiped out and we came to work to sit around for 8 hours with no work.. I was a temp so they ended my temp assignment.  Hours were perfect for me  being a single mom however they were not flexible with needing to make any appointments and making up time etc.
bad,"Keine Management-Kenntnisse. Heute Hüh, morgen hott. Null Struktur. Meiden!"
bad,"Robert Half est réactif quand il s'agit de caser une personne sur un poste vacant et peut importe le profil de l'intérimaire, l'essentiel est de combler les cases et accroître leur chiffre."
bad,Accountemps was very helpful in finding a position for me but the situation at the job was not fulfilling.  I only had maybe 3 days of work for a 5 day week.  I am used to being busy and it was very hard to look busy when I had nothing to do. I would constantly ask if I could help with any work and was told there was nothing I could help with at the moment.
bad,"Good introduction to staffing/recruiting/cold calling sales, but long hours and pretty soul sucking.  If one is promoted quickly then one can make decent money, but don't count on it, it is pretty cut throat and management is no bueno."
bad,The hardest part was shrink wrapping booklets and pamphlets  I enjoyed working at the hotel to get people for their sporting event.
bad,"Receiving medical records request from physicians, hospitals, CommUnity Clinics to continue patient care."
bad,"They try to say that your in Human Resources and that you'll be helping people get jobs! Sold! But its actually sales and not really a true HR role. It doesn't matter who you find just get people jobs so you can get your commission. But wait there's more...don't expect to be there longer than 12 months because that is when they fire you so that the 'original players' can inherit your income from the people that you've placed. "
bad,"Negative experience.  cannot depend on info given, rude feedback, callous staff"
bad,Lack os stability and constant turnover makes the commission process harder to obtain.
bad,"Even though they claim temporary to permanent positions - they are more temporary they claim permanent to get more qualified candidates. "
bad,"Worked very long hours"
bad,"In my experience, they will send you on whatever job they feel like. You may be qualified for it, but don't be a problem or have a question about the job when you get there. Never, never get fired, quit or ask to be placed in a different position. They think they are always right. They also may say they are working hard for you, but that is not true. You are cattle to them, that is all."
bad,I processed payroll
bad,"Robert Half made it seem like I was getting a great position and that I was going to have lots of room for advancement. In actuality, there was almost zero room for growth and the job was very low level. I tried to negotiate my contract and they said that there was no room to do so, when others said that they were able to."
bad,"The money is good, but they hardly call you, I fuss to the company just to get work"
bad,This was suppose to be a temp to hire position but didn't work out that way due to the company's budgeting. The temp agency was awlful. There weren't and time off benefits and health benefits were outragous.
bad,Not for anyone that doesn't have experience in sales or staffing
bad,My typical day at work always varied with each assignment.
bad,High stress
bad,"They hire people with little to know experience, but offer good training. Very little flexibility and very high turnover which is hard for clients to deal with"
bad,"Management is overbearing, needs to be more ""hands-off"" on document review projects. Off-site work was handled with a law firm.  Robert Half was only involved administratively."
bad,"Placement councilors do not care about the temps & treat them like animals.  Don't dare ask to be removed from an abusive client, because they will not placed you again."
bad,Un cauchemar pour moi. Responsable pas à l'écoute. N'a jamais su jouer son rôle de coach même quand on demande de l'aide
bad,"My overall experience with Robert Half was great until I accepted a position at the RH St. Louis location. Rude, inconsistent, cliquish, unprofessional team members catering around a rude/cliquish Sr. Administrator. "
bad,Lack of real leadership and advancement opportunities for employees that show and do good work. Everything is not always about a dollar! Placing people in bad situations that create stress and hostile situations is not a good look.
bad,I was not happy they treated you like a temp you were blamed for things the emplpyees at the firm you worked for did and Robert half always took the side of the client
bad,"I saw many GOOD employees leave during my time here because of this. There is one person who is given special treatment (she’s the only one with her own office for goodness sake) and allowed to make ALL decisions for the office. She bases her decisions on the opinions of her little lackeys, since she is in said office all day. . She gets what she wants. If she doesn’t like you, you will be gone. It is allowed because of the $ she brings in. She is an ok person but this is WRONG!"
bad,I had a decent experience as a Robert Half employee. It was my first job out of college and provided adequate corporate experience. Did not find it to be a long term career choice.
bad,"Extrêmement décevant. Placent les personnes sans vraiment faire attention aux expériences précédentes. Si problème au sein de l'entreprise eh bien débrouillez-vous car le temps qu'ils réagissent, vous avez réglé le problème et c'est vous l'enquiquineur et eux gardent leur bonne image. Est-ce fait exprès? Pourtant l'entretien était plutôt sympathique au sein de leur bureaux et ils semblaient être efficaces. Autre chose, méthodes vieillottes pour une entreprise soi-disant américaine, peu de documents dématérialisés et ceux qui le sont donnent l'impression qu'ils ont été mis en ligne par des débutants."
bad,"Nod and smile is the way to get by in this company, you are told to build relationships yet reminded daily to achieve number goals simply for the sake of achieving the numbers.  The talk of building relationships is window dressing.  Might not be that way for the whole company, but it is the case with the manager I deal with."
bad,"Vorteil: Man wird weitestgehend gemäß Qualifikation eingesetzt. Auch kann man in Absprache mit dem Kunden flexibel seinen Urlaub gestalten."
bad,"High turnover "
bad,"I don't have much to say about RHI."
bad,"Docketing legal documents"
bad,"i have worked with them and received excellent reviews but, they never called me to work again despite qualifications & experience. Always stated I wasn't good fit when ALL requirements are met. Some management do not care about workers or contracts. Not a very stable or nice environment for a worker. Too many people to place and ONLY the ""click"" are used."
bad,just starting out this is the type of place where you can build a resume. work with lots of clients and pay your dues. if you have no experience you can get some here
bad,"Put to work at a company that was, underminded. Office staff didnt listen to the problems. When addressed and stopped at job the office staff never called for another position"
bad,"It's a temporary agency. No benefits until you work a minimum number of hours. I don't know what the cost of the insurance was, I didn't work there long enough to find our.  I worked 40 hours a week for approximately 7 months. My job assignment ended without warning."
bad,"The placement job was vaguely associated with accounting.  More factory / production environment with some accounting skills required to get program/controls off the ground.  Once proven it would work they offered me a position (temp to perm) at the same rate I was working as a temp. Agency had ""inferred"" offer would be a bit more. Agency contacted me for 90 day temp to hire but when 90 days came and went - I discovered they had extended my contract without discussing it with me."
bad,"My problem with them is the lack of communication and follow up. I have went in several interviews and it takes a week or more to hear back OR the famous they are holding off on the job. I have had a different temp agency send me to the same place for an interview and I hear back the next day, usually starting the next week. Do not use them if you need a job ASAP, they will take forever to respond."
bad,"It is very hard to make commission here , office politics , too much Backstabbing everyone talks about everyone and the only reason some are successful are because they are given established accounts or they are close with management."
bad,"While it was nice to work different and odd jobs, the need to go from temp to fulltime was the ultimate goal; not just for them, but for me as well. The management seemed to be lacking."
bad,"My experience with Robert Half was not a typical temporary agency. I had to apply several times  before they were able to get me any work. When they found me work, it was a job that required to work very long hours throughout the evening. I learned how to repair computers, replace LCD screens on tablets, replace hard drives, memory, motherboards, and power supplies. The hardest part of the job was the drive as I lived too far away from the warehouse. The most enjoyable part of the job was the quality of music they played during work hours."
bad,"Found that they mislead you about the type of work and the amount of contracts the company has had with them. Which means the company has lots of temps and does not hire them but, you are lead to believe they will hire but they don't."
bad,"Heavily KPI driven role"
bad,"Payroll, and employee file management. I learned more about the automation of time tracking, digital employee file management and meeting the demands of payroll deadlines. The most challenging part of the job was getting the information you needed on time and knowing if any information was missing. The culture was stressful but when you work with money you should expect that."
bad,"If you need a job, Robert Half can find one for you if you don't mind the low pay and lack of people skills. If you're lucky, your recuiter/rep will do a good job of presenting you to potential clients."
bad,They always assigned me the low level jobs. I have a Masters Degree in an Administrative field and they never put me in a job in my field. They pick and choose who they give the better jobs to. They also got me fired off of an assignment. I asked them for an increase in pay for the work that I was completing was way more than was stated. They asked the client and of course I was let go on a moments notice from the client.
bad,"For a company that is proud of it's ""diversity"", not a lot of diversity is seen in upper management and current employees who have been at RHI far longer and deserve and are qualified to receive a promotion aren't given the opportunities they are entitled to."
bad,"Billing rate to client vs. contractor rate is really bad.  "
bad,"Very long hours, presentee-ism culture, sales people promoted to management. Some managers were brilliant. High targets, v cut throat. Good training though. Some people flourish if particularly thick skinned and very tenacious."
bad,"Robert Half is a temp to hire company.  I didn't feel they were aggressive enough in assisting me in finding work assignment.  When they did, I felt I was paid a lower rate than my quality of work deserved."
bad,You must be ready to work upon arrival.  Phone calls all day and documenting is necessary. Day goes by fast due to being on the phone all day.  The lunch is only 30 mins so it goes fast.
bad,"Each account has its own culture.  However, at times some of these clients will target a temporary employee.  The in-house employees tend to behave badly toward a temporary, because they know the client will easily replace them.  Most of the times the in-house employees will blame the temporary help to keep their own job, and the owners or management will do their part to keep a facade of a positive atmosphere my replacing the temp."
bad,"Enjoyed the 2 places I have worked under office team.  Just wish the last company was hiring full time. The job itself was awesome in the environment that I was glad to be in wanted to learn more of this area and I was giving the opportunity to learn and be productive, Even though I did not get the job full time It was on of the most fulfilling opportunity I took with me skills and experience. I would work for this company in  a heart beat great company. Excellent opportunities."
bad,I worked there as a recruiter for two months with virtually no training or support. My supervisor was preoccupied with her own sales quotas and spent very little time guiding or supporting me.
bad,"After a long and painful screening that compares with getting a high security clearance which I already have. You will get hired, pass the screening to get with a bunch of morons. "
bad,"Robert Half temp agents are very sales-oriented, which comes at the expense of the employees they are placing. I often felt disregarded and that their sole motive was to receive the highest commission possible as soon as possible."
bad,"This temp agency has very unprofessional staff. They're rude and very unorganized, They don't match you with jobs that fit your skills.They will not listen when you voice your concerns or ask for a different assignment"
bad,"It's sales.  You're an attorney, but it's sales.  It's not terribly difficult to do, but you'll make more as an entry level legal secretary.  Bonus structure is pathetic for a Fortune 500 company, which means the majority of the compensation is going to the executives and not to the people bringing in the money. Benefits are very expensive. High turnover - but again - that's sales for you."
bad,"The Creative Group is a part of Robert Half. See previous review."
bad,"I did have a great recruiter, until she left.  Was happy with my assignments, though I wish I had more.  When my recruiter left, I wasn't told and I lost my regular job assignments.  Tried to straighten things out and was told I couldn't call corporate."
bad,"Bad communication from recruiters, they are only interested in getting those who are well over qualified positions in there company. Most recruiters are rude, shallow and they lack cultural diversity. Have yet to gain a great position to utilize my paralegal skills with this company."
bad,I had a lot of issues with not getting my pay check 4 pay rolls in a row. Onsite manager was not good at all he was never available.
bad,"Recruiting Agency that only uses you when needed for other companies workflow, never intentionally promote your expertise towards other clients or companies.  Provide very few assignments in spite of expected job market changes."
bad,"When placed, the job is usually ok.  Some variety to it.  However..."
bad,"long hours, no respect for employees, no work/life balance"
bad,Too much based on numbers and not on actual relationship development.
bad,No comments on the work/life balance.  No comment on Job security or culture.
bad,"This was a nice company. I was hoping for more of a personal office type position, which I specifically requested, instead of the more cubical offerings. I was a little disappointed there. Unfortunately due to health problem they had to let me go."
bad,"Robert Half is one of the nation's top IT staffing firms, but has one of the lowest contractor satisfaction ratings.  The pay is typically below industry standard, the benefits cost much more than the value provided (it's best to just get your own, personal, insurance plan)."
bad,My assignments have been for the most part short.However I have learned multiple accounting softwares and sharpen my accoun ting skills  
bad,"Management's concern is devoted almost entirely to productivity with little concern for the employee.  A long and productive tenure at RHI will not guarantee your survival if your numbers should fall, even if due to events beyond your control.  In effect, your entire career at RHI can be summed up in your last three months' results.  "
bad,"When I first started working for this company, they were very professional and straight-forward (which I appreciated). "
bad,They take too long to find you a new assignment. You can call forever and leaving messages and no one call you. not happy at all
bad,"The position I was placed in was not a good match for my skill level. I was expected to handle a position that really required 2 to 3 people. Attention had to be devided in 4 different directions at once and the stress was too high to be sustainable. Another person was brought in to work with me but she dissapeared into the files and wouldn't come out to do the work she had been assigned, leaving me to greet patients, answer phones, check patients out and get time cards and files for interns. All of which happened simultaneously."
bad,There is not much to say about this employer
bad,"Robert Half Technology is great for entry level recruiters, they have a great training program, and will provide you with all that's needed in order to be successful. However, they believe in a heavily metrics environment, daily pressure, and heavily micromanaged environment. It wasn't a fit for me long term."
bad,was not very interested in short term assignments - would not give long term assignments or closer to home work places - salary offered was getting decreased with every new assignment
bad,"Temporary positions don't last very long. "
bad,Much of the operational work that should be done by technical support makes its way to the Engineering departments. partially due to poor management but also no accountability in the TS org. This means I spend more than half of my day doing Tech Supports job. Not enough time to focus on projects and no time to work on career advancement.
bad,"-- Impedes growth and career development --"
bad,"It would have been nice to know what the expectations were and how to get there. No trainer,no devoted time,simply, magically meet your numbers or go."
bad,"Wells Fargo placement was a fun and welcoming atmosphere, tasks were presented by priority and our work time was managed on our own schedule. Managers were helpful and respectful. There was no micromanagement. Facility was comfortable and offered a variety of amenities."
bad,It's all about numbers and quotas; the company doesn't seek to match candidate and talent. The compensation doesn't align with experience but they don't care.
bad,"I started working with Robert Half a couple of years ago and I was super excited considering great companies I would be employed with. I became a salaried professional employee for Robert Half and that's when things started to decline. They sent me to two sites were the worse place for hostility and not organized. One of the companies I still have not been reimbursed and I feelretaliations due to the morale and it wasn't a good fit for me any longer."
bad,Very disappointed in them. I worked for them for 5 years thought they were great. They helped me get a good job. But when I needed to find work again later on down the line years later. They wouldn't  return phone calls acted like they had black balled my name. Told me theyjust never had anything for my skills or an assignment was closed that just posted.
bad,The home office is typically non responsive.  Temps are just a tool to the numbers rolling every period.  The typical clients is a mess and the temp is just working right along side the mess.
bad,"Boo..not a company I would recommend to anyone. My experience was short but not sweet."
bad,This place turns bad people into monsters. There really isn't a collaborative approach. People want a piece of everything. people that know the system game it and never pursue management because they can bully new people.
bad,It would be nice if they returned your calls and emails.  I have emailed and left messages for more than one individuals and still have not heard a response
bad,"The company is definitely okay, but the office culture in San Antonio leaves a lot to be desired. On top of that, management is never in the office, or working when they are. The company tends to promote within, but they do not consider if the person being promoted is even management material. The compensation plan is not bad, but there is more to life than money. I have mostly enjoyed my time there, but need a place with more of a work life balance and a boss who cares about me as more than just a producer."
bad,"I was sent on an assignment, I followed all instruction given by RH and my site assignment, after one day the site I was placed at said i wasn't a fit. When I asked for feedback on what I could change I was given none. I still kept checking in but got no further assignments, had several initial calls to gage my interest in a few assignments but no return calls, received a voice mail on an assignment. Called back within the hour was routed to a voice mail becuase my regular recruiter was out for the day and never received a return phone call as of this date"
bad,"The management really did not have a good handle on what they were supposed to be doing.     They were more interested in producing ""an"" answer quickly than producing the right answer."
bad,Am Anfang war die zusammen Arbeit gut. Mehr möchte ich nicht sagen oder schreiben.
bad,"Robert Half often over employs candidates, but does not place from within. Multiple long durations between assignments ranging from 2-4 months wait. 40 hours consistently when assigned, however Pay is usually between 10.50-12$ under their advertising rate of 14-16$. "
bad,Many times they would call me with an assignment and minutes later it would get cancelled. This would also happen while I was on assignment usually due to misplaced paperwork.
bad,"Harsh management, also agreed upon other branches, offices and employees. Not any recognition or encouragement given. Overworked, lunches skipped. Not given adequate breaks"
bad,"The personnel at Robert Half are fantastic,in all my dealings with them.  They were attentive to my interests and were always reasonable and courteous.  However placement in the area I live in was somewhat tricky.  I received two assignments, one with a very difficult client, and another with a client who was confused as to what she wanted & needed  from an employee."
bad,At the time I worked 11am to 3pm and took the bus downtown. Was part time but took full time to get there and home again. Just did not work for me. Some room for advancement. Interesting people.
bad,I had a terrible experience working with Robert Half. The staff had a terrible attitude and was often outright insulting. Every single position they offered me were anywhere between 20 and 50 miles from my house and sometimes in other states even though it was clear they had available positions that were closer. I would never recommend them to anyone.
bad,My job with this company was on a temp basis.  Job only lasted for a couple of months then ended.  Pay rate wasn't that great but there was no room for advancement.
bad,"Prospect, recruit and interview with candidates in-person, by phone, and using various digital methods to establish strong business relationships and followers. Ongo- ing account management and client contact with all managerial levels to determine candidates fit for the assignment and viability to support specific current and future client needs."
bad,"The work hours are good, 9-5. But the day would drag, because the management could not or would not schedule a good work flow. Management basically knee-jerk reacted to any jobs the came through. Also was very isolated in the office of all sales personal, no one to relate too, and it seemed that that whole office had a distrust of artists. Seems that they had a bad history with several designers... Spend many days cleaning the filth out of the negligent space."
bad,Its hard to talk to someone at the company when you have questions. They passed me to 3 different agents so I never knew who was my contact person for this company when I had questions or if there was a pay discrepancy.
bad,Accountemps was just a temp service.  It found me some promising jobs to work at for a limit of time.  I was offered a full time job once but then it was put on hold.
bad,I started with Accountemps back in May after profusely seeking dead end employment. I was finally matched with a company that I thought would be a perfect fit. I was wrong. The company I was placed in canceled my contract and I'm now back where I started. The way Accountemps went about it was the same feeling as getting kicked in the teeth and they haven't even made an attempt to place me with another company. Good luck getting anyone to call you back regarding being placed anywhere.
bad,"Temporary Hourly Paid Assignment"
bad,The manager was nepotistic on his best days. We had no one we could speak to as RHT was solely on the clients side. Any complaints made to management and or rep from RHT fell on deaf ears.
bad,We did employment surveys. The hardest part of the job was people would hang up on you because they wouldn't want to do the survey. The enjoyable part of the survey was learning about people and what degrees they had and what jobs they ended up with.
bad,"Management positions are awarded to ""top-performers"" -- those people who know how to sell but not how to lead, manage, help, or coach... all managers compete with their subordinates to fill roles with their own candidates!"
bad,If you are looking to be run over and handed work load that does not pertain to you job it's a great place. The management was under new CEO and was making more changes then needed. They were under a audit and was scrambling to get things together didn't know where all of the prior year files were and asked way to much on trying to get it set up for audit.
bad,I have been temping for Robert Half for going on six months and I highly enjoy it. The company keeps me busy and management is great with communication. Only issue is opportunity for advancement. Only issue was that there were no opportunity for advancement.
bad,The most enjoyable part of this job was to serve the patients by obtaining their medical records or translating simple questions for them when requested from me.
bad," Answering multi lined telephone"
bad,"After ten  years of service as a temporary placement clerk, new management hired on and all of a sudden you go from a call first person  to a never call person."
bad,"The management is not good on calling people back. I called once to find out information about an interview I had and didn't call a call back. ""Be sure to stay by the phone."" Sure"
bad,"I enjoyed the multi tasking necessary for my position. Guidance and training could have been a little more thorough, all though I enjoyed figuring things out myself. Interacting with the patients and co workers made my job enjoyable.  I learned about the holistic treatments for cancer patients. It's a small treatment center so  multi task from registration to accounting is necessary."
bad,"If you get an opportunity to work for them it will most likely be by contract, at a low rate. I discovered that my rep could not even go to bat for me when it came to landing a position."
bad,"Temporary work while in school full time. I sorted through different mortgage categories, grouped them, and transferred them to a BB&T employee to file electronically."
bad,"Was so excited to be a part of a corporate environment.  Did not know the Ipad they gave me was to do work at home for free, which means you end up with minimum wage.  This type of job consumes your life.  Management creates a hostile environment. Would never recommend or work for this company again."
bad,I worked as a Concierge at the front and I enjoy meeting the public. Most importantly I had to direct the customers to the right location. I thought that I has to set a good example for the company where I worked. I thought the job was exciting and interesting.
bad,"Staff is phony,young no professional ethics.They'd call for assignments & never hear back.I'd call back & told ""Client has put a hold on the job."" Yep"
bad,Initially I believed this was a good match with consulting flexibility with fixed salary and benefits.  But the management does not have any support for the consultants.  The consultants can have weekly meetings but the consultant is totally alone with the interpersonal and technical skills. Sometimes the management will try to fit into the role even though the consultant may not be totally is a good fit.
bad,Communication between contract workers and their respective agency contacts is very poor. Routine calls were not returned and information was not forthcoming regarding the continuing assignment and contract extensions.
bad,"This wasn't a horrible company to work for.  However, I only had two assignments with them that were for the same company, which was Rotary International."
bad,"This is you're typical contracting firm, so don't expect to be treated very well unless you are in a contract to hire position.  Nature of the beast in IT contracting world."
bad,"I worked as an Administrative Assistant for one of the branches. Overall, the managers were demanding, did not know how to direct their admins, and the culture was overly social and competitive. They did pay very well."
bad,"The company is going through lots of changes; the daughter is taking over the company from her father who longer is able to run the company.  This transition has been forced and therefore causing lots of confusion, conflict, and resentment.  Leadership doesn't have the experience to run the company.  Longevity is a huge concern."
bad,This was a highly unorganized and horrible company culture. I walked in the door and instantly became depressed. There was no natural light inside the building. Everything was low light and brown. I felt as if I aged 1 month for everyday I worked there.
bad,"Robert Half has unrealistic expectations from their employees. it is expected and required to put in 12 hrs + per day. there is no work life balance. the metric system is impossible to get ahead of. Very cut-throat and money driven, only."
bad,Too long of wait in between jobs. And the out of state employment paperwork is good and easy. Just wish there were more work opportunities.
bad,It was nice to try something outside of accounting. Robert Half is a very sales driven environment focused all on numbers on a daily and weekly basis.
bad,"This was a temp agency, my work varied."
bad,Average work place -- possibly a hostile work environment where your are always looking over your shoulder -- no job security
bad,"The first year I was under their employment; I was upbeat, energetic and optimistic. They have really dropped the ball. They send their people to the slaughter-house. No appreciation. And they have dropped to almost minimum wages for triple amount of work. Sad."
bad,"I held several temporary positions for Officeteam. However, it is very hard to get a temp to hire position. They tell you that you are in the process of getting hired then you don't get the position. They find you assignments very quick which is a good thing."
bad,"A high pressure environment with absentee managers led by a culture of fear and intimidation. Everything is about money and productivity and if the market is not conducive, staff are replaced with little to no warning. The current rate of staff turnover is 50%. Avoid at all costs."
bad,"I really enjoyed working this assignment, Work hours were very flexible. I never had any issues with pay. This was a interesting experience."
bad,"Good place to find a job fast. However, the pay is way less than the full-time employees. Not possible to know when will you be set free because this is a temporary employment."
bad,"NOT everything was up front with you upon starting my new position.  I found out after I started it was  part time, temp position only."
bad,"Was not very impressed with Accountemps.  The only position they sent me on did not use my experience and talents at all.  I have not heard anything from them since I completed the assignment.  I feel that even though I have reached out to them since the assignment, I have ""fallen through the cracks"".  I was switched to a different counselor and she has not been very helpful."
bad,"Placed in the worst assignments with this agency, and all they did was defend their poor decisions."
bad,You are always being watched and told on of you are talking while working.
bad,As long as they have work you will  have fun but the down side to this is a company that will put you on one day assignment and if the have any jobs that offer anything over $10 an hour and it's in your field you will never get a call you can bet one that. And the recruitment team in Miami suck really bad that call you and when you call back they never return you call or email. So if any body put you on assignment in Miami your on your own the only time they care is when you mass up and the client calls them.
bad,only part-time work. You're treated more like cattle than a human.
bad,I had a very bad experience with Accountemps. I was offered a position and they did a very poor job explaining the procedure to my potential employer. As a result of this lack of professionalism I lost the chance to have a very good career opportunity.
bad,A typical day is spent listeing to Managers that only care about numbers and if you are not hitting them then your gone.  I learned alot about the world of Staffing and have made amazing connections.  The Managment was very poor at my location with next to zero training.  The co-workers I had were amazing.  Overall the job is not for everyone.  OfficeTeam is an entry level job where it's next to impossible to bonus.  People with out a college degree or basic work experience would be amazing in this role. If you are looking for big money and career advancement don't apply.
bad,there are great people at Robert Half in administration and in non-competing departments (and other offices) but there is a serious lack of integrity among co-workers that I had the unfortunate luck to collaborate with. I would not risk my reputation as that become more evident. I value the people that count on me for a job and trust me not to mislead them or use them as pawns.
bad,Robert Half International is a temporary agency that does not appreciate their employees. They are all about satisfying their clients only.
bad,"While working at Robert Half, I never had a secured full-time job."
bad,"I worked hard for this agency and did all the duties asked of me at each assignment they put me on. I felt under paid for my skill and education level as well as under utilized. The work was variable and the relations with my agent fell apart because she couldn't place me at a decent paying job. I enjoyed working with the different law firms that I was contracted to, they were all nice people and we got along great. There were lots of wonderful experiences, it felt like every day held something new and exciting at each location. If only the agency treated me better."
bad,"I worked off and on for Robert Half/Accountemps over the years. Some of the jobs were great, but make no mistake, they are out for themselves and do not care anything about you. Only that you make them money. One time, the placed me in a position that they said was 2 to 3 weeks long. It was actually temp to perm, but they knew it was not something I wanted on a permanent basis so they lied to me, and lied to the company about me. Then when I told the company that I only wanted temporary, not perm, they cut me. Accountemps left me a message on my phone and would not return my phone calls when I called to find out about it and get more work. Then when I applied for unemployment, they lied to them and said I quit. My friend also had an experience where Accountemps tried to cut her out of unemployment. So if you want to work for Accountemps, be aware that if the job ends and they don’t have anything for you, they will lie to unemployment to keep you from getting it. Make sure you correspond with email or text regarding the end of the job so you can prove you didn’t quit."
bad,I did contract work with different companies. The Creative Group staff was constantly changing which made it difficult to get new work.
bad,Consulting company with many project opportunities in the human resources department.
bad,"I was referred to this company by a family member, that thought this would be THE place to find a new working opportunity. When I was interviewed, the manager did not even listen to what I wanted, she was only interested in filling the position she had open. It was a temp contract that I was over qualified for, so I ran out of work every day. The pay was $5.00 less than my previous salary so I could not afford to continue working for them. I am happy to say that there are other staffing companies out there that will pay you what you are worth!"
bad,"I did not have any personable conversation with my recruiter, they got me a job but did not discuss any of what i was looking for in it.  I given a hire date with no discussions if it would work for me or my schedule.  Not any follow up or communications after a contract position was accepted."
bad,They contacted me for a permanent placement and ended getting pass to a temporary assignment agent. I kept asking them to find a permanent assignment & only got 1 interview.
bad,"This was a temporary assignment with a known end date.  The hourly rate was low, and there were no benefits. The computer input work was agreeable. This involved contacting vendors for data and pricing information."
bad,"I enjoyed working for the company, wish they can find me a more stable high paying job.  It would also help if all branches are linked because I am getting emails from another branch wanting me to upload my email when it should already be in the system.  A more systematic approach and quick response would be great!"
bad,They keep you on temp and never help you get permanent employment. Don't give you enough notice before an assignment. They don't pay you enough for your skills.
bad,"Robert Half International, or commonly referred as, Robert Half, is a global human resource consulting firm based in Menlo Park, California founded in 1948. It is a member of the S&P 500, and is credited as being the world's first and largest accounting and finance staffing firm, with over 345 locations worldwide."
bad,"Working here is a full time commitment over family, kids, social. It takes over your life. You work long hours driving to hit goals. It can be a ton of fun but also a ton of stress. You have been warned."
bad,Empresa propicia desenvolvimento e oportunidades de atuação em diversas empresas e segmentos de mercado
bad,"They are friendly with you before you hired. Once you are hired, her comes the headache and stress. Management will always say they will call you for work, never do, then advertise for a position you waiting to be called for on their website. Paid vacation is only issued after you have worked with the company for a year."
bad,"Not enough projects to sustain a stable living."
bad,"Robert Half is a contracting company, and I was a contractor for them. So I can't say much about the working environment. I think they could do a better job, but that goes for any contracting company."
bad,"management is not very much concerned about the contractors’ work environment, they don’t visit , can’t reach the managers, low wages, no adjustments through the years  no paid vacations or holidays."
bad,"Being a temporary employee doesn't give you a true picture of the company you work for, because you work for a different organization. Your only contact is when you get paid."
bad,I am unaware of the corporate mission.  Utilized Robert Half for a short term placement while searching for full time employment after moving from Alabama to WI.
bad,"High turnaround, heavy workload due to people being fired/quitting constantly, disrespectful upper management who cursed employees out regularly, immediate supervisor who did not train new employees well and would get easily irritated if you continued to ask questions. I would never work at the work site again but would work another assignment with Robert Half"
bad,"I worked in an office for various companies. Generally, the Staff at RH directing me to my assignments was friendly. The hours were great. However, one local company to which I was sent was extremely scattered and mismanaged. I was glad to leave."
bad,"My manager was overwhelmed to attain his goals and did not provide much training for new employees to attain their goals, but created a fun work environment."
bad,"Recruiters do not respond in a timely manner, I had to constantly contact them for updates and reminders to keep lookig for something fo me.  Recruiters too busy"
bad,Working for Robert Half was by far the most intense career opportunity that I've ever experienced. The advancements of skills training was providing and the company culture promoted a vulture mentality. Prey on the uneducated about the business and not coach them to succeed.
bad,"No follow up, not dedicated to finding you employment and once you’ve been released you are pretty much done and forgotten. I was on a very temporary (1 month) assignment and for some odd reason they said I was released and considered a “concern” when I was TOLD I was only covering someone on leave and they came back. I came in early and went above and beyond on that assignment."
bad,Work - Life balance does not exist. Promise of a six-figure income...you may make about $50k-$60k per year. You will have to be good at sales and working with people. Branch location makes a big difference. Prepare to cold call!
bad,"Aucune notions management, pas d'humanité"
bad,"Due to the fact that it was temporary jobs, there was no typical day.  I learned to get along with everyone and each position.  There was not a typical anything.  I believe that it has changed."
bad,"did not enjoy my time here. was not set up to succeed by management."
bad,"It all depends on the client. If you fit in with the culture and are well like then the job placement will last.  Unfortunately, Accountemps., are at the clients' mercy were the employees are easily discarded like used garbage.  It doesn't matter if the employees do a good job it is all about the politics.   Once the client is out of an accounting bind and the problem is fixed they will release the temporary help.  I have seen this happened first hand.  This is especially true once their in-house staff has learned something or now feels they can handle the job without the help of an accountemps employee."
bad,"My review with the first person was good, But se got fire . and the new staff was so mean they do not care a but as. But the place I work was really g"
bad,gig economy is awful and all these temp agencies are just pushers of human labor. You are expected to do everything and get paid dirt and get no benefits. Jobs were all boring and unsatisfying.
bad,"I was unfortunate to work with international team who apparently were telling lies about my performance to my manager, who ended up letting me go. I didn't expect such unprofessionalism, as she canceled all our one-on-ones and didn't give me a chance to defend myself.  She also once mentioned that it is hard for them to find talent, as no one can stay for a long time. That obviously is an internal problem and not the problem with talented and bright people that they're hiring."
bad,"Had a daily 8 hour day."
bad,"OfficeTeam was conducting interviews in this area for local clients. I received a call to meet with them as they needed someone immediately for a local client in the downtown area. While this opportunity came at a very good time, it was the only assignment I ever got from them, even though I applied for other posted positions."
bad,"They will get you to work, but good luck having any results when your job isn't as advertised. You're told to deal with your agency first, but in my experience, you are expected to just keep going and doing the job no matter what."
bad,After 19 years  RH has dropped me. I was on an assignment and had to leave on an emergency regarding my kidney patient husband. I'm trying to get back.
bad,I worked as a temp at Artelye through Accountempts. It was a nice place to work. The staff was pleasant. I gained a life long friend while working there.
bad,I got a contract to work for MJ Roofing and was told this position will go permanent which didn't and had to scramble to find another job bills to pay
bad,"RH is very quick to get you in the door to meet with you, to meet a quota, but follow-up and actual placement is a joke.  "
bad,"Poor management, poor company culture and poor metrics. No training provided early in career and then scolded when staff does not hit metrics. Very cut throat environment,"
bad,"Robert Half is a great place to start your career but it's a commission environment and from my experience, anyone will do anything they can to win and get above you. Everyone is selfish, doesn't play by the rules and is extremely ruthless."
bad,Not a very good company no structure there. I did not know if they were to hire permanent alot of layoffs with this agency  I would not reccomment this company for long term work.
bad,I would not suggest working for Robert Half.  The managers are petty and they are uneducated regarding the line of business which they are managing.  There is no training structure and the turnover is horrible.
bad,"Being an employment agency, Robert Half provided a way to be introduced to long-term employment. However, assignments were engaging and provided on-the-job training."
bad,"Leveraged leads that are worked by the managers before being distributed to the recruiters. The problem with this is that the managers get first bite of any potential commission. They fill the easy roles and attempt to fill the difficult roles. Once their own efforts fail them, they then pass the job requisition down to the recruiters. Disgusting and discouraging."
bad,"Never worked for Robert Half directly only through a temp agency."
bad,I had a great experience using Robert Half as a Temporary Placement Company.  The person that I worked with treated me fairly and worked on my behalf to get me my current placement.
bad,This was a part time/temporary position it is not relevant. I don't understand why you insist on obtaining this information that is irrelevant to posting my resume.
bad,"This is the best role to get when first out of college to gain some footing in the corporate world, network with various individuals, and then move on to a better opportunity. It is a cut-throat work culture that is concerned more about numbers than anything else. In some ways, that focus deters from the actual recruiting of candidates. I suggest unless necessary look elsewhere for employment."
bad,This is a great company to work with that fits suitable matches well with their contractors skills. Also provides great benefits for serious working people who have professional goals to meet.
bad,"Did not have job assignments ready when the one I was on ended. Too much time spent not working and not making money.  Once you get behind on bills, it takes much longer to get caught up on them."
bad,"This job was more of a scam then anything. They were known for hiring a lot of individuals, playing them against another then letting them go and not paying them for the time they were there."
bad,I tempted for Office Team some time ago and when I was offered a full time job from a non placement agency Office Team got very upset. They even called my employer at the new place and harassed me. They treat workers like expendable slaves.
bad,It took this office at least a month to get back in contact to give me my 1st job.  Was not consistent on finding jobs and jobs are never temp to hire or long-term.
bad,Great for getting a lot of experience in a hurry to put on your CV. But no room for advancement. You have to work for them for 6 months before you can apply with a client.
bad,"Nothing special, just temporary assignments with local companies performing tasks that has nothing to do with my skillset. Primarily call-center jobs in Lansing."
bad,"Not reliable. Say things to excite you, don't follow through. I got an interview with them and was promised lots of things that never came true. Couldn't get in contact with the guy who was assigned to me. Only got 1 opportunity the whole time"
bad,"Organization was not friendly to the employee. Anytime you needed to speak to a manager, they were never available. Had to call to be assigned to another job, once this one was completed."
bad,I was lucky to get a full time position on the first job assignment with the temporary agency. I did not have much time with the company so it is hard to rate them on that time.
bad,"I am not satisfied with the  support or lack thereof  provided by RH. I have  not received  any ob offers in the past   7 months at the least."
bad,I have a Masters and they are offering me only entry level positions.  I also have 40 years experience in legal and clerical work.  I guess my age is a big barrier for them.
bad,"It was a long time ago, and the specific branch that I worked in has now closed.  There are still other  offices in the country but it wouldn't be fair for me to review them"
bad,I did not work at Robert Half a/k/a Officeteam. This temp agency assigned me to various companies for employment. This gave me knowledge of how different businesses were managed.
bad,"Administrative support for clients including: AIMCO, Bridgeport Brewery & 3 Mountains Plumbing, clerical duties and tasks such as filing, faxing, dictation, and creating customer databases as well as comprehensive administrative support for executive-level staff."
bad,I only worked for Robert Half for 3 months and then was hired by JWM from Robert Half.  I tried to contact Robert Half after being hired and no one would return my emails.
bad,"Reason they let me go I talk to much, when I worked in a room with 2 cubicles one without computer and the one against the wall I worked at had a computer.  I just talked to Auto Insurance Companies their was no one else in the room - figure that one out?"
bad,Recruiters rush Candidates on to assignments no one else wants without proper research on the client and the role. Clients' expectations do not fall in line with Candidates' and should be highly considered by Recruiters but it's not. Advertised pay isn't what you receive for an assignment. Some of the Recruiters are very unprofessional and don't communicate effectively. I'm not sure how the Recruiters have these positions but they misrepresent the great name of Office Team and Robert Half. This used to be a great company that I was proud to work for in the past.
bad,The typical day at People Ready was not really bad. It actually was an enjoying environment. Their were several raising issues about the management skill and style. It would not be an ideal workplace for me.
bad,The plant manager has personal issues that he allows to overflow into the work place. He is not a fair supervisor or considerate. He never thinks about the well being of the employees.
bad,Good experience working for Accountemps. I worked for a property management company. I had little contact with the people at Accountemps. My counselor contacted me twice in two years.
bad,They don't work for the employee.  I was only given one job.  After that they just forgot about me.  I would only go back to that kind of work if I absolutely had no other choice.
bad,"When you have worked to qualify for holiday day pay, sick time and have that taken away from you, it's a slap in the face.  Especially when your have work with great job reviews, year after year."
bad,"They hire your for your contacts and after you run out, you are usually let go so more new people can be hired for theirs. People move up by taking other people's accounts that leave."
bad,"With extensive experience that is not recent but still applicable and one year of my master's program completed, I felt the positions were below entry level.  Most were file clerk or even less."
bad,When you can't make it in for an assignment they are super unfair. They should understand that's why people do TEMPS! Horrible staff and stuck up too!!! Once you call in they will give you a second chance!
bad,"Very dirty workplace and you need to take out your own garbage. Learned how to do everything such as Insurance verifications, payment posting and billing. Was hired to be a claims collector but did not do much of that at all. Company in financial distress and work was being sent overseas while the employees corrected their mistakes."
bad,Recruiters care more about getting someone to fill a position than rather that job is actually a good fit for the one being recruited. They told me that they had the perfect job for me. Kept me on the hook. They went through all of my qualifications and knew my strengths AND my weaknesses. Then they put me in a job where I was obviously not qualified doing things that I had told the recruiter I had no experience with and I had to listen to the complaints of the business they placed me with gripe about how horrible I was. The company called them and said for me not to return. Then instead of realizing their mistake the temp agency sent me training exercises for things I'm actually good at. Go figure.
bad,This position is all about sales. You have to meet your quota and make cold calls all day every day. I enjoyed the recruiting side of the business and dealing with candidates.
bad,The culture of the position was stagnate. No potential growth in the company at all. Pay was great but it did not make up for lack of culture. kkkkkkk
bad,Employed with Robert Half for 6 months. Difficult to get a hold of specific Recruiter for my assignment. Was told they are the only one I can speak with. The positions that I see posted company site are never available when I call and inquire about them.
bad,This is a good place to work when you are between jobs. Great place to learn in different area of your filed. Working for a temp company can give you great learning experience which looks good on your resume.
bad,Sometimes the Robert Half staff employees are argumentative; do not return calls promptly; do not reply to emails promptly; post jobs that do not exist simply to get resumes. Robert Half staff do not always notify employee of termination of job.
bad,"There are not much benefit as a contractor. Minimal insurance and no holiday pay. "
bad,"Word, Excel, Outlook, emails, customer service, etc. "
bad,like the staffing agency just not the places i was sent to. I was treated different because i was a temp and when i would complain to the higher up they dismissed my complaint
bad,"I had a few positions working for "
bad,You were hired to work as a contractor for companies thru Robert Half with he ability to be hired as a full time employee with the company you were placed in.  Was a good way to decide if you wanted to work in that company
bad,assigned to an insane warehouse company. 18 hour days. Offiuce team did not care as long as they got their money. They new of the terrible conditions and did nothing.
bad,"- der Arbeitstag wird in einem angenehmen Arbeitsumfeld eingeleitet"
bad,"A typical day at work is very stressful. Some days are better than others, but for the most part, it is a very stressful environment to be a part of. Every month you start over."
bad,CEO is a millionaire doctor that runs the place like a communist country.  It's either his way or the highway.  My manager was cool as she tried to help me as much as possible with the dictatorship culture there. The controller was old and wouldn't even convert into using microsoft excel.  He wanted you to use some 1970's program still....
bad,"I have worked with this company for a number of years. This is a place that has been finding position that suit my skills. I enjoy the work, even-though the compensation could be a bit more."
bad,"Self-advocating is a must when working to gain employment through staffing agencies. Once hired by a financial company, my position was intricate, and I enjoyed learning to become skilled. My superiors had relaxed management styles, and the job itself made the workdays go by quickly. Once I became knowledgeable and proficient, I enjoyed assisting new hires during their learning process. This assignment eventually ended, and I was given a short term assignment with a different company that ended earlier than expected because they ran out of work. I have not been placed in another position even though Robert Half knows that I'm looking for employment."
bad,With the short time working there it taught me how to answer phones properly and built my confident in talking to customers.
bad,"I am glad to have an opportunity working at Diamond Resorts International as a staff accountant.  Even though, it was only five months of duration as an assignment from Accountemps.  Diamond is a multi-culture environment with the wonderful teams of people.  Unfortunately, I am not able to stay with Diamond due to the contract with Accountemps.  It is forbidden me to convert as a full time staff at Diamond.  Therefore, I decide not to accept any job placement from Accountemps."
bad,Short term positions and given a small opportunity to go further with each company. Getting a variety of experience when you are given a new assignment.
bad,"These Recruiters are lazy, they take their time and if you are lucky you may even get a 2 hr job with them.  The only reason I have ever heard anything from them is because it was a new person in the office checking up on me wondering what  was up to."
bad,"paid on time and job in industry"
bad,During my time at Robert Half I received great training but no work life balance.  Working from 8am-6pm will ware you out. If you branch out you can find cool friends
bad,"I do not recommend working for this organization if you are looking for permanent work!  I am not bashing the company as a whole, I just feel it is not a place to seek permanent work."
bad,"They have jobs available but aren't willing to work with you when a permanent opportunity comes along.  I've had job interviews for permanent work come up, and when I've told them I needed to go for an interview they behaved as if I was being completely irresponsible in asking for time to attend the interview.  I wasn't asking for days off, just a late morning or the ability to leave early to go to the interview.  And heaven forbid your kid get sick!  My wife can't be the only one who stays home when the child gets sick but when I've called in because of a sick kid, they've been less than happy."
bad,I and the company were unable to work on the project because the client asked that we discontinue the project until further notice.
bad,I did not enjoy my time working with Accountemps. Many of my calls and concerns were left unanswered and unaddressed. The agent I was working with did not care about my needs and because of this I decided to leave the company.
bad,"Im Großen und ganzen eine gute Zeitarbeit Firma."
bad,"I worked for this company in different locations and there was only one location where the customer service skills weren't horrid. I don't personally have issues with the company as a whole, but more so with specific locations of this company."
bad,"I made a tree interview and never haven't the opportunity to be select for them, they never pick up the phone after the interview, don't answer the mail."
bad,"It was just a job"
bad,"beaucoup de travail en équipe"
bad,"Lots of sales needed to keep the job.  Not a fun place to work, management was not very supportive.  The environment was too salesy and people were too competitive."
bad,I have learned that working contract is ok for a minute but I would prefer to grow or climb the ladder at a permanent place of employment.
bad,"The job itself is not bad. The job culture, security and management is terrible. The job entails screening candidates and placing them out to work when possible, not hard. Management is huge on politics and favoritism. If the manager does not feel that they click with you then you will be targeted and bullied for a variety of reasons. Managers are highly unprofessional. Before I was laid off, I saw 4 other people go before me due to decreased business. It was very unfortunate and everyday I was worried about my job security which definitely took a toll emotionally. Examples of issues: Manager gossiped about other employees, one of their top performers brushed her teeth at her desk every single day, they made fun of the temporary professionals, manager got drunk and told me she wanted to fire someone at the christmas party, terrible training was given and the manager is unethical and wrongly takes money from the company. I was told that I would have job stability and be able to make a great amount of money. Both of those things turned out to be untrue when the oil and gas industry took a turn for the worst."
bad,I was mislead about the length of time for this job. When my assignment ended it was handled HORRIBLY with lies and assumptions. I WAS NOT allow to say my side. They DID NOT defend me what so ever to the company I worked at thru them. I learned that I DO NOT TRUST TEMP AGENCIES! I WILL NEVER WORK THROUGH ONE AGAIN!
bad,"Management is horrible, lets start there. worked for a client of theirs for two months and during that two months I might've called the Plano office about 8 or 9 time (no exaggeration) my calls were never returned even after the assignment ended i had to call another office in order for them to start looking for work for me. I had a feeling they were a bit more unprofessional than what I was use to due to the fact that I was told a start date but ultimately didn't start until 2 weeks later. They were not responding to emails or my calls which made me miss out on 80 hours and not to mention the fact that another staffing agency was working with that client also and we all find out that they were making about $3 more than us, now i know what the client pays for everyone.. but to see that Robert Half was taking such a huge chunk was extremely disheartening."
bad,It was a quick assignment. Went in did the job and that was that. Only worked for them a couple of days. So one way or another I don't have an opinion on them.
bad,Work on temp jobs. Very low pay but got a lot of experience. A lot of different industries and knowledgeable workers. Would recommend it to entry level workers
bad,The person I dealt with the most was nice but it was obvious she didn't really care whether I fit the position or not...it was more along the line of sending a warm body to the site.
bad,"I was responsible for keeping the restaurant network up and running normally at all location by monitor switches, routers, modems and hubs activity."
bad,will move to various jobs every 3 months to variety of things
bad,I work for two different companies and learn new things for different industries.
bad,"I really want a permanent work place, and not changed companies often, is great to have a job, but waiting to see if you are going to have a job the next day is not fun at all."
bad,I have already provided a review for this company. Nothing further to say.
bad,You have to love sales and cold calling.  It is a very rigid company but very successful and some of the people are very nice.
bad,You might get a long term assignment and then no assignment and no one even calls you back when you let them know you are available.
bad,My daily duties were to place the online orders as well as take sales phone calls.
bad,"I was the 7th person in that seat since August of 2013."
bad,Management was more interested in numbers rather than training. The hardest part was receiving enough training to ensure success.
bad,Need some stable and temporary assignments are not always coming along working for a staffing company
bad,A lot of data entry on current employees compensation benefits that they received in commission.
bad,This Temp Agency was very helpful in placing me in a short amount of time in jobs as they came available.
bad,Churn and burn.  They did not make good on promises given during interview process.
bad,TCG was a great learning experience in the industry and I've met amazing clients along the way who build this creative city. I know that this is my time to move on to another opportunity to build my career.
bad,"I never spoke with the same person twice. I was given incorrect addresses for interviews. When I requested follow up information from prospective employers, I was told twice they ""had not heard anything from them,"" but ""they were not moving forward with me.""  I was also instructed NOT to sign with any other agency while signed up with them, which is a direct violation of unemployment regulations."
bad,"not enough jobs, each one was different.  I didn't learn anything I already didn't know.  Coworkers were friendly.  Most enjoyable part of the job was helping people"
bad,"I have worked with this agency for years and since they have changed staff jobs have become very scared. They do not keep me busy enough, so I had to move on. I desired perm employment and opportunities kept passing me by, becuase I was always on a temp assignment and I was told that I need to finish the assignment first to be considered for a perm or long term position."
bad,I worked for an assignment for them. I had some problems with some co-workers and I needed to speak to them urgently and they never got back to me. Time cards are messy. One cannot get approved til the supervisor approves it and its a hassle to ask them to get them approved and get paid. This was the worst temp agency i ever dealt with.
bad,"It is a sales environment, which works well for some, but it was not for me"
bad,"The Company, is alright to work for. I was placed very quickly which was a plus. However, the work in the mortgage department of a certain bank i was placed at was not ideal, actually quite boring...Robert Half seemed to want to place me at a company i didnt want to work at other than finding me somewhere to work that suited my degree."
bad,"This company lures you in with promises of stability and a constant flow of clients. Specifically the Parsippany office. They end up not following through with their promises. They are really flexible when it comes to work life balance, but if you want to further your career steer clear of this company."
bad,"Job security is non-existent. If that jobs ends, it can be weeks before they place me in the next position."
bad,"The most enjoyable part of the job is the flexible work schedule however, this also does not afford you any advancement or job security."
bad,They placed me on a couple of good companies and one horrible company. It really depends on where you get placed.
bad,When I first started out with Roberhalf i felt confident in my job placement. As time went on I noticed that other temp agencies stayed in contact with their candidates more frequently than accountemps did with me. When I had issues they were never really address and my point of contact changed often.
bad,i was sent to various jobs one in which i worked a whole year and was narrowed down from thirty people to five but stil wasnt hired.
bad,Robert Half is a great starting off point if you are early on in your career in the staffing industry. They provide the tools and training neccesary to get you acclamated to the ever changing industry of temporary and temporary to hire placements.
bad,Direction qui change tout le temps.  Environnement très americain et qui met tout les employés en compétition au point de se poignarder l'un l'autre
bad,"Robert Half was in a hurry to get you into a role, but once you were there did not care about you at all. "
bad,Boring office job with no reall opportunity to make good money besides a low end base salary - this job is like the movie office space - you just spin your wheels here
bad,"My recruiter didn't stay long at Robert Half. I had a hard time getting in touch with anyone regarding payroll and benefits questions. "
bad,"After being placed at a job, I discussed with Robert Half my concerns and the misleading information I experienced.  After asking at least 3 times to place me elsewhere, they ignored my request.  I left due to the lack of concern from Robert Half.  They did not seem to be concerned with the concerns.  The place I was working for them had an air condition problem and the temperature was in the 80's and having to wear a tie.  Robert half told me it was business casual in order to place me, but when I took the job I was informed it was a dress shirt with tie!"
bad,"Ask a series of questions very brief , the interview was very detailed .I has been some quite time since I have worked for the company but I remember when I had the interview , very intensed during the time  A series of questions back then . Could have changed as if now , at that time, lengthly and time consumed ."
bad,Hours and pay wasn't competitive to my experience and education. I didn't get fair treatment. Need assignments to be matched with the pay. There are many relevant positions in business.
bad,"If you can help it, try to find a job thru another agency.  I haven't had the best experience with them.  A few of their recruiters will lie if they have to to make a buck off of you."
bad,"They charged the temps money each paycheck for working through them at the employer where one temp'ed. Benefits were non-existent. They also charged too much of the employers who used them to hire the temps, so employers did not want to pay the ""buy-out"" fee in order to hire the temps permanently, as regular employees of that employer rather than the temp agency."
bad,They micromanage and do not care what you have to say. You are a body to fill a position that brings them money. Hard to get a raise. Make you feel like you don't deserve to work for them and constant reminders that you are the lucky one and are always replaceable.
bad,"You must grow your business by 10% per month or you're gone.  You make money, but 2/3 of us were being medically treated for stress.  The burnout/attrition rate is astronomical, and if want to make your numbers, you work so much you have no life outside of work."
bad,"Office Team staff have offered few openings.  Only position offered was through Robert Half Tech as IT Help Desk Customer Service.  "
bad,They have a great reputation with businesses but not with employees. They care more about getting you placed on an assignment or hired with a company for their benefit than they care about your career goals and worth.  They will try to make you take any job and pay you as little as possible. You need to know your worth before you interview and agree to work with them. You feel like more like an item than a human being after dealing with them.
bad,"When kept busy on assignments working at RH is alright. When there are no jobs it is terrible.  Once they find you a temp to perm job and it does not work out between the candidate and employer, you are dumped."
bad,I was constantly leaving messages and my rep would never  call back....... I was available for work and they don't seem  to be too concerned about the fact we don't have income and we have to wait on them
bad,"Decent job, low pay. That's not fair. Furthermore the jobs are temporary and you don't get to leave until the employers is done with you even if it's a sucky employer...you have to stay or Accountemps won't get you another opportunity."
bad,Robert half is basically a temporary place of employment.  It is a good place to acquire income and work experience. However it is not a place to have a permanent working career in.  I did not find a typical day too stressful and I was glad to have the work experience.
bad,You are guaranteed nothing and can never be certain. Because of the structure of the company your explanations of missed days or issues in work product don't usually get spread to all the proper channels and this can cost you a job.
bad,"Largely based on the company's job placement opportunities.  Performing well for a company helps, but still is no guarantee of a future placement.  Bench time is available, but only for a few weeks."
bad,You are not paid much for the work that you are asked to do.  If you can go to school get a degree and go get a profession because this is a dead end.
bad,The employees aren't valued. In the beginning it was great but upon ending the assignment management was rude and dishonest. I wouldn't recommend this office location.
bad,"Promised a full time job, But I mostly worked as on temp. work assignments. It does give you the opportunity to work at various companies and find out the work environment and what it entails, If it would be a right fit for you,  if you ever got an opportunity to get an offer for permanent employment."
bad,They paid me decent but the management and environment are enough to make one not want to be there. Definitely look at reviews prior to accepting a position with them.
bad,"A very smothering environment with little advancement opportunity. Management was horrible, loved to micro-manage. Not a happy environment. Not good a"
bad,Robert Half is a great staffing company but the sales goals are extremely high with unrealistic projections to reach them. The hours are 12 hour days not allowing any time for rest or family making it difficult to balance.
bad,"Overall working at RH was an average experience. The turnover rate was extremely high, mostly because the managers were rude and obnoxious."
bad,RHI is a large company that has high expectations for their employees. Some would say they are unreasonable in their practices and will throw each other under the bus to get where the need to be - those that say that wouldn't be wrong. I think if you work for corporate you'd be fine but one of the branches - no. They are too cut throat and demanding.
bad,"Inbound calls, office work, great pay, temp position, enjoyed the job, ,met alot of amazing people, love helping people"
bad,"Two members of the management staff there need additional training on how to communicate effectively and in a timely manner with the employees they have out in the field. They also give incorrect information, and incomplete information. Working with them is an extremely frustrating experience."
bad,"Clock in on computerized, payroll time system."
bad,"They don't get me consistent work. I understand that my experience and education are both poor, but we need jobs all the same. We all have bills to pay. I've had a few jobs that were described as basic administrative, such as scanning and filing, but turned out to require heavy lifting. Once worked at a school and had to move the bleachers the chorus kids used."
bad,"I worked with Accountemps here in St. Louis, MO (Creve Coeur) and my first two assignments went great. I went to register with the company this year and meet with some of the new recruiters and the experience was subpar to say the least. I was told I would be sent on interviews and I had a great resume but was never called. I see postings online regularly and when I respond, I receive no feedback. I don't know what's going on or what's happened with the changes going on there but the quality of service has definitely decreased!!!"
bad,Account Temps always found me great opportunities where I was able to learn and excell. The positions I was hired for paid very well and if I had to choose a staffing agency to help me again this would be the one
bad,"When I first started with Accountemps, I was pleased with the office staff. Unfortunately, in the past several months I have seen a large decline in the quality of customer service. We are required to contact the office if we experience any issues (running late, sick, etc.) but messages would not be relayed to the hiring company for hours, making temps look bad. Also, it is next to impossible to reach either Brittany or Bree via email or phone. I left countless messages when my first assignment ended and not a single phone call or email was returned or acknowledged."
bad,"I loved the work I did while on assignment with the client. Although, a lot of information was incorrectly communicated. Assignments were not detailed and permanent opportunities were falsified."
bad,When they finally found me a job it was not a good company to work for. They manager cussed alot they had no job description for me and did not know exactly wha they wanted me to do. My overall experience with this company was not good.
bad,"Robert Half was my first ""corporate"" job and it really hurt my view of larger organizations--particularly these traditional, sales-based organizations. On a typical day, everyone joins the office with a similar feeling of their heart getting left at the door. They then have a quick meeting and start hitting the phones. Though management calls it ""consultative outbound selling"" it should be called what it is--telemarketing. Bothering people. Cramming sales pitches down peoples' throats. At Robert Half, I learned how to keep my mouth shut and tow the company line. They also taught me strong relationship selling skills but much of this training could easily be renamed ""how to manipulate people."" Some of my co-workers were okay, though generally they hire people who are attractive and shallow so that they'll be good salespeople. The hardest part of the job was to go into work everyday and the most enjoyable part of the job was working with lots of ambitious, hopeful candidates."
bad,"I very much enjoyed managing my team, as well as building rapport with my clients and getting people their dream jobs! I worked very hard at Robert Half Technology and was promoted twice in a year. I learned. I learned SO much there."
bad,"I had a few assignments with them. After a job wasn't a good fit or the temporary job ended after the # number of days the assignment had, they weren't quick at putting you back into work. I had to get involved with other temporary places to help me find a job which wasn't always helpful either."
bad,"- A typical work day consisted of recruiting/marketing and tracking productivity by use of reporting."
bad,"Make a lot of promises or claims, but you might not see or hear about the position in which you applied. Worked with RH and OfficeTeam in the past. Something got lost here. You have to chase them down sometimes on some of the positions. They keep their employees/candidates in the dark until you actually start or put you with the company. I understand the business, but this makes them suspect in keeping good workers. A viable candidate, working with a competing agency."
bad,Before moving to Texas I really enjoyed working with Robert Half/Accountemps.  However the Plano location is very hard to deal with and have seen the great results from other locations.  If this had been my first location I would NEVER work with them again.
bad,"I actually ended up at Robert Half for a job posting only to be recruited by them. I had never done sales at this point so I was concerned and voiced as much. The people were nice although always stressed out to the point of being sick. "
bad,"Working for RHI was only benneficial for them, I recieved a dime raise in 18 months of working for them. They rarely contacted me about any issues, You are basically on your own."
bad,"I spent time at Robert Half and never thought that I would have to question so many of the companies practices. At times, Robert Half would turn a blind eye when clients made unlawful requests regarding candidates. Hiring managers would discriminate based upon age and race, and those who trained me would simply joke about this behavior. The company lacked overall organization and this led to a lot of issues among team members. Within the first month I noticed that the work environment caused several individuals to leave, and those who remained were extremely unhappy with their jobs. Overall, I would not recommend working for the company."
bad,"I was employed to work on various temporary office assignments which included everything from taking calls, to typing up legal correspondence for one particular client."
bad,Requested more information on Office Team. Typically worked 40-48 hours wk.
bad,They find great jobs but don't pay well at all!! They look out for themselves and not the employee they have working for them.
bad,My time at Robert Half was brief (5 months) but I can say the environment is very competitive and hectic.
bad,"The overall experience feels like I bought a beautiful car with a terrible engine. No support from branch level leadership, no communication from team - unless it was a request to do something for them. A position that requires you to keep the branch in compliance with federal regulations- and I basically watched videos to learn how to do so. The best decision I’ve ever made was to leave the company !"
bad,"I worked for Robert Half as a staffing manager in the Accountemps division. It doesn't really matter which division of RH you work for, because no matter what this is a sales driven, high performing job where managers will breath down your neck and force you to make 50 cold calls a week (at minimum) trying to sell your staffing services to companies who do not need you. When you FINALLY get a company to listen, you have to visit them, and you're supposed to get many client visits per WEEK, so employees would just fake their ""client visits"" and actually go to lunch with other colleagues. "
bad,Werk-prive was niet in balans; verlof nemen was moeilijk.
bad,"Was given incorrect information about the job.  From the software to who would be training me.  When I expressed some concerns regarding the job. I was told I had a bad attitude.   I was fine with the answers I got, and never brought it up again.  But I was still told I had a bad attitude.   It's not about the employees, it's about their bottom line."
bad,"Signed on and followed up with Accountemps for months before they found a job that fit my schedule at the time after several attempts that did not adhere to my specified allowed locations I would travel to for work/available hours due to school. Once they signed me up with a temp assignment, I had no further contact with them about anything. Was not checked up upon again once I was in my temporary assignment that I was a second alternate for."
bad,Every office is different. You have to create your own success through sales and its not in everyone best interest to help you. most see you as a threat
bad,"While I was able to find a long term contract through them, I generally found them extremely negligent.  Rarely was I provided with opportunities and almost never presented with room for advancement. They also took a large cut which meant I was payed relatively little and had difficulty requesting raises from my contracted client."
bad,"A typical day at work would be to gather all documents placed in your in box for scanning and begin to scan 50 sheets at a time. Assist in filing, archiving and electronically filing documents"
bad,"Benefits were good, solid 401k, dental, vision, health care coverages, with mutliple different options. "
bad,"Very cut throat, lobg days no matter how well you were produciong. Hard to have a good work life balance, always expected to be working till 6-7:00 every night regardless of what was happening."
bad,"Recruiting is definitely not for everyone but this is going to be the most honest non biased review possible. "
bad,"Company strategy was set but leadership could not execute and was not decisive in making decisions.  Did not know how to create shareholder value."
bad,Job is tough and you sit at a desk all day on the phone expected to make 100+ calls per day.  Just not my style I need a more active job with less pressure of a boss standing over you grilling you on how many calls/how many leads. For some people this works.
bad,"Started out as contract work hired by Office Team (Robert Half) for Canon Business Process Services.  They are supposed to hire you permanent after 760 hours.  There are people here who are still temporary after 18 months full time."
bad,While Accountemps provides a good work/life balance and good benefits the lack of leadership and guidance from leadership and lack of expected expectations and feedback make it more likely the job will be a short lived one then a long time experience.
bad,"As an administrative professional, I was hoping to temp at different companies because I like change. I found a Receptionist position placement through OfficeTeam which lasted for about a month and a half during their busy season. I loved the job but when it ended Office Team didn't have any other positions for me and I ended up being unemployed for 3 months! Unacceptable for a supposed staffing agency!"
bad,"Even with adequate working experience in the field, you are likely to be placed in an environment that doesn't suit you and pays less than you are looking for. The hardest part is reviewing assignments that won't work."
bad,I liked working here but I had a two bad experiences out of three. One manager told me I needed more college and work experience. I left there thinking I was not good enough to work there. The second time they placed me in a job it was just a fill in job while someone was on vacation after I specifically asked for long term. However the third job was a GREAT CHOICE.  I loved it even knowing it was only temporary.
bad,Do not like that they post jobs that they really do not have and then try to get you to commit to something that is totally not up your alley.  Not very helpful as far as I am concerned and not well organized. Would not recommend
bad,Made great friends at RHI but the turnover is very high and incentive compensation is difficult to reach.  Recruiters are very dependent upon Account Managers generating business in order to make any decent incentives.
bad,"I was hired into Conifer by a temp agency Robert Half."
bad,"same as Able"
bad,"•	Assisted in maintaining clinic flow; scheduled follow up appointments, "
bad,"This is an employment agency. At first look temp agency looks impressive. First interview happens with Office team in their offices. Second interview is done by the company for which temp agency is  looking to fill. The terms are temp for 6 months at which time transition occurs to permanent status. Well, It was not clear to me that you still have to be invited to join the company even after you have met the 6 month period as a temp. I worked the six months at which time another temp person was brought in. I received a call at home at the end of my shift and told this was my last day. I considered this a waste of time for me, I should have looked at increasing my skills with certifications or renewing"
bad,"After contacting my recruiter with concerns about my current placement, I had to continue to reach out to speak with him. My messages were not returned. After my assignment ended, I was told I would be contacted by another recruiter and never was. I had to call them again. I have heard nothing from them in weeks. I have a college degree and 10 years of administrative experience but for some reason I have not been a option for them. I have had much more professional dealings with the other staffing agencies in the Des Moines area."
bad,The job only offers a temporary job title/position that's not guaranteed for permanent for hire. More opportunity for growth is crucial for staff to feel confident in their work ethic and performance.
bad,"Robert Half is a bad place to work if you are looking for a good work life balance.   Less than 45-55 hours per week is unacceptable.   They pay based on performance, so you better be ready to put in the hours in order to get paid fairly and advance."
bad,I am currently working in the Salaried Professional Services arm at Robert Half. There isn't enough work provided by management. There has been a decent work life balance depending on the engagement. The hardest part of the job is not having a routine and often being shifted around to very short engagements.
bad,"The office I worked in was simply unbearable. People were simply not happy with their jobs, which lead to unhappy personal lives. There was almost no communication on how to improve the work being done. Almost no encouragement and it reminded me of what an office might feel like 20 years ago (when we didn't understand the importance of ""culture"" in the work place)"
bad,"The firm was okay in the sense that they have your best interest at heart. Hardly managed you, but horrible work culture."
bad,Every day is the same you do the same work over and over.  Nice co-workers and management is not the best.  Very poor pay and work conditions.
bad,"From the beginning of the interview process with RH I should've noticed the red flags. District and Branch managers pull out all the stops to hire you and then wait months until they train and invest in you as an employee. They call this the ""sink or swim"" period, but if you have no experience in staffing they end up wasting the company's time as well as your own. My experience with management wasn't great. I felt like I couldn't go to my bosses and ask for help and I couldn't trust them based on how I saw them treat my other colleagues. Management engages with gossip on a regular basis. They fire people pretty often and it is a very competitive environment. Lots of office politics that will take up the majority of your time, even after you leave the office."
bad,RObert Half requires high production. They will give you goals and it isnt good enough to reach the goals. They want you to exceed the goals.
bad,"not the job i was promised."
bad,"after I did not complete an asignment due to my child catching the flue, I couldn't get another job thier. thiers nothing more to say"
bad,"The assignment that I was on winded up being for 2 years. Was told that I would be made permanent but that never happened! As soon as i was told that the assignment was ending, I called the agency so another job could be lined up for me, but they kept offering me assignments that were $5 less than what i was already making! long story short, I found a new agency to work for..."
bad,"In the administrative assistant position I support 17 sales people and 7 inside sales people. It is a very busy fast paced environment, which requires a high level of attention to detail."
bad,"A typical day at work consisted of entering A/R and A/P transactions into the company software. I learned more about detailed A/P, A/R data entry and working on a deadline. The management was fair and my co-workers were very helpful. The hardest part of the job came late in the workday when it was time to make sure all of the daily transactions were reconciled before leaving the office. I most enjoyed being able to successfully assist the office staff whenever and wherever I could."
bad,"Some assignment were ok, when you the employee would speak up about a problem, the contact person always put the client first. You the employee are told well you can leave, but we can't promise that we will be able to find you another assignment for a while.  A lot of times you were stuck. If you walked off the job, you were the bad guy. Hard to get increase if you are on a long term assignment. Mini medical is a waste. You pay more money out of your pocket. Better off not having it. More money in your pay. They don't call you back to tell you if you weren't selected, so you are left hanging. Some recruiters are ok, some are rude, they don't know what they are doing. Sometimes you get call to do a 1 day event, then they might cut your hours if your suppose to work 8 hours, you may only work 3-4 hrs. Its happen to quite a few people who were working an event. Your told to go to lunch & you come back... they tell you to go home."
bad,My experience with Robert Half has not been a completely positive one. On the recommendation of a friend I worked with a recruiter in the Fort Worth office whom of which I could rarely get a hold of and often offered no real solutions to work placement assignments. She also continued to place me in temporary positions despite my repeatedly reminder her I was looking for a full-time position.
bad,I've been on their payroll since 2012 and only worked at three different locations. There's always job openings online but when you call about your job placement there's never anything available. I only get called in to work to fill in for someone else who has called in for the day. I've never had an assignment lasting longer than 2 wks.
bad,"Robert Half rarely, if ever communicates regarding resume submittal for positions applied to. Of the dozens of applications I have submitted I'm skeptical that I am not a fit for any of them, especially those I feel were written specifically for me..."
bad,"i did enjoy this job. the only downside was the branch manager who showed me that racism is alive and well in the workplace, and she's not afraid to show it, because no matter how many complaints are put in about her she will win. she's been there for over 30 years, and no matter what you say she's done, she can dangle your job over your head, attack your character, humiliate you, tell racist jokes, talk threaten your job, discuss your personal life with your fellow employees, take personal calls half the day, and no one will challenge her. however, if you do challenge her you will end up let go with the excuse that she tried to fight for you but they just wouldn't give her the funds to hire you, when you know that since another employee that was there for over 30 years just transfered out of the location, and before you came the previous person in your position quit, it doesn't matter, because you're a temp. and unfortunately the temp agency you work for thinks you should stick it out, because they were told that you would get permenantly place on this job, but you end up being told you have one week left. and instead of listening to you and trying to help you find another job, they make you feel like you're over reacting, and instead of answering your calls (when you want to check your status at your assignment) they answer the phone saying ""what do you want ....."" and avoid your calls. i did not deserve this treatment and i am very disappointed in this temp agency for allowing this to happen to me. i've been working with them for over 20 years, and never had a complaint."
bad,Was a contract to hire and received the position at LMI. Friendly and outgoing client representatives.
bad,"Were not up front about salaries, compensation, etc. They kept information from me whenever they could. Started me at a very low salary and said that they couldn't go higher yet they were getting 40% of my compensation."
bad,"I think the upper management when they call someone for a job, they should delegate the job to the to a normal recruiter below them.  This way the job seeker can get hold of someone to answer the question for a job.  Right now if an upper management contacts me for a job and if I have a question about the job, it is almost impossible to get hold of the person who contacted me.  They do not reply their voicemail or email."
bad,"The only truth I can say about OfficeTeam is that I never got to work for the company that hired me.  You typically are a temp that travels wherever the business sends you to and do data entry, for the most part, for clients.  I never recieved a call to do anything, so I guess I was forgetten."
bad,"Robert Half is a Staffing Company and you sent out as a contract employee to companies needing their services, their main focus first and foremost is their bottom line and of course, make sure that you are a good fit for the job for which you are being filled. And you are never allowed to negotiate permanent employment with a company who might want to retain you."
bad,"As a temp for RH, I found their reps to be very nice, but without a doubt, they are very client focused and seem to forget that the consultant is human too.  Also, their PTO and benefits policies for long term consultants is terrible."
bad,During my tenure at Robert Half i found the work to be very repetitive and over time just was no longer passionate about our services. However Robert Half instills a hustle that will help you succeed in any other positions you would apply yourself to moving forward.
bad,10 hour days were a bit grueling. Office culture was sassy and immature. Had to create own job orders. Not much coming in organically. Typical 80-100 calls a day recruiting and staffing job
bad,"Management did not look out for their employees best interest, they were only concerned about their clients satisfaction. The pay was great but it wasn't worth the stress and mistreatment."
bad,"I am happy to work with them, but the process for any job assignments takes too long for me to wait since I need to pay bills. When we do interview, I get the impression that I would get the job assignment right away or about a week later or two. However, it doesn't happen that way at all. I get very discouraged."
bad,"The position, hours and management is amazing. Great location and great scheduling.  If this position paid more, provided healthcare and was permanent, I would not be looking for another position."
bad,You spend the majority of your life sitting in a cubicle on the phone. Wasn't for me. Management didn't really care what you did and didn't provide guidance. The people that work there are generally young and fun which was the only good thing.
bad,"unpleasant work environment overall. catty environment, unprofessional supervisory people (not all but many), good aspects were job flow was easy and stayed busy as long as kept to self. Very pleasant co-workers outside of very isolated issues with specific individuals."
bad,"Most of the jobs, that I apply for online.  Are entry level"
bad,"Found contractor engagement contract excessive in use; Client managers created hostile and harshly insulting workplace. Turned cheerful beginnings, consistent hard work into negatives. (One even threatened to use force; abuse contractual authority) "
bad,"JSR is a great company and culture to work with, but they're growing too fast to handle it easily."
bad,This is a company that goes through people very quickly. In 5 months there I saw over 20 people leave or get fired. It is all about numbers and if you arent hitting the numbers then they will let you go right away. The training isnt there either.
bad,"I'll keep it short.  In 3 placements on their Salaried Professional Services program, none of them matched my skillsets, all were set up to fail.   "
bad,"Worked as a temp for one year through Accountemps. Very exciting assignment which required a lot of communication with entire sales team. "
bad,"Not very exciting, difficult to manage both client and candidate."
bad,Not everyone is very open. Communication is limited amongst recruiter and client.
bad,"The only expression you are allowed to show is happiness. You get bashed for looking stressed. You end up walking on eggshells the entire time you're there, watch what you say, watch what you do, make sure you don't step on anyone's toes. If you want to survive, you have to belong to a clique."
bad,It was very difficult to get ahold of their services for job opportunities. Little to no information on the job you get. The company is far. Once you finish one job they either don’t contact you or contact you way later regarding a new job position.
bad,Not a trustworthy experience.  Feeling like the company only really cares about the employer they put you with not the employee.  Job assignment was quick and enjoyed working for the direct company just not Robert Half.
bad,"Was not thrilled with the culture of Robert Half. Your handlers are somewhat inexperienced and not a great deal of help providing information or assistance. You are a billable body to them and your value rests in the amount of hours you work. They can be inconsistent in their communications with contractors, at least they were for me."
bad,"I love that they pay better a little than the minimum wage. For example, the minimum wage in NYC is $10.50 or $11.00 an hour (2017). I have always gotten at least $13.00 an hour.  They would pay $13 before NYC raised the wage.  The only problem is the work is not consistent. Will not hear from them for MONTHS and then get an assignment for a week or 2 weeks.  They say to contact them but, nothing comes of this. Send an email or call it is BS.  They will contact you if you live near the assignment.  For example, if you live in lower Manhattan, and the job is in lower Manhattan, then expect a call."
bad,"Everything was going great until they forgot how to pick up the phone. After my last assignment my emails and voicemails went unanswered. Then when I voiced my concerns I got an apology and was assured it was just because of the holiday season, then the same exact thing happened again. I feel like we broke up only I didn't know about it. I don't know if this is usually how temp agencies work (completely disregarding their clients) but if it is I would advise people to look elsewhere, very unprofessional characteristic."
bad,the company was nice to work with .. but the people that were out of line with personal comment that were not so necessary I would not work there again
bad,A great day is working consistently but not always is the work available. I loved the jobs that I was sent to but wanted something more permanent. I wish they provided me more options instead of sending me to locations that requested for me and really wasn't looking for permanent employees. The just enjoyed having me do a great job for them.
bad,"I would like to start my review stating that my experience with the sites I was assigned to by the agency was very pleasant and professional initially. I noticed that some of the employees feel that temporary employees are a threat to their positions and a very rude and unprofessional. My opinion is, the staffing agency could do better at monitoring the sites and support their employees a little more. My main objective is to represent the agency as well as myself to the best of my ability for the purpose of getting the job done. It is unfair to the persons who to take pride in what they do, to be mistreated and mishandled at employment sites because the permanent employees are insecure of their positions. It should be established that the temp employees are only there to help the company and staff. Not to steal positions from the permanent staff. I am very big on respect of myself and showing respect for others."
bad,"I covered several positions in this job, I went from one extreme to another promoted several times and was able to improve on my background experience."
bad,Had to learn thing on my own even though its a temp agency. Trainer was not helpful but was able to pick up on it fast. My job consist of process accounts.
bad,My recruiters are all unreliable. My recruiters would call me a lot but sometimes I don't hear from them. I receive empty promises. Otherwise they're all very nice.
bad,"packing customer orders, learned how to do different jobs within the warehouse. my managers were great."
bad,"Once placed with the company, they totally forgot about me. As an example, they fired the company point of contact that I had to send my weekly timesheets to, and didn't tell me. For three weeks, I didn't know and it took four weeks to get paid. They were totally inept and didn't feel like I was a valued member of their team."
bad,"Good starting place for those that are looking for a stepping-stone. "
bad,In 2005/06 worked a few assignments for Accountemps Sarasota & West Palm. Pay wasn't that great but they kept me busy.
bad,"My review is this:  you are a product for Robert Half, and don't ever forget that.  There is very little time off.  The benefits are nearly non-existent."
bad,"Robert Half was able to offer several assignments, during my contract seeking.  Some were temporary, others were temp to hire.  I received a permanent job offer, which I accepted."
bad,"Poor customer service.   Only interested in you if they have a relevant opening that you are qualified for.   They throw too many candidates at a job, instead of just sending the two or three most qualified.   Like throwing spaghetti at the wall to see if something sticks."
bad,Extremely high paced work environment.  The office is a bull-pen style set up with 50+ team members.  Great for independent workers who is comfortable working non-conventionally.
bad,Unable to comment. Did not interact with staff in person. Only received a telephone call offering a new assignment. Did not report to the office. Unable to review.
bad,"As a job seeker, once you are placed into your first assignment the team at RH will be impossible to reach, never call back and it will take a lot of time and effort trying to track them down to advocate for you or get anything done.  Then they do not follow through or up on anything.  Typical Miami workforce mentality."
bad,"Robert Half is hit or miss when it comes to project assignment, insofar as client needs vs. consultant skills. Often I am assigned to projects that I am over qualified for just so they can bill. Once on a project, I don't hear much from my representative, unless there is some issue that needs to be addressed."
bad,"As a contractor at RH, my experience varied with my assignment.  I would say that the company is focused on the less skilled requirements.  They would probably not be the best partner for an up-and-coming professional."
bad,"The position was data entry and the associates at this contract job were nice; the location of the job was a little further then I preferred. Traffic was bad and the parking was in a parking garage a distance from the job location. I stayed positive that I received excercise, but the walking distance became difficult during the winter season and getting the flu. Did not see this job as a long term future career."
bad,Robert Half offered me the temporary employment I needed. I had a variety of Temporary Employment. One of my temporary positions lead to my current employment.
bad,They provided good training but the biggest problem was the significant amount of turnover. The stress of the job gets to most people and management does not do much to fix it.
bad,"As a younger person I had a very hard time dealing with office team, they were very excited when i first started which looked like a good sign but after my first placement as a temp was up they stopped calling for positions. It has been months since i have heard anything from them and i don't plan to anytime soon."
bad,"My placement is with ShopCore Properties, a large national commercial property management firm, in their East Coast office."
bad,I worked with Robert Half as temporary employee looking for permanent work. I only worked with them for 4 months and they may have given 2 or 3 temp jobs.
bad,I do not wish to provide reviews of companies and their stuff.  I really do not have an opinion at this time but  seem to be forced to complete these reviews to continue.
bad,"Only care about their bottom line, not the employee. They just fill positions with their goal in mind."
bad,"I've been able to work with TCG once and it was positive, but thereafter things have been incredibly disappointing. The recruiters are very hit and miss and inattentive, and apparently only leave job postings open for a day or two before mysteriously ""filling"" them. I usually don't like doing online work reviews because if you have a bad experience it can come off as an employee being bitter but this company is not bad (especially for creatives) I just with they would be more consistent and upfront about their employment opportunities."
bad,The temp job I worked for this place was a pretty decent place to work. Now dealing with the recruiter for the temp job wasn't the greatest. She was very closed off and hard to work with
bad,"Prospect, recruit and interview with candidates in-person, by phone, and using various digital methods to establish strong business relationships and followers. Ongo- ing account management and client contact with all managerial levels to determine candidates fit for the assignment and viability to support specific current and future client needs."
bad,"They do not pay well"
bad,"The people don't care and all they say is ""Okay"" to everything. I could find a job by myself. They say to call so you can give them feedback about the assignment and still they say ""Okay"" like it's the only words they know."
bad,"Usually, you are given an assignment where your manager (typically a woman) calls you and tells you the details of the job, the location, the salary and the number of days you will work. You then decide if it is a yay or nay then proceed to accept or deny the position. The more positions you accept, the more you and your manager get paid."
bad,"The technology segment is very poorly managed in the Chicago Market internally.  Extremely high turnover, little work life balance, and misleading comp plan."
bad,"Company was disorganized. I only met my recruiter once. They required me at the time to fax in my timesheet. On multiple occasions they told me they received it, but forgot to entire it into the system so my pay easy delayed."
bad,"They ask you what you want to do, you explain in detail and they send you to a location that has nothing to figure!  I explained to them that this was not the type of job I was looking for; they were upset that I didn't want to return.  My contact was very condescending and then I overheard her talking about me to other employees.  I thought this was very unprofessional and I told this to the recruiter. He still wanted me to return, there was no way that was going to happen.  I knew they would never call me again, and I told them this; however, they claimed that would not happen.  I haven't heard from them since.  Not very professional, nor a way to develop a trusting business relationship."
bad,I worked for account temps and office team. They could use better communication with employees. I think there is better agencies out there if your looking for permanent or part time work.
bad,"Disappointed in first job placement. Was told it would be full-time, I would not have to sale or solicite, and job would last 4-12 weeks. Also, I was not told by the Office Team manager I was working  with when my last day of work was, I was told by the office manager at the business where I was assigned."
bad,there needs to be more opportunities for virtual assistants and other professionals like realtors or support assistants in the real estate industry that these similar agencies could provide
bad,I believe the recruiters were trying to get paid vs. listening to my needs as an employee. My experience with staffing agencies has me burnt out. I am only interested in direct hires.
bad,I think that this company is very tough work for. The extremely long hours with no guaranteed lunch and continuous call center feel is definitely not for everybody.
bad,Very poorly managed. Not very good training tactics. Very nice location and for the most part good people. So so experience.
bad,Great first experience for the HR professionals. Learned how to have critical conversations with employees and how to work with a wide array of business professionals in the market.
bad,"Kept me busy and working at various industries. I constantly learned from these assignments, wihich I know will asssit in my future endeavors."
bad,Contract work using multiple skills filling necessary functions in areas where companies needed interim associates.
bad,"Help Desk Specialist for different school districts within the United States, responsible for assisting school district staff with any questions, trouble shooting, or concerns with their standardized test via phone or email."
bad,"Decent contractor to work for. Not very personable, yet tends to micro manage employees. When contracting, client is always correct even if treating contractor less than par"
bad,Not the environment that I enjoyed working in at all.  Others have made a very successful and long career in the staffing industry.  I decided to take my focus elsewhere.
bad,"Robert Half Inc is an international staffing service, that is set up to be the most competitive and financially successful organization in the world. For competitive and sales oriented individuals, with a preference for call centers and being on the road, this is a great fit."
bad,"I printed back up files for 3 months. It was a good atmosphere, the other employees were friendly. The hardest part of the job was that I didn't have a lot of direction, an employee was let go and once she was gone no one really knew what was going on."
bad,good place to start a job.  employees are nice and helpfull.  Accountemps helps you find the perfect job for you.
bad,"The attorney's office I work for would probably be a better place to work with more professional staff and more established and organized means of conducting business.  There is no training, and they expect you to learn legal process on your own without any resources.  You also have so much to do that you don't have time to learn.  Everyone is stressed, and there is a lot of hostility and lack of professionalism which is stressful in itself.  The pay is probably in the bottom 2% in the country for what we do, and there is no employee appreciation or motivation."
bad,"I have a hard time saying that I have had a great experience with Robert Half.  Unfortunately, they have placed me in positions where the company is desperate to fill a spot because someone left abruptly or they have taken on so much that they have to hire someone ASAP.  This results in lack of communication, low morale and poor training.  The poor training creates problems because the staff assumes you will know the job after a brief run through of the day-to-day tasks but they leave no room to go over typical issues or concerns.  It seems as though the staffing agency has no real compassion for you.  You are just a candidate, not their client.  They make that very clear to you after 2 or more assignments."
bad,Placed within organizations needing long-term professional experience in diverse department areas and the accounting cycle following GAAP.
bad,I received one assignment from this agency. It was a good one that was to have lasted 4-6 weeks and it barely lasted 3. I was abruptly told I was no longer needed without an explanation. I have received no assignment since although I was assured they would find something. I have applied for other jobs through them but have not received any responses.
bad,Various duties depending on work assignment. Staff use you as more of a tool than an employee.
bad,I did not stay with company for long.  Assignments ended and I didn't feel that they were trying to find me a long term position.
bad,Not employee friendly.  Management was young and very inexperienced.
bad,There was a disconnection when I was placed on the assignment in 2008 now I am certain there's the personal touch.
bad,They don't send me out on anymore assignments. Distance I have to drive is an issue to them.
bad,Enjoyed the independence and flexibility but had trouble getting new engagements in my area.
bad,I developed a great deal of data entry experience through this company. It also help me gain a broad awareness of office skills.
bad,Robert Half can get you a temp assignment with low pay.  What more can I say.
bad,There have been plenty of times that I was working with Accountemps and the employer pulled out a little before the 90 days with no hire. The worst was the last time when I was texted and told not to come to work because my job was now part time! I then was told I was no longer going to work there and they couldn't find me another job for a long time.
bad,I had several jobs which I was assigned.   These jobs I was hired for had nothing to do with my training in secretarial school.  But I enjoyed working at the different companies and hospital.
bad,Depends on the contract you are fulfilling. Some placements can be fun and some can be boring.
bad,I didn't have enough training to be there long enough to prove myself.
bad,Isolated feeling in department. Not given appropriate access to systems needed to complete assignement.
bad,I have do spreadsheets and talk to invoices. Talk to people about the invoices and work on the computers
bad,"The position was listed as temp to hire, but in the end they really wanted someone with accounting skills, of which I informed them in the beginning I did not have, yet they still hired me in a temp to hire role."
bad,"I enjoyed the job and was always busy however, I worked for the CEO who was quite needy and demanding. The HR department was not very trustworthy and I felt like I had to walk on egg shells every day. The job allowed me to go to school. I liked how different my days were. I was hired through the temp agency Robert Half and was let go from Bossard on a Friday with no notice what so ever. When asked why, they told me they wanted to make the position full-time and when I said I would work full-time through the summer they told me they already hired someone for the posotion. I did not leave with a positive view of the company."
bad,I woukd sort mail and transfer to the correct departments. Fax records according to priority. Create and file medical records.Enter info into packing system.
bad,"I was the lead accounting clerk at a manufacturing company. I processed 300 invoices daily, contacted vendors if they had any disputes or if we needed corrections on purchase orders"
bad,It's an ok agency i don't like you tell them what pay rate you are looking for and they will pay make less like jobs that pay 12 they will pay you $9.00 even though they have a gap to negotiate a better pay because they charge the client a high fee for their service. they rather pay you less
bad,This staffing agency is one that I've worked with for a while. It's one that will keep you busy but the compensation and benefits are not competitve. It's the perfect agency for those straight out of high school or working college students.
bad,Worked for them in the past and they were OK.. but getting a response from the recruiters is very difficult to do...
bad,"They pay you really well, but the atmosphere is high pressure and high stress."
bad,I only worked with this company on one or two jobs. I believe on position was a receptionist and I don't remember what the other position was.
bad,It was a quick and easy assignment where I got to use my very fast computer skills
bad,"RH did a great job matching me up with a firm. It felt as if they knew what I needed and wanted, more than myself!"
bad,"I worked for Robert Half as part of their Salaried Professional Services program which means you are a full time employee with benefits and even if you are not on an assignment they will still pay you your regular weekly pay. The problem though is after an engagement ends, they then try to find another engagement for you and in most cases you have to interview for them. On some occasions you will get a project without an interview, but not much and if they don't get you an engagement then eventually they will lay you off."
bad,I worked at very nice places.  The only problem was they were all part-time.  I needed full time.  Maybe none were available at the time.  I liked the staff at Red Bank very nice.
bad,this was a temporary contract position doing review work for class action suits. Returning to litigation support work proved unexciting and difficult because the field had changed tremendously since i last worked in it.
bad,I liked working with Robert Half the work load is just not guaranteed I like to stay employed and when the work load is slow and your waiting to get a call for your next assignment can be a bit frustrating.
bad,Best worker I can and be on time everyday and would love overtime. make sure I bring lunch everyday and never be late back on my break . Make sure if I’m absent to warn my supervisor
bad,They advertise high paying jobs and 40 hours a week but that not what you will get. they cant seem to just tell you the truth they make more the half of what they are paying you
bad,"The recruiter I worked with was great, but when she left the other recruiters dropped the ball on helping me as well as others find a job.The recruiter I was turned over to never returned calls or emails"
good,"I worked as a temp via Robert Half during the economic downturn.  They were great in keeping me employed.  Some of the ""short term"" positions turned into long term, which was helpful."
good,There is nothing to write. It has been so long ago that I don't remember. It was great when I needed the temporary work. But as a single parent I was continually looking for full time employment.
good,"A typical day was whatever was assigned."
good,Staff appear to be working for you but you have to do alot of work to keep them looking for work for you. Didn't get pay for all time work because employer misrepresentated situation.
good,"Never got a permanent position, the staff kept me in short term position and never made over 13.00 an hour, and if i did it was for less than a week! I was loyal but the company wasn't . Now after working for them all this time they never call me for anything worth something!"
good,I use them because I have to. The company finds employment opportunities but are not honest about their contracts.
good,I have no comments for this company.   It is a temp agency looking for their own profit.  I have applied for another positions and the recruiter always tells me I can't be considered because i already have an assignment.  Even if I don't like my assignment I have to be here until they want.
good,Robert Half garner's a portion of temp worker's wages and connects them with company's willing to exploit workers without benefits for low wages until they decide if they are worth hiring.
good,The job assignment itself was good but the way managers and team leads handles employee was like the employee was grade school kids.  The way managers tells the employee that they are no longer needed is an embarrassment.
good,Started the day with a morning meet and reviewing my daily goals. Then began making calls to recruit candidates and schedule interviews. I also made sales calls to clients on a weekly basis to grow our clients.
good,"My above review rating is strictly for KM Larson Co."
good,"I am only giving a review from a temping standpoint. This agency plays too many games for me. One minute they have jobs posted but will never notify you with an opportunity to applied. I believe they have favorites and not that hungry to make money. "
good,Would not really recommend this job. THey offer temporary jobs and they pay their employees differently even though everyone is paid the same rate. Miscommunication all over.
good,"I would like to see management place proven leaders that were in prior positions, sent on assignments timely. The process is not productive. Losing out on ROIs in my opinion."
good,I enjoyed the job they placed me at. However they don't allow you to be able to go home if kid or house need you. They also tell you to try a different branch if you resign from one of the positions they place you in.   Then  when you try they will not work with you
good,This was just a temporary job which there was no room for advancement. There were a lot of turn over with this company. I never really had any problems with this job location.
good,"Employment specialist are great to work with. they are very informative. wages are fare. assignments are compatable."
good,"Professional agency, placed fairly quickly with client in rural part of San Diego"
good,"Was told on more than one occasion that the job would be temp to hire, but in the end the assignment ended."
good,I am responsible for inputing information in our donor database Raisers Edge by Blackbaud. I process Tree of Life Orders as well as Shining Star Awards.
good,I sat in the front desk. Greeted both employees as well as customers. I answered the phone and directed to the corresponding extension. I learned that you my positive attitude its most needed in this type of setting because people are usually stressed with presentations and meetings. My co-workers were very supportive. I enjoyed showing up to work each morning.
good,This company builds it's name on a brand. The culture is driven around the Happy Hour and who you choose to be friends with it. Very similar to High School Heirchy. The attrition is extremely high and only the best will survive. The rest will either get filtered out or find another place to go.
good,I have worked on and off for Robert Half for over 20 years. They have kept me busy between full time work and I am very appreciative to have the opportunity to continue working for them.
good,This is an agency to get you into a job and show your skills and hopefully get you a permanent position with the company you have been placed in. Good people to work with. Helpful when you are searching for a position.
good,I have worked at Office Team for 5 years.  They started off great but have not been able to find good paying assignments or consistent assignments or me.  The staff gives a great spiel but will forget about you quickly.
good,"Since it has been so long since I worked for Robert Half, I really don't remember anything outstanding, either pro or con with the company.  I do recall they sent me on temporary placements that were interesting for the most part."
good,Tension between employees as well as upper management. There is a great deal of improvement needed here by all who work here. Much complaining going on.
good,"I have worked on several projects with Robert Half, the project was great assignments but short the pay very low.  I was told to call in every week which is called availability, I've done just that and never got a call. Slow turn around finds another assignment."
good,"If you are looking for contract work, Robert Half is a good bet. They usually contract for accounting and audit; not so much IT. Compensation is on an hourly rate, so obviously there are benefits, bonus or health care."
good,"worked in cubicles, not a lot of fun to be had until we went to lunch. Hard to get needed documents from other employees to finish the clients list for payment."
good,"They put me to work immediately which is a good thing, however the pay rate was lower than what, I was asking for. Pay days are never the same. You also have to enter your work hours online."
good,"When I worked for Robert Half I was happy to get the work.  I enjoyed working with the staff.  It filled a need.  As far as the company, the benefits at the time were all taken away. You did not want to work for them for a long period of time. It may have changed."
good,"Operate switch boards, answer multiple phone lines, greet clients, data entry work, clerical work and shipped and received mail for executives. Answer emails"
good,I was working as a contractor for Robert Half.  The client needed some extra help during Open Enrollment for COBRA.  The people I worked with at the client's location were a great group.  I enjoyed this assignment.
good,I wouldn't make a career here.  No advancement.  Can't get hired in with the company.  No incentives.  This job is okay if you want a second job.  The supervisor is easy going.  The work is very easy.  There are only four people that work in the area.
good,"They place people by the demand of their clients. They do not take the time to find a good fit. Hit or Miss style. "
good,"I mean it was a staffing agency, pay was ok at the time and the location I was in was great. The person who placed me found me something really quick."
good,"not family oriented, I was looking after an aging parent, it was detrimental to my tenure there. I would have liked to have stayed at the job, I liked the people I worked with & the job I was doing."
good,The position I was placed in was initially short term but resulted in me being their for four months.  The communication of the representatives of OfficeTeam of Los Angeles on Figueroa Street were not useful with placing me with consecutive work. I have taken to other employment agencies outside of OfficeTeam to find work and have been successful in my endeavors.
good,"Spotty performance and communication from managers.  "
good,Good starting point but hard to get feedback or in touch with anyone. I have worked with this company for several years and have only had  work for six months.
good,Enjoyed my assignment at Morehouse School of Medicine. Great senior buyer that I learned a great deal from.
good,Office Team does not show they are interested in keeping their temps continously employed.
good,"Review orders requested for expediting deliveries "
good,The upside was the getting to know new prople and learning new skills. The only downside was that they are based in Kalamazoo and couldn't find enough assignments to keep me as busy as I wanted to be.
good,"The pay was not the greatness, for the work you had to perform, and the location was so far, because the gas prices would take most of my salary, but over all the hospital was nice."
good,It was okay. I prefer a more permanent job. The place where I was assigned ended up hiring me so I guess that I can't complain.
good,I currently do contract jobs for Robert Half International Currently I am working for their Office Administration Division. I am working on a long term contract.
good,won't pay you on time. period. worked on a client side where a person brought a gun to the office! robert half seemed to think this wasn't an issue and even said it was MY FAULT as I left.
good,"They kept me working, however, job was not guaranteed and always short-term assignments.  Never tried to put me in a permanent position which is what I wanted."
good,"Good company to work for. I enjoyed them and their support that was given onsite and with the company. "
good,Kept me working but not good matching relevant experience with jobs. Need to be better on getting clearances for jobs. Need to communicate sick protocol more effectively.
good,I’ve been working with RH since January 2019 and they never would tell me how long the contract was for and I told them I wanted to work a permanent position. This was far from permanent. They don’t pay for holidays no matter how long you’re there. They consistently lie about the job and puts tension between the employer and myself. I wouldn’t recommend this company.
good,regularly given a change in assignments. no reasoning given. regularly lied to about assignments and employers. communication was not even an option in this agency.
good,Reps were not proactive and had to keep on them for job assignments.This is a temporary employment agency and I had better experience over the years with a few other organizations. I would not use them again.
good,"It's a start but not an ending. "
good,"I completed schooling for Paralegal, told need experience and should look into RH.  I did, the jobs they supplied to me was for more data entry work.  I never did get a job in the paralegal field."
good,They do not tell you facts of jobs they place you in and if you are harassed on a job and you inform them about it and you loose the job they dnt care
good,When it comes to Accountemps they pay low.  They don't want to give raises does not matter how long you have worked for them.  The benefits are not good. Because if you have a dr they don't accept the insurance.
good,"The great thing about Robert Half was the ability to get a position quickly, the down side is no paid time off and lack of understanding of life outside of work such as children and their needs."
good,It was ok. There were no direct hire opportunities. Recruiter was not always available to see me or answer questions. I had to leave alot of messages. We played phone tag alot.
good,"This company doesn't have any secure for any job, as employee I have question for them but they never have answers for me, it wasn't no body who i can talk."
good,"It’s contract work, no expectations. Poor if little communication from a rep, on my 9th person over 10 months, rarely checks in, doesn’t seem to care if job duties match what am paid, won’t show you a great fit or pull you if on an assignment- basically you are deadlocked and a butt in a chair. "
good,Worked 6 to 7 hours per day. Learned how to transfer calls to other offices in other buildings. Worked with other employee very informative and patient with new duties.  Getting used to all of the companies that were not located in the same building was a challenge. Meeting the diverse culture of people and getting to know them.
good,"Placed in temporary to permanent positions, where there's too much competition for advancement. Once you're in a position, you're stuck in that position."
good,Serviced 4 Departments. Learned to wear different hats. Interesting. Multicultural. Supervisor not available.. I felt that I was good at my job in all.
good,"PROS:"
good,"In two different placements by Robert Half the recruiter looked out for their own interest verses looking out for the candidates,  The recruiters were more interested in the money they could make off the client than the me the candidate . I worked  for them in the past and did not the same experience."
good,"They will pay you fairly, the managers for Robert half are easy going and easy to talk to. This is a temp agency, so I do not work directly with the staff I am at an off site location."
good,"Atmosphere was mostly relaxed, the employees were great to work with.  The company brought in weekly groceries so that we didn't have to worry about bringing a lunch.  Office was in an industrial area, and if you didn't have transportation of your own, getting out for lunch would have been tough."
good,"At the time of employment I was not treated as how they state they treat their clients, I was overworked, looked over and not paid according to the job description."
good,"Not a place to setting but you can gain experience and network while providing temporary service. One assignment I've held for couple years, the others are for three to four weeks long."
good,"The typical work day is all day. You take your work home. Candidates will call you after hours and your manager will ask you to coordinate job orders. RH is a high stress environment with a terrible compensation structure. Management is helpful but they micromanage at every point. The culture is very political with everyone fighting for job order credit. "
good,Got laid off with the job I was placed in and they never found me another job afterwards. I had almost perfect attendance and had highest scores for inbound calls.
good,"It was a good temporary job at RPS even felt like a family till RPS hired another temp from another agency that was aggressive and personally insulting to me as a woman and with different political view points. Though I kept those to myself, it was somewhat known by other people in the office. I was laid off because of budget cuts but not sure if that was the real reason but Robert Half advisor did not give me good information to handle that situation properly and I was laid off. They have yet to find me another position."
good,"I've been hearing that the things i loved about them have gone to the wayside. They used to give you a Length of Service bonus that was the equivalent of a 40 hours, that's been cut in half. The health Insurance which wasn't great, is now gone. "
good,"I only work for the company through Accountemps for about a week.  A typical day at work was to input payables, cut vendor checks and mail them.  I learned nothing I didn't already know.  Management at this company was kind and the co-workers were of no help to me."
good,Loved the recruiters.  I would be lucky to hear from them once in every three months though.  I was a booked for a job only to be told the day of that it was cancelled.  Very disappointing to say the least.
good,"This is a fast paced environment that really expects a lot from its staff. Office space has a younger vibe, but the role is difficult and demanding."
good,Enjoyed working for different companies & see personal growth.  I did not get to know employees well since I was a temp & did not know how long I was needed.
good,"I worked with Office Team (2) two years at a very hostile vehicle impound. (My last and only assignment) The job wasn't hard, the training was good, but the pay was not worth the daily ridicule you face with customers', not mention I had to threaten to quit before a raise was issued. Also the assignment was a 24/7 facility, which they milk the heck out of OT. This is good for extra pay but bad if your commuting by public trans. Walking-in any inner city streets is dangerous at certain hours. "
good,"benefits are minimal, no maternity benefits, no communication after 6 month mark.  The reps do not call you back, no real push for permanent placement."
good,Very average starting base salary. Poor leadership as a company and terrible ethics.  Fast-paced environment. High volume cold/warm calling. Leadership fields calls and disperses them as they see fit.
good,"No good benefits. If they find you work maybe, maybe not, it depending on your qualifications. Sometimes you might have to wait for weeks in order to get a job assignment."
good,At times it felt like I was working on an island due to me being a contract worker.  Maker sure you continue to market yourself during our assignment to provide the next contract or full-time position.
good,"This company did not support me and allowed the employer to disrespect and lie on me.  I decided not to work for this company in Nashville ever.  The company in San Antonio was great.  They found great company I could work for, but pay was not enough to stay and contract ended quickly."
good,"Each morning duties were assigned based on the needs for that day.    My co-workers were great.  Assignment ended/looking for fulltime. "
good,"I really can not say anything bad about account temp, except they never call me for any more jobs after my last assignment was completed."
good,"I loved my colleagues and my loyal customers. Other than that, there is not much to say. My co-workers & clients are the reason I stayed as long as I did."
good,"The company has a great system set up for working remotely. There could be more collaboration between staff from different levels. The job is pretty easy, just needs better coordination."
good,"Robert Half is a productive place to work with a fun team. However, compensation is minimal. Narrow chances for advancement."
good,"Worked because I had to pay my rent."
good,Just not enough work. I worked for a few months and that was it.  They offered work that didn't pay for me to do.  Expenses higher than income.
good,"Answer phone"
good,"I worked for various companies as a temporary employee. Each assignment as different from the one before. "
good,RHI is a great company. I am thankful to have worked there and look forward to something new.
good,This was a great place to work if you always wanted something different. Learned many programs and work ethics. Some Profeesional and some Casual. Loved the constant change
good,"Robert Half is ok, but be careful of the document review project in Tampa. The firm treats the attorneys like high schoolers on detention. Morale is pretty low and the atty leads have pretty high demands being placed on them by non-lawyers. They say they want you to review at least 100 dockets per day and if you're slow, they will speak with you first. However, several people were let go without so much as a warning. Just beware! If you have no other choice, take the job, but keep looking for a permanent position."
good,"I worked for four months for a very low wage that barely covered my gas, which I did happily since I was told this was temp to perm position. I met the production and quality standards of the highest staff members within one month. Then, I was told there would be no further need for my services."
good,They send you to great companies but the assignments are too short. The pay is not up with cost of living you have to really fight for a fair pay. They don't check in on there employee to make sure things are going well they tend to collect the money and work more on there relationship with the company and not the contactor.
good,Sent to different locations and would start a temp to hire. Never was hired at any of the locations. Some locations you would be there for a week and you would get a call saying the company hired someone they sent over while you were temping for the employer.
good,"Most enjoyable part of the job was the people and always keeping busy and challenged.  "
good,"I have performed a variety of IT services.  This includes setting up computer labs, repairing laptops, wiring for routers, and other IT duties.  I have worked at a school and the Convention Center.  Both locations were very satisfied with my job performance."
good,Make all these fast decisions with no thought or planning and you have several meetings for everything local branch is working endlessly stressed to-the max micromanaged in this department the pitch sounds great but the job sucks a lot of work not enough recognition management on power trip
good,I was hired for a temp to hire position and after 1.5 days was told the position was no longer available. After that I have not heard anything from them about other positions. I have called twice now and they say they have nothing for me but when I go online I see at lease three jobs that fall under my skillset.
good,"At this particular clinic, the employees were not happy.  About half would call in sick, other employees would be late.  Management was poor and the training was not consecutive.  One employee would say one thing and another would say another."
good,Not committed to providing direct hire positions. Say it is a temp to hire but it is only for a short period of time. Say it is for 3 weeks but is only for one week or less
good,Took long time to get a job after applying with them. Worked at Consolidated Health Plan for a year thru the temp agency and then applied with CHP to be an employee there fulltime.
good,"I had a temp position that disappeared one day with no advance warning. All I was told was that ""I was not a good fit"" by someone at Robert Half. The lack of communcation was appalling and unprofessional."
good,"Your experiences depend on which company they place you with and that depends on what openings they have.  If you like to bounce around between jobs for mediocre pay and no benefits, then this model should work well for you.  If you're looking to be placed permanently, this could be hit-or-miss, mostly missed.  There's always the suspicion that they're making a hefty profit margin on your work."
good,Develop and grow client base by marketing our services for contract and/or contract-to-hire staffing solutions; market to clients via telephone as well as conduct in-person meetings with C-level executives and key decision makers. Participated in local trade association and networking events to solidify Robert Half Technology’s presence in the local business community.
good,"Not a bad doc review company. Just keep do not get sick; they have no respect for a doctor's appointment and will let you go if you do not hit 40 hours per week, despite medical reasons."
good,"Company set up to be good, my personal experience was negative due to my boss whom I discovered was cheating other people out of commissions and I was persecuted for it by her and finally decided to quit, she was later fired for exactly what I had uncovered - a few months after I left the company on my own.  Sad... could have been much better for me if upper management would have been more concerned about there integrity instead of their personal friendships."
good,Invoice and checks processed utilizing TMW and GP Dynamics 2015 software.Logistic drivers’ paperwork breakdown for Ford and Chrysler divisions daily.Accident and Trailer damage claim management which included updating folders  and contact with company dispatch; repair service shops; and claims adjusters.
good,"These people are great recruiters, however it's extremely expensive for a company to hire you from them. They are very diligent in trying to find you positions, however if you're looking for permanence I would go through the head hunter rather than AccountTemps."
good,Robert Half as a staffing agency is great. They have some very good jobs that can turn into careers. My experience at their corporate office in the Payroll department; however was deplorable. Without going into slanderous territory I will leave it at that.
good,"Great assignment, onsite location with the client was friendly helpful and engaged. My recruiter with Accountemps was not engaged and rarely followed up with me."
good,"I went to a few assignments one where the real estate company did not even know I was coming, so the recruiter didn't coordinate things properly."
good,"Robert Half is an excellent incubator and training ground for salespeople.  If salespeople can survive the constant pressure and competition, then they will leave with the best sales training in the industry."
good,The job was very interesting .  I was able to go to different locations and meet new people.  I learned a lot of good things to carry forward to the next phase of my life
good,"I worked as a Consultant for them when I wanted full-time employment! was told that I could work to start as a Consultant and that there was nothing for full-time Desktop Support at that time. It seems that there is No Time although I see the postings on their Websites for Desktop Support Full-Time positions, yet when I apply to those positions Nothing happens. And I have been offered projects that leftovers that seem to be that other Consultants turned down!"
good,"They're great if you're between jobs and need money ASAP, but don't expect to get good or reliable income.  They match you with jobs that just barely match your experience.  Temp to hire positions never become permanent.  Great for college students or paying the bills while looking for a permanent job, but not enough financial stability to actually live off of."
good,"My days  were always busy. I learned how to multi-task and accurately.   I learned how to be a ""people person"" and great team-player.   I enjoyed being placed at different companies."
good,the average staffing agency.. not much to expect from any staffing agency.. they help you find jobs and pay low wages.. this is typical of this industry...
good,Working with Robert Half has expanded my horizons in learning new skills to apply with current and future employers.  I learned about flexibility needed to work in Human Resources.
good,"This company had many different jobs that you could do. It was hard to get a permanent position, because the amount they wanted was high. The person I worked with was friendly."
good,Office Team is the typical job placement firm. Pay is not equal to working for an actual company. Difficult to obtain a higher salary with  good company
good,Robert Half has a very cut throat and stressful environment. It is a good place to work as a resume builder. A lot of people will just work there to gain good experience and then move on.
good,"I had many different placements while I was at this company. They will place you anywhere, does not matter if you would like the company or not. Good job during college."
good,lack of transparency with candidates. rates are 100% higher than the rate the candidate gets paid. RHI charges companies a conversion fee to hire candidate to in-house position and gives none of the rate to the candidate for doing all of the actual work.
good,The experience that I have had with this company has been very negative.  I was told things that are not true.  Always promised temporary to hire and the jobs are not ever that and the pay slowly declines the longer you work there.
good,"Not a fan of this particular job, it was a repetitive, never changing da  to day job. I would never want to work here again. No room to grow or promote, just another job to get a pay check."
good,"It is hard to break into the paralegal field in my city. Robert Half can help young paralegals and legal assistants accumulate much needed   experience. The details of the job will change depending on the assignment. The pros and cons of temping are pretty apparent, but I found my experience with RH better than past staffing agencies I worked with."
good,"No real opinion as first position I was placed at wanted to hire me.  It did take over a year to complete the hiring process.  not known if it was  because of the Staffing company or the hiring company."
good,"While the pay was good, when it came to issues that I had with the company that I was assigned to, Robert Half did not in anyway shape or form back me up. They chose to ignore the wrong doings of the company, and accepted and supported that company's  unfounded allegations.When asked to get proof of these allegations they refused to do so. Then refused to assist me with finding another job assignment. While they pretend like they are there for their employees in actuality they are not."
good,"Good for someone that doesn't have a lot of experience. Managment was not aware of the workload, felt like you worked a two person's job."
good,"Dead End Position, Once you are in a position you are locked into that position. You fill as though you are not important to the company, just a means of providing income for the company."
good,Started my Career at Accountemps as they were able to find me a couple of temp jobs. This company help set the foundation of my career growth path.  This is a good company to start your career.
good,They were never able to find me full time employment and didn't follow through on what they promised.  My hours were no never full time and when the staff wasn't always friendly.
good,This was my first time working with office team and it started off good until I got let go from the first assignment they gave me ( because of a rude boss I had ) after that they rarely contacted me back rarely had any assignments did not contact me said nothing to me at all !!!! Very rude !! They first job they gave me was not even what I told them I wanted I wanted a job full time because I have a daughter I've never dealt with this at any other staffing place they work with you very good in the beginning and then nothing at all and  it's been almost 2 weeks and I can't even get an email back very unprofessional to me .
good,Its okay if you are only looking for temporary work but I like to be in one place for an extended length of time (years) I don't like job jumping and filling in.
good,"A typical day at work is answering telephones, scheduling patient appointments, preparing charts for current and upcoming days, obtaining authorizations, referrals, sending faxes, making copies of necessary correspondence, collecting co-payments, preparing injection checklists and necessary items for injections and lasers etc."
good,"I have been with Office Team for three years. Other then a fluke two year assignment that was supposed to last four months, The company have been unable to find employment for me. Any specific needs are ignored. For example if asked to give a worker a couple of days to check day care situation, assignment given to someone else. I also have never worked for the salary range I asked for when I started often working for three or more dollar less."
good,"I worked temporary assignments, i learned a lot at the hospital in reference to charge entry and billing the management was absent i assume because we were temporary they never communicated with temp employees and the hardest part of the job was working with minimal information or direction."
good,Not much to say just your run of the mill temp company they set me up with assinment that I went out on and never was hired permanently.
good,note caring enough to get people that where great on assignments jobs immediately following the end of a assigment. didnt learn  much because date entry is nearly non thinking. the hardest part was just learning the codes but once the codes where memorized it was pretty easy except for the stroke counting. co-workers where very nice and friendly. the enjoyable part of the job is that we worked together like a family that had to get a job done.
good,the company is a good company to work for  I worked for them for about 3 months had to leave for personal reasons. I would go back to work with them if the opportunity was there
good,It is very interesting because you get sent to different companies for assignments. Because I would be a temporary employees they permanent employees of these companies I got sent to were not so nice. The best part of these jobs were that these companies were not permanent where you had to deal with the employees on a day to day basis.
good,"Enjoyed accounting related duties at The Deal Group.  It was a six month assignment and bank reconciliations, accounts receivable, accounts payable and journal entries kept me busy."
good,"Good temporary job. "
good,Was assigned jobs with potential to hire- was hired at Keubler Builders and the Hutton Construction Inc; my skills and work experience were matched to these companies and I was working until work slow down and was laid off
good,"I feel like they we're really friendly and kind, however I do feel like I wasn't offered any of the good paying jobs. When I asked about it they said I didn't qualify for anything except the ones no one wanted and I have a Associates Degree and Bachelors degree"
good,Working with Robert Half was a great experience for a recent graduate like myself. I was able to learn customer service skills along with getting used to working in a business professional environment. I got along with my coworkers and saw that there were different techniques that I could learn from different recruiters. A typical day at work would include sourcing our job boards and finding resumes with candidates that I thought could be a good fit for future positions. I also conducted about 15 interviews per week (in person and via Skype) to establish candidates technical and soft skills.
good,I received good experience and knowledge in the field of accounting and billing from the top companies in Kansas and Missouri
good,It was a temporary positions.  The jobs that I performed were related to Administrative Assistant.  I was treated fair and the payment varied according to the job assigned.
good,"Years ago I worked a few assignments as AP/AR clerk.  A couple of the positions were ok."
good,"They do have a number of positions, but they showed little concern for trying to reach your requests for pay and length of contract.  I did not have a lot of down time between postings, but I would have preferred more down time to find better positions with potential for permanent placement."
good,I love the people at office team. They are courteous and professional. My only negative is that they don't have enough jobs to keep me working steadily.
good,"Arrived early, start work at scheduled time. I learned how to  process Accounts Payable on their Sage program. The Human Resources Manager/Accounting Manager trained and reviewed the procedures and guidelines of the position. Co-workers were ok, the hardest part of the position was the manual processes, but I was able to comply.  I only drove 8 miles one way no traffic."
good,"If you want to work part-time or full-time with no benefits, this is your best bet!"
good,"As a consultant here, I was always working and the technical leads who found the positions always assigned me to excellent contracts. I learned allot about how contracting worked. Robert Half is a great place for people starting on in IT to gain experience about the industry. It helped me allot and the Robert Half team was always supportive!"
good,"The jobs were temporary.  The company was good.  The only negative, if I enjoyed working in a place, the agency required for them to buy my contract or have me work for a long time under their management until it was appropriate for the company to offer a job."
good,"Can find good places to work, if you are patient. Need to call everyday to find placement."
good,"Robert Half was able to place me on long term assignments with great people. One job was working with the engineers renovating a hospital - a over a two year period. I was gathering and processing all the payables and payroll information to put it into a monthly invoice to the hospital. The more I learned about the job the more responsibility I got."
good,Poor receptionists. Poor matching skills. Poor placement and follow up with employees.
good,"Log in, review emails and organize emails based on importance"
good,"Meet a lot of great people, but not guarantee of full time employment."
good,A typical assignment would be called a day before the job. You would report to work as you would with any other job. The Temp service may call and cancel the job last minute. That has happened to me about 3-4 out of the 5-7 jobs I've been assigned. Being a Temp is risky and very time committing with little compensation in return.
good,Specializde in highly skilled Accounting and Finance Professionals for temporary and temporary to full time positions.
good,"I learned a lot about the full-cycle recruiting  process. It has shaped the way I recruit and the work ethic. But, the work-life balance is poor and the people you work with can be even more brutal."
good,I enjoyed working here the staff was friendly. hey work with you in your time of need.
good,"I was required to type in handwritten responses to a questionnaire given to insurance clients."
good,Can't really depend onthis any.  Luck of the draw when getting  work
good,"If you are a new grad and just need something, this may be the place to work. Management was often stressed and unorganized. Did not understand how to implement a new niche market. Expectations were often confused and disorganized. Managing supervisor was unaware of the industry's needs."
good,This company is not a team player. Recruiters are like flipping a switch. a person can be black listed very easily.
good,I answered phones and provided customer support to companies. I met some wonderful people at this job.
good,And nothing going forward even after great review from supervisor on the contract.
good,Temporary jobs
good,"Appreciative to have a job, Job was mostly customer service and data input work for customers wanting to get quotes or information about Insurance."
good,"For the six years that I have worked there it was a good envionment and then things started to head down hill. I did learn a lot of jobs working there. Then when we started letting people go I picked up the manager , supervisor , leads and the CSR job and was not giving a higher pay after asking for more pay. I was eventually let go."
good,"I had 3 job assignments lasting 2 months apiece. Everytime I apply for an open position, nobody responds back. Not sure I would refer anyone to them."
good,It was a good company overall but all they cared about was numbers they didn't put too much energy in their employees
good,Office Team didn't have alot of job assignments for temporary employment.
good,"Die Zusammenarbeit ist mittelmäßig, die Bezahlung dürftig, die Arbeitskultur mittelmäßig"
good,"I enjoy working with the people that I do. They make the days fly and the job itself can be very challenging in its given environment. The job site if isolated, but the cafeteria is very nice with good food."
good,"The job market working temporary is not for mature adults over the age of 50 years old or if you are a person of color.  If I work 4 weeks out of 8 weeks, I wonder why with my job experience and education, I am not utilized more as a temporary employee with RH Legal."
good,"Il vaut mieux être autonome si vous souhaitez vous y inscrire. A baisser en qualité. Avec toutes les fonctions supports présentes au sein de la société, la formation, l'évolution de carrière n'est pas de mise. Le variable n'est pas du tout avantageux. "
good,"After raving about my skills and possibilities, I was given a temporary job that was supposed to last 6 weeks. Due to the employer (the office manager quit and they brought in interns to do the work they hired Accountemps to cover) the job only lasted 3 weeks. I enjoyed the work I did at this placement. The job site was excellent, and the people were helpful and friendly."
good,"Robert Half places temps. This is useful if you badly need employment, but if you want a reference from the company you were placed at, you would be out of luck. Furthermore, the fact that temps are extremely underpaid does not help. Life is hard working as a temp, knowing that you could be out of a job in a month."
good,The culture was different from staffing firms I'm used to.  I had a great manager and learned a lot from her.  Business Development was a key driver that made me more successful here.
good,"It's a temp placement gig. A great start to your career if it works out. If you're able to get a job through here, great! They'll probably hire any artist. Hardest part of the job is landing a job through the service."
good,Uhmmmm... Not too great not too bad could use some more recruiters more vacation hours and more opportunities for women coming off of maternity leave...
good,Always had more to do than time to do it. The people hard a lot of projects they worked on and always expected you to know what they wanted. Sometimes before they told you that they wanted it.
good,"I worked for Robert Half/Office team and had one pleasant experience.  My recruiter sent me on a job interview that went well however the client had a concern with my commute.  The following week my recruiter sent me on another job interview and I was fortunate enough to be chosen for the assignment.  The onboarding process is fast so be prepared to start work ASAP, as I interviewed on Monday and started Wednesday.  Throughout the assignment my recruiter checked in with me and made sure I was satisfied and provided client feedback which I liked.  The assignment ended based on a mutual agreement and I was transitioned out of the position. "
good,"Zu wenig langfristige Einsätze, daher häufig wechselnde Kunden."
good,"I wish they put me in more positions that better suit my knowledge, but since I have been either let go or was sent to a company that is completely awful, I haven't seen to be the top candidate since then.  It has been months since I have been put on assignment. I don't get it."
good,Assignment lasted the most was a month or two. No long term assignment sometimes just for a week or two. More time off than working. Over all I did learned something. Thankful for the opportunity.
good,Working for Robert Half was great at first. Until finding out I was being ripped off my salary by them since they charge half of the hourly rate. Great work agency but just for startups.
good,"I am looking for a job home. Tried of moving around. Once you get comfortable with a company then you are done and moving on. I am having to drive an hour to work and it takes me longer than that to get home. Also, I have no medical insurance and they have been kinda crazy with payroll checks. I still have not received my bonus."
good,"Hard to get get contracts to fit your abilities. Used more as a work horse for management to get their commission than to help you get a job. Last contract worked was not desirable and when it was explained given my two weeks notice, management was not impressed because client did not want to change. Left position anyways, have not had contract since."
good,Accountemps will help you find good accounting positions where ever you may find yourself in California.  They present your resumes to several positions until they find the best suit for you.
good,"The jobs they placed you on are very basic especially for seasoned professionals.They like to downplay or doubt the skills and experiences of individuals to low ball the pay. Some managers will try to force you into jobs to save their relationships with those companies. If you say no, then your record could be flagged so no other positions are offered to you."
good,"Did not like that there were not many opportunities available. Once my contract expired, there was not other employment for me to step into. I worked with this company for 4 months."
good,I initially worked with OT in NY and was very happy with the experience.  I had a great person who sent me on two assignments and had a fabulous relationship with them.  I recently moved to Connecticut and was put in contact with a OT member in New Haven.  I have less than good things to say.  I have to call that office to see the status of what's available.  I can never get the person to call me back or even acknowledge my calls. I have been using other avenues to receive work but I really think OT needs to evaluate their recruiters for characteristics that may not work in motivating good candidates to put their careers into the hands of folks that are not enthusiastic about helping you find a job.
good,"I always looked at the job description to be certain I was qualified.  Most of the time I was over-qualified.  I would still do the work as well as I could being very careful not to volunteer for anything not on the job description.  I learned that I just want my own job and my own desk.  The management is stuck in the 1990's, dress for success time period.  Nothing has changed in their business model and I no longer contact them when I want temporary employment.  I became resigned to just coming in and doing my job.  Many times I was left out of the client company's social events.  Many times I was ignored and called ""the temp"".  I was bullied at one of my jobs and Robert Half did nothing about it that I could see.  The hardest part of the job was waiting for another assignment.  I did enjoy some of my jobs, especially the ones in which I learned something new."
good,"When working for Robert Half in Houston, they were the most unorganized branch to work for.  I tried to apply at a branch near me in the Galleria area, but no one would speak with me even with an appointment.  The job I was recruited for came from an office in Ohio and the supervisor that they had was from the Woodlands area."
good,This was a temporary agency. Most days were easy. I learned the concept of administrative work. Management/Recruiters were helpful and did the best they could to place me with the right the company. The workplace cultures varied from company to company. The hardest part about the work was that sometimes there were not assignments available for me. The most enjoyable part of the temporary assignments were having weekends off.
good,"I have not worked for Robert Half International as a temp for two years.  Additionally, I only had one temporary placement with them.  Therefore, I do not feel qualified to review the Pittsburgh office."
good,Essentially they send you where ever you are needed. You are a Robert Half employee but are basically a temp at other places.  The pay is OK if your starting your career.
good,"New recruiters need more training in how to treat applicants."
good,"This is a staffing agency."
good,"Assignments are available, pay rates are not equal to qualified skill sets. Otherwise, Staff is kind, diligently try to fill their positions quickly and are great people!"
good,"Seemed like most recruiters were not professional, never returned phone or emails, and practiced age discrimination, the new paradigm. The good old days of one phone call to show up tomorrow are long gone."
good,The temp hours required to work are crazy. Management does nothing to help you. They try to match you with whatever job they have available to make money off of you. Even if the job isn’t a fit for you.
good,"This a temp company, so not promised anything,"
good,I didn't enjoy working temp-to-hire because I worked very hard only for my assignment to end after a period of time. I prefer a little more consistency in pay an location.
good,This used to be a great company to work for but now it is hard to stay employed by them.  Fewer work days and unhealthy pay rates. RH is a great way to develop skills and knowledge for the future.
good,Recruiter never checks up on me by phone email or anything  if I don't email recruiter nothing.  I would have thought for Xmas a gift if some type would have been presented to Vendor not one word and I see other Vendors sending snacks goodies and gifts all the time
good,I felt like I was a body to fill a slot. I faced workplace discrimination because of my minor disability ( I walk with a cane) and they did not protect me or my position.
good,Recruiting staff was very helpful and understanding of individual needs. The lead staff could be improved as some of them seem annoyed when asking for help and the body language can be unprofessional.
good,"Calling and emailing candidates, business skype meetings, posting jobs on various websites, collaborating with team about potential candidates."
good,I was never marketed as a financial professional - i was marketed as a accounts payable clerk. Jobs were not plentiful and therefore the assignments were few and far between. Never got any additional skill sets and that was the whole point in taking the job.
good,"Robert Half is a staffing company that found the job at Hospice of Metro Denver for me.  They were very organized, friendly, and helpful while I was a candidate for the position at Hospice of Metro Denver."
good,"Heavy volume sales role, very cut throat culture. Lofty goals with minimal training. Manager was great, brought a lot of charisma to team and made office environment much more enjoyable."
good,The previous staffing manager for this company was more attentive and proactive then the staff now. The assignment given was for insurance and I must say that that process went pretty smoothly though. I had multiple problems with the timesheet and logging my hours which was stressful. I'm not a huge fan of this agency to be honest.
good,good place to work in between jobs until you find something more permanent. most assignments are fair and people are friendly. good launchpad into fields you might want to dabble in
good,"Had several various temp jobs from web work to supervising system revamp for banks. The longer commute for lower pay gigs is not a plus but you get gigs which is better than none! :) There are many going for the same positions, which also makes it difficult to land great jobs with good companies, but forces one to continue to excel and gain more knowledge."
good,They manager of the recruitment team do have some projects lined up to ask the staff to help with 2 day projects. It is not stable enough for me to get this part time jobs
good,Fast placement and great opportunities with this agency. Great company to work for in seeking temp to perm employment.The staff is courteous and professional.
good,"This is a sales gig, period. It's a numbers game, so you if you don't keep up your submits, they will let you go."
good,"Fun group of people to be around, and always busy getting paperwork processed. Crunch time was a challenge sometimes, but we always got the job done. The day would go by fast which I liked, because we always had work to get done."
good,This place was a dead end job. Situated at the back of a warehouse in the middle of nowhere. The team were really hardworking but undervalued by management.
good,Management played favorites. Lots of fake people they will smile in your face one minute and throw you under the bus the next. People often talk down to you.
good,"There are difficulties hitting commission on the temporary side of the business.  Requires a full on commitment that plays into your weekends, and after work hours"
good,"Robert Half offers great oppurtunities for people looking for a ""job"" not a ""career"" place of employment.  The workplace culture is not consistent and communication needs to be a bit more open and timely.  The lack of advancement is a the real issue.  I felt more of a number and less of an asset."
good,I got a job through them then the people let me go after I trained someone and never got help even though they said they would! I am back in school and will be graduating June30th.
good,"Often times, I'd be called for a position that was described as a standard administrative position, but it turned out to be something different. The companies that work with Robert Half do not pay well, and the most you can expect to get is around 15.00 an hour, even if you have extensive experience. Unless you call them every day, you have little or no chance of getting any position. "
good,"Working with Accountemps can be both good and bad. I worked with the Braintree, Massachusetts office. Generally they were less than fully responsive. Occasionally calls were not returned. The usual procedure was that after receiving a request from an employer, an assignment coordinator would contact a potential employee with a description of the assignment, including the pay rate. The coordinator would then review the potential employee's qualifications with the employer. After the employer approved of the candidate, the coordinator would get back to the employee with additional details of the assignment including company, address, start date and time, etc. Sometimes the coordinator did not call back in a timely manner or did not have accurate details. I found that the coordinator did not have a full understanding of the job or an accurate job description. This led to poorly matched assignments."
good,"Robert Half Legal in Chicago is a fairly decent office. I'd never had any issues until I had to work with a most rude & disrespectful woman named Terri Herb(something). My previous contact kept me working, when one assignment would end she had a new one line up in a matter of days, even a few short notice call outs for just a day or two. We had a wonderful working relationship, all in all it was life as a temp. My only dislike is like many temp agencies there are to many temporary assignments & not enough temp to perm opportunities."
good,"I had year long ""temporary""assignment that I was told would eventually go  full time. After I was ""let go,"" they hired in a 15+year veteran of the company's daughter and she was given my position."
good,"They found an assignment that should be temp to hire. Great! But the client changed their mind and decided not to hire anybody for the position, instead they put someone internal. Okay! But when I told Office Team I would not be hired and needed another assignment, they never found anything. Also, the pay rate is ridiculously low (compared to other agencies). After some time emailing and calling them, I decided to look on my own and got a decent job."
good,NO Job security. Below Average Pay. Great if you don't need job security or care about being in the same place for long. most placements are for a week
good,This is a good temp company for office professionals.  They have a good client base and can get you into a position often.  There is little job security as most positions are just contract temp. but some may be temp to hire.
good,I processed and resolved billing issues.  It was a great environment working inside a health insurance company.  They are all very friendly and great to work with.
good,"Those placing me seemed very nice, but I frequently had to talk to a ""team member"" instead of the person that already knew what my situation was...it was a little frustrating.  They did place me at a small law firm but I worked for them for seven (7) months before I became permanent on my assignment; this length of time caused a loss of real income."
good,"Its Okay to help you get through a tough spot, but no longevity. Not much follow up after first two weeks on assignment."
good,"Office Team in Norfolk is only concerned about making money. They tell employees anything to get assignments. I was promised temp to perm with a certain salary. When it was time for perm,  they forgot  what was promised.  They wasted my time but made money off me for 6 months.  I have worked for Robert Half for over 7 years in different states. The downtown  Norfolk office is the worst I have ever experienced. I was shocked."
good,I enjoyed working through Office Team. The assignments were steady. I eventually left because the placements weren't permanent and the benefits were expensive to maintain.
good,"Answered a high volume of calls. Checked voicemails and returned calls from patients. Addressed pharmaceutical reps and helped w/ arranging meetings for them to come and speak w/ the physician. Checked patients in, roomed patients, checked vital signs and prepared patients for the physician. Submitted request for authorizations, prepared charts, and made sure all charts were prepared for the following day. Worked weekends filing charts, obtaining medical records.etc..."
good,"Data entry for Hudson News. i learned to time manage and multi task. Not stressful, calm environment, lax management, co workers were easy to get along with. Hardest part of my job is dealing with clerical errors. The most enjoyable part of the job is listening to music and completing work."
good,"Working with Accountemps taught me a lot on how temp work in accounting works. I was given independence, and was able to show off my accounting skills, but in the end learned that temp work does not usually end with a permanent job offer."
good,if you like working n variety places a few weeks at a time it is  a great learning experience and you will gain a good amount of different on the job experiences doing a lot of different jobs and working in many different places for many different companies.
good,They never really got me any roles or positions that I wanted or would help me figure out what I would want to do. I would recommend for people to go out and seek there help to find a job. But it's not that great I guess.
good,"Love the work that I do, could use less of office politics that go on. I enjoy the job due to location, pay rate and job duties."
good,Company had a large contract with local employer. They became less concerned with quality of workers versus quantity.
good,Not a very organized and lack of communication.  Will never work for a temporary company again. I would not recommend this company to anyone I know.
good,"Like any sales job, there are sales metrics to abide by. It's not the high expectations that make or break your career with Robert Half. It's the management. If management doesn't support you, you won't get anywhere."
good,"I  was given one assignment quite a distance from my home,  and have noticed that there are other assignments much closer to where I live,  and for greater pay,  and have not been contacted.  They placed me on assignment and it feels like a ""get thee behind me""  attitude,  because I have been unsuccessful in reaching my recruiter,  and because my resume is obviously not being forwarded to other companies.  I asked that if anything opened up in my area to please move me, they have not. Poor communication overall. "
good,"As senior at college, I wanted to land at an opportunity after graduation. I took and pass the security series 3 license to trade commodities, my experience early one was not pleasant and decided to leave for better opportunity."
good,"Working as a temporary at Stark State College is not fun - you are treated as ""just a temp"".  It is very cold for the most part as you are not really their employee.  However, the money is good, it can open doors and you are often the 1st to hear about position openings.  Then you have a very long process of applying for a position.  Some people give up and obtain other employment while waiting."
good,On a typical day I Answered and redirected phone calls; sorted and expedited mail and documents. Accurately maintained bookkeeping logs and office files; proficient in Excel Spreadsheets
good,"I think as a temporary service, its just okay."
good,"I was placed on some good assignments where I learned a lot.  Their assignments were sporadic.  They were not loyal to me, nor did they take good care of me.  Their agents were poor about returning my calls."
good,"I took the temporary job because we were moving to Florida but had to sell the house first. My husband had gone down to Florida ahead but I had to stay to get house sold and packed up. I went to the designated places they told me to go. I did entering Accounts payable invoices in computer, desinated ones to be paid, generated print outs, sent out tax info and talked to customers about any problems with bills.Hardest part was the traveling as some were in Richmond, culpepper and fredericksburg. During the time I was working for them my husband asked for a divorce so before I left there my head wasn't quite into the job."
good,Office Team and Robert Half is the same company. You can get temp to hire or just few days on the week to work. The only assignment was very easy to complete in one day
good,They work you hard and get little out of it compensation wise
good,"The program works well if properly managed.  My experience was both good and bad.  Good in the sense that I received exposure to other industries, bad in the sense that it was not properly managed and as upper management had to much turnover and not a stable manager on hand."
good,"Assignments at different locations"
good,"A typical work day depends on the task at hand. If one must work a 9-5 that is what your work day will be. "
good,"This review pertains to my last job assignment "
good,"A variety of administrative jobs ranging from one day - to 1 1/2 years. "
good,Great company with success driven individauls. I've learned that some organizations are only concerned with the end result not what it took to complete the task.
good,The work days were long and with lots of overtime for the client. I learned a lot about different requirements for states on how they title motor and non motor vehicles
good,Good work environment. Great to start a career and fast paced environment.
good,It's a Good Company.  I'm not sure about their honesty and integrity in management.
good,"Was assigned at a great company with very low benefits"
good,"A typical day involves answering phones, resolving candidate issues, greeting candidates and clients, filing and inputting candidate files."
good,"I worked for Office Team in Princeton NJ for 1 year, but due to unforseen situations that was totally out of my control, I had to leave, strange that it was right before a company was about to make me premanent."
good,they place me in a good job
good,I enjoyed working at Robert Half and being placed in different work environments as Robert Half is a technical temporary agency. The down side is it was unsteady work.
good,"They rarely have jobs available. They are able to provide good opportunities, but they do not always have jobs available."
good,The most enjoyable part of this job was the experience I gathered from different job assignments.
good,"I have applied to many postions since my unemployment in February 2011 and never hae recieved a call or email response other than the automated responses. I know that I qualify for something since I have over 20years experience in my field. I have also worked as a temp long and short term with very positive results. I even was hired at my last assignment. If there are issues with my applications, appearance or any other negative items I really need to know so as to adjust in order to secure employment"
good,"A typical day of work in Comcast would be getiing on time of course. Count money, give the best customer experience and meet all kinds of people."
good,I loved my team and the idea of my job. But It was difficult to get over the corporate mumbo-jumbo.
good,"The position was OK, not exactly what was described, but not completely out of bounds. My management never contacted me, and wasn't really supportive when I had an issue. Company management at client company was terrible, RH manager called it ""challenging"", but three different contractors left due to abusive behavior. "
good,"Because this is a temporary job placement company, I can only go by what my experience was with them.  I found them to be slow in placing me in jobs located within a reasonable driving distance from my home.  The pay was below what was necessary for what I needed to make.  One thing about working in accounting is that you see the bills and to see what they were charging for me to work there in comparison to what they were paying me was a bit disheartening."
good,"I enjoyed working here, the team was fun. The benefits and pay where fair. However there where some unrealistic expectation around meeting sales goals and there is a high turn over. expect to be cold calling al day long."
good,"Pay ranges are based on their expectations and not your qualifications. The recruiters return by phone and email a week later. Also, there is alot of discrimination."
good,"You'll be provided lots of tools to succeed, but it's all up to the individual to use those tools. No holding hand here. It's a numbers game if you don't produce you're out."
good,"I strickly reassign emails to staff.  I've learned where different terminals are located. Management is very helpful when I get stumped. It gets extremely quiet here and while I wait for another email to come in to reassign it gets a little difficult to stay awake. "
good,"This is an Agency.  After a 90 day assignment ended, I was never contacted again by my representative.  I have repeatedly reached out for new assignments and have been repeatedly directed to other representatives."
good,"Good job while looking for employment while economy was not great.  Only agency that I was able to accrue time off.................."
good,"Good learning experience but not a good culture fit for someone not interested in sales. Pros are lots of company events like softball games, lots of performance based awards too."
good,"I work as a Salaried Professional for Robert Half. I am similar to a temp, but the assignments are longer and require more knowledge. It is very competitive for assignments and if you have an issue, you may fall off the assignment list and sit without work for a while. It is their way of punishing you for a mistake."
good,I wasn't overall thrilled there. Many people like it but I found it very clucky. Management had there favorites and ignored the rest. Certain people could do certain things others couldn't do. It was overall a bad experience.
good,I do think they can do better and placing people with things that match their resume.  So of the jobs that I have been placed at are at a lower level compared to what I have done in the past
good,There is great income potential if you can make it past the first 2-3 years and end up on the right team that is not too large.  Not much flexibility.
good,This is a great place to get your career started if you are unable to find employment on your own or want to explore different career options. You have to put your best foot forward.
good,"Only went on a few assignments for them. Both places were dumps. They always say that the positions are temp-to-hire, but they're not. They are temp positions.Found my own direct hire position."
good,"No comments, I don't have any more to say regarding this company."
good,Lack of leadership and direction on assignment. Limited follow up with the Office Team in regards to client expectations or review. Doordash was my only assignment.
good,Poor teamwork. I did not get trained at all because I was a temp. even though I was going to work there for over a month. Did not gain anything from this job.
good,I did not work directly for Robert Half and they were very weak on overall communication and support during my placement.  Would not work for them again.
good,"very stressful environment. no work/life balance. very little off time to yourself. they are trying to improve the training, but it is still very poor in my opinion"
good,It has been an opportunity to use my skills in diverse environments and enhanced my adaptability to different working cultures.  I feel confident in most settings to make a difference within an organization.
good,"Robert Half is a temporary agency and doesn't interact with its employees in the workplace.  "
good,I enjoyed the people I met with Account Temps but the placement was for a limited amount of time.  The placement required accuracy and becoming knowledgeable of employees and their duties as well as learning the system very quickly.  They also desired overtime in order to complete assignments.
good,Its a temp work corporation. They look for work for you. Typically the jobs they find aren't of a living wage so don't expect too much. There may be a large lapse between jobs
good,"the positions I was assigned to were both well below my qualifications but I took them to be employed."
good,Working for a temporary agency has a lot of benefits. They are a great resource to use to either work while you a looking for a permanent position or they introduce you to companies you would never have found without them.
good,"This is the company that gives me may assignment. So far, so good. I hope they keep it up. There were assignments that the place have some sort of power struggle. I usually ask for another one."
good,This is one of the best legal staffing companies to work for in Michigan and their is an opportunity to gain a lot of knowledge and skills. The hardest part of working with a legal staffing company is there is no job stability. There is no guarantees when your hired that you will stay at those companies so your constantly hoping around which could look bad on a resume but you gain so much more experience from the variety of work.
good,Everyone is out for themselves. The structure of the bonus system sets this up. Should include some type of team incentive. Branch leadership could have made this better.
good,Good to learn new task when you are working with a company that are temporary hires.  Good part of the job is no one yells at you and are willing to teach you new task when they are needed.
good,"Was given an opportunity as a receptionist. Company wanted to hire a paralegal. I let company know I was interested. I was told I didnt have enough paralegal experienc. "
good,Fast faced; not a lot of flex in terms of my long hours; Good learning experience; its a good staffing position. Its a good position for anyone entering the workforce and trying to make a career in recruiting
good,"I took various part time office positions while I was still in college. I only did it for a few years, mostly during the summer. I did it to keep my office skills fresh."
good,I felt like this was a cool agency to work for however I felt like if the customer (place you went to work at) is displeased with you so is Robert Half.
good,"it were one of the bests places i've been work for, as a company and polities. "
good,I was placed in a job immediately.  I appreciated that OfficeTeam took into consideration the skills I wanted to acquire and called me within a couple of days.
good,"This was a temp agency. I really don't have much to say. The were able to find jobs for me, but nothing permanent and the pay was always low. They always had nice things to say about me. If I had to, I would use them again."
good,"The position was sufficient for what I needed at that time; however, I was seeking permanent employment.  "
good,"Days vary as to work assignments.  Accounts receivable and payable, cash management, accounting, customer service and team skills are important.  work a variety of accounting systems and company policies."
good,I didn't have a good experience with Robert Half.  They were slow to respond with jobs. I didn't get good feedback and I haven't heard from them in months regarding possible job opportunities. The job they did put me in was a hard assignment and I found out after being there for a while that this particular firm had over 12 temps with a partner who was hard to work for. I learned that I could do the job but was hindered by being badgered or intimidated by the partner in charge. The only enjoyable part of the job was working with the legal assistant. She was helpful.
good,"Paralegal/Legal Receptionist "
good,People nice to work with.  it was only a temporary position but I enjoyed they way they were very professional.  Liked the location of the office and the interior.   Again a temp job with little to no perks
good,"I mainly got called for grunt work that no one else wanted like a last minute receptionist for a 1 day job or to work for a disorganized, rich, spoiled, unrealistic woman who didn't know what she wanted.  I was never provided any information on what I was to do and the woman was expecting some kind of magic tricks or something.  Office Team should have found out what it was that she wanted before sending me out.  Also, I  had two promising assignments fall thru after doing everything needed such as background checks and drug tests with no compensation for my time to go to clinic, gas expenses, etc.  On one of the assignments, I actually turned down a 12 week job with another temp agency because I was assured I had a 6 week assignment with Office Team. However, it got cancelled and I lost out on money I desperately needed. Another time I showed up at an assignment which was cancelled prior to my arrival without anyone bothering to contact me.  Again my time, my gas, my money = no compensation.  I'd advise the recruiters that before employees are sent to a job they need to confirm it.  Also, be more clear on what the job is and get clear specifications for each assignment."
good,Temporary assignments are usually specialized where an employee's  technical skills are deployed to solve a particular accounting problem the client has encountered. Examples are implementing a vast number of accounts reconciliation or correcting some issues within the Fixed Asset Register.
good,"I like the company as itself but some of the project that I was on was very cut throat, no empathy for people and life situations. Basically temp workers were treated like dirt."
good,Try your luck elsewhere. Unfair pay and staff is really rude. They barely give you any assignments yet alone pay you fairly. Sparks Group is way better in my opinion.
good,Sent me on a lot of temporary assignments and kept me very busy. Met a lot of interesting people and worked at some great companies and got great experience.
good,Benefiits are minimum to non existent.   Although there is another end of the house where there are benefits.   This was on the temporary employment side of the Robert Half House.  Took the assignment because I needed the flexibility offered.
good,"My reps were all basically nice, professional but after I finished one job I couldn't get another one despite good reviews from my assignment.  Ads are run saying we have more work than good people to work them but they really do not have work."
good,"good temp work, good to build experience. fast placement. great recruiters. the work location wasn't not a preference of mine but the office is downtown which was cool for me to get to"
good,Didn't work very hard in finding jobs and didn't seem people's unemployment was a true concern for them.  I didn't feel they took my need for a job seriously.  Very judgemental and cut throat.
good,RobertHalf is a staffing service.  The positions are sales positions and it can be very stressful at times because of quotas that must be met for success.
good,"Enjoyed the variety of contracts and the type of work."
good,The Robert Half Agency was able to find jobs for me in a timely. The assignments were matched with my skills and I enjoyed working at the different assignments.
good,"Staffing was not concern how their clients treat the employees who were sent to many locations."
good,Robert Half is a temporary agency. There's good and bad of most companies like this. I can't speak on a company that is created for temporary employees for the most part.
good,Go to your assigned company and the company expects the same from you as if you are a regular employee of the company.  Any issues are first and foremost reported to the agency first
good,Good company but lack of work-life balance and highly competitive work environment. Great place for someone with sales background and great networking skills.
good,work hours were not traditional but nice. The hardest part of the job would be working with a others that are not as knowledgeable about the product as you would think they would be for their roll.
good,"Team Workers are great and back each up.  I found that the staff are great, but manager very overwhelmed. Very face pace department and majority of the Distributors are nice."
good,"This organization isn't pro-active with regards to engagements.  "
good,"No typical day it would depend on who the client was."
good,The RH Salaried Professional Service program allows you to move around in different industries which allows you to build on your KSA's without the job hoping.
good,"Salary is not competitive with other companies. Also, Management need to communicate or follow up with staff when they are on assignments on a more frequent basis."
good,"Robert Half needs to ask clients how many tax returns they do. Proble more in-depth questions to employer.  For example, if employer says we need tax help during tax season doing estate and tax returns, ask the client how many do you do. In my case, I only had 40 to do and the rest of the time was doing odds and ends of other people's work. Ask for the role/position."
good,"Very High Churn, stressful work environment, cut throat, and not a lot of opportunity of growth."
good,"Make a lot of cold calls, and pass any of your generated leads to more senior associates, watch them prance around in their starched shirts, and never get a thank you from anyone.  They do offer free water as a benefit."
good,"As any staffing agency, you don't always get the job you originally make yourself available for.  Seems to be very commission driven and places you anywhere without considering what you are looking for."
good,learned about construction A/R which was different from what I have done before. Called clients for payments on a daily bases. Culture was relaxed. The hardest was had to learn the construction business. Enjoyed the people I worked with.
good,Hard work is rewarded with more contracts. Employees with a strong  work ethic tend to excel. Management is not forth coming with information and they tend to retain the bulk of the contract value much too often.
good,This is a temp agency that offers a lot of variety in types of jobs but no reliability on any permanent schedule. The jobs I was sent out on were for short lived projects or vacation fill in.
good,"My recruiter never showed up to our first and third meeting at the new work place, and does not meet the monthly meeting requirements. I'm not sure I have a recruiter anymore. Not allowed overtime, and I did not like the location of my placement (they told me it was a different city from where it actually was) and they basically told me to suck it up. I asked to be placed elsewhere due to moving and school transfer and I still haven't heard back. It's been two months."
good,i found it hard to reach people.  I often applied for open assignments and never heard whether i had been considered or not. The tried to offer me position that i was clearly not interested in. I have an extensive customer service and medical background but would be offered call center jobs
good,"Quick and easy job placement, but staffing agents like to place you in jobs way below your pay requirements. You have to demand the correct pay rate."
good,It is a decent company to work for. You can let the company do you thinking for you. Take notes. Contact the office often. I did feel the company didn't want to work with me when I was ready to change assignments.
good,"Like all staffing agencies they are head hunters, job recruiters, I had to continually reach out to them to see if they had anything available."
good,Non consistent and rude.  I had a hard time with either some of the Robert half managers or the managers at the sites that I was being placed at.  It was quite frustrating
good,This company was an aggressive sales environment. Management was indecisive and made for a challenging work environment. I have heard that they have either closed or changed company names.
good,"The company is just ok. Nothing special and job security is not very stable.Great for temp jobs only. If you want stability I would try another company, but if you do not mind contract to contract they are great for that."
good,This is Temp agency and the work is done outside Robert Half.  he assignment I was called for was one day per week and didn't last very long.  Pay was a good rate.
good,Job has its highs and lows but great group of people. New Challenges daily.  Transparent senior management but middle managers need development.
good,Absolutely no room for advancement. Too much down time. The environment appearance was very bland and depressing. No personality to this position.
good,"Very fast pace atmosphere, training is done months after you start really you have to learn as you go. The part I enjoyed the most was recruiting and helping people find jobs and the right match to jobs."
good,"Typical day of work was long (48 hr work week)"
good,"I only worked with RH for a short time.  The key to working there is to keep your head down, don't have an opinion and no matter what anyone does to you that may cost you money, don't say anything. If you get upset, or voice your thoughts, the management may let you go."
good,Robert Half was great in placing me there and followed up to make sure I was happy but the company was poor in transitioning the position from old to new company with little support.
good,"I worked mostly on temporary job assignments. "
good,"This company was great in getting me into different businesses that were in need of help organizing the files in their offices. I rather enjoy the seemingly tedious task of organizing files, so the job itself was wonderful. However, the assignments at each business were temporary and sometimes it would be weeks before another assignment could be found. When one is looking for a steady job and steady income, temporary work is far too stressful."
good,wonderfull staff loved the girls I worked with had a lot of team players everyone willing to help each other out Would love to have stayed there full time however on hiring freeze looking closer to home
good,This employment agency was not professional at all. Put in my wrong social security number into the system. I also ran into a lot of issues when trying to get copies of my time sheet records.
good,"I am a fast learner, team player and get along well with team players.  I would like to join a company and plant myself there as if it would be my 2nd home.  My experiences are basically excellent customer service skills and communication."
good,"Hard strenuous work"
good,"They match me wrong and they just sent me to clean up someones mess, The companies were in a situation of employees leaving and no clue on what to do. No advance and motivation to stay. This agency just want to make money, not to help the employee."
good,"Set me up at a nice, young growing company with promises of full-time employment after 6 months. Company decides it is relocating. Bonus program was provided after staying on. Biggest issue was that the Accountemps office I was working through, would not allow me to talk to another, closer Accountemps office in a reasonable manner."
good,"I went to that agency as a temporary worker so of course could not rely on them for job security."
good,not much to say about this company. i only worked for them for a few months. very limited interaction with associates. they were friendly atleast...
good,"Great company, training. Scary culture. Manage with fear. You are never sure which day is going to be your last. Vague about bonusing until you aren't making your bonus!"
good,"Not able to plan a head while working as Temp. employee"
good,It's a temp company.  I don't expect much and have not been disappointed.  They don't seem to have many temp jobs.  It's a pain when I call to let them know I am available.  I don't expect to talk to someone every time but I am so tired of getting the automatic email.
good,"Contract placement at Deluxe Corporation in sourcing department."
good,"Each day was full and I was allowed to work independently.  I learned how to input invoices into a database and how to better work independently.  Management and co-workers were very friendly and helpful.  "
good,"It can be a very good place to work if you are assigned a stable temporary position or can get lucky enough to get a temp-to-perm job.  "
good,More focused on their commission than the needs of their employees.
good,I did not like the work environment the company I worked for was very unprofessional. The language used was unprofessional and offensive.
good,Pay rate is way too low for qualified individuals. Staff are nice.
good,Working for Wells Fargo was different and challenging. I was to compliance the files that came across my computer and make sure that all required information was provided. My co-workers were great to work with and there was a lot of diversity in the building which made it fun. My manager was not easy to speak with and did not do very well at communicating concerns. My time there was short because the temporary position was relieved due to the department shutting down.
good,I prefer another temp agency. I was told teh company would keep me busy. I spend about 5 hours a day looking for something to do. I asked the client company and Robert Half to expand my duties. Both turned me down.
good,"Pro: You're introduced to different work environments and culture."
good,"Office is relocating out of town, and I am unable to make the move."
good,Had many different assignments and was able to learn new areas of law but salary did not commensurate with work experience and education.
good,"Okay place to work. Good cafeteria, quiet work environment."
good,I really can't remember much about this other then I was commuting 2 to 21/2 hour to work and them back home. My own dogs forgot who I was....:-) Bad choice on my part with location.
good,"Fast past environment, heavy phone calls into Helpdesk."
good,A placement agency helping you get work. A place where they help you get a start at temp career.
good,Review services rendered to determine if the patient is part of a clinical study.  Not very challenging.
good,"Its a good company, but seems disorganized, hard to get in contact with anyone if you need assistance or have questions. Co-workers were contracted and only saw someone from a management position once in the entire time of working."
good,"Arrived on time answered phones, filed. "
good,Assigned to various companies in the role of an Executive Administrative Assistant on a temporary basis.
good,"My job at Robert Half as an internal employee was a very fast paced, multi tasked position in which I was required to provide outside and inside sales as well as recruitment for various positions. My managment team was very hands on and the co-workers were all team players. The most enjoyable part of my job is finding the client and the candidate that perfect match ."
good,Temporary position for healthcare facility processing a backlog of insurance claims.
good,"Great people at the office, polite. However pay is very low and assignments are short and unpredictable in duration"
good,It seems like regardless of the talent and job experience you bring to the table they low ball you as much as possible. They tell you what you want to hear vs telling you realistically your chances of being employed if any.
good,"Distribute mail, enter credits, expense forms, answer phones and file documents."
good,"Great way to expand your resume but don't do it long term- it'll be difficult to get out of temping. "
good,"Administrative support for two sales teams, I learned how to think very quickly on my toes and to juggle many requests at once and what priority to place them in so that they were all completed.  My co-workers were supportive and knew that I understood how difficult the position they were doing and that I was there to try and make their jobs easier."
good,This was a good place to be if you're in between jobs or want short term office employment. It was a good stepping stone into office work for me.
good,Robert Half International was a great company in helping me gain my current employment with Wells Fargo
good,"My last assignment representing this company was with a client working in the mailroom. This was the only job that I was given at the time and the assignment was terminated because the other employee came back to the mailroom from maternity leave.I needed this work, because I really needed the money to pay my bills. I really want to work as an Administrative Assistant, Data Enty Operator or any other clerical worker to show what I can do the job,but the clients want people with years of experience."
good,This consulting firm pays the least amount as possible in the market.
good,Days are from 7-7
good,"Great company, you meet different people, and different companies. Very fast paced temporary company needs."
good,I worked for minimum wage and very long hours. Very rude boss
good,Seems to be a good place to work. I did not receive any feedback of how I was doing though
good,"Outgoing and results-oriented with a record of exceeding performance expectations. Highly creative, energetic, and organized with a history of overcoming challenges to achieve goals while handling multiple responsibilities. Outstanding communication, negotiation, and interpersonal skills that result in productive relationships with diverse individuals at all levels. Independent self-starter that also excels in team environments. Offering a solid foundation of knowledge of consultative sales, marketing, planning, and communication"
good,I had a temporary job but I wanted the recruiter to try and offer more permanent positions.
good,"RHI was a very fast paced organization. It was a great entry level job. They taught business sense, discipline and how to achieve high activity. Everyone was great to work with, however it was not the most understanding management team."
good,The job was supposed to last 10 months but they sent all positions to Mexico after only a few months which left all the Quality Assurance techs without a job.
good,"Nice agency"
good,They will find you a job really fast but expect from 13-16 per hour. They will charge your employer up to 30 an hour for you so they will expect the world from you.
good,"A lot of opportunities for growth throughout the organization.  RHI highly respects and accommodates hard-workers and top performing employees.  Overall culture can be grueling, however the routine tasks build character and ultimately foster the fundamentals of sales, customer service, and teamwork."
good,The recruiter I have been working with is responsive to my emails. She is very approachable and really knows how to place candidates. I like that she checks in with me and the company to see how things are going.
good,"I thought things were going good, which is the feedback I received, and they just dropped me. When my file was transferred to some woman, she basically developed some sort of bias towards me.  She was not polished and lacked a high standard of professionalism, unlike my previous worker.  Out of the blue, they stopped calling me about assignments. No feedback or anything."
good,"the job is good you get a good amount of experience, people are also nice and helpful, but I think they pay little less as it is just paid and no other benefits other than pension scheme 20 holidays and a day off for birthday."
good,The only focus is creating billable hours.  The management is high pressure sales for both the employees and the companies that sign the contracts.  I wouldn't recommend working for RH.
good,If you are interested in experiencing a rotational full cycle recruitment job with a 12-18 month forgivable draw at or around $50k then this is a wonderful opportunity. The people I interacted with were always there to assist and were kind.
good,Recruiter - Not too communicative for this assignment - overall this was my first time ever having this experience with Robert Half.  For the most part their recruiters are engaged with the consultant and always have an open door with it came to communicating.
good,"They did a good job when I was between jobs letting me try out different things to do and jobs to experience"
good,"Unlike other employment agencies, Robert Half worked hard to help me find a job and maintain a job. Even though in this instance the job was temporary, Robert Half always checked in and made sure things were running smooth."
good,"The only negative aspect to working at Robert Half are the benefits. It is virtually impossible to earn a paid holiday. In order to qualify for a paid holiday, an employee must work ""at least 2100 hours during the preceding 52 weeks"".  Considering a full-time employee working a 40 hour a week schedule will only work a maximum of 2080 hours a year, providing they work every holiday and never have a day off, it is highly unlikely anyone can reach the 2100 mark unless they are at an assignment that allows overtime. To earn enough hours to meet the 2100 hour requirement for paid holidays, an employee would need to be at an assignment were they can work approximately 92 hours a year in overtime.  This calculation takes into consideration the days when job assignment is closed for major holidays."
good,"Upper management in Education lost in military style tactics. Not open to idea that people who do the work have to talk to SMEd who might be VPs. Management is 19th Century style, no input, and disrespects those with more experienced. The SMEs were great."
good,"You think that you are doing good on an assignment, and you get a phone call about the assignment has ended! The recruiter that I have buffs uo your resume, even if you don't have the experience."
good,The company is a good place to be working at if you get hired. They are very strict on hiring people to work for them. They will check your credential very thoroughly.
good,"Great opportunity to be successful and make good money if you are liked by the manager. Very cut-throat sales environment. Would have enjoyed working for the company long term, had they employed professional leaders."
good,"I don't work for RH, I'm a contracted employee to be clear. While I've been in a good assignment since starting with RH, I've noticed a disinterest in what my goals are. "
good,"They play games with you concerning pay.  Lie and tell you client refused to give raise when in all actuality raises are up to Office Team.  Lie and say they discussed increase but I found out they never spoke to client.  Who stated they had nothing to do it, because they signed a contract with the stated amount they would be paying agency."
good,Not much to say. As of 1/2019 I have not been able to get any work.  Not sure why I get no calls. I call a lot to see and nothing.  I just dont understand why.
good,Went in processed invoices for payment.  Cut checks and waited for the owner(s) to sign them.  Cut checks 30 day to date of invoice but the checks might not be signed for another month.  Slow pay for most of my duration there.  And no raise for the whole time I was there!!!
good,Good place to work at but not always given straight forward answers. This place is good if you are trying to advance certain skills but not if you're looking for a permanent position.
good,Not every recruiter is the same. As a contractor  or temp employee you must contact them on a regular basis so they don't forget about you. Most of the opportunities pay less than $15 per hour in the Atlanta area.
good,This is a job placement employer. They are supposed to be a clerical and accounting agency. My contact does try to place me as much as she can. They do have a website with their listed jobs.
good,It was ok no complaints. It was good place to get started in the legal field . I am in search of my next move to make more money in future for retirement
good,I don't mind working through Robert Half for employment opportunities but I found the pay to be so low that I couldn't afford to pay my bills.  You may have to work a part time job while working for Robert Half to make sure your bills are paid unless a company decides to hire you full time.
good,I was never given any information about benefits.  I found out about the benefit I was entitled two months after my contract.  I contacted their Human Resources and was told that I am not eligible after 30 days and there is nothing they could do.
good,I was only a temporary fill but I had literally no training. People would be upset with me when I didn't know how to do a task when I was never taught how to. They say it is team oriented but it truly isn't.
good,I enjoyed working for Robert Half one of the only legal staffing compnies that gave me a wide range of employment opportunities to build my skill level. I attribute my extnesive legal knolwledge in this field to their corporation.
good,"Honestly, after 3 years of IT work and being mostly in contracts, I am exactly where I started. I find it disheartening to have zero stability but it is easier to get a new guy for cheaper than to take care of you in those roles. I feel HR and IT are the worst industries because people find you disposable."
good,I only worked a few weeks for this company so I cannot say truthfully that my ratings include a long enough time at the company to honestly answer the questions.
good,I enjoyed given the opportunity to work in different environments.  I enjoyed working for an energy drink conference.  I also enjoyed working on a special project for The Franklin County Board of Elections.
good,"Initially employed as a temp and assigned to The Commercial Finance Group as a Collector.  Accountemps, an agency for temporary placements and for applicants seeking employment."
good,The clients from this agency aren't your normal companies. They are the ones that you don't hear of quite often. The salary/hourly pay is to be much desired.
good,Not many long term assignments and I was often offered assignments further than I was willing to travel. Assignments would end way before the scheduled date.
good,"I completed a temporary assignment, after that they never returned my calls or emails. Seems like they only want to get you in then they don’t care after your first assignment."
good,"The companies I was sent to were pleasant and professional. they treated me very well."
good,"Competitive, and success is determined by mentorship of division manager's skills. Opportunities for education are useful after experience gained on the floor. In general, you have to learn this fast or the rest of team suffers and does not help the rapport of new recruiters to fit in."
good,"I was assigned work outside of my career field and experience background. I have several years experience in account management, customer service, and accounting technician positions. During the year employed I could not transfer into a preferential position."
good,If you need a job it will work but unless you have experience in the field to begin with you probably will not get a job you are looking for and if you do they can kick you out at any time until you get hired on by the host company.
good,"I enjoyed the work that I did with Robert Half/ Office Team."
good,"The initial process from the intake procedures and securing an interview was prompt. I felt that the positions available did not match or meet my skill level. Therefore, I accepted temporary employment in an industry that I was not interested in as an entry level contractor. As the assignment went on, it became impossible to be reassigned as the culture of the client was not in my best interest. Upon the expiration of my contract, I was not communicated with for a follow up to see if there were other opportunities available. I feel that Robert Half could improve their communication skills with their contractors."
good,"During this time, the job market was slim for technology and not many positions were available given my expertise.  If the employment environment was more suited for my abilities, the experience may have been better."
good,"I was offer one pay and when I was paid it was different amount. When I brought it up to the recruiter, She change the paperwork to show that she had only promised the lower amount."
good,"They are ok at best.  The are great if you like being a contractor,  but poor for if you are use to being hired in at a company.  The benefits are a joke!!"
good,"The job is slow paced, same thing each day which makes it easy to learn and catch on to. The hours were stable. The staff was fine. The office was pretty small and only one bathroom for 20 employees"
good,"Typical temp agency."
good,"Well, simply put, if you like working new jobs constantly and can handle random intermittent weeks of no employment or hours, this is the job for you."
good,"All of my coworkers at Robert Half were smart, collaborative, kind, innovative -- everything you would want. However, management was secretive and seemed to do little but jockey with each other. Definitely a culture that values appearance and politics more than results. Good work -life balance and good pay, but projects would stall or disappear frequently without explanation, which made it difficult to feel good about your work."
good,"Robert half is not a bad company if you are an individual that does not need job security nor benefits. I pay Robert Half $97 a month for dental, health, and vision yet not a single thing is covered. And when it actually came to them looking for positions this is the only job they accumulated for me. I was really disappointed in that. Also when this job is coming to an end they have yet to call me back on other jobs. I too hate that.I feel like i could of done a better job at finding a full time position than these guys did."
good,Seem like a great place.....if you are in the top 10% of the company.  The place is cutthroat and a constant pressure cooker.  If this type of environment is for you then you might do well.
good,"Professional staff, interesting assignments. Professional recruitment staff. Friendly company. Assignments offered where in accessable locations. I would work for them again."
good,"I worked at Memorial Regional Hospital in Mechanicsville, VA. The distance was much longer than they promised me for getting to work and back each week day and also for the pay. I could only get a part time position, no more than 37 hrs but I worked much less. I enjoyed the work once I got the hang of the job duties. The workers seemed very competitive and short tempered when you needed their assistance. Management seemed to talk behind your back  which was very unprofessional. Nice hospital to work at. The patients were very nice and appreciated your help."
good,Did not find the recruiter responsive to calls or emails.  It normally took me calling back daily to catch them in the office.  I was told that I would receive a raise on numerous occasions without follow through.
good,It was a stressful work environment but the pay was adequate. Also on the project I was working on they over promised on commitment to turn contractors to full time. I felt there was little room for advancement and management was subpar.
good,"Empoyees at Powertel, where accoutemps sent me were against each other and management and management was not good to the employeees.  I would have stayed with accountemps if that place was not so misserable"
good,"As a temporary worker I need to adjust quickly to new jobs and environments. Most of my assignments involve filing, data entry, and receptionist work."
good,While I understand the whole idea of using a staffing industry; I don't accept or agree with ghosting by agencies.  A recruiter/contractee relationship should be more than just going down a list of required skills.  I expect to develop a working relationship with a recruiter that truly understands my goals and talents; not someone who is looking to fill a position with a robot.
good,Working as a temp. its good cause they could find job for you but it maybe not a long term job. liking how they are willing to help to search job position for you able to work as and sometime hours rate might not be the best job to work at. They updated you sometime but when you started working with a job with  Robert half they sometime don't updated you until you about to leave the job about a week later or that week.
good,Stay away if you can.  They do have great company to work for. But they put there clients above everything even their employee. They also make you salary as low as possible
good,"Its temp work. You will be placed on assignments at different times. Its ok at first. Then when you about more permeate positions that are posted, I was NEVER considered for them. I was on 1day, 3days, 3weeks 2mths jobs very. Robert Half will always place you with a job."
good,"As far as Contractual companies go they are pretty good. "
good,"Many Type-A, ambitious people working for this company. You'll meet very pleasant and not-so-pleasant ones. Company culture in general is cut-throat, and you're judged entirely by the numbers you produce (it's sales). If you can succeed, you'll make a lot of money. Work/life balance is not good. The company gives you all the tools/resources to succeed but the training I personally had was mostly ""learn-as-you-go."" I think the enjoyability of this job depends entirely on the office culture of the specific branch. Some are dreary, others much more lively."
good,"What do you expect? It isn't a career. Sometimes they'll try to find you something in whatever field you're looking for, but once you prove your worth as a professional they'll try to plug you into whoever is giving them problems or has had a poor experience to retain their clientele."
good,This is a temp agency.  They have consistently called when there is an assignment that I qualify for. They also set up interviews for full time permanent jobs.
good,The fees that Accounttemps charge to employers to release a contractor to hire permanently are ridiculously high and then to be locked out for a year before being able to work for that employer and apply for a permanent opportunity is also ridiculous.
good,"Office Team has always kept me working and I appreciate that. They pay very low, I think and treat kind of ""treat you like a number"". They favor the client (company you are assigned to work) because that's their profit. But overall they are good because if you keep in contact with them, they will find work for you."
good,"Job assignments can lead to full time positions. But remember they are a temp service and employees are their stock and trade resource. They charge a company to hire you away from them regardless of the time you have been on assignment, too. But it is a great way to fill out your resume if you are just getting started. Worked on 3 different assignments. Worked for 2 years with the Metropolitan District Commission the ING for 5 months, and the Stanley Works for 7 months. All were great assignments."
good,Fast pace and very stressful environment. Hard to keep up and satisfy management with the ever changing demands and goals. The only enjoyable part was connecting with the clients/candidates and find them employees/jobs.
good,Working for a temp agency helps to build work experience.  Most of the staff is pleasant and make me feel like they are there to help me find work when I have none.
good,The service is so-so. They have no genuine concern for matching the applicant to the correct client. I have only received occasional text msgs and no calls from them since my first and only assignment.
good,"I find that some people work and some dont. You have to be one of their favorites or you dont get many gigs. I have a friend that works thier and he continuously get excellent jobs and I have to beg for work. Never have I had any issues at work, jet I havent worked for over two months. My co-worker has been working almost non stop.They are very friendly but favortism runs rampid, in this company."
good,"•Contacted customers for payments on past due accounts via voice and email. Maintained a good working relationship with all accounts, both internal and external, while being firm regarding payment requirements and define collection processes."
good,Repetitive tasks easily mastered.  Hours dependent upon volume.  Corporate management out of touch with branch operations.  Branch management great to work with!
good,"The overall feeling I received was that of stepping into the ""big leagues"". If you are not looking for a career, don't even apply to any of the posts."
good,Good company to work for when starting your staffing career. Decent training/on boarding depending on the team that you specialize in but I do believe this depends on the offices.
good,"I enjoyed getting to know the different customers and our Field Service Technicians in other states and Canada."
good,"I have been working for the Robert Half Company for over 3 years. They always had positions available for me, and i feel as if i have learned so much from all of the different rolls i have been in just within the 3 years with them. I have experience in micro-soft excel, word, and  etc. .  . I like the fact that the Company was focused on making sure their staff was taken care of."
good,"Lots of micro managing going on here, there is more than picking up the phone, there is more quality that needs to happen than quantity. Long hours with limited flexibility, no work life balance, you are here to make money which is great, but sometimes growth is more important to a career as well, you can get stuck in this industry quickly."
good,I like working for this company because they provide me with a work life balance that is needed at this time. They are extremely flexible and helpful in working around my schedule and needs.
good,"This company wasted my time and money. They are a staffing agency dedicated on getting rich on employee turnover. They should have a culture program the dont know which team will lead them to success production, logistics, or marketing the sales floor is run by a manager that is no longer in charge of his career."
good,"I like working for this company because they are real and I asked them to tell me the bottom line without playing around."
good,Robert Half does well in assisting with job seeking skills. Though there is very little job security and permanent positions are rare.
good,"This company has probably worked for many people in finding a permanent job in the workplace, however for some they continue to place employees into only temporary positions which muddy up a resume for any future job prospects."
good,"The assignments were interesting but brief.  It is a great way to check out different companies and work climates before any commitments. "
good,"Lack of knowledge of the company and position that I was sent out to. Information given was not correct about the job description and the hours. Communication with the recruiter was difficult, the office was open the exact times I worked and when I could call, I was always leaving voice messages."
good,"They get accounts and I might get called and sometimes I might not. I get jobs that last one or two days, I'm hoping to get more someday."
good,"I was a housewife for many years and unsure of skills and not sure about my career path. This is a good place to explore career options. Be prepared for just slightly over minimum wage offered. I was offered full time positions after working at two different companies, so it is a great way to get your foot in the door - again, you will be expected to start at a lower salary range since you can't request a big raise from a temp status position. I was able to work part-time while the kids were in school, so flexible hours are possible for contract/part-time positions. Best part was knowing that I could move on to something else. Minimal healthcare at a cost through Robt.Half and no other benefits for contract/temp jobs. Better situation if you are married and covered by spouse or national healthcare plan or a new grad who might be still covered by parent."
good,"This company is ok to work for, pretty good on placing temps in suitable environments. The interview process is pretty good not as lengthy as most temp agencies."
good,"Training overall was very thorough, consistent and on-going.  Unfortunately, the culture was cut-throat and led to a poor work-life balance and few opportunities to truly work as a team."
good,"Worked with the company over 10 years same position.  "
good,"If you enjoy office work, then Robert Half is a good occupation. If you're the sort of person who wants an occupation slightly related to administration you'd best look elsewhere."
good,Very sink or swim environment.  The team doesn't really have time to train new employees so there is a high turn over rate.
good,Mid sized company which can get consulting work in a short time. Company has medium sized clients and pays in time. Not like a big five consulting companies which focuses on overall consultant development.
good,"My typical day at work would be me clocking in, starting up my computer, opening up my programs that I used daily to complete my daily assignment, make calls to attempt to collect on outstanding balances. Co-Workers & Management spoke about one another when one of the parties was absent. Management held double standards and expected team members to assume what she was thinking when making work related decisions regarding customer accounts. Management did not display professional character. Most enjoyable part of the job was staying busy throughout the entire shift."
good,The job placement was a wonderful location. My supervisor from RH was wonderful but I do believe that communication between us could have been better.
good,"Skill set fit well with company and there was"
good,"It was interesting working as a temp, with each new assignment I had the opportunity to learn new skills."
good,"Recruiting, marketing and desk are the 3 roles that are included in a Staffing Manager. Recruiting: you find the candidates who you have open job orders for. Marketing: you cold call on everyone and anyone. Desk: you speak with the clients, take the availability calls from candidates, fill the job orders and take the new job orders. There are different types of management styles, depending on if your manager is hands-on or not. If your manager was hired on as a staffing manager then got promotions, you are in the right hands. They do not give any notice of lay-offs. Co-workers are great and they will probably have the same personality as you, everyone works as a team. The hardest part of the job is having to cold call, build your own client book and maintain your marketing goals while you are doing a full desk. The most enjoyable part of the job is finding candidates jobs, dealing with the candidates and clients and being with your team, if you are on a good team."
good,"Hired as a temp receptionist.  Between calls I verified and filed orders placed postage orders, also updated distributor certificates using excel."
good,"This job was temporary.  I answered phones, took orders, created ingredient requests for the processing plants and closed open orders so they could be invoiced."
good,"Receive a call normally during the week before - during this call you will be told where they would like you to go and work, some of what you will be doing, the hours and the pay and the timeframe (how many days/months) they will need you to be there."
good,"Great job to work if ever was offered a permanent position.  Reviewing loan packets for borrower signature, dated, as well as notary signature and dates."
good,This job was a good learning experience. It started out with me doing all of their inventory and logging it in. Then I got called back so that I could update their MSDS reports. I really did not work with anyone else. This was a temporary job assignment. The job was not hard to do just a little boring. The most enjoyable part was knowing that I had every weekend off.
good,"A typical day at work would be:  Creating documents, letters, memorandums, etc. from dictaphone or hand written from attorneys.  Revisions to documents, excel charts. Client contact, hotel and airlines reservations.  Waiting on work flow to come in.  Being able to work consistently."
good,"Local Staffing firm in Woodbridge, with a great reputation and great Staff."
good,"As an employee with Accountemps, I had one work assignment in my related career field.  The company does not present many healthcare positions available in the Daytona Beach area."
good,"Only temporary assignment. Excellent first months. Not a lot of communication. Excellent company. It would of been nice if there would been some training when a person is leaving for vacation, to the person taking over in the meantime.  At least that happened to me. No training whatsoever. Not sure about other departments. Other than that, everybody was always very nice and very professional."
good,Anyone who has ever worked through a temp service will find no surprises here.
good,"I was working as a temp so I helped the recruiter lady sort resumes, make appointments, create new orientation agendas as well as new hire folders. For the benefits generalist, I helped enter information on the system for new hires, termination or changes, review statements to make sure that new and old employees were corrected, Approve all invoices and take them to Accounting for payment."
good,"The corporate office personnel in California are kinder than the local RHI, Inc. employees. I am a seasoned commercial collector having been employed by a Fortune 500 company over 14 years. Why was it such a challenge to connect me to another commercial collection position?"
good,Great for those who excel at sales.  The rewards can be really great if you are a strong performer.
good,Took on all temporary jobs that were assigned to me in the finance area.
good,The assignments have been great.  The opportunity to be hired full-time is limited.  The co-workers and work assignments are wonderful.  I really enjoyed meeting new people and learning new skills.  The hardest part of the job is getting comfortable in my assignment and then the assignment ends.
good,"Stedy work, nice enviroment. It is a nice place to work if you dont need to make alot of money an hour."
good,"This is an employment agency. All their offers came on a very short notice. In this case ""short notice"" sometimes  was around 3 hours before an interview. Also, most of the times, the wages they had to offer were low."
good,I have accomplished many tasks at each employer but I would like to work somewhere that would be challenging and lots of room for critical thinking skills. I also would like a place where there would posses growth potential.
good,Supported various aspects of a Human Resources office at an expanding manufacturing facility.
good,Learned a lot with this company and I was able to grow my skill set
good,Robert Half is a large successful temporary staffing firm. They have a specific business model that all staff must follow.
good,"I worked for Office Team (Robert Half) for 4 years, when I was again looking for work, and called them (10 times), no one ever responded, in spite of MANY job openings posted on their website."
good,"Several times, my supervisors or managers have expressed to me that they do not have time to keep replying to emails and phone calls made through Robert Half employees. Recruiters bug management at place of employment with too many attempts at contacting."
good,"I worked very independently with a group of 4 other individuals.  I performed legal analysis and very detailed contract review work in a three phase consolidation project.  Management changed the priority so that, even though the team was hired for all three phases, it became apparent that the phase one team, once its objective was met, would be eliminated.  Overwhelming, competitive environment for only 3 FT positions.  The energy on the team was good but the requirements and competitive nature of the position became increasingly demanding."
good,"Intially believed I was going to be trained on how to ""close a deal"" and ramp up my client and customer needs. "
good,This was a temporary assignment ending with the CEO selling the company.
good,"Good work, decent pay never. really communicated with office unless there was a pay problem. which I never had an issue with. "
good,I was working with Robert Half but located at Wells Fargo home mortgage. It was great
good,"The days worked by a temp are always different, especially between projects. Most of the projects were design-related, so I did my design thing. I learned a great filing system and more about image quality control then I ever wanted to know, and I still hold to that knowledge today."
good,"I was sent to good jobs, but assingments ended because I would become ill."
good,"Satisfying work, placing unemployed individuals on a temp or temp to hire basis."
good,"I have enjoyed working with this company, they have yet to find me full time stable employment, I have currently been doing day labor, but I have always been treated well, they also have giving me many skills I can use in the future."
good,Co-workers were pleasant to work with
good,My time with Accountemps was a necessary step needed to be employed at Shin-Etsu Silicones of America since Shin-Etsu rarely hired directly at that time. My employment with Robert Half / Accountemps lasted about 5 months until Shin-Etsu hired me as an employee.
good,"when job was full time - enjoyed planning lunches for visitors,"
good,Despite having poor leadership the individual account managers work well with local businesses
good,"My current branc is a single admin in our office. I handle front desk duties as well as the operations of the branch. I answer phones for 3 seperate lines. I assist customers/candidates with the application process, handle I9/W4 information. I've had the pleasure to manage 2 members of the administrative staff. It is important to me to get along with my fellow co-workers as we spend the majority of our days with each other. Work hard, play hard. Hardest part of the job is pleasing everyone. It can't be done with so many personalities approaching you. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting a call from that one candidate/client who is thrilled with our service. Makes the bad days go away."
good,I was a temporary employee as an accounts payable clerk for a waste management company. There was very little contact with co-workers or management. The hardest part of the job was sitting for long periods of time entying data on the computer. The most enjoyable part of the job was the interaction with vendors requesting payment.
good,"I've had the opportunity to consult for different companies, in essence giving me the chance to interview each company before considering full time offers to see if it is the right fit for my working style."
good,"Like many other staffing agencies, Robert Half fields candidates for employers and then takes a cut of the check every week. Overall they're decent, but many of the recruiters that work there are obnoxiously pushy about getting you to go downtown to their office and interview with them, even if they don't actually have a job for you. I'm guessing the recruiters get some sort of bonus for getting people into the office? The last guy I spoke with sounded like he was about to cry over the phone when I wouldn't agree to driving 45 minutes to an interview because they didn't have an actual job offer that interested me."
good,"The staff was nice, not too much interaction."
good,Staff Agency has to find you a job. Sometimes it's really hard to get you a job. Too many people without jobs.
good,"Had problems with assignment and my cries of moving on to another one were never listened too because it brought money to the company and I was an excellent worker. So going to work eventually turned into a nightmare, that I had to keep putting on a big smile for."
good,Pay was low for experience.  Workplace culture very difficult to deal with.  Very little freedom and development lead inexperienced and lack planning skills
good,"It depends upon your placement. My skills are much greater than where they continued to place me. Unfortunately, in today's market a job is what is necessary so I had to take what they offered. However they continue to advertise jobs that fit my skills, but never seem to have them when you ask."
good,This company will assist you as long as you are persistent with them.  I had to make sure that I got all of my compensation such as benefits of vacation and holiday pay.  This company has a requirement that you work 2100 hours per year to get these benefits.  If you work a 40 hour week for all 52 weeks in the year you will only be able to squeeze out 2080 hours which makes it so you never get the vacation or holiday pay.  This is the only company I have worked at that this is the pre-requisite to getting paid compensation.
good,"great to get your foot in the door but hard to progress if you are not handed accounts by those leaving.  Extremely high turnover, at least 1-2 employees per month"
good,"Temporary Company - as you would expect. You are the product. Expect to be treated as such. Was give 3 days notice of termination after 14 months of employment and no complaints about my superlative performance. Was not contacted for next assignment for 2 months and the position was a random, poor fit with less pay."
good,"Accountemps is a conduit to a client.  "
good,"I worked for RH in New Jersey for nearly 10 years, including 7 or 8 at the same RH client and 1 1/2 additional years in a very difficult assignment as the manager of a problem plagued department in a water utility company.  While I was allowed at least some flexibility regarding work hours and workdays for the 7-8 year assignment, I received no actual recognition for my efforts as far as advancement was concerned, especially since the client was dramatically reducing its staff, which was part of the reason why I was there in the first place.  There were no benefits. Fortunately, I had ""grandfathered"" at a previous employer for medical insurance.  Why did I continue at RH for all of those years? The fact was that very few employers in my profession would hire anyone over 55, let alone over 65.  When I moved to the Jacksonville FL area at age 65, it was impossible to obtain any RH assignments in spite of my prior years of excellent, dedicated service to the company. I was not only as competent at my profession at age 65 as I was when I was younger but even more so because of the years of experience that I had accumulated.  The Jacksonville office didn't care about any of this.  I believe that my age was a factor. That's how the cookie crumbles. Others may have had different experiences, but this was mine.  If your experience was better, then good for you."
good,This is a temp agency that sends people out to differ locations for employment. My employment was through them at another entity. The interview process with Robert Half was basically getting to know the person that they were sending to the actual job location.
good,I like working with them. I would like more feed back on the  no Interview. Need more communication and callback when told they will. Need to recruiter to make sure the employee know what the job details are upfront
good,"Previously worked with Accountemps numerous times in Florida some years ago. It was great for finding a permanent job and for an interim position while waiting to go overseas."
good,"I had a supportive supervisor that was very nice, but the company itself does little for its temporary staff. I would not recommend working here for more than 6 months. The benefits are terrible. They are only interested in temporary positions and not full-time placement. I guess that is there business model."
good,"If you put in your time, it will pay off. You do have to put in 10-13 hour days just to keep on top of all the different pieces of a deal moving though. Overall, a unique company with a great foundation, yet management style is unrealistic with today's hiring culture. High turn over rate (60%+) can lower moral of the office, however, it is still a positive work environment overall with great people."
good,"This was a temporary position, the pay was minimal and it ended without warning, which left me in a bind.  The company did not have a contingency plan, very disappointing"
good,There were several companies that wanted to hire me on as a direct employee but due to Robert Half never waiving their fee the firms that wanted to hire me ended their contracts and went to alternate recruiting companies.
good,"Nice people, slightly segregated, but definitle room for advancement. Could be slightly more involved with the candidates after placing them for the most part."
good,Robert Half did not come through for me as far as obtaining a full-time permanent position at any of the companies I was contracted out to.  I work for Robert Half for 10 years with no results.
good,This was a temporary position. Their business is providing contract employees to other companies looking for temporary workers that may have an opportunity to become permanent employees
good,"I would not neccessarily refer anyone  to this organization. I was not being communicated about assignments that were being posted on Indeed,"
good,My first time ever recruiting was with Robert Half. You have to be able to learn your line of business quick and cannot slip up on placing candidates.
good,"Allerdings profitiert die Personaldienstleistung auch von den Einsatz jedes Mitarbeiters. Sprich: Sie üben druck aus. Für Quereinsteiger oder für Leute, die kurzfristig ein bisschen Erfahrung und Geld brauchen ist es für eine gewisse Zeit okay. Aber es ist definitiv nicht für langfristig angedacht."
good,"This was a temporary assignment.  It was for an oil & gas company, but they didn't have any live drills. I was extremely board in this position and I would not go back."
good,You are always waiting for a call or follow up. You are matched up depending on your skills. Some jobs only allowed for half days or a couple of hours in the week. Mostly temporary gigs.
good,Great place to help locate a job. Pay isn't too good if you're a single income household.  Very professional staff.  Would sign with them again for future employment.
good,Accountemps helped me find a job when needed to find a job. I liked the process that they used to find me something that I could use my skills. I believe that I would like to find a job that is full-time not temp.
good,"NA-It has been interesting. Placed in a company that did not really need me.  I really don't have a lot to say.  It is good.  I need to work, they found me work."
good,I was a contractor / consultant so there isn't much to say.  RH's people were nice and professional.  The client was ok and the work was as expected..
good,It's a hectic place to work and a mixture of cold-calling companies and interview candidates.  Wasn't the right fit for me but people who find success here REALLY find success.
good,"Pro - I've gotten to meet lots of great people and gain valuable work experience. "
good,The company is only paying $10/hr.  Office Team did not negotiate salary.  I returned to work place I previously left.  Company requested me back.  Would like another placement.  The company is non-profit so no room for being hired full  time.
good,"Empresa bastante séria, focada em resultados e resiliência."
good,"A stressful, hard working day. Maintenance orders and the heat index, organizing the assistant manger files. Also helping with leasing  agents files. Doing the re-certification for tenants leases."
good,"The job isn't bad for someone new, I believe if you are new to your job field this is a great place to start. I enjoyed it at first, but it was annoying to start over, over and over."
good,"Robert Half found me a position with STI Concrete. Though the place of employment is not the best, RH still takes care of it's employees. I do wish they provided paid holidays."
good,"Did not provide a great number of opportunities that matched my qualifications and salary requirements."
good,"Great place to land and start to learn and get my food in the door in Las Vegas, NV, but, not enough full time hours or room for growth or payment, no benefits."
good,"I was not impressed with the HR personals in this company with their hiring processes.  "
good,"Various temp to hire opportunities allowing me to ""interview"" the company while working."
good,"Working for Office Team wasn’t always a bad experience, most of the jobs were informative and kept you busy. However most of the clients hiring through Office Team do not follow through with temp-to-hire positions and often use any excuse to end the assignment. Office Team regularly over hires employees leaving little to no assignments available for current employees going off assignments. Average wait time between placement was 2-3 months with a week or less assignment in between. Average compensation was between 10.50-13$ an hour. Well under their advertised 14-16$ rate."
good,"Depending on your assignment, every day is different.  You can learn many different skills, which can be a lot of fun, along with skills that you can carry with yourself to other assignments."
good,"Answering phones and creating a ticket "
good,"You are the one that searches through their website for an assignment.  They don't help you much. My experience however, on the one and only contract job I received and completed, was enjoyable and I learned a lot.  But then I never received another assignment and have not heard from them since."
good,Not a bad place to be just not for everyone. Had a great boss but just didn't enjoy the day to day work. I would not go back but there are plenty of people who have stayed there for almost an entire career.
good,"i don't make enough. i don't know what else to say, my admin. day gift was a water bottle and hard candy, not impressed. i have been doing office work for over 25 years and i feel like it is all the younger folks that are interviewing me and just saying whatever i want to hear and just place me anywhere and not listening to or paying any attention my needs. i am head of household. i can't make it on $18 an hour. how can anyone?"
good,"Low pay, take advantage of employees.  They don't listen to employees.  Place employees where they do not want to be place.  Hold back raises due to assignments."
good,"The agency was helpful and was able to place you with a job with the right experience but the pay was a little low. Otherwise, the employees are helpful and professional."
good,Robert Half has no real advancement. The life of a recruiter is very dull almost similar to a call center atmosphere. If someone is looking for experience out of college Robert Half is the place.
good,"Everyone who worked in my division was looking for a way out as soon as they could find one. There are other firms out there who not only pay their candidates better, but pay their recruiter WAY better. Rarely does anyone stick around for more than two years, if that."
good,What to recall from 22 yrs ago? A lot of temporary assignments that helped prepare me and hone my skills for my next permanent position. I was even able to work in Florida with AccounTemps.
good,"Work assignments adequate.  Paid weekly.  Jobs according to availability.  Mixed employer attitudes towards temporary workers."
good,"The team lacked listening to concerns from me, as a contracted out employee. On several occasions I informed them of my concerns on the job they sent me to. Those concerns were ignored."
good,"Robert Half provided a good opportunity for me, as through their Accountemps division, I have worked as a Project Administrator for WGL Energy the last 3 plus years.  They have a very positive culture,  but also lack in support, where I wish there was more communication between myself and the representative responsible for my contract with WGL.  I have not been able to advance my career as I hoped, which is the main reason I have decided to move on."
good,"Here in Sacramento they don't seem to really help a lot when it comes to helping you get work.In Columbus, Ohio they are great this company I would suggest there."
good,Although the management is all family it takes at least a year to be hired on. They offer a lot of overtime during the hot months but if you are a temp you are not eligible.
good,"This company put me to work quickly but was not concerned after that. In short, they listened to the people paying them, i.e. the hiring company, but were indifferent to the employee's concerns."
good,I was not a full time employee with Robert Half Technology.  Primary issues was lack of job security and available benefits.  Primarily worked as a contractor.
good,"Robert Half is the standard for business-related temporary services.  "
good,"Temp to perm opportunities often do not follow through, compensation offered is below skill, experience and education level candidate has to offer.  No paid holiday time until after a ridiculous number of hours worked that exceed 6 months on average."
good,Never get too comfortable at any job. Always keep your options open. Always learn new things to reach a higher ground. Smile and never consort with groups of gossiping co workers.
good,Great company to learn how to build a successful brand and business. They do offer one of the industry's finest training platforms. The culture is very stressful. Most people are in a perpetual state of fear for potentially losing their jobs. The management is broken in most regions. There is a certain arrogance that is portrayed and almost emulated by top producers that is very off putting to candidates and clients. I learned this later on after I left the organization for an outside opportunity.
good,I worked for a business thru robert half and the client told me they thought i was making about $ 10 more than I was and then she called robert half and they gave me more pay. something fishy was going on a nd i went a long time being paid less then i was supposed to be! I was so mad!
good,The jobs that The Creative group seemed overall alright. I learned a little bit more about each company that I did contract work for. Hardest part of the job was the commute. Most enjoyable part of the job was the people that I met.
good,They have found many temp jobs for me. All however are temporary and do not lead to anything permanent.  Locations never really mattered too much to me. .
good,I had to really hound the placement coordinator to find work for me and she was very unresponsive. They never offered me benefits because you had to work at a single position for 6 months before you were eligible.
good,Accountemps kept me busy for over a year.  It was more about what they needed than what I needed.  I learned a lot about various workplace cultures.  I didn't want to stay at any of the assignments that they sent me on.  Communication was readily available.
good,"I mostly had short term assignments with Robert Half; the one lasting longest was 6 weeks.  I worked intermittently with Robert Half for 8 months.  During that time I had at least 4 different contacts.  This was confusing and annoying; at times it was difficult to know who to contact and, of course, it's impossible to list a contact on job applications."
good,Was put into a position not good at all horrible. I have nothing to say about it besides I will not put myself out there for another job for there benefit.
good,Tough to bounce around to clients.  Working with clients that are going bankrupt is a tough working environment.  There is usually a lack of training.
good,Staff was very helpful in my goals of employment. The place of employment was very friendly and I enjoyed the people in the office. The staff from the assignment I am still in contact with today.
good,"I received job placement rather quickly.  Staffing Manager was open"
good,"If you are hungry for staffing this is the place for you. If you work hard they will help you play hard too. Management tries to stop things from rolling downhill but there is only so much they can block. I would not know as much about staffing or how to look for people without their great training programs. They will give you the tools, it is what you do with the tools."
good,"The hours are very long. Rewarding working helping people find jobs. they are doing well with technology implementation but are still holding on to the old ways of Robert Half.  They need to turn the corner on more modern workplace, flexible hours, work life balance.  "
good,"They are great at finding you a gig if you are in a bind and need to pay the bills. If you're lucky, you'll get matched with an employer who will hire you on and convert you to their employee instead of the agency's."
good,Was a pretty good except communication is kind of bad. Had a few little issues with assignment placement. As well as placing me in a positions that I didn't want to in.
good,"Unable to find clients that offered good work environment. Other OfficeTeam locations have been more successful, Pay was on the low end of the scale for my experience level."
good,"not the most enjoyable place to work, work long projects (long commutes) and than you are not appreciated.  the managers/recruiters don't care about you"
good,Contract or temp job-some assignments OK. Office team-oversold the temp capabilities-did not always explain all that is required-underpaid for the work I had to do
good,"There's a lot thrown into training which is great, but a shorter leash to perform, hit numbers, which is not so great and very little grey area. It's a sales organization even as a recruiter. Sometimes the model can work for you and sometimes against you. "
good,One assignment had a nice paycheck but the job was poorly structured for the experience and knowledge required. The job required a strict adherence to a particular schedule like very junior job classes but was hired for much more experience and a senior role that was supposed to be a driver for change and efficiency.
good,"Accountemps neglected to divulge information regarding the work site complaints from previous placements of former employees to a particular site.  "
good,"I did really enjoy my job, and learning new things. The culture was just not as friendly. I think it's important to work in a place where everyone is nice."
good,"Great job placement. Great reviews, Great people, Great income, Great work life balance, Great co workers, Great staff, Great temporary services, Great"
good,Flexible schedule but not a strong connection to the organization as employees are usually at the client site. Work requires the ability to deal with different personalities as employees are always working with different people
good,"I don't have an issue with account temps, it was the company I was placed with. I don't think account temps is upfront about the buy out cost. They need to do more check in to who they are sending people too."
good,"They need to realize that they have two clients, the contract employer and the temp, not the contract employer and a commodity.They need to get clarity from the contract employer and be totally honest with the temp/hire as to what is expected; not data entry and then you find out that you have to get on the floor with your dress pants and lift heavy computer parts. Not good"
good,"Robert Half was able to quickly find work for me, but only at a very low wage. I worked in a warehouse, filing documents, day in and day out. When the job was complete, they did not provide a replacement job. In addition, they were unable to find me work less than 50 miles from my place of residence."
good,I was extremely busy. I learned the importance of time managemet and attention to detail. management was not professional. My coworkers were great. Dealing with disgruntled coworkers. I learned a lot about reporting and Risk management
good,They have been very helpful in finding appropriate work for myself at my desired rate of pay. Always have enjoyed the people I have worked with on these temporary jobs.
good,Its diverse environment and lot of coordination between various departments. Remote management and rolling out processes. Training on various tools. Small set up and dependent role.
good,"once placed there is very little contact with Robert half "
good,The pay can be better. Managers should be a little more concerned about their clients. It is all about their commission.
good,"Understanding that the accountemps staff get commission on every hour you work means that companies are reluctant to hire temps full time. For example, I spent several months on an assignment with a company learning their system, and then the company announced that they had 12 positions available but let all of the temps go. Seems like the contracts they work with accountemps will not allow them to pick up temps full-time. So in my opinion it's a great place to break into an industry and piece to together good experience. But ultimately you need to have your own resume constantly updated and submitted individually in order to land a permanent job on your own. Overall, good company to break in but knowing the bottom line of why things happen is crucial here."
good,"Great for people fresh out of college and wanting to get into the staffing  industry. "
good,"I enjoyed working with Property Management again after many years. The company and properties were some what different from what I had dealt with before, therefore, it's pretty interesting."
good,"Worked for them on a temporary basis so I cannot really say what a typical day would be for me.  What I learned is to work quickly and accurately and take notes."
good,"My job here was informative and I learned more about duties that I have previous had experience in.  Daily duties were up and down, sometimes busy and other times not.  I believe in being busy at work or have work to keep you busy but that was not always the case. This would be the hardest part of the job, not have enough to do."
good,"This company was pretty consistent with providing work. They didn't always give the correct information for an assignment and they didn't keep in contact very well. I learned many things from this company with every assignment I held. I learned how to operate commercial printers, as well as, how to work quickly and efficiently. I perfected my professional writing skills and gained other administrative skills, as well."
good,Foco em operação. Quem tem perfil executivo pode não gostar e se adaptar.
good,"The hourly salaries are better than minimum wage $13 etc.  However, you have to harass them in order to get an assignment.  Assignments can last a couple of days or a couple of weeks.  I do not know anyone who has gotten a permanent job."
good,Able to gain experience working with excellent professionals. Positive learning experience working with an good company. Staff were very helpful in job placement.
good,"A jack of all trades. I answered the phones, did recievables, went to the bank and made the deposits, and the came back and balanced the books. It was a dream job. I got to do it all."
good,"-Last min calls for jobs"
good,"Overall,work environments are somewhat welcoming. Hardworking gets you noticed by management, but not very well liked amongst some employees because you are temp. A typical work day might be whatever it takes to get the job done, whether it be something small or big."
good,"I loved the work I was able to perform for the company I was placed at.  But, I would never work with RH again.  Their staff were unprofessional, lacking integrity and didn't actually work toward benefiting the very workers placed by their representatives."
good,Was employed for over two months. They told me my job was ending a day before it ended and have yet to find me something else 3 weeks later. I have to constantly keep emailing and calling to express my interest.
good,Their are a lot of perks working for Robert Half. You could be a top employee one day and not have job security the next day.
good,The staff was very friendly and did an okay job finding assignments. I was placed in roles that didn't challenge me or give me the ability to  learn new skills.
good,"Tasks and responsibilities varied depending on job but all 4 different positions were challenging and allowed me to grow both intellectually and technically. Work as part of a team as well as with minimal supervision."
good,"Lovely people to work with. Varying shifts and hours delivering stationary nationwide. One of the best places I've worked, but time to move on."
good,"A typical day of work depends on the contract. The account management position is mostly considered contract work because of the commuting required to complete each contract. The average job  relies on the industry being served but primarily involves the handling of all inbound calls in regards to customer service inquiries. Lead generation is conducted in between service calls, and responsible for updating all contact information in company's database."
good,there is to much time between jobs. Not enough of passing information on to us like why Wells Fargo is not hiring people. They expect you to drive an hour and a half to your job. client tells them they want you to come as needed but don't tell you.
good,"Organize company files, data entry, handle multiple phone lines, assist with projects that are on a deadline, order office supplies, archive files"
good,It is a good company to work with as they have a lot of projects from big companies.They have good contact in the industry.
good,"Ask questions, read and understand offer letter before accepting a Salaried Professional position. Minimum 37.50 hours per week, however offer letter salary based on a 40/hour week.  Some clients only allow 37.50 hours so you may never make full salary. Also, ""bench"" time is limited to 3 weeks per year. If they cannot place you with another client in that time you will be laid off."
good,Working through OfficeTeam/Robert Half doing temporary assignments until something more permanent becomes available.
good,"Great customer service, they will work with you to help you find the job you desire. you will need over 1000 hours to qualify for holiday pay."
good,"I enjoyed the 7-month assignment very much and hated to see it end.  There was no involvement of Accountemps in my day-to-day job responsibilities and I was content to do the job I was assigned.  I was offered full-time by the company I was assigned to but it wasn't a good fit for me at the time."
good,"A typical day at work starts at 9:30AM. Calling providers to verify their demographics. In a small cube, very quiet atmosphere. There is not to much to learn job is very simple. Management could do a bit more training. Co-workers are helpful. The hardest part of the Job is staying awake. No enjoyable part of the Job."
good,"This is a work as they need you job.  If you are the sole breadwinner, this job may or may not pay your bills."
good,Send you on a bunch of terrible assignments most assignments you are standing eight hours at a time with only 30 minute breaks. Not a great experience.
good,Working at Robert Half is ok. The people are great and as expected you will make a lot of calls. You are well compensated for doing well.
good,"The environment is fun, but competitive. There is heavy emphasis on performance right out of the gate. Management is available but training is something that has to be sought out. The hardest part was the cold calls and the harsh divide between teams, especially those within the same department as you would fight over accounts and candidates. A good learning experience but not a long term gig."
good,"Great experience, enjoy meeting new people, help solve problems"
good,My co-workers were very friendly and it was overall a decent job.
good,"Little pay"
good,after completing one contract they have trouble finding another
good,"- Office Team is a Placement Service."
good,"This was a extremely fast paced job.  I answered and transferred multi-line phone in a busy temp angency. Candidates would arrived as early as 8am for testing, interview, and job placement. I tracked each candidate though this process encoutering up to but not limited to 6 candidates per hour.  I enjoyed the interaction with the candidates. Unfortunately, the economy was slow, which caused recruiting to be slow, which led to me getting laid off.  I was fortunate to have worked for Robert Half as they helped me get my current job with Gordon & Rees.  Alos great, is that G&R sometimes may need of temporary workers which allows for for my personal interaction with past co-workers with Robert Half."
good,"Accountemps was a great learning experience for me and stepping stone to my current position. There was not enough work for me to stay busy and opportunity for advancement. "
good,"Greet public"
good,"St. Jude is a good place to work."
good,"Management was good but culture breads unethical competition that while not encouraged, is not curtailed either."
good,"I loved my co workers I am actually still in contact with a handful of them to this day.  The actual job was easy. Really the only problem I had with the assignment was when we first got hired on we were all told one thing like what our assignment was going to be and our hours and days off then when we got to the work place it was something completely different. I did the assignment the best I could I even did the over time we weren't even told of but working on our days off I didn't do because I didn't have transportation for that day. so I believe I complied to more than what was originally put on the table,"
good,I have worked for this corporation several times and they assisted in gaining full-time employment through temporary positions at different companies. I enjoyed learning operations and processes and many accounting software programs by working temporary positions.
good,"Contract work"
good,I would get an assignment a few days to a week before with instructions of the job description.  A typical day would consist of checking in with on site supervisor and getting details of assignment.  I have learned new telemarketing skills and have learned how to regroup with new people with each new assignment.  I have enjoyed the diverse people I have met and worked with at each assignment. The hardest part of working new assignments would have to be the lack of instruction at some sites by the on site supervisor. I enjoyed learning new skills and meeting new people.
good,"Simply put, Robert Half International gets your foot in the door. What happens once you're in there? Well...that's another story."
good,RH usually provided the better paying positions.  I was exposed to some of the most exclusive and high ranking companies not only in Memphis but nation wide.  I gained immeasurable experience.
good,"Fun atmosphere, great people, abysmal technology. If you are a hard working sales type person who enjoys cold calling, you should do well here. HORRIBLE technology. Feels like they run their infrastructure on a couple flash lights mounted on milk crates and hooked up to a car battery. Corporate intranet is run on IE 6.0 or earlier. "
good,"Working in the travel & meetings services department has taught me the ins & outs of corporate meeting planning.  The fast pace environment allows me to show my multitasking and organizational skills.  The team atmosphere is a group of close knit friends who truly demonstrate teamwork.  The hardest part of the job is over the top demands/requests from meeting requesters however, the opportunity to assist my meeting requesters and go the extra mile for their event is all worth it in the end! "
good,"Very professional staff.  Unfortunately, the placements were few and far between, and not necessarily the best for my strengths or skill-set."
good,"I was with them for about a year, working perhaps six months; the staff was friendly enough and they made very short order of putting me on my first assignment, which lasted just over a month.  The work was fairly monotonous and certainly didn't pay much: the work I did for most contractors was pretty trivial and ""easy,"" but it still needs to get done and I felt a higher wage was appropriate."
good,"Good Company to work with"
good,Professional staff. Consistent job leads and placement offers.
good,"A typical day would start off with the team at the board communicating their plan for the day as it relates to activity goals, specific accounts, process of job orders and overall thoughts. I learned a lot about numerous industries as I was with a Fortune 500 Company. Moreover, I learned how to lead, effectively manage the team and different sales approaches. The hardest part of the job was to stay stll since it is a very exciting environment. The most enjoyable part of the job was going on Client Visits and helping people."
good,"Worked for different companies assisting in collections, in between career oriented opportunities. I was actually hired full time by one of companies that I had started out with as a temp"
good,The first part of my employment consisted of calling customers and informing them of a policy change. After this project was completed I was put in charge of a data collection project in which I gathered and collated data that would be used to more efficiently plan routes.
good,Lack of assigments available on a consistent basis
good,"The company I work for through Robert Half (Accountemps) is Communications Test Design Inc (CTDI) and it is an international telecommunications firm. I work on Special Projects in the Accounting Department. My days are not typical because I have worked on several different projects from setting up books in QuickBooks for two non-profit entities of the corporation, to reconciling Fixed Assets for North American branches, to reconciling temp invoices to their Kronos time clock. I love their management style. They tell you what they want and don't expect to see you unless you have a question or have completed the assignment. There is definitely no micro-managing here! My co-workers are good, friendly people who have no problem lending a helping hand when necessary. The hardest part of the job is getting myself to West Chester by 7:30 am although the time is actually my choice (they allow you to choose the time you regularly come in from 7:00 to 8:30 am) and I chose that time to beat traffic and I am home by 5. I could not say what the most enjoyable part of the job is since my tasks are constantly changing. I can only say that for the most part, I enjoy what I do. I look forward to going in and come home with a smile still on my face."
good,Worked for various companies on a temporary basis. some for one day some for more than a week.
good,"Nothing Bad Nothing Spectacular, nothing really stands out, they are definitely a sales oriented company"
good,"My first assignment with Accountemps was at a magazine publishing company, where I worked as an accounts payable clerk for five months."
good,It is hard to build relationships with this staffing agency as the management is constantly changing. My placements have been positive.
good,I had a great expeirence untill they started reverting me back to another temp manager. Who decreased my pay incredibly. I needed work so could turn it down. The only person worth giving your time to is Chantell poole.
good,"Providing accounting services. As a temporary worker, I learned about different industries and how they operate. Management was often fare. Co-workers behavior varies, I wasn't permanent, so I was not a part of their team. The hardest part of the job is to get to learn new industries and meet new people for just a short time. The most enjoyable part was the flexibility!"
good,It is a client oriented company where managers and staff forget that candidates are as important for the business as their clients.
good,"checking the front end, making sure agents had correct MLS listings, Data entry."
good,"Long term temporary assignment at Hickman & Associates, CPAs, P.C. a public accounting firm and Dodd, Drennan & Associates, PLLC, a public accounting firm."
good,Nice environment and friendly staff. Always able to answer your questions in a timely manner.
good,Robert Half found me a position quickly. It was a location that I was able to get to. There really wasn't a bad part. The Patients Nurses and Doctors at the facility were really nice.
good,"A typical work day looks like on the admin side sending out reports and the proper documents for all Candidates/Clients"
good,Depending on how you are viewed within the organization the right opportunities come your way. Managerial styles vary from one department to the other.
good,"This temp agency has a lot of improvements. When applicants send direct messages, it should be answered within 24 to 48 hours. The jobs that are on the website, should be removed after being filled. In addition if the recruiter is no longer at the company, his/her name removed and correct name added. After you get job, it's easy to get on to full time work. The pay could be better."
good,"Initially schedule was adequate, but part-time hours were decreased to bring on additional staff.  Poorly managed and Technical Support was adequate but poor performance in providing necessary office supplies."
good,"Had the chance of meeting and working with some good people.  Although, this was temp work I really enjoyed working with Iron Mountain everyone was so friendly."
good,"Could be seen as a toxic environment. Lower level management was great but a lot of politics once you moved up in the chain. Micromanagement was huge and pressure to perform was constant. It’s a lifestyle and if you’re not totally sold, it’s easy for them to spit you up and chew you out quickly"
good,"The staff is nice and they do keep you busy in temp positions but often can not make the salary requirements I desire."
good,"this is a staffing agency.  There focus is their client primarily which makes sense but there is little to no support for you as their employee. I asked to have a job close to my kids schools, that never happened. I took a job out of need which was temporary during the summer months.  When the assignment was over, I asked if they could find me something closer and they replied--- we don't have anything right now but there were a bunch of listings online,  dropped them as a firm."
good,"Job security, employment timing when a project was ending. Wait times ranged from 3-8 weeks and were difficult for families. Lack of affordable health care was a concern"
good,I was very happy with my assignments with Robert Half until the last couple years when my assignments dwindled down to 2-3 days per week and sometimes 2-3 times per month. Unfortunately I needed more hours to keep up with my financial obligations. I can't fault my supervising manager as I also had many restrictions on my time in recent years(2) due to my husband's cancer.
good,"I have found the communication at Robert Half to be poor. It's hard to get an answer to my questions while I am on an assignment. When I have had questions I've had to ask at least three different times."
good,"I had some really good assignments that I enjoyed and one in which I "
good,My review is fair. The job was a temporary assignment. Since the job was a temporary assignment the staff was not very friendly overall with a few exceptions.
good,"This is a temp service so your account manager may change based on temp assignment and the temp assignment may change without notification. All temp assignments are NOT temp to perm and depending on the account manager you may or may not be placed in a position that you desire versus one that is in need of filling of which ""some"" of your skills will satisfy."
good,"I was taught that if you have nothing nice to say, say nothing. So will not say anything at all. I appreciate the help they gave with finding a permanent home.I haven't found one yet."
good,"Overall a good company.  Pay and benefits are lagging behind others.  Suffers from being so large and fragmented, with so many competing internal organizational agendas and infighting that often the real work and focus gets neglected.  But a lot of good people doing solid work."
good,"No job security/safety and time to learn about the industry"
good,They send you out on jobs that may or may not be a fit - doesn't matter. It's all about money. If you don't fit too bad. You're out the door. Another warm body will fill your place.
good,I worked there for about three months. The job was satisfying but the commute was long and the pay was only $20/hr so it was not worth the commute to work there.
good,"Fast paced office with an insufficient staff but it's pleasant dealing with the Accountemps staff, but not enough referrals for work. The career building jobs seem to come first."
good,You have to get 2000 hours to get paid for holidays and vacations when working part time it is not easy to do. Once the job was obtained they were not involved at all.
good,Working at Robert half is all about numbers. You can rise up easily and fall down quicker. They don’t give you enough time to pick up your accounts. I had 30 days to increase my numbers.
good,"Lot of Turnover within their office.  You got a different reqruiter everytime.  Had had  a couple great people, one left the company and the other transferred."
good,"Recruiter will work to get you a role that you qualify for. Once on the job, the recruiter does check in every week to make you communication on both ends are good."
good,Placement was fairly quick at a long term assignment.  No opportunity for advancement and no rate increase no matter how long at a position.  Was at an assignment for over a year with no rate increase and benefits very minimal
good,RH only helped me interview and secure short term temp jobs that I was underpaid and over qualified to work. Even the opportunities to transfer within the sister offices in other cities was told to be easy and that was just as hard as headhunting for oneself.
good,"One branch for Robert Half was quick to find me a job, which didn't work out because of a mismatch between skill set and job requirements (amicable discontinuation of contract). The branch closer to my home has failed to provide me with a single job assignment or provide me with any communication over the last month or so."
good,"Fast paced environment can be challenging, demands organization. Competency is rewarded, but can also be overloaded and work/home balance distorted quickly."
good,"Responsible for maintaining members online transactions, bank deposits, checking PO Box weekly & scheduling with vendors and handling package arrivals"
good,My only drawback with them is that they have a high tun over rate.  But they called me for various assignments  accounts receivable positions.  I really wanted to be  connected to full time work however.
good,"The work assignments were very versatile. Was able to work an assignment to completion and successfully moved on to another.  The pay was comparable to a good living wage and my current education level, experience and the geographical area at the time."
good,"I was hired as an accounting specialist and performed various accounting duties for a diverse group of companies.  My contract positions included: Office management, Accounts payable, Accounts Receivable, Auditing and Tax accounting."
good,"At Robert Half Legal the benefits are terrible.  For instance, you must work 2100 hours per year to get a 20 hour (yearly) bonus.  This is impossible if you work an 8 hour day/40 hour week because there are 52 weeks in the year and if you work every day and every week the maximum hours you will be able to work is a total of 2080 (do the math).  They do not care and think that the their employees are stupid because there is no way anyone can make those hours."
good,"Good working environment. Parking availability is poor and cost to much considering your pay rate. These positions were for legal document review projects that lasted from one to two months, sometimes longer."
good,"I think this is an okay staffing agency.  Sometimes they are not in tune with their clients.  You have to work really hard in order to be seen and heard which I think isn't conducive to a great company that has a motto of working to get you what you need, jobwise."
good,"I did not work at Robert Half but for them as a temp employee.  They sent me on temporary assignments."
good,"They managed my assignments pretty well but, did not communicate with me when changes came and assignment ended sooner than expected and I had to ask about what I was told at client location."
good,Good company but work was sporadic and sometimes a long drive. It was contract work which provided me with some good experience.  I got to see how different companies did things.
good,"While the managers that I worked with at Robert Half are very nice people, they are very unreliable and inconsistent. I constantly am having to send multiple emails and call multiple times before I can get ahold of them. I specifically said I did not want to work in sales, and the first job they assigned me to was sales. They didn't really listen to what I was looking for in a job, and seemed to just worry about filling slots for whoever was contracting them. The pay is good though."
good,The company is well connected to many organizations in the SF Bay Area which provides a lot of secondary networking opportunities. It's difficult to onboard initially but a great option for new residents.
good,its what you would expect from a temp agency. positions can range from administrative to sales. Long term positions are scarce and don't come around often.
good,Good pay and medical insurance after a certain period of time. Compared to other temporary agencies I prefer Robert Half. Sometimes it takes a while for them to find a fit for you.
good,"Hopefully, the company will give me a more challenging task or assignment which I will be able to learn and excel productively in my knowledge skill. The task I am doing right now is boring I am not gaining experience."
good,Worked in a call center for a company and answered questions to employees that called about their benefits.  Worked on several company's at a time. Needed to know multiple company benefits at one time.
good,"This was my first IT Contracting Job with a company.  My first contract was supposed to be for thirty days.  I was supposed to trouble-shoot and fix some code.  The job only lasted two days.  Ooops.  I suppose I fixed the problem too quickly.  I received a good review from customer, but there RH did not follow-up with me afterwards."
good,Robert Half is a Temporary to Hire agency.  Some of the above questions do not apply to this type of employment.  They found a great temporary job for me at Maine Medical Center that lasted for 7 months.  The hardest part of that job was satellite parking and walking from the hospital to the Accounts Payable Building down the street.  The most enjoyable part of the job were the people with whom I worked.
good,"I worked for Palmetto Health USC Medical Group in Columbia SC.  "
good,"I had dealt with little to no communication with Office Team staff during my last assignment.A new assignment, to begin on a Monday, was cancelled the previous Thursday and I was never contacted by Office Team about the cancellation, which, had I not known someone at the company I was to work for, would have resulted in a 1+ hour commute with no way to enter the building or to contact Office Team with questions since the start time was before their office hours. I contacted them myself the next day when I still had not heard from them and ended the professional relationship."
good,"I obtain job through Robert Half Temp Agency and although Robert Half does a good job at checking in with their employees, I did not enjoy the job culture at Tegna Corp."
good,Would always call you for positions with very low pay. Most did not part of my skill set. They were mostly concerned with getting the position filled with a person.
good,"Have been on assignment for a year and not getting picked up "
good,Specially in SuntTrust where there was another Agency they would pay $6 more per hour then what Accountemps were paying us. That's one of the reason when the project was extended they only asked the other agency to bring in  more people; the other reason unorganized.
good,"temp/contract work; staffing manager I worked with was amazing and kept me busy, she really tried to find assignments that were specific to my skillset; only negative was hourly rates"
good,"Assignments varied. Depending on business conditions you could be flooded with work, or you could be idle. Contract is great when trying to build a career, however."
good,Working for Robert Half as a temporary employee allows me to see what is available in the workplace.  The temp to perm positions allow the employer and me to evaluate one another and see if it is a good fit.
good,A typical day at work was I was constantly busy.  
good,"A typical day for me would be calling ""OHFA"" and Ohio Save the Dream clients. I learned a lot about the real estate industry. Management did not communicate as much they ended my assignment with the impression I was a amazing worker but nothing to offer me now. The hardest part of the job you had to detail orientated. The team environment was the best part."
good,"Love people I work with; love the work I do"
good,"I have been sent to a large variety of employment environments, which keeps working for OT interesting.  However, there are no benefits outside of a paycheck."
good,It's great to go into a business and provide the help they need to function in any given day when they are short on employees or have gotten behind for some reason.
good,"If you don't have enough hours working per week, you won't get paid for holidays. The staff in New Jersey worked with me but, the staff in Colorado was looking for someone younger."
good,They pay fairly. The assignments they send you on are professional. They have respect for their employees. They will find jobs according to your transportation.
good,"I found during my time there that management is not always open and willing to follow through, or have an open door policy...clearly depends on who you are."
good,"Long hours, bad management. Felt like I suffocating and never really going anywhere. Could have been my work ethic as I had no passion for the job very quickly on. Lots of kissing up in order to move up in the company.. Def. played favorites and there was too many heavily under qualified managers on a power trip :)"
good,this is an agency they send you where ever they see you might be a match even if you don't really fit in. they try to be strict about placing you and the pay is very low.
good,Some of the managers are ok but some are down right wicked. I feel bad for some of the recruiters because they can get the axe as soon as a week. The co workers were nice but you could tell the majority of them were stressed out.
good,"Great company to gain a variety of experiences, exposure to a variety of job opportunities to gain knowledge.  Meeting new people is great, learning from others move you forward."
good,"Each position or assignment is a fresh view of different companies' processes and procedures. Exposure to different workplace cultures helps to learn what works and what doesn't work in office environments. The hardest part of the job is the first few days to a week, when you are stepping into a new assignment, not quite sure of the expectations of the supervisor or owner."
good,"Worked for Robert Half in California and always had pleasant productive experience.  However, in Michigan legal secretary positions are far and few."
good,Worked different temp assignments and the staff was always friendly and helpful.  Would recommend to anyone just starting out in a career and not sure where they want to go.
good,"I was hired as a temporary administrative assistant in January of 2017, with little given direction of where it would lead me to. I took on as many tasks as I could with every opportunity, but there was minimal opportunity for growth."
good,The staff at OfficeTeam works with each individual to try and meet their needs.  They are easy to contact and return calls in a timely manner.  Often temporary jobs are extended so a 2-4 week job has now lasted 4 months and has been extended for 2 more months.  Salary is the only thing that is an issue right now but the new experiences are a plus.
good,Accounttemps will place you even with a difficult company to work for. Even when they know Management at a company is extremely difficult to work for and burns through temps in less than two months. Then they will place the employer above the employees as far as caring about what happens to them. If they wanted to make money they would care more about the people they are placing. It has to be a balance between the two.
good,"It's Robert Half, a temp agency. Kind of know what you're getting going in don't you? That being said, the pay was decent and I did, eventually, get hired where I was placed."
good,"Obviously you basically are a number. If your current role is up and they have nothing for you, oh well. They do not plan ahead (in my case). Now they bug the heck out of me. Send me on interviews all over creation and unless there is an offer never get back to you."
good,"I used their legal placement services when I moved to the greater Boston area.  I did temporary work for them.  The assignments were good, but I like a more stability in my life.  I eventually found full-time employment on my own with a state agency."
good,The problem I had with them is that once I was at a position they didn't want to move me to something better. I would inquire about other jobs that they had posted on-line that paid better or interested me and they always said that they were filled. Which I don't know if I believe. They don't want to loose commission on the job your at now by switching you. It's the downside of working as a temporary.
good,"They will find somewhere for you to work at. If it's a contract or part time position and you like the place, good luck if you want to stay there. Chances are you can't. You're worth more to them if you continue to go without the workplace wanting to keep you."
good,"The positions are great. However, the assignments are short term and too far and few in between. The staff  is hardworking and are sure to reach out when new opportunities are available."
good,"My experience at Robert Half was enriching. The SPS program offers a diverse experience in the accounting and finance field. Though I did not have a sense of belongings since I was constantly moving from projects to projects, companies to companies."
good,Ok salary and work conditions.  Flexible with time off.   The project lasted about as long as they said it would so that was good.  Decent experience overall.
good,"Depends on if they like you enough to keep you in a job; I was fine at the start, but, they've been reluctant to get back on me after leaving several messages between several people."
good,Accountemps is a good place to find potential opportunities in accounting and finance and therefore gain experience.  Some positions are temp to hire.
good,"I signed with there company to help me find a job, I did not work for them... They had me one day filing, another day, entering data, a different job daily"
good,"A typical work week.The .management team works with you and help you understand your new career, Professional, is update they are very successful .thupdates to date with the clinical"
good,"They are very nice to deal with and helpful."
good,"If you hate being bored, this is the place for you. Definitely understaffed but most of the people there make the environment fun to work in."
good,Not for the weak of heart.  A-type personality work environment only.  Pay is good if you can close deals!  I worked here for a year and closed plenty of deals.  I gained a lot of knowledge about the IT world and made good Client and Candidate relationships.  This job is aggressive sales and there is plenty of competition within the company.
good,The companies you end up working for can vary from awesome to awful depending on who found the position and how their feeling on any given day.  There was little communication or emphasis on making the Salaried Professionals feel as though they were actually important.
good,Assignments are not consistence. The work place is a nice environment however the assignments are short term or one day.
good,"Office team was able to find me a great temp position when I was a recent graduate. It was a great opportunity for me to gain experience. I had great impressions of office team when I first started my position, but after working with them for several months I realize how horrid they are at communication. When I call, they rarely answer. When I leave VMs, they rarely return my call. As my employer, I would very much appreciate communication between them"
good,"This company has become family to me. Aside from being such a distance from home, I look forward to coming to work and enjoying my day with colleagues/family. There is plenty of opportunity for growth."
good,Accountemps in Minneapolis Minnesota has a very helpful team. They work strongly together in helping you achieve your goals within your career.
good,"There are many pluses to working at Robert Half. They provide you with networking opportunities, technology, and the largest recruiting pool of any firm. It is also a very young environment in the branches so very much a work hard play hard environment. Management however is very metric driven and always will want more. They assess your performance weekly and will frequently change the metrics they're seeking success in."
good,"I was new to the bay area and had no idea what jobs to apply for so I decided to seek a temp agency. It helped me develop my resume and gain experience, but was not a great long term solution. I had a hard time finding a full time position from a temp to hire project."
good,Multiple industries contacts with well qualified consultants that provide great support as a learning experience. Gained experience in new systems and
good,Robert Half is a Temp agency that only provided me with one assignment of 5 weeks.  While with them I worked at a Trucking Company that was pleased to have me in due to my extended experience in the Trucking Industry.  Management was awesome as well as my co-workers.  hardest part of the job was when it ended and the most enjoyable was being a part of them!
good,"Good experience working as an 'office temp'"
good,"The assignment I was placed on is a very pleasant place to work. "
good,"Hired to provide programming services to UCFS.  Modified programs, screens, reports, and generated letters to customers as required, in RPGILE and COBOL."
good,"On a daily basis managed labor reports, processed change orders,  payroll,  etc. Daily walk-through of development with management while taking notes. Helpful co-workers and subcontractors and mentor working environment. Hardest part about the job was reassignments to another project site."
good,Since there was an opening close to where I lived and far from  most others they were quick to get me into the positon.  I worked for the  HR department at Anglo-Gold in Cripple Creek.  The assignment was easy enough and close to home.  Co-workers were reasonably good at training me .
good,"I do like working with them, but unfortunately there is not a great amount of open communication with this company. They are hard to get a hold of, and sometimes return phone calls"
good,In general Staffing agents are courteous and willing to assist in job placement.At times it feels that they don't emphasize my skills to clients as much as I feel they should.
good,"The industry is very tough to excel in, it takes much hard work and dedication to the job. That said, if you are not the type of person who is willing to work for and undetermined amount of hours during a given day (on average, expect to be in the office from 8 to 6:30-7:00) this is not the job for you."
good,i got a chance to work with great companies. They do everything on short notice so its hard to plan things around this type of schedule or work a more stable job.
good,i had several contract jobs though this company they were very helpful and willing to spend time getting to know my skills and abilities
good,They are good at finding you long term short assignments like 3 to 6 months which could possibly lead into full time positions. But if your assignment ends you have to wait a good time before the next assignment comes in. Not that many 1 to 3 day assignments.
good,"Professional enough. Got me a couple temp jobs and one of them led to a permanent position. Do not know the company, haven't followed them since 2005."
good,"Good opportunity for gaining experience.  However, temp is somewhat stressful. "
good,Average temporary agency.  Sometimes placement and work skills are not cohesive.  Getting to a job facility and noting that you do not have the skill set to do the job is embarrassing.
good,"A lot of smart people working there but a very high pressure environment. Most people don't last long which says a lot. Great sales training, but micromanaged"
good,"A temporary work agency that has sent me out on many jobs.  Sometimes they are unclear as to the desire of the employer, which can cause problems."
good,"AccountTemps is an alright company to work for.  It does seem that as soon as you work for the Temp side of Robert Half, they seem to forget you on the Perm side."
good,"Fast paced environment, heavy sales. you will be constantly on the phones and should never put it down to stay successful."
good,"Great company to work for, continue to stay busy. This is a matrix focused company which keeps you on your toes.I have learned a lot about management styles and working as a team. This is a job that has given me a lot of hardworking skills."
good,"Every day is difference depending on the temporary assignment. Some of the duties include data entry, answering phones, scanning documents."
good,"Sometimes the job is for a week, sometimes a month.  You definitely get to expand your skill set through various contracts at various companies."
good,Ran a full desk of Recruiting at Robert Half Technology.  Developed own book of business and supported these client for any staffing needs.
good,"This was supposed to be a temporary job, leading into a permanent position.  However, that is not what became of this opportunity."
good,"Great place but very hard culture to work in very hard to feel comfort in the environment. Great Money , not much training ."
good,This place was pretty good. They did everything they were supposed to do in getting you hired on. They pay is ridiculous though. They make a lot of money off their employees but don't compensate accordingly
good,Robert Half is very fast paced. You get in early and leave late to make sure you get your work done. You interview many people to find the right fit for your client. I liked working on the tech side because it was a team of 3 and we worked together very good.
good,"Great recruiters at Robert Half. They are always looking for jobs for you, only downfall is compensation for certain projects. Most of the the jobs I was placed on I was over qualified. Still great experience with the Office Team at Robert Half."
good,"Print out collection report, call and or email tenants for payment; Generate and email invoices as requested to tenant; send and receive credit card authorization forms for payment processing; reply to internal and external emails; prepared delinquent accounts for agency placement; established a great working rapport with co-workers and managers."
good,I have been with RHI for 2 years and the only issue I have with them is not providing adequate notice when an assignment is over. I have also worked with them long enough for paid holidays but the temp employer let employees off for 3 days an RHI only provided one paid day off.
good,"Working with this organization was a rewarding experience as they matched me with very different assignments:  two agricultural companies providing different approaches to the accounting area and their needs.  One long term assignment was almost an autonomous position but was still interesting."
good,Great vacation time offered but no raises.  Fun place to work loved the employees. Mon through Friday job with 40 hours per week.
good,"Fast-paced environment which offered a huge learning experience."
good,Many exciting opportunities to grow one's skill level. The challenge is being able to quickly ascertain what the contract duties are at an assignment.
good,"Great bunch of people, yet was very closed on letting a temp in on too much information. Basically handed a stack of papers and told call and find these people. No explanation or reason until asked. Got bored real quick. I guess if I were a full time employee it might have been more enjoyable."
good,I rate the company high on taking care of housekeeping issues.  The one time an issue surfaced was when the company I reported to wanted to hire me but didn't want to go through Accountemps.  But since I had signed a contract with Accountemps that took precedence in my eyes.  I think I've been paying the price for that decision ever since.  But I can't focus on that.  I would work for Accountemps again.
good,"Marketing to businesses to obtain job orders and recruiting/interviewing top notch talent to place with our clients.  The majority of the work is done on the phone to schedule interviews and client visits.  After scheduling an appointment, I meeting with C-Level Executives to find out the specific needs of a position and then matching the job with the right talent.  The hardest part in this organization is to be a number and not have an impact on the company's direction.  I really enjoy helping someone progress in their career and place them in a life changing position."
good,Easy to be placed and work in the positions you like.  I enjoyed my experiences that the jobs provided.  A day at work was long but went fast.  The hours were not exactly what I wanted.  My co-workers were very nice.  The company where I worked experienced daily computer issues which made my job difficult.
good,"While the office staff is very pleasant, assignments have been few and far between.  I called and even emailed in the past, but to no avail."
good,I truly like working with my co-workers and having a very team oriented place of work.  I learned a great amount of about HR and what it takes to make sure that not only the client is happy but the candidates.
good,"Can be a high-stress environment, but you learn a lot. I gained a lot of knowledge of office work and HR in my position. Co-workers are great. Great office location in the Inner Harbor."
good,Call center environment and you're always talking on the phone.  Stressful atmosphere to hit sales numbers. Constant meetings about the same stuff. Cold calling required.
good,"Unkomplizierte Vermittlung an einen Entleihbetrieb."
good,"For the most part treated like an after thought, last minute inclusion. Better than other agencies in the area (Wash DC) but that's not really a compliment."
good,"jobs weren't that great, difficult to get a hold of, other agencies were easier."
good,It is a stressful sales environment and there is a lot of micro managing.
good,Enjoyed learning what it's like to be trendy and staying one step ahead in the fashion industry.
good,IT Application Development Recruiting on contracting and FT Roles
good,Need benefits as a competitive edge to retain workers. They jobs they refer me to pay is extremely low and not worth taking. Some assignments are not comparable to my skills.
good,Good place for someone in a bind having a hard time finding the right fit.
good,Great place to work if you do not have kids.  You can make great money and you can get great training.
good,Their client-base projects fully utilizes current IT skill-sets while expanding direct IT industries employment experience.
good,"Worked for Nevada State Bank on assignment from Robert Half. I was the go to person for recruiter Jill Clawson. She could always count on me."
good,Not much room to advance. Great people and work. Benefits are wonderful.
good,Learned a lot of the basic accounting pricipals. Excel skills were utilized. Co-workers were easy to get a long with and learned a lot in my role.
good,"The jobs I have been assigned to were good paying, gave me some experience that I didn't know, but the hardest part is waiting to be matched to jobs."
good,I worked at Wells Fargo in the Home Equity department. I processed demands as well as subordinations. I learned a lot about the process in purchasing a home as well as the time it takes for paper work. My co-workers were very great but some hard to work with as far as questions on the job itself. I believe that management was helpful at times but mainly expected you to know your work in a short period of time. I was there for about 6 months and was ok on processing demands but had a lot of trouble with subordinations due to lack of training. The hardest part for me is just to have the time to go over how to process the subordinations. The most enjoyable part of this job was being able to spend the evenings with my daughter and working with people which is what I love to do.
good,"A typical day is picking up pc's, deploying new pc's, migrating users, troubleshooting hardware and software, shipping and receiving, and trying to find my way around without getting lost (approximately 80 buildings on site)."
good,"Can't really remember too many details other than the fact that I earned a raise and above-average performance review.  I thoroughly enjoyed the job duties and meeting, greeting and assisting the public on a daily basis.  The phone system was awesome!  I would have loved to have worked there longer and would have liked a clear reason for why my position was eliminated."
good,"This is a temp company which I worked for 2 years, the consistency of taking assignments are unstable. I have to call every week to check wether or not they can give me work."
good,"Entered data to update spreadsheets, made calls to collect on past due accounts and maintained files."
good,"This agency just has short term positions available, with no future no found a long term postiion"
good,"This is a temporary agency that have different account, that you have to provide a professional manner, for the Client needs, which is General Office work, some assignment may lead to a permanent job."
good,I enjoy my work that I am doing however I do not feel like my talent is being used in the best possible way.
good,Currently working on a temporary assignment.  I have been contracted by OHL Infrastructure through OfficeTeam.
good,"Extended assignments are preferable to shorter and more frequent ones because you do get the opportunity to develope relationships with the staff. I was a front desk receptionist and the entire staff had to come by my desk. They were all professionals with some names that were difficult to pronounce. Each day I greeted each one by name and they liked that a lot. When I left they took me to lunch, gave me gifts and even tried to help me secure permanent work."
good,"This was a placement agency that I used for temporary work assignments.  I felt they did a good job in placing me in a variety of positions to work with until I found the right fit for me."
good,Temp agency gave many different job to pick from. Learned many things by going through an agency
good,Great company but I didn't like the client they sent me too. Once I made them aware of what was going on nothing was done and I was told to suck it up.  Not very professional.
good,I have nothing negative to share from Robert Half's perspective.  They could do more in offering opportunities to the contract worker though.
good,A great opportunity to learn how many different companies operate day to day. Very friendly co-workers when placed on assignment.
good,My day would start anywhere from 4 am to 7 am and would end usually before 3 pm. I would drive from one school to the next daily to photograph staff and students for school pictures and yearbook. I learned the proper way to photograph and ensure the picture would be the best possible. Didn't work with staff to much. We had our own set up stations. The hardest part of this job was getting lost and running late. (Navagation Systems were still new). I enjoyed the students trying to give their best pose and smile to make the parent/gaurdian happy.
good,Working for Robert Half International allows a person to work in various environments and experience various company culturals. 
good,Great assignments but pay much less than full-time equivilent
good,The experience of working for Robert Half has been rewarding.  They have provided me with temp employment when I needed it.  The assignments have been very educating and fulfilling.
good,Job came and went have not heard from the recruiter since. No emails nothing. Would be a benefit if they reached out to you with possible positions available. Other companies I worked for in the same capacity contact me regularly to let me know what they have in my area
good,"Again, I was not a permanent employee of Atlantic Distributors. I was working as a bookkeeper through a temporary agency. The company is/was still in probate after the death of the primary owner in January. There was just too much drama between the other 2 owners while the probate is/was being settled. Sales were also down and the ingrained sales reps were not willing to get new customers or abide by basic rules regarding COD accounts."
good,introduce to job agent
good,The most enjoyable part of my days at work were meeting and greeting people.
good,A typical workday involved being very detailed in the process of reviewing mortgage loans.
good,They are not reliable about getting your check. You have to call them constantly if you want to work... Will not help you if you have problems with your temp job.
good,"Robert Half International is a staffing and recruiting firm. A typical day consisted of Clerical duties, meeting and greeting all candidates and a large number of Administrative duties. I gained professional experience. The staff and co-workers work together to the best of our abilities to match all Candidates with an opportunity of employment with a company that would best fit their potential and skills set. The hardest part of this job was their roll over positions & management. My experience in working for Robert Half International was not a memorable one."
good,Got 1 job there which was nice. Data Entry & Receptionist. coworkers were ok. worked there for like 3 days.
good,"A typical day working for this company was I come in and filing and refiling charts, so they were in order when the needed to be reviewed. I mainly worked by myself, I did interact with other employess in the morning and evening."
good,I was a temp for them. I enjoyed working for them as a temp. I had assignment with Investment Banks to Churches. You gain alot of valuable work experience but it is temporary. Meaning you can be let go without notice for no reason..
good,"The staff was friendly and I felt they listened to what I was looking for in the temporary industry. I was available for any position, so they offered me quite a few. I felt that their inter office communication was lacking. On several occasions, I was contacted by several staffing regarding the same job. Or no one knew who my contact was for an assignment. But for the most part, I would definately work for this company again."
good,I learned that being a temporary placement for hire for Accountemps is that you have to be ambitious and know your skill set. Always groom yourself for the next step.
good,"My tenure as a temporary administrative assistant for OfficeTeam/Robert Half met my expectations: it paid adequately, provided me with consistent work, and allowed me to develop important contacts."
good,Often times would be sent on assignments that were not what I was looking for but took because of a lack of anything else available.
good,A co. that is conservative and makes good long term decisions. A good place for a stable and reliable career.
good,"I didn't work much with the in-house staff, but can tell you that they were available when I needed them."
good,"It was a learning experience, good co-workers laid back enviroment. Learned more of the client side of the prescription benefits."
good,I enjoyed the opportunity to learn new accounting systems and apply my previous experience in new environments
good,"Good co-workers, environment and a nice place to work. Learned how to use spreadsheets at this temporary position."
good,I like the different clients you work with. Good company management.
good,Good Company to work at. Prompt payment for asignments. Good support staff.
good,a temp job to get me throw school and it was easy. i would go to different places and file papers or anwser calls
good,I have worked at great temp places in philadelphia. I have learned alot from each experience as well as gaining skills.
good,Fine to work for. Pleasant to contact. Pay is weekly and prompt. Follow up with problems is prompt. Various positions were available. Open to feedback.
good,"Great place to work I would highly advocate for them!"
good,"It's a busy fast paced environment, very metrics driven. Management was nice, its not for everyone. Quite competitive, not much work life balance, a lot of pressure to make cold calls."
good,Helped me to obtain temporary employment.  Not all jobs that they recommended were a good fit.  The last temporary position I took turned into permanent employment.
good,Serious but friendly environment.  Good work ethics and diversity.  Their standards are really high and when your assignment is over it takes them a very long time to call you back for another one.
good,"Working for a temp agency is difficult because there are no benefits or holiday pay unless you stay with the company for over 2000 hours.  Otherwise, if you like moving into different jobs, than the company will help get what works for you."
good,"While most head hunting companies will require a background check and many other requirements, Robert Half Technology only asks them if necessary. However, they do care about placing you with a company that meets your needs which can take awhile depending on the field your career is in."
good,This agency has helped me many times with finding a job. I would recommend to work temp for them or to find a good job that would make you perm. Working for Robert Half for a long time does not promise you a perm. position for the jobs they give you.
good,"Not actually on site of Robert Half so I don't know about their culture, work life balance.  Pay depends on the position they placed you for, flexibility depends on your position they place you in."
good,"Interessante Kunden "
good,Temp agencies are nothing but a paycheck. they do not give the opportunity to go full time. you are done in 90 days. I don't want to review places like this.
good,"I had several assignments, but the one working in the hospitals was the most challenging.  I really enjoyed going to work each day to see what was my next achievement of the day.  I enjoyed the people I worked with & saw in the hospital environment,."
good,Very good company. I loved the location and the ambience of my work place. The surrounding were nice and it’s across the street from miracle mile! Lots of restaurants and shops!
good,This is a big company that makes you work for your success. This is never a bad thing. They really push you to your limits as they want you to succeed at all points.
good,"Overall, I would encourage future professionals to seek out employment options with the company. The company is resourceful and the investors are very professional."
good,"This is a pretty good company to work for under Robert Half International. I usually get pretty good assignments. But the only thing I ever wanted was long term jobs that will definitely and finally turn into a permanent workplace for me. Also, the hourly salary needs to be consistent with my years of work experience that I can offer. I have worked over 30 years in many different kinds of companies and industries and knows and have learned alot in administration, banking, as a leasing consultant, retail and as a receptionist in the automotive and various offices as a receptionist/office assistant."
good,"I had the opportunity to provide assistance to the Human Resources manager of the company assigned.  I was given the opportunity to learn their systems.  I like the company that I worked for.  This assignment was a match with my skills.  I do not wish to disclose more information at this time.  If given the opportunity, I would accept other assignments."
good,Accountemps is a good resource for employers to fill in the gaps during crisis.  The recruitment staff were very supportive and conscientious.  For the short term Accountemps is a good place to earn money.
good,"start out the day by setting up new accts, make collection calls on accounts ,  in the USA and Canada, research and process refunds for customers. bill accounts with direct on line billing. ."
good,"They make money off of their candidates so they have motivation to get their candidates placed.  The positions are not always what or how they present them, the compensation is low, and once you are placed in a position you rarely hear from anyone."
good,"I work for Office Team but not at Office Team. I was assigned to another company to work. "
good,if your looking to gain some experience this is a good position to do so. However if your looking for something long term this is probably not the best fit for you.
good,"I have not had a bad experience with Officeteam."
good,"I recently reapplied with office team, did a video chat phone interview.  Advised of my expectations and upon reaching out to the Chandler az remote location I was ignored and received no call backs or job opportunities. I never had problems with the Milwaukee WI or Dallas TX area offices."
good,"Great experience, worked with a good staff, training was often and senior management interacted with all levels in the firm. Team mentality made working with CTBC a good fit."
good,"I learned a lot with different job exposure. Its just that there was no increase when I worked for the same company for almost 2 years. There are no paid vacation days and holidays if you haven’t reached certain hours And when i had a month long unpaid vacation, everything was reset like i am a new employee. There was no pressure in getting you a permanent position."
good,"Robert Half is a big company with great earning potential and benefits. However, this particular branch has a manager that tends to play favorites often and belittles simple questions asked. I'll never forget coming to him with a question only to be answered with ""use the google machine and figure it out"" only to see another rep in the office approach him with a similar question, and for him to respond with a ""pull your chair over and lets take a look"". If only I was the blonde with a pencil skirt on instead of the young man looking for advice.... Gross!"
good,Great place to work! Really nice team and fun job. Recommended the company to several friends. Great hours to work and lots of great benefits. Very professional culture.
good,"Difficult to get feedback on job performance.  They seem to switch your contact person frequently.  No problems with automated compensation system.  Employee inputs detailed work-hours on-line and can use direct deposit for pay.  Your contact may or may not call weekly just to ""touch-base""."
good,"If you like temp work, I guess. Worked for 2 years and poof, terminated. No further reference or job offers despite the notion of being highly skilled."
good,Enjoyed working here would suggest friends to work here.  Payroll services are great enjoyed working hereenjoyed working here would suggest friends to
good,"i enjoy the company i work for/but would not highly recommend being placed through RH. in a contract role do not qualify for company benefits like retirement, paid time off and competitive benefits (health, etc)"
good,Only worked at Robert Half for 4 months while transitioning between employers.  Great interim place to work while seeking permanent work with other employers.
good,Would call on victims would have suffered a disaster due to weather conditions through-out the world.  Would answer phone calls and help them with information to get help.
good,It was a decent company to work for but as with any some parts were better than others. The placements were varied. The culture claims to be communication centric however that was not always the case. Many times I had to reach out for information that should have been provided.
good,"I do not believe they set employees with matched customers. They just try to fill a position and hope it works."
good,My first assignment with them and I did not like it. I was not compensated for my work experience. Did not like the assignment I was on the company was not professional.
good,The assignment's I was given were fun with great environments!  Varied with great culture and people employed.  I tend to be a people person.  I was able to use my warmth and engaging personality traits without feeling uncomfortable because I still enjoy engaging with people.  The assignments also were good for me because the personnel of each organization expressed positive and receptive feedback about my presence and how much they enjoyed working with me.
good,"Great place to work overall but the management and communication were sorely lacking. They expect you to do things but do not tell you what or how it needs to be done. Once you complete a task, if it's not correct, they go right to the top instead of discussing what needs to be done differently. A lot of going behind your back with this so that you are not really informed of what is expected of you. Again no communication. When you ask what needs to be worked on or what you can do to help, there is no response but very quick to go to upper management to complain. Real shame because otherwise it's a great place to work."
good,"They have a variety of job assignments where you can gain new skills, knowledge and experience. "
good,"They Work With You To Find Placement!"
good,"I liked working for this company, except that working for a temp agency does not allow for stable income.  I like to know if my job is permanent, but this isn't always true."
good,I would have had preferred if they really took the time to listen to you that way you can stay with a company that you enjoyed working for. Other that I learned a lot from my temp jobs that were given to me.
good,"•	Responsible for divisional strategy, business development, and client relations for Management Resources, the consulting division of Robert Half. Focusing efforts on growing revenue in key service offerings including finance, business systems, audits, compliance, merger and acquisition (M&A) activity and technology optimization"
good,"Robert Half was a contract job working for Bank of America. I enjoyed working with this company and my coworkers."
good,"While I was with Accountemps, I worked for an insurance company.  The pay was fair, but I did not have much contact with the actual agency.  It was a good experience."
good,I was processing WA & MT Purchase order invoices. was trained to fill in for vacationing customer service team where I learned how to handle heavy amounts of phone calls and emails. Helped in the mail room when needed.
good,"I enjoyed the time I worked with Robert Half, the Senior VP who handled my assignments was great.  She knew how to market my skills and manage my schedules and assignments well. I was never on bench for a month."
good,Robert Half and Associates was a great place to work for a variety of locations and gain a lot of experience. I met great people and learned so much during my time there.
good,"Some people are made for the grind of recruiting and some are not. The hours are very long, so not the greatest work life balance, but the people are nice."
good,"Not much to review. I would prefer not to work for an agency after Accountemps. Treat you like a commodity and not a person. Very little personalization with your manager."
good,I really have nothing bad to say about the company ...except that they did place me a location one tome and the drive to work was an hour long.  But the pay was ok
good,I have enjoyed working on Robert Half projects and adding value to the accounting teams of the companies where I have been placed.  I continue to receive opportunities to allow to build on my experience.
good,It is better to find employment on your on because once your prove yourself to be great...they will not find you permanent employment.  They will continue to let companies extend your contract and you will not still have benefits.
good,I was a temp employee because I needed flexibility to travel to be care taker for family member.  This was the perfect solution for me.  I was actually placed with a former employer.
good,Ability to try out a job without being committed to accept hire position with them if you feel your needs for job fulfillment isn't their at that company or benefits are lacking to enhance lower pay
good,Troubleshooting computer issues. computer deployments and setups in different buildings downtown. Was able to deploy a system in the fire department downtown.
good,"Assignments are short, good pay, drug test, work environment pleasant, work is constant flow, near shopping and eatery. Offered employment on a annual basis."
good,great company to work for.  flexible hours.  great projects.  responsive management.  most enjoyable is the flexibility.  highly recommended.  great compensation.
good,I don't have anything to say about this company. It was so long ago that i don't even remember what i did for this company. It may have been a temporary service.
good,First and largest specialized staffing partner.  Seven lines of business to support clientele from temporary-permanent roles.  Provides consultative approach to ensure client satisfaction.
good,"I just worked contract, from one extreme to another.  Would go outside my work experience. Nothing really challenging.  Different locations. I did not like having to fill out timesheets or not knowing if I would be working one day to the next."
good,"I did not work there. I only went on assignments. Between assignments were long gaps between assignments, low pay, lack of researching locations were sometimes a problem."
good,i work with accountemps because it help me finding jobs as temp while i am looking for permanent job in the field of my interest that help me get an idea and experience of org.
good,It was an ok temp job to work at.  Some of the employees were ghetto and unstable. One of the supervisor was very ghetto and unprofessional. He dressed like a gangster.  I understood later on why most of the it and salespeople worked from home cause the production team was like a bunch of animals from the zoo.
good,The work you do can very quit a bit at Robert Half because they pick up short term consulting positions and match with a pool of candidates.  You can be busy for several months and then not hear from them for several months.
good,"it was a temp job work day 8 - 5"
good,Robert Half is professional and their offices are nicer than most. The agent I worked with was very nice and placed me at a job I did very well at. Fair temp agency.
good,"I enjoyed working with them, they placed me in a job.  What more can I say.  Professional and easy to work with.  I would work with them again in the future."
good,"As a consultant, pay is comparable to job specification. Pay in my estimation for contractual work is very good. Recruiter is engaged and helpful. Benefits are what you make it."
good,Wageworks allowed me to conduct a lot of different job type scenarios to help the overall security posture and aid in their overall compliance in multiple regulatory areas.  Robert Half was only informed I was conducting this type of work and did not participate at all
good,"It is after all a temp agency, after reporting the date my assignment would end they really just said well good luck in finding a new job glad it went well."
good,"Nice to have help looking for jobs that might fit. It is good having a place to help filter job listings and knowing many companies and employers. everyone has been nice and helpful,"
good,"Mandatory review of a staffing company?  Are you kidding me?  They found me a job, for that I am happy. But they are a staffing company, I did not work for them."
good,"No flexible hours, very hard work. Can be good if you have a good team and good training but that is hard to find. The culture isn't great at all. Expected to work overtime."
good,Office Team has placed me on numerous assignments. They are very professional and make their clients feel comfortable working with the recruiters. They prepare you well for your assignments.
good,I have no review for this company I would like to say that it was fine working there and i had no issues with it what so ever for the time that i worked there
good,Did not like the management. No vacation because of only 6 month contacts and no holidays. You would be expected to make them up on weekends. The pay was on point though.
good,A good place to start a career in HR. You do need to produce in order to show your work. Everything is here for you to learn and find opportunities. weekends and holidays are days off.
good,"This job is very sales focused. At the time, I found it hard to sell such a high mark-up. The hours were very long. There was not a lot of work life balance. I also hated having to pay for parking."
good,Work was not always consistent and locations varied. Pay was never the same due to contract work and demands of client.  Management was always friendly and helpful.
good,Must be able to travel to different clients to perform accounting work. Work is based on the number of assignments available. Must develop relationships with clients and maintain billable hours.
good,Robert Half can be a great place to work depending on what you want to do long term. There is not a lot of personal/professional development unless you ask for it. They care more about the number of calls you make in a day than developing you as an employee.
good,They were successful in placing me within the greater Sacramento area when I was unable to do so myself. It was great having them look for me while I did the same.
good,"Robert half has great people, always willing to help you out. They are always available to call and work things though. They work closely with Prohealth Care. I was a temp for ProHealth for close to a year. They have good people there and it’s a fun environment."
good,This position was a temporary assignment.  The temporary agency assigned this position to me based on my skills. The agency handles legal firms and other companies that will hire people on short term basis.
good,"Very good place to get your accounting career started. But there were confusion about job locations, the length of job and they often don't put the right people in the right seat. it can be a good experience for those who have the skill sets for different jobs. But seriously"
good,"as a temp agency office team is a great company"
good,"Robert Half International, or commonly referred as, Robert Half, is a global human resource consulting firm based in Menlo Park, California founded in 1948. It is a member of the S&P 500, and is credited as being the world's first and largest accounting and finance staffing firm, with over 345 locations worldwide"
good,A two-month contract with RH helped me build my resume for  future opportunities. The opportunity was rather low-level contract administration in the sense that our team of four temps were just reviewing contracts to find data to include in a contracts database.
good,Once contracting is up have a plan b for next assignment. Follow up on emails and phone calls. When resume are sent for open positions they go absolutely no where
good,I have utilized AccounTemps several times in my career when I was in need of immediate/temporary employment.  The staff has always been very helpful.  I would recommend them to anyone.
good,"You need to pay more for candidate's in Oklahoma. Most call centers pay 14 an hour now. And since we as the temp, do no have paid holidays nor do we have someone to submit our timesheet, we should get paid at least 13-14/ hours. Personal opinion"
good,"Robert Half is a publicly held permanent and temporary employee organization. The team environment was fun, motivating and supportive. I most enjoyed helping clients meet their staffing needs, in particular getting the right fit for their particular culture. The most challenging part of the job was trying to navigate a very political environment in which their were concerns about favoritism. Overall, "
good,For a temp service the over all company was great. they got me a couple of great assignments. They worked hard to find just the right job for me. Working for a employment services is totally different from years ago.
good,Great for cutting your teeth in recruiting. Invests in training and development only to let you sink and drown if you are not good at locking in the process.
good,Assisting clients by pairing them with a home health aide. I learned how to pair Aides to their clients based upon services needed. Management was informative and patient.
good,"I was given short-term and temporary assignments that could last for only one day, one month, and then given my current Help Desk Analyst position for 6 months. I created great rapport with multiple employers will working with Robert Half Technology Staffing."
good,"Worked for RH for a short period of time. Fast paced and demanding. Long hours and poor work life balance. Extensive and thorough training process."
good,The co workers are nice like to work as a team.. it's at a fast pace.. I really like the jobs they offer.. it's hard getting them.. it's a long waiting period for the jobs
good,"didn't work in their office, but people i talked to always happy and friendly, i didn't learn anythging here.  management was good.  culture was ok.  enoyed getting paid weekly"
good,I worked for Office Team during the recession so it was hard to advance there.  I worked for some great companies and I also worked for some not so great companies.  They send you to where you are needed.
good,Never enough contracts and doesn't put you on contract much and doesn't pay enough and also jobs are to far for low pay worked with a great group of people
good,Our group was nice to work with and we collaborated efficiently. We were given tools and access to admin rights to perform our job. I loved my job while I was there. Was carried over under Denali Advanced Integration.
good,I have depended on officeteam when my children were young and I could not work full time. It provided opportunities without my having to individually seek out jobs.
good,This is a fast paced environment with lots of other people in the room as well.  It felt a bit like a call center type of environment where the cubicles have half-walls so you can see each other.  I really like the upper management.  The camaraderie between management and fellow employees was probably the best part about working here.
good,"I found that there was great communication relationship.They actively sought out the best positions with the skills I had acquired during my career."
good,"Accounttemps provided me with great opportunities, and I have been working with them for 15 years off and one. I can say they were one of the only temp agencies that really went to bat for me."
good,"I am a contractor so I do not have a typical day.  I am hired to fill in for other workers or to do project related work.  These job assignments are enjoyable because I get exposed to new people and new challenges, while experiencing various cultures."
good,"The communication is not great. I have been registered with them almost a year and have yet to be placed on an assignment of any length. I have only had a day here, a day there assignments that have been less than my required salary."
good,It is a temporary staffing agency. I can't rate them per se but I liked the assignments that they provided for me. They have a reasonable amount of opportunities.
good,"Fast paced job, lots of competition between employees, I learned a lot about the job market and what employers look for, poor work life balance but there is a chance to make a lot of money."
good,"Do a job in good place and company I will be greatly appreciated for the indeed results I reach the company "
good,"One of many staffing agencies, but I personally feel some disconnect with the recruiters and myself - I'm not sure what it's about but I don't get much feedback on any critical behavior that could be improved.  Also, discovered that recruiters can be go-betweens with the people you interview with, to send thank you notes, which I discovered at other recruiter companies."
good,OfficeTeam placed me in a company that had a lot of turnover for the position. I believe the company I was placed with did not plan to permanently hire the temporary employee at any time.
good,Assisted in placing me in 3 temporary positions which led to a permanent position.  I was not an Accountemps employee but a contractor that would be placed in positions as needed.
good,The position was competitive as I learned how the company’s operations were designed.  It became stressful as I was placed in positions to help or replace positions other employees may have desire d.
good,"The corporations that I was fortunate to be placed with were very pleasant, informative, and well structured. I could sense some struggles from within the management of Robert Half. Those restrictions did, in fact, affect the roles that the counselors played in placing the candidate of their choice."
good,"hardest part of the job was the long hours and short breaks. Need to be focused, very demanding job. Perfect job for serious people who want to find a career"
good,I have taken a couple of assignments through RH.  They have come along way on the way they treat people and the pay and benefits have improved for the better..
good,I am a temp trying to find permanent employment. I have been working with them for four years. I working at a lot of companies but all assignment have been short term.
good,"Hard to get in contact with your personal recruiter. Not many jobs offered in my field. Once your assignment has ended, they don't really try to contact you."
good,Staffing agency that provides opportunity for those that are seeking them. Didn't expect too much other than to work my assignments when they became available.
good,"Was given an opportunity to run a HR department on a temporary basis,"
good,Supported monthly/quarterly financial closing and analysis of results including analysis of variance to budget and forecast for income statement and period-to-period fluctuations in key balance sheet line items.  Prepared weekly/monthly evaluation of excess & obsolete inventory and calculated required valuation reserves.
good,"Long days in factories, stressful, dirty, short breaks, management was horrible, pushy to say the least. Work culture was hostile, hardest part of the job was going to work, most enjoyable was getting off to go home."
good,"They are very competitive, and they try to do there best to find you a good paying job, but they could only find temporary jobs, and i'm looking for something some stable"
good,"This assignment was with a home health care company. Verified vendor invoices, entered into A/P system, matched invoice to check and mailed. Researched variances between actual and budget for financial statement preparation. Assisted clients with inquires."
good,"I worked a 1 year contract for 3 years.  I went through 6 different supervisors and always had to get the new person up to date on my contract issues.  In the end, I was given a suggestion that would allow me to leave my position when I found out the contracted company was going to let me go without telling me.  That, and the volatile atmosphere was becoming very uncomfortable for me.   I took an 8 day sick time that allowed my contract to end per the companies intended end date.  "
good,"Unless your are applying for an accounting/finance position, Robert Half will offer you positions that do not pay according to your experience. I told the recruiter my minimum for a position would be $15 due to my experience. I was offered jobs that only pay $10 an hour. After I declined these low-paying jobs, I did not hear back from the recruiter."
good,"great recruiters, timely placement, fair salary."
good,Great place to work in stressful hiring agency. Lots of stress out people there. Morals clouded. High volume of interviews with no actual placement for them going through long process
good,I was placed right away with a construction company that was very disorganize.  The Supervisor was very rude. I would never recommend anyone to work for this construction company.
good,"A great career for anyone interested in the staffing industry you will learn EVERYTHING and have the ability to shine, IF you work hard, become coachable and put in the hours.  It's a great company and it's not for anyone who is a clockwatcher or interested in finding ways to slack."
good,Met with mangement once. Very flexible hours. Location was a plus. The job assigment was what I love to do. The pay was fair. Good place to find a temp to perm job.
good,Working at the temp agency was enjoyable because they seemed to care for your work experience.  I was placed at nice offices and enjoyed working with their employers who I was sent to.
good,I enjoyed my time at RHI although we were required to report non-financial metrics that were scrutinized closely.  The sales training was top notch and the office energy was high.
good,"My experience was pleasant mostly. They were willing to work with you given your situation. Also, they were able to find a position for me very quickly. However, at times I did get the feeling that they cared more about pleasing their clients than helping their employees. As long as you're pleasing their clients, they were ok with you."
good,"I worked at Robert Half as a salaried professional.  They placed me into a position at a company as a temp.  It was great while it lasted."
good,"As a temp or temp-to-hire company, RH is good at placing staffs. However, my personal experience with RH was not great because they did not place me in the position that is best suited with my experience."
good,"Pleasant staff, Informed timely of changes in the current assignment.  A variety of working environments.  Professional and supportive when questions came up."
good,"It would be a good starter job out of college if they provided better training, but they don’t so this company is ideal for someone who already has some staffing experience. Good job if you like an 8-5, M-F, but difficult to make a whole lot of money over your salary."
good,They work very hard to match you up with the right fit for a position and also the location of the position. They try to make sure you are adjusting to the position as well.
good,"This was a temporary job with Queens Hospital."
good,The jobs where good but i did not like the fact that they were all contracts. i am looking for full-time permenant work. I would recommand them for a entry level person.
good,"Accountemps was contract employer who put people into temporary"
good,"I really didn't work for Robert Half. They are the temp agency that gave me assignments. They placed me at HCMHRSB were I was eventually hired. During the time I was a temp, they were fin."
good,"Very high turnover.  Employees are micromanaged and held to strict metrics.  Very cut throat environment which I guess is typical in a sales environment.  The training, however, was good."
good,"It was great! Work was beneficial, they placed me in great positions. The hardest part was getting let go with temporary work. I needed something permanent and full-time."
good,Robert Half has many divisions in helping someone to get a job whether it's temporary or full time. I mainly worked with Office Team who specialized in the administrative community.
good,I have worked at various sites thru Robert Half.  Learning new skills at each site has helped me to feel more confident with each and every assignment I was placed in.
good,"I was only in that position for 6 months. I really can't give an opinion of account temps, but the company I was employed for through accountemps was very good, too bad it was only a temporary position."
good,"Agents try to get you jobs with desired wages.  Worked with different representatives, seemed to have high turnover.  "
good,"i work as a contractor for robert half.  i  dont know how or what the actual  employee  work life is."
good,"Robert Half sent me to a wonderful company that treated their contract employees, just as they would treat their own employees.   I would definitely recommend them."
good,"Robert Half provided me with temporary jobs.  Was able to learn from various companies different procedures and processes."
good,This position was working for an outside company who is having financial struggles.  Lack of communication between levels of management.  Call it growing pains since company was bought by new owner.
good,"I never truly worked for Robert Half, they placed me at a position where I worked at the company but however was paid by Robert Half. I don't know what to say about them."
good,"This is a staffing agency. They always did their best to place me with a proper match for my skills. Some positions are temporary, some positions are contract, and some positions may become permanent."
good,"Typical placement agency. Lot of promises, little follow-through. The assignment ended early and little to no help by them finding a new project for me and the 150 others on the project."
good,A typical day of business can range from many different roles with Robert Half.  It was a great organization to work with and will continue to work with moving forward.
good,"Temp company, they contacted us all the time to see how we were doing, they dont pay that well, the insurance was not good, it was Lincoln Financial, and doctor I took it to, they never heard of it."
good,you get what you ask for being a temp agency. the people i worked with were knowledgable but they knew you were only passing through. I enjoyed my time with them.
good,This particular place of employment was just a temporary job until I found a permanent one. Doing a lot of different jobs and different places was sometimes a bit overwhelming.
good,"The placement specialists are helpful and supportive, but there isn't consistency in placements, things are set and then they aren't.  Jobs falling through.  "
good,I cant say much other than they just hand out contracts. Thought you have to keep calling them back every other day to continue getting contracts since they dont provide the calling service where they call when they find some thing that meets theyre requirements..
good,Worked as a Accounting Contractor for Robert Half and enjoyed working for the various companies they assigned me.  If I could not work an assignment they would find one that suited me more.
good,"Okay job, but worked in a small market during a bad economy made this job not so rewarding.  Worked there until could find a new job. Nothing really good or bad to say about RHI from employee's perspective."
good,Fun place to work and high energy atmosphere. High sales targets to meet and takes time to create a viable book of business. Great network of colleagues to draw support from.
good,"Professional Services offers flexibility in work assignments but be forewarned that as a salaried professional you do not begin drawing a ""salary"" until your first assignment and if you sit on the ""bench"" between assignments you should be cognizant that like any company, your time not producing billable hours is limited."
good,"Great place to work depending on your department.  Also, there is a lot of tenure at the corporate office which can be good and also be challenging.  My advice is, do your homework and ask the right questions to make sure its the right fit for you."
good,"It’s an okay company to work for. It’s a temp agency, so they place you in a position, they pay you every week which is good.  I would go to them again if I needed to."
good,"Placement counselor had favorites they preferred including pulling temps from other projects to new ones so they dont lose the client. "
good,"This is a great place to get your feet wet with in your local market, networking and navigating amongst decision makers and getting to know skilled professionals."
good,This company is a temp agency which helped me get my foot in the door with my current employer.  Have had no further contact with them since coming on as a permanent employee.
good,What I learned was AccountTemps is a provider of temp opportunities that can lead to permanent job placements.  I went through several jobs until this happened for me.  It worked out well in the long run.
good,The staff at Robert Half work hard to place their employees in the best position acorrding to the needs and skills of the employee. I enjoy working with them
good,Working for Accountemps allows you to work in different industries and environments.  The recruiting staff are generally helpful and try to match your skills to open positions.
good,I had gain many knowledge in accounting from  this company. From a  fresh start new graduated I had learned through this company to become an accounting clerk.
good,good place to start your career in recruitment. they train very well but don't allow for autonomy or deviation in any way to their process which is a constraint to ones ability to succeed.
good,I had enjoyed working through Robert Half Temp. Agency.  I enjoyed that I can have the opportunities to learn other field of jobs and not just Compliance Specialist or Accounting.  I was able to modified the report databased.
good,"Accountemps is a nationally known placement agency for financial profecssionals.  As part of their Salaried Professional Services, benefits are earned proportionate to hours worked and health insurance provided on a pre-tax basis. "
good,all of the jobs I had were very fun and I met a lot of fun people which I wish I could work for them again. Since they are based in West Palm Beach and I live in Port St Lucie there was not a whole lot of work for me.
good,"A typical day at work depends on where your are assigned every assignment is different, I feel you can learn a lot from working through a temp agency because you are allowed to be in several different office settings."
good,I only worked for this company a couple of months but I enjoyed my time there.  Even though I was a temporary employee I was paid half day for holidays.
good,Accounting centered temporary/employment agency. Does good at finding positions for candidates looking for temporary or temp to hire accounting/finance positions. Pay is good but some smaller agencies pay better with less mark up.
good,"Work on a weekly Forecast and respond to ad hoc request from operational managers.  Respond to emails and phone call for operation departments responsible.  This helped me brush up on my financial modeling skills as well my Oracle, Hyperion and Microsoft Office skills.  The culture was an environment that allowed you to offer his or her opinion or thoughts on a situation with an open door policy.  The hardest part was getting some of the operation managers to offer his or her numbers in a timely manner when it came to the weekly forecast that included the balance of the month and a 90 day outlook.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the staff and ability to give your input."
good,They were good at helping you find a job. The office felt a little fat paced hen a office talking to them face to face. Over they were very professional and good at there job.
good,The staff checks to see how things are going and if there is any assistance or questions you may have about the job or company at the time you are working.
good,"There is no special thing to say other than it was a agency that got me job placement. For the most part it had a lot of turn over with hiring managers. The pay varies from job to job, and the location were ok, some of the placement were not the best some was. I would work for them again if the right job came along."
good,ACCOUNTEMPS places employees quickly with employers.  I found that they were very knowledgeable of the medical billing and coding practices.  I learned a lot about their computer systems and the software that they use.
good,"The recruiter's are very professional and nice,  They will go out of there way to do there best in finding a good position.  They Should stick up for their employees though."
good,"I did not work within Robert Half  but what I did not like is the rate that I was paid, I think  Robert Half structure does not give enough to some employees who are representing them in the field."
good,The Capitol Complex assignment was unsafe and hostile and so was the last assignment at Mercer/Marsh when my coworker tried to frame me for stealing checks out of the safe.  I was deliberately sent on assignments that threatened my well-being so I had no choice but to quit.
good,"Occasionally I got a placement that was really pleasant and challenging. It seemed they wanted to place me often in other positions that were not challenging at all. Temp work makes me feel like a commodity - I prefer a ""real"" job."
good,"I am not getting the hours I need to call this good job.  I reached out to the managers, but haven't been given new opportunities.  The pay would be OK, if  there were the hours."
good,Slow paced company that rarely called for IT work.  I mostly moved computers from one location to another.  Maybe worked for them once or twice a month.
good,This was more like a contractor position. You had to call your recruiter and let them know you were interested in working for that week. Sometimes there was work and sometimes not. Pay was OK for the work we did.
good,"Took quite some time to place me in a job. Job was temporary, but the management at the assignment offered another position in the company which also happens to be temporary. Asked the staffing agency for other positions, but have not been lucky enough to land something that may turn into a career. Holding my breath still, but I may turn blue by the time they find something. Keep many other staffing agency options out there is the moral of the story."
good,It was a good temp job placement.  I enjoyed working with the company I was placed with. The Temp agency was good to work with too- they were informative and straight to the  point.  Good people.
good,Worked at different companies doing temporary work. Learned different computer systems and different ways to enter invoices. Was always busy. Always hard to leave.
good,"Everything was reasonable. I worked at Elma Electronic and when I had questions I had the contact information.  My contact changed several times and, sometimes that was the reason I didn't receive an  immediate answer."
good,"By it being a temp agency, I loved going on different assignments and performing different tasks; learning different things and making sure each job was completed; always leaving the client satisfied."
good,I have worked with Robert Half as both an employee and a customer. They have always been professional and did a good job of representing their workforce
good,This is a well known international firm with a solid reputation. Management was supportive and always accessible. That said the competition is stiff in this arena.
good,I enjoyed some of the jobs I got through RH.  Pay was ok but not great.  RH has some good/bad recruiters.   They take a long time to find you a job I would recommend RH to some people..
good,"I was assigned to a company call CCI to assist with their collections. "
good,"Data Entry usually moving data from database to another or updating a current database."
good,"Great place, friendly staff, great manager, good benefits, flexible hours, work from home, good commute, growth advancement, friendly atmosphere "
good,My assignment with Accountemps was temporary though I found them to be a positive company to work for and very willing and helpful in working with their employees to find them positions that best fit their needs.
good,"The most enjoyable part was working with my team of designers, and excellent workplace culture. The most important part that I've learned is not to micromanage your people, let them do their work and get results."
good,Found me a full time job while I was working as a temporary worker.  Kept me up to date on potential and possible job opportunities.  Could always call them if I had questions.
good,My assignments were short term until my last one where my employer wanted to hire me permanently. Going to different companies and meeting different people was interesting.
good,"Quiet proactive at finding you work. Every time I have gone to them, they have been helpful. I did work with the location Director. They are well connected in the area."
good,Worth it if you are in school as a temporary job until you graduate. After school they are slow at getting you into a position to utilize the degree in which was earned
good,"As always working for a temporary agency, you have to be able to be the best you can be to secure employment on a permanent basis. The management team was very informative."
good,The company was good at staffing.  I enjoyed the contract work I did for this company.  The recruiters were very knowledgeable about the positions.  Pay was compatible to others.
good,They are ok for such a big company. I get jobs but the pay was not very competitive. Once I found out that they were not able to pay as much for the same contract that I had with a different temp agency.
good,"The recruiter I have worked with lied to me. Telling me the position was a temp-to-hire position. I discovered that the department, I was sent to work in, was been closed within six months."
good,OfficeTeam places you in great work environments. The cons are the fact that the work is temporary so your job can end at any time. The pay is decent and the paychecks are consistent when working.
good,This is a temporary work agency. They provide a professional  office assistance mainly within the financial field. Individual assignments various according to different companies needs.
good,"Very inviting, find work for me very fast."
good,"The temp service was a great company as far as pay.  They were willing to get me right where I wanted to be.  The only problem is that they don't bother to ask any questions, when something goes downhill at an employer.  They just take the side of the employer and then they don't want to place you somewhere else."
good,"When your client believes you are making double you are really making, that is an issue. The salary should be higher for the contractor and not the recruiter. If they feel they need to charge the client double what they are paying to make a profit, the charge amount to the client should be higher. The contractor needs to have an opportunity to showcase their abilities without the recruiter, allowing the contractor to make the money themselves."
good,"nice pay, slow paced on finding new clients after other positions expire other than management is very professional and nice and are very hands on with in building job resume."
good,"It was a good assignment and the representatives at Robert Half were attentive to my needs as an employee. My assignment was to be for one week and ended up as a 5 month placement. Overall, it was a good experience."
good,"only work a few months, company I was with didn't not have as many orders as they anticipated. hour were 730-veryone was set in there ways so it was hard to input anything positive"
good,"The environment is laid back, but the employees are very diligent and hard working. However managers come and go so often it is difficult to maintain contacts knowledge of upcoming projects, or demands. All in all it's a great place to get your foot in the door starting out your career."
good,"Hit and miss. One time they placed me with a great job, other times, nothing. I suppose it's who helps you get placed with a job. Would recommend to try this agency."
good,good if you want to work temp jobs.  I only worked temp jobs but I would like a permanent job in Information Technology.  Some managers were good others were poor.
good,"Learned a lot , had good experiences. My only complaint is not clear on length of assignments. When you ask they don't have clear answers and you are surprised that you don't have a job to go to,"
good,I enjoyed being an administrative assistant.  However the companies I worked for did not want to hire me permanently. I guess I was what they were looking for.
good,I worked temporary positions while seeking a full-time permanent position in my field.  Robert Half was great at communicating with me regarding available positions.
good,"management valued opinions of employers as absolute disregarding employees needs request comments request and observation"
good,If you are a fast paced worker then Encore is a good match for you.  It is a busy environment with many changes going on daily.  Quick advancement if this is what you are seeking.  Robert Half Agency is an excellent company to work with.  Their staff is kind and friendly.
good,"Good entry level job, very convenient location and unlimited overtime. Fast pace and competitive environment. The management at time seem lack communication. Overall, good place to work."
good,I was transferred to 3 different representatives throughout my time being a contractor for them during a 6 month period. I would receive calls from them about how I was doing at the job while I was on the clock so they should have known what my schedule was I even told them multiple times but they still reached out to me at that time.
good,"Work for almost 4 years with various Companies preforming various functions,  Usually assignment was 6 months to a year.   Enjoyed the flexibility and variety of assignments"
good,"Robert Half is a temporary agency that employed me in Honolulu, Hawaii. They were helpful and supportive. They employed me as a Medical Biller at a pharmaceutical company."
good,"As a Division Director of OfficeTeam you are responsible for you and your team's overall performance.  Performance is weighed weekly by how many temps are on billing and how many hours have been billed.  Teammates can either be on the sales side of the division or the recruiting side of the division.  I was responsible to drive both while ensuring my own individual goals were met.  I specifically sold our staffing services to new and existing clients.  I did this by making at least 100 dials per day and connecting with at least 25 different people per day.  If those standards were not met you were underperforming.   "
good,"I had a wide array of duties, and that wasn't the issue. It was more about becoming a permanent employee. Every job was supposedly ""temp to hire"" but it just wasn't the case."
good,"I could work with Accountemps anytime. The environment was professional once a position ended, they were on top for looking to place you soon after."
good,Just started at my temp assignment and within the second week was told that I have until beginning February 2018 to find a new job as the company I am temping for has hired from within.
good,"Officeteam was a great starter job.  I was given the assignment and just showed up to do the work.  If I had any problems, I called the hiring manager.  If the office had a problem, they called the hiring manager who relayed the message to me.  Assignments were short term.  So I didn't really expect much."
good,"Certified Payroll Professional "
good,I was a temporary employee working short term contracts. I enjoyed working there but I needed more security. I left when a permanent full time position came along.
good,Positon was on a temporary basis. Enjoyed working in a administrative position. People in the environment were positive. Management was supportive.  Benefits could improve.
good,"I haven't worked for this company in years, any review that I could give would not be fair. This company is a temp agency and did a fair job placing me."
good,Robert Half is agreat placement firm to work for.  They took the time to make sure the my placements were a good fit for me as well as the company that I was to work for.
good,"Printed invoices, collection letters & all correspondence	"
good,"The staffing agency is decent. They will help you secure employment quickly and with good companies. However, the jobs will be low paying and temporary."
good,No advancement opportunities or placement guarantees and they never know what is going on. I rarely hear from my recruiter and when I need information he usually does not have it.
good,I was place on an assignment with one of the prominent hotels on Miami Beach in the HR department and enjoyed working with the staff and employees on all levels.
good,"My tenure there was not long and my department was did not interact with any other within the company."
good,"Quality and accuracy of work."
good,"The recruiters were very friendly , and more then helpful on what you need to get a job start your career in the tech world."
good,I didn't work for accounttemps directly I worked for another company thru accounttemps.  The company I was working for was fine it was a temporary position.
good,Temporary position one month. I did not work for this company for long enough. Typically this is a staffing agency and hence I am not sure of what their typical work day is like.
good,I like working for the company for the time that I was there.  Sometimes there was lack of structure/leadership of job duties or tasks. Great opportunities for possible growth.
good,"Management is struggling to adjust their business model to the millennial economy.  Too may senior executives are ""old school"", new perspective needed"
good,Office team is a great company to work for if you like working for a temporary agency. I think the pay could be a little more competitive to the location of employers.
good,Good place to learned about Personal and small business Federal and State Income taxes. As well as  foreigner federal income taxes. The most enjoyable part of the job is the clients.
good,"It is a job - some branches are managed better than others which can tie directly to your happiness. At the end of the day it is a stressful job, but the day you place your favorite candidate on an assignment...it makes it all worth it."
good,"I worked for them 7 years ago; they sought me out and found me a job within 3 days... great experience!"
good,"This was a temporary position that didn't go well. The company where I was placed won't return Robert Half's calls so I never knew when or if my assignment ended. I was just told one morning not to return-no notice, no warning. I was not given alot to do at the assignment so that should have been a clue.  I found that some places resented and/or are threatened by temporary workers. This was one of those places-not Robert Half but where I was placed. Robert Half did what they could in the situation."
good,"The specialists there have a solid grasp of what I offer, and find appropriate roles that march my skills. They know their business and take time to know mine."
good,This company was way too corporate for me after coming from teaching.  They were not supportive and will to help you in order to be better and grow. They were always willing to fire you month to month. No job security.
good,"Good to work for when assignments are available, but there are long stretches with no work.  Very supportive management, but when there is no work there is nothing they can do."
good,"Robert Half is an excellent company, but their continual micromanagement was taxing. "
good,They are very nice and professional but the available jobs were not at the level I had hoped. I did gain some additional experience in some areas but overall somewhat disappointing assignments.
good,I liked that the company gave me the opportunity to work as a Junior Paralegal part-time with not having any experience at all. This was the first job I had working as a Paralegal.
good,"Could do much more for all contractors and provide better pay benefits for their contractors, Pay increases would draw a better more suitable list of personnel."
good,This was a temporary position that was slow paced and relaxed. I was a research assistant that called and asked questions and inserted the information into a database.
good,"My previous contracts through Robert Half were reliable, quality experiences. However, recently when I found myself looking for new opportunities, I have had issues even getting them to reply to my emails despite my having worked with them before."
good,Good place to work while in transition  / in between other positions...helped me land my dream job and a few of the folks I worked with have become true friends
good,"Daily activities include responding to emails, researching loan information, separating insurance mail into categories for insurance specialists, updating non-escrow policy information and processing refund checks and non-escrow policy cancellations as necessary."
good,i have not had any work assignment in a long time. I need a job assignment in customer service and office services associate. they have not had none since
good,"It's a temporary agency and its to be expected that there are inactive periods which can be frustrating.  But, good for when looking for a change from the norm."
good,"If you looking to start to career in recruiting I would definitely recommend this place; however, sales metrics are tough to meet and you better to ready to drink the cool aide....big time."
good,The position I was offered was a temporary position.  That is all that was stated.  I figured I could  get more experience to help me to relocate to a position closer to my home.
good,"it was a reguar day , learned alot of things that I never did before the manager was good the work place had different backgrounds , the most enjoyable was meeting new people"
good,"I know that Office team and Robert Half and Assoc. is a large nationwide company, but my review is only about the Madison Office."
good,"Quiet workplace, nice coworkers the hours were good and the work load was heavy. The hardest thing to do was filing the paperwork. The work place need security but overall it was a great place to work at."
good,The management and staff was very helpful with training me in this job. After learning this one I was able to move to something bigger. We were sad that this assignment had to end.
good,"Unfortunate, I relocated to Las Vegas, Nevada from Illinois with an opportunity to receive but one(1) temporary job assignment....  Recruiters did not follow up with job opportunities."
good,Got assignments not often and it was for a really short period of time. I feel like it should have been at least a 3-6month contract not a day or two kind of work.
good,"Great company for experience and learning new skills without feeling pressured.  They offer training, support and so much more.  The team always thinks of you."
good,"The company is great to work for and have a lot of opportunities in different areas of the country. Depending on the assignment you answer phones, customers and employees."
good,Always stay working and have respect.  Get your task done in a fashion order .keep in good attitude and be reliable to the company. You have good hrs every week as long as your a good worker
good,It seemed like they would just stick you at any job whether you were qualified or not. It is hard trying to contect the recruiters. The assignments are not long enough.
good,"I was always sent out to good clients and a great work environment."
good,Good training if you are getting started in the recruiting/staffing industry. The position is sales oriented which leads to high turnover if you don't hit arbitrary numbers.
good,"Productive with the opportunity to develop my skills and learn new things or take on new projects. Also, provided an opportunity to maintain and develop relationships with various levels of professionals."
good,I started at Wells Fargo with Accountemps as a temporary position and was then hired full time by Wells Fargo.  Everything I said about working for Wells Fargo also applies here.
good,"I worked various assignments for them.  However, once they placed you at an assignment, they stopped working for you.  I loved working for them, but wish they looked out more for me than the companies they set me up with."
good,"I did well at the assignments they sent me out to accomplish. At one time it lead to a full time 5 yr position but when I went back to them, it was very sporadic for a single independent woman."
good,"Feel like 'one of the herd'"
good,"Worked on  Temp Assignment for a variety of companies. No real job security.  Pay was Good but not what I expected for the jobs I was assigned to do.  I would work through them again if asked, and if they followed through."
good,this is a very stressful lifestyle because you never know from one assignment to the next what to expect (i.e. coworkers or the work load itself) the hardest part is never knowing !
good,"while working for RH, i feel that they did not take the time needed in finding a replacement job.  after going on Indeed job site i noticed that there where jobs, but for whatever reason, RH kept giving me reasons that there was nothing available."
good,"reasonably average IT focused temp agency. When I really need work as soon as possible, it is hit or miss if they can come through in a reasonable time."
good,My typical day at work was pleasant and the investment personnel  were great and their need to understand and learn the database topics. I learned how to present topics in many ways to capture everyone's learning style. The managers were very helpful as well as the corporate culture at the University. The understanding how the firm worked and the most enjoyable part of the job is when employees get the material and I can create final project that prove their understanding.
good,"Great team to work with"
good,a typical day with company is like any other company with good people and employers. I  didn't really learn anything new while working with this company
good,"This is a consulting company that staff other companies with employees on temporary terms whenever they are in need. However, the company culture is very much conducive and a good place to work for shorter terms."
good,Robert Half is a great place to find a starter job or a temp job.  They are aware of the places they send you to.  They are concerned about the types of employers they are working with.
good,"Quick to send me on assignment with Fresh Start Bakeries, as an admin assistant.  Time cards were always correct and paychecks were on time and correct.  Worked temp for 5 moths and was placed permanent."
good,set up a sales table in big box retailer. Greet shoppers with a statement that draws them into a conversation and discuss cable and internet needs. management hides behind fixtures and photographs you and customers this is called a coaching experience ie opportunity
good,"Unfortunately I was only working for a short period of time for Robert Half."
good,It's been too long of a time to write a good review. They did keep me working the whole time. They worked around my personal schedule and sent me out on the higher paid jobs.
good,Office team was able to place me on many assignments and one of them was at Johns Hopkins University. I was able to get hire after 3 months.They kept me busy and was always pleasant when i called in for my assignments or any problems i was having.
good,A varied selection of positions and pay rate in the financial industry. The minimum I've earned has been $10/HR. My longest commute to an assignment has been between 25-35 minutes. Direct-Hire is limited to upper level management and executives.
good,The staff is professional and friendly and constant communication with employment opportunities; disappointed not many positions for my experience were available.
good,"I have learned so many accounting duties working with my employer. They post me to different accounting assignments, on one hand, this has enabled me to learn numerous accounting systems, but on the other hand, it makes it difficult to focus on a particular system. My team at Robert Half are hardworking, sustainability is the key to our success with our clients. The management is focused and diversified, our culture is to give our best to our clients. The most difficult part of my work is that, it is unstable because most assignment ends shortly. The most enjoyable part is meeting new people and learning from each other."
good,"If you really love working in Accounting Field on temp basis, this is a very good company to work for. The staff is very friendly. Good recommendation"
good,"Your basic contract house work environment varies between contracted employers."
good,"Not the best place to work, but if you are willing to work hard, you will be rewarded with a lot of money. don't make friends there cause they will only be tempory"
good,"Easy to get a hold of, job placement is okay. Stood beside me when the company they placed me with decided to suddenly no longer need me.  Knowledgeable staff."
good,"AM Team Meeting"
good,"Robert Half is like most staffing agencies, however I feel they do a good job at trying to find compatibility if possible between the employees, and the companies."
good,Job assignments were limited to a small number of employers that under utilized my specific experience resulting in client work that did not challenge my skill set.
good,it was a learning job  you live and learn... but time will change and we all do things so for that reason I will be thinking of or about a new job be there or be not there
good,"Sourced the local area for qualified candidates to fill IT, Network Admin, Systems Admin, Technical support, and customer service related roles for our clients."
good,I started just out of college and was offered the opportunity to go to the headquarters in CA to train.  Recruiting is a very tough business to get into especially right out of school with no connections in the field.
good,"Never kept me busy enough, jobs were not presented correctly so when interviewed I didn't have proper info on job description and expectations.   No follow up on jobs"
good,I enjoyed working for this temp agency.  They were always able to find me work quickly at a pay I was willing to accept.  I would definitely use them again.
good,"RH representative stayed in touch continually seeking feedback to ensure the right match.  Upon placement, checked to ensure good fit. Appreciated candor in job description and individuals to whom I would be reporting.  Will use again!"
good,"Robert half has you come in every 6 months if you haven't been working for them. Even with experience, they will still put you with companies that don't really pay but they're getting paid as well."
good,"Lack of, here in Texas. I loved working for them in California, very consistent and no down time. Here I can't get a call back or even an email. I've tried emailing and calling and I get nothing."
good,Accountemps kept me busy as I was a salary professional employee. I learned different accounting systems from temping at all various companies. Great to elarn.
good,was looking for a long term found this it was temp to hire. loves the coworkers and great place to work all around. but was going though a rough period in life had to leave.
good,This is a temp aency so I worked at different places and met alot of different people. I had alot of diffeent assingments at different places so i learned alot of different things
good,"My recruiter helped place me in jobs that I really enjoyed. She made an honest effort to get to know me, my personality, and where I would thrive the most. She made sure that there wasn't too long of a gap between my contract positions."
good,most of the time the assignments i was sent to were a good match to my skill set. there were times when work was limited and i spent time out of work but most times i would end one and start another right after. the best part about working for RH. is that i was able to gain many different skills and many different fields. The worst part about working for RH is not knowing where my next assignment would be.
good,"was hired temp to perm in 2013, jobs on/off since, had good experiences at temp jobs, is not always proactive in finding next assignment, learned they need to be receptive to people who rely on transit"
good,"If you had a choice as to the area that you would prefer to work in, that would make the job more enjoyable.  The commute can be grueling and time-consuming."
good,"The work environment was good but the work was a temp position, and the contract ended abruptly."
good,I complete all the builds using scripts and practiced techniques that were outline and improved the process while I was there. I had to look after all the QA environments.
good,If you are a hard core sales exec and prefer inbound sales then this is the place for you. The people are great but you have to have a special drive to last here. And I repeat you must love sales and also understand the staffing and recruiting industry.
good,This was my only recruiting position. It was permanent placement for IT during a time when IT hiring was at a stand still. The company shifted me to Accounting and Finance where I was able to produce. Training through Robert Half University was outstanding.
good,I would to have loved to spent more time working for them in other places for them but before I could I went back to working for the school system and did with them more
good,"A temp job was good, but I prefer not to pursue temp employment."
good,I have had several different assignments with Accountemps in recent years. All have been satisfactory as far as the type of work assigned by the specific employer. Management was always fair in their treatment of employees to the best of my knowledge.
good,"Positive atmosphere, management seems fair and approachable, coworkers easy to get along with. The work is interesting and requires one to stay focused on the assigned task."
good,"Really enjoyed working for OfficeTeam, the staff is vey friendly and encouraging,  When they send you to job assignments you fit right in and not feel awkward."
good,I really liked my job and I think they really liked me as they extended my contact HERE is where i had a problem managment is constnatly switching AND it take them forever to get back to me
good,Working for Accountemps was strictly temporary and the pay was decent for temporary positions.  The checks were weekly and the hours were usually full-time hours per week.
good,I worked through Accountemps as a temp worker.  They kept me employed with various temporary position with hopes of getting hired.  It was difficult getting hired on a permanent basis due to a few company's budget
good,I always had a job if i needed one. Although sometimes it was difficult to get ahold of the person handling leads I had been given.  There were several Great  and helpful people here.
good,"This position required a friendly, caring demeanor, proficiency with a wide variety of office   equipment and a keen attention to detail. My responsibilities included:"
good,"great training ground for staffing. If you looking to get into the staffing industry get trained here and leave !! "
good,"meh.  It's straight up contracting.  You get no benefits other than pay.  I was satisfied with the hourly pay but wanted an actual vacation every 12 months and instead got an extra paycheck every 1800 hours, which isn't the same thing."
good,Very easy to deal with the Agents at the Princeton NJ Office.  Website is very user friendly.  Easy to find open jobs on the website.  Wish they would be able to help me find more part time jobs in the location that I need at this time.
good,It was a temp agency. They get you as much work as they can. It can be very slow at times and at times they can have a job for you every week if that's how long the job lasts for.
good,"an assignment, worked for a year and half, the place was average. people were good, long walks to and from my car, but it was necessary, great food, kept busy learned a lot, SAP was a must know but understandable, and can be taught."
good,I enjoyed working at the company I was assigned to work.  My advance job knowledge and experience in accounts receivables and customer service skills enabled me to do the job well without work procedures and training.  I hit the ground running in the position.  It was a short term position (6 weeks).
good,Had been sent on some great assignments in the past. It has been 6 years since I last worked for them so I don't have anything to say good or bad. Don't remember
good,"Recruiters and other staff are easy to work with. they are good about assuring you're capable and qualified for the assignment(s) that they have available; and will not pressure into an assignment that's uncomfortable for you, or beyond your scope of ability and experience."
good,"I was a temp. Not very clear roles and no opportunity for advancement. Fair compensation but it wasn't often."
good,"The staff was very professional and courteous. The compensation is what keeps me away from them. They training resources are great, but the Company is one of the lowest paid employment agencies."
good,"Was fired and they didn't give me a reason why. And I still haven't received my last check. I worked for Auto Finance USA and the supervisor spoke to me like I was a dog, three days of my training class I was in the room by myself then I was thrown on the floor not knowing everything I should have, then they wonder why the turnover rate is so high. I still 8 people work out after a month of working there.  Yet accountemps still hasn't returned my calls or emails. Just sorry and sad"
good,Have lots of temp jobs.....very few temp to hire or permanent.  Staff changes out way too much. I guess they take the best jobs for themselves.  Oh well.
good,"mass email, interviewing, Hr duties, culture was good management was great, pay was low. There was a lot of goal setting involved in the day job. lots of pressure to meet numbers."
good,I was basically doing to temp work on a contract basis through Robert Half Tech. They kept me busy which was excellent cause i needed the money. Positions varied which was nice.
good,The job quality is not always the best but they place you.  Some of the jobs I have been are great and some are not so great.  Accountemps has you work a two week notice even though no job is lined up.  They will not look until you give your notice  If working conditions are not friendly they need to get out while you are still at location.
good,It's a good company to help you to get a job.  That's about it. Nothing else to say.  Nothing else to say.  Nothing else to Say.  Nothing at all else to say...
good,"The recruiters are very professional and friendly. However, jobseekers get so many calls from different offices trying to sell jobseekers a position. Which at first sounds good but once you start working the position(s) you realize it's not a fit. I've learned that the recruiters seem like they really don't  know where to place jobseekers in terms of working for a great company with a great culture. They seem to just want to place jobseekers somewhere so they can get their commission. This is my experience."
good,I really enjoyed working for Robert Half and their client. Using my multi-tasking skills and working with the public has always been fulfilling for me. The workplace culture was good and they had a good management team.
good,"RH works with you to help you develop your career. They were able to help me find my dream job. If you have the opportunity, I'd suggest working with them."
good,I enjoy my job.  I come in I enter and date stamp all mail and checks from vendors. process 50 invoices in to the accounts payable system a day. I process at least 80 expense reports a day and process checks every Wednesday and file them after there completed make sure they have been approve in the vision system. I also do projects for other departments that need helping looking for expense reports. date stamp all invoices and expense reports.
good,This company was good to work with only wish it was more permanent work instead of just temporary work. I did have several good jobs threw the company that lasted 2 to 3 months.
good,"I gained experience doing electronic billing and payment posting, as well as worked A/R. Hardest part of the job was the constant change in procedures"
good,"Company has a great culture, has a real care for it's employees.  Great benefits, compensation and ability to grow with the company.  Good stability and growth."
good,Good contract job worked with great people. Good managers to work with & willing to teach new things as long as you wanted to learn. M-F 8-5 pm were their hours.
good,"They would call when they needed certain specialties or just extra guys.  I would accept jobs when available, usually on weekends. "
good,Very good staffing agency.  They try to keep you working.  Some of the assignments should have paid more because of the job responsibilities and the skills needed.
good,Loved the positions I worked when they had positions available. The position that I worked the longest and wanted to hire me on told me the RH required an outrageous fee that they couldn't afford. So I came to the belief that I would never find permanent placement and moved on
good,"I enjoyed the experience working for Robert Half.  I completed many assignments and gained valuable experience working in accounting, collections, and customer service."
good,"I learned a multitude of skills being a Real Estate Administrator which are needed to perform daily tasks for managing commercial buildings, such as allocating invoices into a accounting system."
good,"At one point my client kept me working less than 10 hours a week, but RHT wouldn't place me with another company because I couldn't contribute fully. I'm placing that one on the account rep and not the company as a whole."
good,I am thankful for Accountemps putting me back into the job market after being laid off for 2 years. The staff was helpful and mindful as to where I wanted to commute to.
good,My experience with Robert Half Technology is that they are pretty decent with finding jobs that are appropriate with your needs. They're not amazing but they are not bad either.
good,I didn't work there long.  Wouldn't put in positions relative to desired position ls.  Helped get me my current position.  Would recommend for new graduates
good,They try to get you back to work quickly. They might not pay you the  rate you deserve. However they will get you back to work. It is an okay company.
good,The team members are very knowledgeable and professional and willing to go the extra mile to assist internal or external customers.  This organization routinely provides relevant and comprehensive training to its employees.
good,Only had one job with them for a few days so I would say IF they temp jobs for you then you will like it if not then it's a waste of time and you would be better off looking elsewhere.
good,I was hired with this company to do medical billing and i enjoyed doing this because of my experience over the years.   i was typing at least 85wpm and 20000 number strokes in 5 minutes.  I did not find anything hard about the jobs except that they were not permanent.
good,This is a placement agency so each job is different and the experience would depend on who you're working with. The last recruiter that placed me did an amazing job with placement and follow up. This has been a positive place during my time working with this company.
good,"I read all the reviews. Sadly, I agree with the entries. I spent an entire morning there. They seemed very nice! The wanted to make me happy, or so I was told. I went to a company that employs a large number of Robert Half people. There is a huge turnover with no training. The job was not as expected. I had to beg co-workers to help me. I survived one year and then was replaced. I never heard from them again. The high turnover is distressing."
good,"Pleasant to work with, attentive, fast with placement. Thorough screening to ensure a good fit in placement--very easy to work with and clear and true to the way they say it will go"
good,enjoyed the work.  stayed busy and i like to work under pressure. Co-workers helpful.   temp assignment but I liked the work. supervisor easy to work with and very helpful to make sure you understand assignment.
good,Agency required several prove it tests prior to placement.  Staff was friendly and extremely helpful.  Beware of going permanent for a job that you really don't want as this agency will not be able to place you somewhere else.
good,This job agency kept me busy with different assignments. I was able to get hired with one of the companies I was assigned to. Accountemps had no problem transferring into my new position.
good,"I worked for an Advertising firm for 14 months as a contractor."
good,"As a temporary employee, the team at Robert Half was quick to find the best suited positions/assignments for me. There were a variety of assignments and although many are temporary, many companies were willing to extend assignments or take me on full-time. Because of the variety, many skills were learned, like filing and handling receptionist duties. The best thing about this company was not needing a degree to fit in. Each assignment meant new coworkers, different services, and learning new skills."
good,Great place for eager entry level  people to get a foot in the door and prove themselves. Definitely a lot of growth opportunity if you are a great people person and willing to put in the effort.
good,This is where I got my start and was introduced to the world of staffing. Here I learned the basics of staffing and recruiting. The manager was a seasoned veteran in the industry and I learned quite a bit from him. The hardest part about the job was the long hours but the most enjoyable part about the job was helping people find a job.
good,Good company to work with if you are looking for employment that has offers a lot of connections with various companies. I recommend them for anyone in between work as well
good,Not very organized.   hated driving to downtown saint louis.  Jobs were scace at the time.   the area down there sucks.  to much violance in the area for me.
good,Good rapport with Accountemps and client. Primarily bringing client up to date on Tax and License reporting for various jurisdictions. Preparing summaries of accounting records for filing.
good,great opportunity to get my foot back into the working world after being out of the job force for many years .  Great people to work for.  Learned how to take payment and how to input it into the computer system.
good,Accountemps is a great temp agency. They found me employment in a timely matter. I like that you get paid weekly. They are available for questions and there is more then one person working on finding you an assignment.
good,"I am very thankful to Robert Half for the experience and opportunity to work for their administrative team, Account Temps division as well as for their Office Team division. Robert Half introduced me to recruiting and I instantly fell in love."
good,"I'm very happy with RHMR, but their job is to help people like me find employment, and that is why I'm giving them a neutral rating.  It would be unfair to rate any of the above categories, as I do not work under their roof."
good,"Temp Agency - I set up a filing system which lead to Leesport Operations Position."
good,This job allowed the ability to educate yourself while doing the work.  The median age was 30.  Worked in varied workplaces.
good,Pay Scale is fair. On call jobs limited due to location. Communication is adequate. Professional organization. Travel time and distance  that is not compensated can be problematic to accepting potential assignments.
good,I am a willing and efficient worker willing to get the job done. I have a wide knowledge and experience in the Warehouse and copy fields
good,They only found me 1 job and the person that did that quit the company and went to work for the state of Indiana. They do not find many jobs for entry level people.
good,"Not a good experience,, did not like the staff, Did not want to work there any longer.  i workd there as a temporary employee"
good,i enjoyed where i was placed from office team the job was easy and i enjoy meeting different people. i did not like how the co-workers treated me because i was a temp.  i was belittled and talked down too and when i reported it nothing was done. i would answer a 6 line phone line and transfer to the correct department. i would receive rent payments and provide tenants with a recepit.
good,"Did not work long for them.  Can only say they found me one position. Otherwise, I have no real time opinion, The position worked for me at a time I was transitioning back into the workforce after being out for a period of time."
good,Typical admin duties - this was my first 'real' job out of college.  There wasn't much to it but it did open doors to other positions. Good first job to have.
good,Great temp agency staff was really nice and professional. Sung was great at working around my schedule and finding jobs that fit my personality.
good,"If you do not have a lot of work experience, they take a long time finding a position for you. I have been with this company for over a year and they have provided me with three jobs."
good,"They dont give out to many jobs, the people that do call though are very nice though. Other than that I dont really know what else to say other than that they are an alright place."
good,"Temp firm specializing in accounting positions"
good,I worked at Robert half for about a year part time it was an enjoyable experience. It allowed me to work at lots of different environments and they worked well around my schedule
good,My position was/is a temporary placement opportunity. I am not very impressed with the placement process. I do enjoy where I work and the people I work with.
good,Great for people that are new to the area. This company will keep you working and the goal is to find you a full time position.
good,Great company but work is not guaranteed.  Lots of travel.  My supervisor was very professional and helpful.  Had a couple excellant assignments where I learned a lot.
good,I have only been assigned short term jobs since retiring from the IRS. They have many satellite offices that specialize in different areas.
good,"I am a full-time consultant for Robert Half for 3 years (and current)"
good,"The people are glad to work and communicate over phone and email.  They discuss the contract terms in an easy to comprehend structure and then email it to you if you decide to take the contract."
good,"A typical day working for Robert half legal staffing,"
good,I enjoyed my job at Lexis Nexis.  I was in a secure building and worked with very nice people.  I wish I could have been hired but they were not hiring.
good,"I have been working for office team for years. I do not like the wage per hour. Other then that its fine. I am tired of temping.I would like a ""Home""."
good,ITs a great temp agency. They definitely make you feel like your part of a great team. Ive worked with them for over a year and have liked where they have placed me. Only con its temp positons
good,Through this agency I have amassed great knowledge to ensure my occupational growth. I have learned all I could from them and I am seeking growth in a permanent position.
good,"Accountemps is an average employment agency, with many candidates and few jobs.  I feel they treated me fairly, but the focus was on their profits, rather than my future"
good,I am not comfortable providing any additional details about this company at this time as it has been many years since I worked for Robert Half.
good,"I had a pleasant time working with my team. As a contractor, the work load was very heavy, and challenging but had lots of help and direction with management. The commute was far but I like the fact that you can work from home 2/days per week,"
good,"I would show up on time and do my work as asked.  My coworkers would be polite and say hello."
good,I wanted to work here full time but they didn't hire me on. Nice people very helpful was able to gain a lot of experience. Building computers setting up end-users and migrating from windows xp to windows 7.
good,"Not supportive towards employees even if you've worked for them for a while. Can't speak for all locations but, the Cleveland office rep I dealt with when I had an incident."
good,Great place to gain work experience and excellent career opportunities; however many positions are only temporary positions and not long term.  I enjoyed my position as an analyst.
good,"Good place to work. A lot of challenging projects. Some people should not be trainers or mentors."
good,"I've mainly worked document review jobs with Robert Half, and felt that I was treated fairly and well compensated. Sometimes the management is a little haphazard but that's the nature of these projects."
good,"I think staffing agencies are good probationary periods to prove your worth to a company. The downside is you may not have benefits, but overall, I love proving my worth and hard work ethic in all of my positions I work."
good,The pay was nice though. They would call while you would be working to see how things were going and you would have to tell them you were in the middle of working. I think sending email would have been better especially if you were on the road at the time of the call. Technically they could be liable for that phone call made.
good,"Customer's were usually rude."
good,Quick and available short-term employment option. Experience multiple employers and experience diverse accounting possibilities. Exposure to accounting practices and procedures from multiple entities dealing with internal controls and compliance.
good,I worked with RHI for a number of years in the Salaried Professional Division. While the projects may be challenging at times the management time who are in charge doesn't have your best career goals.  Your career path can take a back burner to what's best for the company and client.
good,This was a temp agency that I worked for and the people were very professional and polite. I would highly recommend them to others.
good,"Assigned contract was with a company who still used a MRP software from the late 80's. My skill set was more extensive than what was needed. Company was closing it's doors after doing business in San Jose, California for 70 years. Completed the assignment to help out the company transition."
good,My skill set was a bit too extensive for this assigned position. An excellent group of people to coordinate and work with. I followed through the extent of the assigned contract to help them out.
good,"Would rather not comment on this position or the management.  Turn over rate was extremely high and I know the reason behind it all.  I would not go back to that location again, but I would work for Robert Half again."
good,"•	Assisted NYC Department of Education School libraries with updating library inventory. "
good,"I've spent the last several years working in the Salaried Professional Division and have noticed that all of my projects have been in difficult high stress environments except for one. I believe the SP program provides challenging opportunities for individual growth in ones tolerances for complex work environments however the projects aren't always aligned with your skills, which may have a huge impact on your personal career development and goals."
good,"The information I was asked to enter into customer records was not always accurate.  The hours I was scheduled to work varied tremendously, made it hard to adjust."
good,"This company is OK but they put you where they feel they"
good,I worked for Robert Half as a temporary employee.  I was on site with a different employer so my review of Robert Half is missing the Robert Half aspect.  All I am able to say about them is payroll was always accurate.
good,"I was only employed as a temporary employee. therefore, I have no official opinion on their full time benefits or what is like to be an actual employee"
good,The assignment i received were base on my job skills.I was placed at many locations and i was a Customer service clerk Hotel front desk clerk A Receptionist and a Remittance processing clerk i worked at this company for two years.from working i learn to be a receptionist and talked on the phone and transferred calls.also  i answer customers questions.
good,"I was a contractor for this company and being a temp is stressful for me because I have kids and things happen. When those things happen and time has to be taken off, there is no guarantee you will get called for another assignment."
good,"Working for a Temporary agency, you do not know that far ahead when you will be working. "
good,"It is just a temporary employment agency and does its job placing people. I have been on a couple assignments with them and other than that, I don't have much more to say"
good,"Not a good fit for college graduates with little or no office experience, but great for workers with office experience. Entry level candidates might want to start with another employment company"
good,"Everyone gossips at this place. It reminded me of being in a frat house/sorority."
good,We make phone calls to multiple people each day. Seeing if we can get them to be jailbirds and participate in raising funds for the MDA. I've learned many different things. I absolutely love my co-workers. They are my favorite part of the day.
good,"ok. •	Disciplined, accountable and committed to producing quality work in a timely manner; productive in fast-paced, deadline-driven environments."
good,No problems. Found work rather quickly. Co-workers were great. Some of the assignments were a little misleading but it wasn't too terrible.
good,i learned a lot about spread sheet and DME billing. They are okay to work for. They had did seem to fire people who had to take medical leave.
good,I'm sure it was fine. I worked for several companies and the recruiter was very aggressive with gaining me employment when each contract ended.
good,"I feel that I have been overlooked for job opportunities that fit me well, but it seems that what is best for RHI is all that stands.  It would be best if the agents were to really listen to and place candidates on assignments best suited to their rounded out skill sets and not to the needs of RHI.  It limits the individual and seems to ""type cast"" them in positions that may not always be well suited for them."
good,Pay is not comparable to other companies. It really depends what department you work for and what advancement they have. You are able to apply outside your department once you worked in the position for a year. They raises are only 3%. So it takes a while to get an increase in pay.
good,I learned many valuable skills that I still after all these years use on a daily basis in my current position.  I enjoyed working with all of the staff at this position.
good,"The assignments have been okay and the people have been really awesome, but I need a challenge other than constantly being assigned customer service jobs. They need to give me something new with higher pay"
good,"The company was great, but the way Robert Half was not there for you or anything you may have questions about. I would consider employment with them for a short period of time."
good,"I was very happy with Office Team, however they have not had anything in my field.  Therefore, I am currently not working."
good,Worked there completing personal tax returns and other accounting functions. Worked with different accounting and tax preparation.
good,the temp agency offers a lot of jobs but need to do more research with the positions at times but overall a great temp agency. Even and fair work.
good,"they fill my position quickly"
good,"Only if you love audio - its for you,"
good,"Good staff. response to any question was quick, staff was friendly.  Started first assignment within 2 months of original interview."
good,"I enjoyed what I did. I am very hardworking, easy to get along with and dedicated to doing my job to its full potential. Management wasn't the friendliest, did not micromanage but lacked communication skills."
good,"It was a good place to work. I answered phones, filed papers and helped guest/ visiter's. The hardest part of the job was dealing with people who were rude but I worked it out in a understanding manner."
good,"good company to work for, good benefits, great opportunity for promotions, over all it was a great experience. I would recommend them to all of my fellow co workers."
good,"Work various different jobs as assigned, adaptable, different policies at different job sites.  Different co-workers per assignment."
good,"learn new job skills, and provides opportunity to explore other avenues in the it field. Provides a chance to improve communication skills and other technical skill. This helps in future job opening. There is communication with management."
good,Great work-life balance.  Exposure to different industries is good.  The hardest part of the job is having to leave the client.  Each one has treated me as part of the team
good,"They found me a job pretty quickly, but after the contract ran out they were slow to respond to additional work. There seemed to be discrepancies as to what the customer expected and what Robert Haft told me."
good,"Accountemps is all about the client and not so much the consultant. This has always been an excellent company to work for; screening the clients to ensuring positive work ethics. Now it seems as though anything goes! One just never knows what to expect.... Surprises it's a reason for such quick turnarounds...."
good,"The company and the work is tolerable, but the PAY just dont add up.... needs to be Much better !"
good,"Fast working environment, with friendly co-workers. Good attitude with everyone, and very helpful management. Up to date with there contracts with teams and brokers for smooth transitions on new things. Overall a good working environment. The hardest part of the job is when you have some rude customers and trying to get them to calm down and get everything resolved. The most enjoyable part of the job would be the friendly customers you get that are very thankful for what you did for them."
good,"Typical day - varied with contract"
good,Working for many companies and gaining stable knowledge of the day to day processes. I've learned to work harder in obtaining permanent employment.
good,I have had many experiences working at jobs with various office/medical equipment but when I get placed in a job it is always a job the requires the lost skill set I can do.  I have placed in Data Entry position.
good,"Solid company.  Long hours, but if you put your time in and know what you are doing you should be successful!  Can be a bit stressful because a lot rides on if the candidates ace or bow the interviews no matter how much you prep them."
good,Accounttemps division: Very quick on finding openings and matching you with jobs. Quickly solves any issues of payment. Positions are great for learning an industry and trying out new places.
good,there was not enough work to keep the temps busy so that slowed things down and had to get a new assignment. but other than that the people were nice and pleasent
good,since work was thru an temp agency a typical day at work was always different. I learned different procedures with each assignement i.e. some tricks with Word and Windows. The staffing agency was very proffessional and did there best to find work assignments according to your skills. The hardest of the job was learning company procedures in a short time due to assignments were not long term or permanent. at that time liked the breaks between jobs but now looking for something permanent.
good,my co-workers was nice . it do not have hard part of that job there . day usually starts with a briefing and people go to packing and picking after the managers told them
good,I did not work at this company long enough to see how it really was. In the end the actual job was just not what i was looking for. While i was there i can say that i enjoyed the people i worked with.
good,It is a good staffing company =-I still work for them on a contract basis. I just make sure that I keep in touch with them so they know I am available for work...
good,This was an opportunity for me to work with a Hiring agency. My personal contact person was approachable when she was available. Very hard working individuals to find employment for the candidates.
good,Robert Half was great for Short Term Contracts but they kind of fell short when I tried expressing any interest in applying for the jobs that offered me permanent positions.
good,Robert Half is a Company that I would return to & work with again to help increase my skills or experience within the Accounting field.
good,"They try to match you up with a prospective employer according to your skills, education and experience. Sometimes certain employers tend to hire a lot of temps and gradually weed them out and keep the younger, smarter and good-looking ones."
good,Top pay great benefits. High paced environment Great place to work just watch your back because people will steal your business and candidates in a heartbeat.
good,The staff are really nice and hard workers. They work hard to place you in the right job.  This is a great agency to work for.
good,Working everyday is a plus. Robert Half has placed me with a few nice companies in and around the Columbus area. Right now I'm on assignment with a good company and hopefully it will become a permanent position.
good,You'll gain skills you'd need to move in the direction you want to.  I liked the idea of being moved around and gaining skills but a permanent position is ideal for me at this time.
good,"A good temporary company to work for, the company does not keep you busy. Most companies were very prestigious and professional organizations."
good,Any opportunity to work to provide for yourself and family should be cherish. Just know your worth and keep your goals in mind at all times. Just like any company loyalty is not practice.
good,Each work assignment is interesting cause you get to meet new people and work in different locations.  You can learn lot of different experience in workload.  The greatest part you can learn new skills and show off your skills with co-workers.
good,"Good company to work with, challenge work, exciting work, learning new stuff, close commute, flexible working hours, nice office,"
good,"Some days last 20 minutes and others last 15 hours.  It was IT contracting, so it was really random.  Had to drive long distances occasionally to sites, 3+ hours."
good,The people work very hard for you to find you a great place to work. Their staff is very nice and easy to work for. It is a temp agency.
good,"Robert half for the most part keeps you working, but the recruiters are not always helpful. and can't get on the free training site."
good,Normal work day.  Come in early and leave normal time.  Nice group of people.  Very smart at Mohawk.  Many auditors frequently in there from one of the big 4 but they are great as well.  Nothing over exciting but nothing bad.  All in all a good company to work with.
good,I was under the impression that I would work for a great company. They were not that attentive to my needs. I really do not want to say any more.
good,"Worked with Manager to create an investment arm of the company, and managed investment portfolios, reconciliation and was one of the top traders.  I was also in charge of compliance, contract review, and management fee collection."
good,They were all very good to me and stayed committed to me until they found me full time work.  They were very good at finding me the right match.
good,"Great training, benefits and people. Management and overall culture needs work."
good,"Company was ok. Very high pressure sales and they would get mad at you if you took a day off that was not planned.  The coworkers were great, but management was lacking."
good,"These job listings they post on different job boards are basically stock listings to draw in more candidates, it doesn't necessarily indicate there is such a job available. You will never hear about these opportunities again when you sign up with them. I've been with this group for almost year and have been contacted about jobs maybe 4 times. Recruiters are very friendly but are impossible to get ahold of. My advice would be to not rely too heavily on them to help you find a job. Great if you don't mind being contacted out of the blue after not hearing from your recruiter at all for five months."
good,I love what I do.. I come in to work and do my best to help out where ever they need me most... the hardest part is thinking ahead what can I do to improve my work
good,"Enjoyed working with RMC Construction. Was one of my favorite positions. I also, had other position that I enjoyed. Being a receptionist for a shipping company. It was peaceful and pleasant."
good,"The company was good at placing me in jobs that I could handle. I expected more contact from the company. They anly contacted me when they had an assignment for me, I wanted to check every now and then on how I was doing."
good,It was a temporary 2-month assignment that turned to 6 months. Client decided to end the contract. It was a full time 40-hour work week at a health care call center. Teams worked together. Management was decent. Very limited room to grow.
good,They worked great in the beginning always calling and providing me job updates. After a while they became comfortable and was lacking on staying in touch. I would call and leave a million and one vm's and never a call back until after i found a job. The jobs i did work for under this agency were pretty ok.
good,"I have only worked a couple of assignments and at law affirms and other business offices, dealing with multiple phone lines, greeting clients, scheduling clients, assessing others in need of help, and working on Microsoft office 2010. The reason I no longer work there is because school started for a new semester."
good,"Robert Half is an employment agency.  Most job placement tends to be temporary positions and mostly short-term (less than 12 months).  This is based on their client's needs.  Benefits and compensation (paid holidays, vacation and healthcare) are not available until you have minimum of 1500 hours with them, which working full time (40 hours/week) would take about 9.5 months.  "
good,"At first they make you feel great, they get you a job with in 48 hours of signing up and make you feel great like you are  number one!, then after the assignment  is over they FORGET ABOUT YOU."
good,This company never kept me busy enough.  The manager wasn't ever really there to give direction and she had handed off work assignments to others to give me that didn't know the job.  It was a great atmosphere with a lot of people surrounding me willing to learn and grow which was a plus.  I like to be around goal driven people who enjoy working hard for their company.
good,Temporary work at law firm.  Input information from various documents on computer screen pre set up fields.  Good hours.  Helpful coworkers.
good,"Robert Half follows up with their clients, however, they don't do it consistently.  The hardest part of the job is not being able to feel like part of the team because you always feel like an outsider"
good,"They don't try to find you permanent work because they charge the employer, say $18.00 an hour, and pay you $14.00 an hour and keep the $4.00 difference. They have no incentive but to move you from job to job so you can make THEM money. Get it?"
good,Very hard to stay in contact with. Limited follow up once placement and limited placement options. One pro is friendly representatives.
good,"Heavy phones, scheduling customer service. Collected copays assisted by doing necessary administrative functions. Autherizations and referrals when needed. Insurance verification."
good,"This company really kept me busy while I was looking for permanent work, had great communication with my recruiters. They helped me to keep my current skills sharp."
good,"You can learn a lot and RH and if you stick around, you can move to different positions and/or different branches.  It's an okay place to work but it's extremely stressful."
good,"For temporary services, it's ok to work at. It offers experience in the workplace, in some ways opportunity as well and you different professional in the area."
good,"Robert Half Technology was an agency who found me a decent job that was located pretty far from where I reside. I enjoyed the pairing company in which I worked for. However, the work is hard on your eyes due to 36 computer monitors that are blinking in your face constantly waiting for you to make an action on. If you like staying in one place and having minimal interaction with co-workers then look no further."
good,"I was a temp at Codman Square Health from 10 12-04/13. "
good,"Every day is different.  You come in with a plan of attack on you work day and get pulled to do special projects.  On top of my own job, I also train people new people.  The managers do not micromanage.  They help when you need it."
good,Working at Robert Half I've had the pleasure of working with an amazing team of people.  I've learned that team work makes a dream work!
good,A good company but they do not check their employees that are on assignment. I asked for more money because I took on more responsibility and they did not get back with me whether or not I could get more money.
good,This company did a good job of finding job leads.  I have used them at various times in my life and would recommend them to others.  There have been times when I question whether they are being completely upfront/fair about my pay vs. others in the same company doing comparable work.
good,A typical day starts when coordinator assigned work orders/tickets/incident to every tech. Incident tickets sometimes are the hardest part of job. There is a good relationship with co-employees. Most enjoyable part of the job is when there is less work order/incidents.
good,It is one of the good temp agencies to work for. They do place you write away and close to what you are looking for in a career or job.
good,"I did data entry, recorded and audited daily bank deposits, reconciled bank statements, photocopied and filed various financial documents, and contacted vendors and prepared 1099 forms."
good,"Average company could be better"
good,"For the two years that I was contracted at Accountemps, I've had the pleasure of working in different organizations.  I gained a lot of experience in my field."
good,I am very appreciative of Accounttemps for giving me the opportunities to work with different companies and gain the knowledge I did along the way.
good,cannot recall what the atmosphere was like here as it was almost 17 years ago. Temporary placements were fun and frequent.
good,"Overall, it was a fair experience. They call with opportunities sometimes and, with enough determination, you can get the opportunity to try to grow your skills. The assignments are generally pretty short, but it can be great for when you just need to build a new routine."
good,Good for contact/temp work. They kept me busy and were great to work with. The people that I interacted with were always helpful and when I needed to talk to someone there was someone there.
good,It was ok but need more permanent work assignments last 2-3 months and the pay needs to updated for the amount of work done
good,this was just a temp job between two perm positions. I was there for a short period to help transition as a new company bought out this particular client.
good,At T-Mobile I am the inbound-outbound coordinator in the mail room.  I put in the computer inbound packages and out going packages. I make labels for UPS for outgoing.  delivery twice daily. run postage for USPS mail to be sent out.  the employees are a fun group of people.
good,"Some good job opportunities though needed to be diligent and follow up daily with various ""Staffing Managers"" who were on duty to assist with potential jobs opportunities. Received regularly weekly pay when working though most job assignments are temporary and short. Long term assignments were hard to come by."
good,A typical day at work is pretty high stress and full of meeting goals. It was pretty high intensity and not my favorite environment.
good,"Working through Accountemps allowed me to experience working in various types of industries; it was always interesting, and I felt like they always found me jobs quickly."
good,"As a temporary worker at a law firm, I work as a judicial foreclosure specialist for the complaints position. The position is overwhelming due to the high work level, but the job is flexible. It's not job security, and is the reason why I need to apply for a full time position."
good,Robert Half is great at preparing their employees for jobs. I wish there was more contact between the employees and agents for the duration of the assignments
good,I had work that I liked for the most part when I worked for Robert Half.  They were a temp service.  I was never able to get a full time permanent position with them. Which was a little disapppointing
good,In one year I've worked in numerous CPA firms that have allowed me to nurture my skills to achieve business objectives.
good,"First thing in the morning, you would check your emails for any response back from units.  I never worked in the Human Resource Dept, so I did learn a lot about the New Hiring process. Then, you would go into your Zones that are assigned to you and put your information in date order with latest date first and start entering and updating all employee information which includes their merits, promotions, title changes, range adjustments, direct deposits, write-ups, address and name changes with the proper proof and W-4 changes. Meeting deadlines, The hardest part of the job was taking a lunch at a certain time, because once I started on a project, I would like to finish before going to lunch or at least have all my information together in order to meet deadlines a head of schedule. I enjoyed helping others."
good,Very helpful in finding you a position that is inline with your skill set.  Access to several high-end IT industry positions.
good,"This company does not check who they hire out to and I say this because the company I worked for lied to me. They promised things that never came true, and I walked in to a huge battle between on of their employees, and management. this lead my stay to be short lived."
good,There seemed to be a communication disconnect with the client as to the details of the project.
good,"The company I was assigned to was overall good including co-workers and management. I asked several times about becoming permanent, placement lasted 9 months. The job was not hard... data entry of medical documents. I was sad when my assignment ended."
good,Accountemps is a great place for temporary assignments. I have nothing negative to say at all about their business. Positive Comments only!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Very nice people in their office. Not rude to applicants. Wonderful people
good,It was cold an unfamiliar. The people that I worked with were to themselves and did not make you feel like you belong there.
good,"Environment is fast paced and challenging.  However, the culture is more like get in where you fit.  If you do not catch on quickly, you may not be here long.  Management on most divisions are clear and transparent and genuinely want you to succeed.  Other divisions are not 100% with where you stand as part of your development plan and have no struggle giving you the boot.  I enjoy my close team but overall not a great personality fit for me."
good,"While Robert Half was quick to find me a full-time position near my residence, the wages were awful! With the education I had and some experience as well, I figured I would at least be compensated as such. Not at all what I was expecting from a well known agency."
good,I started at JPMorgan Chase thru them in 2000 and I'm still with Chase thanks to Robert Half/Accountemps
good,"Worked in Moyock, Va."
good,they would give me great jobs and good pay. the manager i work with is awesome. They try extremely hard to get you assignments.
good,Fun place to work. Able to see different job environments. A learned a lot from many employeer's assignments.
good,Placement people are great and keep you informed on up coming job that are available.
good,Was quick with the recruiter I worked with years ago. I have been with company since I was eighteen. She took the time to look at all my qualifications and know what type of work I was worth.
good,"Really enjoyed working here but left as I was offered what I thought was a better opportunity. Great leadership (except the Legal BM, she was not very nice), great internal employees!"
good,Lots of opportunities to work in different areas and aspects. Great people to work with
good,It was through a temp agency and I was told it would be till the end of the year and instead it was only for 2 months.
good,This staffing company had great jobs to send individuals too. I enjoyed working there a lot.
good,"Good place to work , you will learn a lot , good training  , benefits ."
good,"Customer Service, helped co-worker with additional training they needed, solicited for new accounts and emails. Used my bilingual skills. Recieved good breaks."
good,they work very hard to get good jobs. liked it for when you are in between jobs
good,"Entered all detailed and confidential information off of client’s insurance application into the Vendor’s website. This allows for phone interviews to be conducted by Vendor (Univita). When necessary will email to Underwriter about certain issues that may arise on a policy in regards to PHI’s (phone interviews). Also entered APS (Attending Physician Statements) orders into system for the vendors, such as Parameds, Westside and EMSI accounts.  Worked with Auto Issue system and AWD systems when processing the orders."
good,Gain knowledge and experience with each assignment or at least  you should.
good,NIce place to work. Quickly to get you placed. Meet alot of great and nice people.
good,At Robert Half I would make about 150 cold telesales calls per day.  I really learned how to project my voice and emotion over the phone.  I learned all about the world of temporary jobs.my co-workers were great in helping to train me as that was pretty much done 100% on the job.  My manager was really down to earth and did a great jobof keeping the team focused.
good,Good for short term assignments. Management was responsive when contacted.
good,Worked for Robert Half on a number of assignments. They have been the best to date at keeping me working.
good,"What was great about Robert Half was they did a great job of keeping you on engagements that would challenge you.  One project you could be closing books, while on another installing MAS 90.  It was a great experience, and am a much better person for it"

good,put me to work during my unemployed period. I appreciate the opportunity here. Now Im looking for a place I can become permanent with good wages and excellent benefit.
good,Robert Half is  a good company but the work was always temporary. I need stability.
good,"A typical day at work would be to fill a requisition that is sent by Fortune 500 clients nationwide. I do a people search on MicroJ, a system that Robert Half uses to store candidate information. When I find suitable candidates that fit the clients requirements, I give me a call. When I connect with the candidate, I ask them if they have FaceTime or Skype capabilities. This is very crucial as I staff nationwide and cannot interview the candidate in person. We use Skype and FaceTime to do a virtual interview and match a face to a name. It helps build a stronger relationship with the candidate. Once I screen the candidate and go through their background and they are still interested in the position, I submit them for that particular requisition. If the client is interested in interviewing the candidate, we are sent an interview request and I set up an interview date and time. I then prep the candidate prior to their interview and give them tips. Once the interview is complete, if the client extends an offer and the candidate accepts. I start the pre-placement process which typically includes submitting the candidate for a background check and drug screen. Additionally, I make sure they are compliant in the system. To be compliant, all of the candidates I-9 paperwork should have been completed in the last 6 months and that their references are completed. If the candidate is not compliant, I call the branch that is closest to them and set up an appointment for them to go do their paperwork. Once this process is complete and the candidate starts their assignment, I follow up with"

good,A typical job assignment would vary from being a receptionist to customer service.
good,"OfficeTeam has given me several interesting assignments, which have allowed me to grow professionally. They are constantly seeking opportunities that challenge me and allow me to stretch my skills."
good,"Changing jobs every few months is quite a challenge. After  interviewing with a potential client, being chosen as the temp they want and actually starting the training process is when you really find out what the job is going to be like. Sometimes you have plenty of time to learn the job requirements they need but the trainer isn't someone that trains well and sometimes the job requirements seem very simple to learn but you find out what you weren't taught after the person training you leaves. It's a bit nerve-wracking when you step into a position that depends heavily on you and you don't feel prepared. However much I enjoy learning new skills I find I miss being part of a company. No matter how nice people are, I am just a temp and not an integral part of their team. The hardest part of this job is that I also don't feel like an integral part of Robert Half either. I don't really have co-workers since I rarely see or meet other consultants. When there is any kind of meeting, there's no real chance of getting to know anyone because the meetings are so few and far between. I don't know if there is any growth potential with this company and I'm uncertain of the job security. It is up to my management team to find me a position but they still have to pay my salary if I'm not working. How long are they willing to do so is a mystery right now but I'm sure I'll learn soon enough."
good,Good working relationships but little room to advance in your field of choice. They have great learning tools for professionals to stay competitive.
good,"This job was busy work for any novice accountant, and I couldn't wait to get out of the office at 5. My work was done by 3:30 pm and then I would try to find anybody in need of help but nope. no one there needed my help ever.

good,"Teamembers from different groups are fairly accessible."
good,"Come in start prepping the food, like mash potatoes, with or without gravy, making coleslaw and mixing/making the sweet tea, butter and bake the biscuits and have them ready to serve. Co-workers were not as friendly or helpful."
good,The management team was awful; but what made it an awesome workplace is the people that I worked with. Those were some awesome people to interact with on a daily basis.
good,"Being a contractor is a constant learning process, as each new company always has a different computer program that they use and must be learned quickly.  Since the positions are usually for maternity leave, vacation cover off or just to assist in catching up on the back logs, its a challenge to keep up with constant change of co-workers, positions, travel and duties expected.  They used to be a lot busier back in the day, but now it seems many companies have found their permanent employees and in office replacements and cover offs.  There are no raises though, and there are no benefits included.  If you pass on a contract that's offered, you may be waiting a very long time  before another one comes along."
good,"Robert Half Legal is  temporary to Permanent placement agency. I recently signed with them in December. The placement that they gave me has now ended, but the company was very inviting and enjoyable to work with, Co- workers are very informative and helpful.

Troubleshooting and repairing laptops, desktops, printers is a regular part of the job, my supervisor would give me a list of tickets (about 10 tickets) and handling complex issues and file extensions, mapping drives, hardware issues and software issues. Mangement style at Robert half is excellent, management is encouraging and helpful. The mangers at Robert half in the I.T department are experienced technician helping and training new techs.

It is exciting to meet people at various companies and do different kinds of work, but it would be better to have more job security in the long run."

good,"Answer phones, process and organize daily mail, organize office"
good,This company helped me grow as a professional and was able to guide me and helped me find a full time position within Wells Fargo.  They looked out for their employees.
good,As stated this is an Employment Agency that conducts interviews for a specific client. The associates that conduct interviews are capable however a great deal of their placement policies are predicated on the applicant being a college graduate. There a no further comments that I wish to include.
good,"I really enjoyed my time with Admail, not because I enjoyed the job itself, the employees are really fantastic people to work and speak with."
good,"A typical day as an office Services Clerk varied. But on most days, I would scan/copy records, deliver and sort the incoming/out going mail. I would also provide other office support tasks such as conference room set-up and back-up reception. I have found that the management and co-workers at most offices are supportive and friendly. The hardest part of the job would be the deadlines the clients would put on large copy jobs. But the most enjoyable part of the job was that some of the firms I have worked for made me feel like a valuable member of the team."

I took them when they wouldn't offer others.In the end I learned from the jobs they assigned and am glad for the opportunity."
good,The assignment I was placed in was a nice fit for my Accounting background.  Didn't have to dress in a suit which was refreshing.  My coworkers were a nice bunch.  It was a small office so everyone knew everyone.

Then calling candidates once you have a job order and matching them with the employer. I learned how to cold call, warm call, be client facing, read resumes, understand how recruiters find worthy people, etc. Management is impressive, they have a lot of passion and everyone in the company has been in the industry for quite some time so they are pretty experienced. The hardest part is getting job orders. It is difficult to get people on the phone if you do not have a direct contact name at a company. The most enjoyable part is the people who work there. Everyone is social and lively and happy to be there, real sales type environment. "
good,"As a staffing professional, the ability to rapidly learn a company's business systems is mandatory, and it is something I have excelled at doing.  The typical day on an assignment involves communications with the permanent office staff to aid in learning the company's needs and expectations.   From there, my time at the company is all about meeting and exceeding the client's expectations.  The most challenging part of this job has been learning new software systems and remembering each client's data entry requirements to make my work seamless.  The most rewarding aspects have been meeting new people and gaining new skill-sets. "

I went for one interview instead of taking the first job they followed through with and one recruiter said that continuing to work with me was questionable. They know you need them more than they need you."
good,They may not pay while in between assignments and they will present you  to potential employers.  Good benefits and lots of potential job leads with internal recruiters all over the bay area.  I moved out of the area so I could not be of service for them.  This is all I can provide at this time.
good,They were quick finding me a job which is key. But full details about how long the assignment would last has left me with doubt. Couldnt get a straight answer out of anyone at RH. Though they are all professional it would be beneficial that all details are fully laid out for the next person to seek out RH's help in finding a job. ALL details including how long before potential hire.
good,"Accountemps is part of Robert Half International. They provide temorary, temp to hire, and contract  positions. They are not too bad. People are friendly, but the response time to inquiries is slow."
good,I like working for this particular company and I learned a lot of new task.  the staff there was very friendly and offered to assist if you asked.  The most enjoyable part of the job was assisting the customers along with the staff.
good,"I rarely have interaction with people at Robert Half. All of my time has been interacting with the client, at the client's offices. I guess this is the life of the consultant. The only interaction I have with people at Robert Half is the weekly paycheck."
good,"Temporary agency until I could find a full time job. For a temp agency, it was a good place to provide income until a full time position could be found."
good,"It is good for me to start to build up career. And I get some entry level  working experience, related to accounting. The rate they pay is fair. However, it needs to take time to secure a full time. Most of job they offer is temporary position,"
good,"It was upsetting to be placed into data entry jobs that did not utilize my college degree, and making the same income as those who had not put for the effort to obtain a college degree."
good,Robert Half is a leader in Accounting and Finance recruiting. The company provides support and adequate training to her employee for free. A good platform to achieve expertise in your field.
good,"Great company, work culture promote employees and offers training."
good,"Worked several assignments for RH, though No assignment in the healthcare industry. Typical jobs were Clerical Front Office and Receptionist positions. Pay was always lower than desired."
good,"I didn't get much communication from my rep, but other than that, it was o.k. This was a good job for me while I was working on my paralegal certificate, though as a temp job, no chance for advancement."
good,I loved the ability to have a level of control of my work/life balance. I could still work in the accounting field and choose my assignments and length.
good,I must say being there almost 2 yrs felt like a lifetime.  They grind you pretty good.  Not sure I would recommend to anyone that has a family as it was overwhelming.
good,I get to review my accounts receivable skills. They said to send email form time to time but they never reply. Maybe they are just busy. still thankful though. As a temporary employee you are not provided a secure benefit. Advisable for starters who would want to gain experience.
good,It is good for someone who is not looking to commit to something permanent.  For the most part the assignments are very good but once you get to the location the description can be misleading.
good,"Office Team is great for when your in between work, especially if you have opportunity on the horizon.  The work can be inconsistent depending on skill sets; sometimes there can be big gaps between genuinely fine work.  It has also helped me polish skills in preparation for other work."
good,"RHMR Offers good consulting opportunities and I was given an opportunity to groom and hone my skills there."
good,"Average placement company, not a permanent fit. Mostly putting out fires for other companies with a real opportunity to advance to higher level positions. In the trenches is there bread and butter"
good,"make collection calls/emails at least 50 touches per day, deal with sales on new jobs or help to contact correct people."
good,"Effectively communicates to a wide range of audiences in both written and oral form."
good,"The client company that I worked for was very laid back, with a fun friendly environment.  Robert Half gave me the opportunity to experience a job task that i'd never experienced before.  It was truly a great Temporary opportunity.  Hopefully they will be able to find me availability soon; that will fit my skills and personality."
good,"It keeps you up to date with your work skills and the profession you're in. You gain experience with the various companies you work for. However, the assigned company may not take you in as a permanent worker due to the fees that Accountemps/Robert Half will exchange you for. Also upon being hired by Accountemps/Robert Half, your pay rate is not the same as being hired by a regular full-time job. Usually your pay is half the wage of what you would be paid at a regular full-time job."
good,I did temporary work through this company some of the assignments were great and some were not so great in the end I was glad to get some accounting experience under my belt. As well as the opportunity to work in some great companies
good,Robert Half is a good stepping stone and gets you in connection with a lot of people in the community which is very beneficial. However you have to be prepared for a cutthroat environment which can be very stressful.
good,Working for the Creative Group opened the doors to a great variety of job throughout Atlanta and got to know people in the industry. I ended up getting hire full-time with a great company through them.
good,"Not given a length for contracts so employees extend them unbeknown to you. This leaves you uncertain as to when or if you'll actually be hired permanently and you continue to receive less pay and benefits,"
good,Great Contract job for their client working in McLean Area. The hours great and I added service desk knowledge to my abilities. It was also a great use of my abilities.
good,"Robert Half was a convenient way to find jobs with friendly people, as long as you don't mind frequent phone calls ""just checking in"" and don't need a quality living wage. They can connect you with plenty of quality employers, but those employers are paying roughly twice as much to Robert Half as you the employee are actually paid. Most jobs pay in the 1$2-14/hour range and don't cover the cost of parking downtown, frankly an insult considering how much Robert Half makes off their employees."
good,"Office Team is a good place for someone who only wants to work occasionally. I want more full time work. At first, I was called often but less now. The jobs which I worked were good usually and Office Team seemed to be ""on my side"" if there were issues."
good,"typical on assignment is pleasant, I learned to be patient with this company and not depend to other assignment inquired about. the management is very nice and pleasure with me. the hardest part about working was them finding other assignments. however, the enjoyable part was their very understanding about you and your personal situations."
good,"They don't micromanage, but it is very competitive.  Great people to work with.  Very number focused but if you show results they don't micromanage unlike other recruiting firms."
good,"I enjoyed working there for just a temporary time, although I did learn as much as I could and received a great experience working there. But I really appreciated that summer job."
good,It's a great place to work for the short time I worked there.  I learned a lot but wasn't given the opportunity for growth.  Definitely had to learn to flexible and adapt to changes.
good,I love the jobs I worked for I feel I did very well but the accounts didn't last and I'm out of work cant provide for my family wish they stayed consistent with the job placements
good,"tough industry that required many hours above and beyond a good work life balance.  compensation is good, PTO was good.  management was suspect at best."
good,My first temporary assignment from here led me to be hired full time.  I would highly recommend if anyone is interested in temporary work. They seem to get a lot of assignments from major law firms that have a periodic back log and do not have funds to hire a full-time employee.
good,It's on and off type work where you will have a job for 3 months and then you're unemployed for a month. It's also very competitive getting selected for jobs. But by far the Creative Group was the best creative staffing agency out of them all.
good,I enjoyed when I started there but the ultimate 800 lb. gorilla in the room was the turnover and the stress to produce.  Management was also turning over and never actually had good local leadership.
good,Robert Half has always kept me employed.  The pay could be better for assignments but it keeps you going and management is great!  I would recommend to anyone with clerical experience.
good,Currently on Long term assignment.  Accountemps takes your needs into consideration and works with potential clients so that there is a good fit for both parties.
good,Morning meetings to go over days objected. I learned that the need to recruiting qualified techs and finding them job placement requires a lot of dedication. Management was very knowledgeable and always their to train the employees.The workplace culture was more like a call center. Sitting at a desk all day on the phone was the hardest part of the job.
good,"It is classic contract recruiting. You make dozens of calls a day and interview candidates ranging in skill sets from data entry to CFOs or controllers.  You learn a lot very quickly, and get a feel for the process of walking new candidates through the on-boarding process with our company and their new companies, as well as explaining the differences in our benefits packages. Additionally, as a recruiter, I had the responsibility of aiding our candidates in professional development and career advice for advancement.  If you are scared of phones or technology, you will not do well here. It requires quick adaptation, and you need to be able to learn on your own as well as use the training."
good,"The assignments were good, but they were few and far between. I had exactly two assignments through OfficeTeam. The first was for two weeks. The second was for one single week. I have more luck finding stuff on my own."
good,working as a temporary employee you are offered a lot of variety and a great deal of experience can be acquired because of the different assignments you work
good,Depending on the office experience you have they can place you quickly and appropriately according to your preferences. Each office location has dedicated workers ready and trying hard to satisfy both the employee and employer's job needs.
good,I enjoy the company. It has allowed me to work in several different industries. I would recommend it for entry level as well as seasoned professionals.
good,"When I worked in this industry is was great you could make a lot of money, then the recession hit and the industry took a dive. It is faced paced and you have to be very organized to be successful."
good,"I worked for Robert Half Technology. The IT portion of the Robert Half temp agency conglomerate. Typical day was to perform all function for the companies you were assigned to. Never heard from the RHT management personally, or been to one of their sites. The most difficult part of job is accepting that you are a TEMP in most cases and your contract can be terminated at anytime for any number of reasons."
good,"Variety of jobs, good work placement, good pay, competative job placement, casual work environment, benefits available, no paid time off, professional work environment."
good,"Answered phones, resolved patients issues. Customer Service, applied any credits or answered questions regarding denied claims. Goal was to make a happy customer."
good,"overall had a great experience at RHT. Good culture, great work life balance, nice management staff, high turnover due to high standards. most of the day was spent on the phone and visiting clients."
good,I did not work for this company I was and still am a candidate. I have worked with this agency for about 5 plus year in various temporary assignments.
good,"Most of the time we accept what is asked of us, and we change,"
good,I wish they were more involved with their employees. Bi-weekly meetings with myself to find out how I am doing with the client and  what is expectation going forward at this site.
good,"Overall, Robert Half is great place to work in an entry level recruiting/outside sales position, or if you are a tenured accountant with a passion for profit. The environment is extremely fast-paced and unpredictable, and you're constantly dealing with the challenges that typical employers face only during the hiring process. Management in my location is good- bear in mind that it is a numbers driven environment, so if you're not of a quantitative nature it won't be the best fit. Workplace culture varies based on location, but I am very lucky to be in one of the better domestic markets. Expect to be just another number for the first year or so until you really get going and get noticed for your productivity."
good,"Job placement are to far for such small pay. Interesting work but, not enough compensation for work. I have enjoyed my placements just to far for pay."
good,"It all depends on your recruiter. Some recruiters make you feel welcomed and encouraged. Others are the complete opposite. The great ones reach out every few days to let you know how things are going so you're not discouraged. Others do not return phones calls, messages, and emails."
good,"The Robert Half Creative Group is a great resource for finding jobs in the video production industry. As an independent contractor for video editing and writing, I feel as though they limit the marketability of my skills and I do wish there were more opportunities for advancement or for placement in a full-time position."
good,Took a temp job at HSBC for 8 months in order to get my foot in the door. Was able to network and meet people which helped me to find a full time position with the company.
good,"This Job I obtain was a good position ,however I did not enjoy the company I worked for. The management was not understanding for personal needs. I Felt like I lost my position with the company because they terminated me without notice. The Temp agency is great the job opportunity was not."
good,"My experience was great.  I don't have anything additional to say."
good,Helpful in securing job interviews and to get your foot in the doors of large corporations. Friendly staff and convenient locations. Good communication.
good,They don't treat applicants great all the time. I was able to get place through their agency based on my job performance. The hardest part of the job is moving around as a temp.
good,It is excellent work if you like to type reports and see and hear depressing things that happen in your county. It also lets you know that your county is not always perfect.
good,A/P Department was outsourced to InfoSync in Tennessee.  This did not provide a stable relationship between management and employees later in the company
good,Very little attention is given to potential employees. Not always genuine concern for their personal satisfaction. Grade people based on their performance in interviews and jobs. Not very caring and understanding of lower employee needs.
good,Its a good placs to work. Keeps you extremely busy at times. Furthers your knowledge and education as a person and worker.
good,Very productive workplace  They were concerned with job placement and steady work..  The placement counselor were very professional
good,Robert Half is a progressive temp company that works to put qualified candidates with companies and give them the freedom to achieve and accomplish  their individual employment goals.
good,"Overall this company is very fair to work for. Outside of a few personal preferences, the work environment has been relatively pleasant. The separation between departments can be challenging at times causing misunderstandings of a representative's responsibilities. All departments run differently, so coverage for another team when out can be a challenge. As an Admin, the separation from recruiter and the administrative roles are very obvious."
good,A typical day at work varies based upon the contract or job assignment but the usual is you collect your mail and review and sort mail then start working. Management was sometimes easy to read while others were difficult. The hardest part of working through the positions were the multiple paths of office politics that may be forced upon you. The most enjoyable part of the job was the freedom gained between positions.
good,"The job assignments are perfectly fine & the people I work with are great. But the so-called management leaves A LOT to be desired."
good,"When they find you a job, things go well. But it seems that their computer system is still in the 90's. Two years seems like about as long as any staff stays."
good,"* A typical day at work is awesome"
good,"Like most companies these days; it seems to be a matter of whether you fit in to the culture of the company versus whether or not you can do the task at hand. I have had at least one assignment from them that actually lasted the full term of the contract, but like most temp agencies; there is little to be said about job security. You can loose a position within a week of being on the job simply because someone doesn't like you, when you ask the recruiter why the most common answer is that the client did not say. I have to say with this company they always pay you on time and most of their recruiters are good about answering all questions and concerns."
good,"I've had 2 placements through Accountemps; 1 lasted longer than expected and 1 was shorter than expected. The placements have been quick, both were within a week of contacting my local office."
good,Large firm with many resources for employment opportunities.  They select jobs that fit your background and do not refer you unless you agree to each referral.
good,"monitoring warehouse transactions for difference's"
good,"When I moved from Michigan I worked temp jobs.  Some were ok some were not so.  "
good,"Got lost in 'Siberia"" complacent 8 yrs 10 mths but a wonderful contracting company to work for.  The banging and clinging all day long as I was able to watch humongous structures put together right before my eyes. ""Oh, that's how that is made.""  Most enjoyable part was kidding with the guys (perfect gentlemen).  Some would get phone calls and I used the intercom because of the noise ""pick up on isle 6"" meant extension 6.  ""Hum"" was the sound given when the Forman came to his work desk to change from his tennis shoes into his steel toe boots.  He would look in my direction up at the big glass window and shake his head at me.  I loved those guys and miss them dearly."
good,"Great company worked there before the economy went down. Very professional environment. Great teamwork Leadership was okay."
good,"i went through robert half (temp agency) to find a job, and the lady i had as a recruiter was not so kind to people and let a guy treat alot of people badly and justified alot of stuff he was doing. i personally would have rather worked at Wells Fargo perm, rather than through a temp."
good,This is a job that gives you experience in sales and recruiting.  Taking the knowledge and move on.  The days can be long and there isn't much room for advancement
good,I learned new computer skills while working at this temporary position.  Each day we performed data entry on a large case the firm was handling.
good,they hire you to go into a company and work as a temporary employee. they hire you very fast right as you apply but after the first assignment you get put on they don't do much to help you find a new assignment
good,They are pretty good at find work for someone. Been a temp worker on and off for several years.
good,Although I have been registered with them since October I have not been working as much as I had hoped.  They do not seem to have as many assignments as I was originally told.
good,"The job was great before management had a change over. In my 3 years their, I had 7 managers, 3 general managers and 2 district managers. And with each change it seemed to get crazier."
good,Worked well and kept contract employees well informed regarding any changes with the contractors work schedule requirements.
good,"From inception the company has been very busy working hard, family oriented, descent management.  Friendly workers."
good,This company is great at placing young professionals in jobs that are commensurate with their degree.  My individual job experience with Robert Half (RHF) was a generally good one.  The pay way great. There were also flexible hours available.
good,"Stressful workplace but great pay. Training available, overtime available,"
good,"I enjoyed working at RHT."
good,"Robert Half is a great company to learn staffing. There is no such thing as a ""typical day"" at Robert Half. I have learned about the ins and outs of staffing. The hardest part of the job is accepting that sometimes you can do all that you can do and it could still not work out in the end."
good,It was a temp agency they call us to work for some one else if the job is to temp to hire and the company hire us so we complete the assignment. and if the company give you laid off you can go to them again and they will find another job or assignment.
good,"I've been with Office Team for a couple of years now. They've been the best temp company I've ever been with as far as the number of jobs they get you. And they're very communicative with their employees - for instance, checking in with you just to let you know they're working hard to get you a job."
good,"I was recruited to work at a certain amount, only to find out that members of another company doing the same job, were paid significant more."
good,"I had some problems with communication for the first month but was able to resolve them. I haven't had much work through this agency. The assignment we were on was ended early by the employer after first being extended as temporary even though we had been advised it was a definite to-hire position. Doesn't seem to be much value in a contract if it doesn't last for the stated time. The staff are all pleasant enough but results are what counts and if I'm not working steadily, not apprised by my agent of the end of my contract, and my contract period isn't fulfilled, it leaves me at a disadvantage as an employee."
good,In the temporary opportunity I have gain the knowledge of the Human Resource field. I have learned hand-on experience to better help my future employer to utilize their human resource to meet their given target.
good,"Good Co-workers, Enjoyed the job, bad communication, Working together helps to make the job easier and get things done."
good,"Very high stress-job but I knew that going into it. It takes a strong mind, good work ethic, and good time management skills. I only wish I had more time to develop there."
good,"Learned more things in Excel"
good,It is a good company to get you acquainted with a multitude of companies in the Atlanta area.
good,"Anywhere from one day to 16 months.  General office duties including data entry, phone work, typing."
good,At first everything was a go after my first assignment things are slow. Maybe my experience I am not completely sure. However I know how the business works. No one extra friendly and helpful. Once you have an assignment with them of course you get all the help you need. 
good,"*  klare Struktur. Arbeitszeit von 08:45-18:00Uhr. Von 8:45-9:00 kurzes Meeting. 9:00-12:00Uhr Clusterzeit (Kaltaquise). Zwischen 12 und 14 Uhr 1 Stunde Pause. Danach bis 17:00 Administrative Tätigkeiten und weiterhin Aquise. Ab 17Uhr Daily Planning."
good,The temp assignments were easy. Had them spread out at different locations.
good,I learned alot about 1099s and occupational taxes. My co-workers were very well trained and helpful. I got to use a new accounting software that I wasn't familiar with at the time YARDI. The hardest part of the job was there was alot of down time after tax time.
good,"I have only had one assignment with this company because I cannot seem to ever get anyone on the telephone with assignment opportunities! It was nice to be paid exactly what I needed to be paid, and all of the people I've met in person there have been kind. The hardest part of this job is the uncertainty, if there are no assignments there is no work for you! In the same light that can come as a relief to be able to decline certain assignments that really aren't your forté. It's also very difficult to get someone on the phone who knows the assignments and who is also willing to call you back."
good,"as a financial analyst it involved a lot more than spreadsheets. It involved handling issues with Unit Of Measure issues that occurred with the system conversion, Contract Price validation within the various tiers, cycle counting and labeling at the actual warehouse and inventory locations."
good,"I worked varies positions for office team. Each require me to interact with employees, and customers and being in front of a computer."
good,Exchange 2010 migration design for the state. I enjoyed the project very much but the billable time was not there. We were waiting on a third party to complete there tasks; every day.
good,"Flexible work hours, low pay compared to other projects. Great team."
good,"most days are a challenge as i am still learning the reporting side of accounting, Have mastered the Journal entries as well as the subledger accounts. Learning the Intercompany accounting made for a greater understanding of some of the reports i currently work with."
good,"I've started not long along for the company. It has a great environment to work for, but so far limited in work assignment"
good,They work and get you the job but most of the time it is something you do not want anyway. It always short lived and under paid.
good,Pay is generally good. I would not want to work for any of their clients full-time.
good,"Great place to work,the people are friendly and they keep you working."
good,Well organized company. Enjoyed working with them. They fit your needs and the company's need. Good match
good,"I felt well cared for by the team. The nature of temp work is such that the pay and security are poor, so having the people at Robert Half rooting to find me the right spot was helpful."
good,"deposition summaries "
good,"RH provides you with the tools to succeed, great resources and the comfort of having a large corporate name backing you.  With the large company comes the bad, you're just a number in the system.  Until you prove yourself or have been there for over 5 years, you're just money in their pocket.  For a large office, there wasn't HR onsite, which should be a red flag.  Not all offices are that way though.  Experiences also vary from what department you are a part of.  Overall, it's a great company, benefits aren't the best, flexibility is wonderful, management is lacking.  If you don't fall into office politics, don't mind grinding it out for 2 years (talking long hours), and focusing on yourself, you can be successful.  They always say not everyone is cut out for the role, anyone can do it, but it will burn you out quickly.  The energetic environment is what drew me in initially, it's since changed, but still a lot of great employees there, with a few bad apples sprinkled in, which management unfortunately doesn't do anything about."
good,"Consulted through Robert Half at the start of my developer career. They were easy going and checked in on me occasionally. Good to work with, would do again."
good,There is a lot of room for growth. This company is big and has a lot of advantages for people with different skills and talents. The company has many locations.
good,Management wasn’t very supportive.  This particular assignment was full of toxic personalities.  Travel opportunity was fun and I did meet some really nice people.
good,"The staff are nice WHEN you talk to them, rare follow-up to check on how things on the job are going.  Not steady work, could not depend on them for placement"
good,A great team of professionals who really try and find a good fit for temporary jobs.  The managers of these positions were fair and friendly and appreciated the work I did.
good,"Good balance between work and personal life."
good,I love working for the company. I dislike the pay and how long it takes you to convert you from temp to perm. For the area and commute you need to get paid more.
good,"Robert Half International has nine divisions that target specific segments of its client businesses. Office Team provides secretaries and receptionists. Account Temps provide accountants with lower level experience, Robert Half Management Resources provide higher level managers, Robert Half Technology supplies contractors for technology projects, Creative Services provides advertising skills."
good,At Robert Half you can pick your hours and places you'd like to work. Good if you are still looking for full time job and need the time to interview.  They do offer full time employment but you must work for them for 3 months.
good,"My review:"
good,Takes some time to get accustom to the culture of been a contractor but you have to apply what was taught about your work culture. Study and keep trying and always ask to be involve about the new tech.
good,They advertise and call you about jobs that never come into view. I just want a job within my job description that is contract to hire like I was told that they could locate for me.
good,It's an okay job but you're usually on edge of waiting for a project and that can be scary because there's not a lot of job security. The pay is low and PTO is minimal. There is also a lot of turnover in the account managers which can complicate things.
good,"Great firm to learn the recruiting business.  Be prepared to have a plan, work it and be managed by your numbers.  Each office at RHI has a different culture so be sure to get a feel as you're interviewing and ask lots of questions about the local leadership team and their expectations."
good,"Loved working my first job they got me, and the second was great, both very, very prestigious companies, but both temp assignments. My next time trying to get a job was more difficult. My recruiter had a position available for me, but I ran into some health issues, which caused  me to delay taking my background check and drug test (mind you, they had all the info from previous assignments), so they let me go. A year later I came back to them, and my recruiter no longer wanted to work with me, and he said I was no longer able to work with them as company. It's was very discerning."
good,It all depends on where you get assigned. Most of the companies that I was assigned to were pretty laid back and acceptable places to work. One Issue that I had was that sometimes they are slow with contacting you about possible contracts.
good,"Robert half is a large temp company, and your profile can get lost in the large staff of placement recruiters."
good,"I enjoyed working at RHT for the first few months, but quickly learned that the management did not care for the employees and thought of each salesperson/recruiter as a bag of money. The bigger the bag, the more that person was exhausted, but if you showed any signs of morality...watch out."
good,"Good employer if you are in between careers, jobs or balancing family life. The staff is helpful and friendly, though can pay better for skills delivered on assignment."
good,"The staff is nice but the communication, follow through and follow up are sorely missing. Seems like they are too busy to accomplish the previously mentioned deficiencies."
good,"In the past Robert Half  in NOLA was booming and popping with contract assignments and temp assignments.  Lately the placement conditions are very poor and very slow, management not striving to meet workers skill set and find placements."
good,"Placed quickly, but wasn't provided any other options that may have been better suited for me. Have emailed recruiter with questions with no response."
good,People are looking for job security.  No one wants to work Temporary jobs months after months then get laid off only to move to another temporary position.
good,"I would love to be busy and called for an assignment more  frequently. When I call in and leave a message it takes quite sometime for that phone call to be returned, sometimes days. Also, at times they have tried to get me to work for less pay which is something I can not afford to do. I am seeking full time employment with benefits and perks."
good,"Strong, global company. Really dedicating resources to upgrade their employee experience, making it more efficient to accomplish the tasks needed for success."
good,"I worked at Office team as a temp employee, I learned to work diligently with others and it advanced my office, customer service and date entry skills."
good,"Great place to work if you like temp to perm contracts  "
good,"I took this job to get experience in my field, but never got enough work to keep it after a while. They offer you a temp job here and there, but usually ended up being less than 20 hours a week of work."
good,"I feel this company could be a little more understanding. I am a single mother and they did not work well with me. Overall, the job i accepted was temporary and was a good fit, but it did not last long."
good,"The company Robert Half sent me to is not together.  The training consisted of listening to recorded audio and training via Skype.  No one to sit down and welcome you to the company, much less hands on training.  I started in February and every week there is something I've done wrong-or something changes. It was a great way to returning to the work force (have been absent for two years due to caring for ailing mother). It is not an assignment I will remember fondly."
good,"New payroll software, crazy busy, management was good, culture was different. Hardest was dealing with new ways of thinking. 99 Percent was enjoyable"
good,"Good company, fast pace. I've gained HR experience. It's a positive work day culture, we work as a team and support each other. The best part of my job is helping candidates find employment"
good,"New program was just introduced to company. In the planning stage all work was manual. CAQH system upgrades in process. Multiple provided enrolled manually. Extensive phone contact with provider, insurance, hospital ,and state/federal agencies"
good,"A typical day is I clock in and I immediatly start taking calls. It would be nice if they let me check my emails before I start my shift. They expect me to get there early to read emails to be ready to go. I get that I should be ready to go, but get to work early to do work before work starts is Uncompensated work."
good,"Robert Half gave me a shot at a contract position which lasted only about a week. I worked alongside a group of technicians at a call center to deploy a number of new micro-tower PC's and re-installed the computer peripherals. Got along great with all the technicians and the leads; but, I wish that there was more technical jobs especially entry-level in Alabama for the recent grads or new individuals who are trying to make a living in the IT field. I hope Robert Half can bring in new clients and new positions in the future."
good,"Robert half like to short change there workers, they are not always honest about the assignment they send you on.  If they tell you your doing AP and they pay you according to that, when you get on the assignment, its a total different job so now you have to call them for more money."
good,"Need to hire different nationality of people.  There are not enough of my kind that work for the company overall, but the place itself is very calm and good atmosphere"
good,"I worked here for 3 months. The work was good, moving files around a vault 3 levels deep. I didn't like that I had to meet a quota of files moved every day.  The work itself was decent and there was a few different things to do in a day, so I never lacked for something to do."
good,"Assignments involved around 20 different companies, for a variety of dates. If the assignment was for more than a couple of days, in the first few days I learned what the job involved, who my co-workers were, where I was to work. Then I did clerical, reception, assisting, secretarial tasks as required.  Sometimes the job involved teaching other temp workers what their tasks were."
good,"it was a long term temporary position at the time it was good for my current situation. You did a lot of independently  work which was good , you were monitored as a group as well as individually for production"
good,"Various job assignments so I get to meet revolving co-workers, duties assigned from data entry, incoming mail, copying, filing, answering phones, etc."
good,"Job is temporary, you may be able to get the temp job to full time employment. i was hired with few temp workers had relation with them. temp job provides you with an opportunity to work with companies and it may lead to full time job."
good,Staff willing and able to work with placement.  Interviews professionally and attempts to place immediately.  I am an associate so I work in various work situations with various staff.
good,If you enjoy learning new skills and meeting new people this is a good place to work.  They also have a great benefits package.
good,"The people are great and they are really trying their best to get you a job, however, they are very 'back the company' not the person."
good,Nice Management and pretty nice work space very demanding and always counting on you to put in 110% which i feel is good i like the fact that they draw the potential out of their employees
good,"Professional and supportive placement personnel. Willing to provide training in several accounting software programs. "
good,I enjoyed my work. It was a very busy job. I had one day to be trained by the person who was leaving. From there the manger trained me. She did not have much time to train me because her job had her busy. I learned the work. I balanced daily and month end.
good,"I enjoy working with the recruiters, they are really nice people and the agency has a great reputation."
good,"Well usually I wait to receive a call or a potential opportunity they currently.  "
good,Helped in the HR department for Red Gold. Was a temporary position when I took it. Was the reason I was recruited to RG Transport when a position became available.
good,"Robert Half Technology the Management is great they do their best to setup work for you. Sometimes you have a lull between roles."
good,"Robert Half turns over $3.8 billion a year. Being part of a new recruitment business has developed my communication and personable skills, which I am now able to use in a transferrable way. My predominant role has been within project services. Developing relationships between myself and the client was crucial to this career, and thus successfully placing candidates."
good,Good company to work for.  Pay every week is a plus.  They can do better on your rates and holiday time.  Management is pretty cool.
good,"Consistently achieved recruiting goals by identifying qualified candidates who were hired for IT, Administrative, Accounting, Customer Service, and other positions for corporate clients."
good,"Searching through papers for important documents"
good,"Accountemps is a great place to work.  The job assignments they send you on might not be the best places to go and you can often be treated as a ""TEMP"" employee which is no fun but Accountemps is quick to make sure that you are treated well and that your job assignments are what you are doing.  I have been sent places where they load a lot of unassigned work on you because no one else wants to do it.  I don't mind doing it but the pay doesn't always match they extra work they pile on you."
good,"I've meet some pretty good people at this job who I am still friends with today but since I was a temp employee, you didn't get treaty fairly at all.  They will have parties right in front of you but you were never invited.  You got invited to eat the left overs. Keep in mind this was a job through Robert Half not Robert Half itself.  They were great the job I was assigned wasn't."
good,Good starting temp job and a lot of choices.  I would at a local school district in the accounting office.
good,"Representatives seldom keep in touch, they talk a good game.  Placements are few and far between, with about 3-6 months of downtime in between.  Compensation is reasonable if you can get placed."
good,I would recomend working for RH if you need temporary employment but don't stop looking for a more permanent position.  There are some good people at RH as a manager stuck his neck out once but the dollar is king and they will act in the best interest of the company regardless of any loyalty or hardwork that you show your clients.
good,"This company was huge in Calgary, and could find me work consistently. The best part was constantly being able to learn new things, and being able to change the job I was working at, I could go to a new place every week if that's what I wanted, and it was nice to know that if the job you were at liked you, they'd ask Robert Half to extend your contract. The worst part, was knowing that if I have a 3 week contract, even if I loved the job, and the person who was being covered while on vacation was coming back, that I would not be able to stay, and would need to start over at a new place."
good,"My experience at RHI has been good simply because I already had prior experience. There are several other technicians I met and supervised whom were trainable for the most part but I met at least two others whom have no business looking for work in this field."
good,As an SPS Professional I am able to acquire new skills and maintain a stable working environment.
good,I enjoyed helping to secure jobs for financial professional in the field.
good,The company was okay.....they did not keep me posted on if the company would consider to hire me on.....
good,"Robert Half was ok to work for, but the company I was placed at was stressful. Shipping parts that were always rushed. Getting parts built that the floor didn't always cooperate with. Management was ok. Not very exciting job. But the pay was good."
good,"I enjoyed working with The Halton Healthcare Services. I worked 8:30am to 5pm everyday. "
good,I had a great staff for support and the opportunity to advance was there. I learned a lot of great things here that will carry on and help me in the future. 
good,Robert Half was an enjoyable place to work. The staff was extremely friendly and supportive of what I was looking for in a position while I was in the middle of a life transition. They were able to staff me at a job I was familiar with and I would definitely work with them again in the future.
good,Just like any sales environment focused on performance and the bottom line.
good,"Long hours, hard working people, great community out reach programs."
good,Robert Half International (RHI) Agents are dedicated individuals who work hard seeking employment for their clients.
good,"robert half has a great staff and i would recommend this temp service expecially if you have a degree, i wish i had a degree then i would see more money in my pay , but over all great place to work."
good,A typical day at work was just doing as I was told and make sure I accomplish all my duties on time.
good,Good Structure.
good,they are not the #1 temp agency in accounting for nothing. this company has national appeal and that is what makes them so great to work for
good,"I liked this job, but there was no job security for me at the time."
good,"Flexible hours, new industry, distance was far, pay rate was low"
good,As a temporary employee you are compensated well however the benefits package is lacking medical coverage
good,"The company was very adherent to the client. As an agent, there was a lot of flexibility as far as scheduling and working overtime when available.  Great company to work for."
good,"my experience was ok,i just wish i had a better result when the job ended, i reached out to them to see if they had anything else available, no one got back to me."
good,I enjoyed working with the recruiters as they helped me find projects that fit my experience and knowledge. There are moments when I will have to wait for a while before being assigned to the next project.
good,"Overall RH has an incredible culture and generally i'd say you'll love the team etc however for many the targets are unreasonable. "
good,It was a great work environment with potential for growth and development. Friendly atmosphere with a great work-life balance. Great place in terms of opportunity.
good,The company gives those without experience to get connected with businesses. I had a tough time finding job placement to due the fact that I did not do an internship. I was able to gain experience in a few different industry which was a great jump start for my career development.
good,"This company is a worldwide company.  The Calgary division is a good size.  They have 2 branches.  Very aggressive on numbers.  If you are not good at sales, you won't last long here.  You have to produce."
good,"It affords you the opportunity to work at different locations in and around the Washington, DC metro area and to get a feel of the position you are seeking. Salary is mostly based on experience."
good,All of the assignments that I have taken on are a temporary basis and a very busy work environment. The work assignments are very short lived. You are not there long enough to gain any experience.
good,"The training in this place is crazy. 13 week program with cold, warm and hot calling. Targets set to be expected to be met at close to the 100% mark. "
good,"It's a good place to start a person's first job, as it is a staffing company that offers various placements. Has contacts with various clients widening the field of opportunity."
good,"Robert Half International's classical structure and hierarchical culture produces both the company's strengths and weaknesses. They exemplify longevity by promoting from within, but they don't provide millennial-oriented office perks that tend to be standard within startup, technology, and innovative companies."
good,The people are amazing. A lot of hard working people. The atmosphere is professional. Management was flexible and super nice. I would recommend Robert Half to anyone
good,"I am currently an employee with Robert Half. I have had several assignments. The biggest issue with them is that they are not getting the full story about the companies they send you to work for. They give you basic information and some times it just is not the truth. They will place you in assignments with the understanding that it is to go permanent and when you reach the 90 or 120 day mark, all of the sudden you are without a job. Sometimes they don't even tell you until you actually get to the assignment and find out its ended."
good,"I liked that they called me within a few days of applying to their jobs and were clear about the pay, hours, and job description. They also work with other temp agencies that called to check in to see what kind of work I was interested in."
good,I had moved to Arizona and wasn't sure if was gonna make my move permanent so I worked temp assignments.  My manager at account  temps always had me working.  He was dedicated and I will always  be very thankful
good,"Worked with company for a short period of time through a referral source from my college, first time working in finance field would go back if I decided to go back into that field"
good,"Work assignments were very short. Typical work day included, data entry, organizing files and scanning Bill's of Laden into data base system to be used by company employees. The most enjoyable part of the job was the work.  The staff were very appreciative of your work and made it known to management and others. Hardest part of the job was not having a longer assignment."
good,I only worked for one week with the company I was placed with as they just had a large order from Morrison's and needed someone urgently until their permanent employee started.  I was told the position would last for 4 - 8 weeks and was disappointed that it was only the one week as the company was a really friendly place to work in.
good,The Accounttemps side of the business does a great job. They return calls and meet with the applicants to get a feel for them. But the permanent side of the business doesn't respond to inquiries at all. I think they are only looking for easy placements and not willing to work for the commission.
good,"Making sure all tasks and duties are in quality standard expectations."
good,"My time at Robert Half was going to be temporary and I knew that from the start.  Unfortunately we (6 of us) finished the non-recurring job much faster that the company had anticipated, so we were all laid off earlier that expected."
good,Exciting ways to introduce my skill set to up and coming and well established corporations with the opportunity for continued learning.
good,"The Accountemps team are great at helping recruits find and obtain assignments in their respective fields that they enjoy and excel at. However, each recruit is assigned to a 3-6 member team. Each team member has their own quota and contacts and it is frustrating to be inundated with multiple job opportunities from different team members who don't necessarily communicate with each other. One needs to be his or her own advocate, since all they care about is getting you in a position so they reach their quota. Be wary of taking the first position they throw at you."
good,They were efficient in placing me in the proper position within a good timeframe. The pay was good. They were efficient in listening to any complaints/concerns and acted to assist in these complaints/concerns.
good,"- On a day to day basis I supported 14 Recruiters/ Staff managers, I answered multiple phone calls for 7 lines of buiness. Managed all customer serivce related questions from candidates and clients. "
good,I check in with them every week for work for the last year nothing has come available for me
good,"They have provided good employers, but have not been working as steadily as I would like."
good,"My assignment at El Paso Corporation was very rewarding, but after layoffs which occurred due to the acquisition by Kinder Morgan, no follow up assignment occurred."
good,"They are only out for themselves. They will not call you, even if you are a perfect fit for a position, they decide who you can be presented to. It is an awful deal!!!"
good,"they kept me working, there were not too many lapses of unemployment"
good,"Extremely busy home health care organization, great experience."
good,It was a great opportunity to be able to work in different office environments.
good,I worked with Wilson Homes through Office Team. It was a very good assignment where I felt I was being used to my fullest potential. Downside: only a temporary assignment with no real offers for a permanent position offered.
good,I like working in contract positions..however it seems limited I. What can happen as far as permanently securing employment...so I am skeptical at times weary .
good,Accountemps hired me as an Accounts Payable Clerk for Regions Bank.  I got to work in the Mortgage Department where I assisted with Mortgage Loan Processing.  This is the first assignment I ever obtained working at a prominent bank.   I learned how to enter data for processing loans.  The hardest part of the job was accepting short temporary assignments and the parking was a few blocks away.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working in the Mortgage Department at a prestigious bank.  The management at Accountemps  know me well and I just know they can be my employer of choice again someday.
good,"One thing I will have to give to them, they do find you great jobs. But they could improve on staying connected to their prospects when needing work. Like once you have completed a contract, it takes them forever to get back in touch with you. I haven't heard back in about 8 months now. All I do get are emails that flood my mailbox everyday. I am grateful for the job that they did get me which paid a lot of money. But they should improve on their connections."
good,"enjoyed Customer Service Representative  on in bound calls, was told 6 to 8 weeks,ended up only being there  only there 4 weeks, temp job completed. Worked Tuesday  thru Saturday 10:00AM to 6:30 PM . had 30 minute lunch and 1 15 minute break. company did work for as temp thru Office team was great. Office team has had no further jobs since. not very helpful anymore."
good,Robert Half is a great company that is very fast paced and demanding (just what I like) if you are ready to work hard and make some good money. This is the place to go. Best Training program in the industry
good,"Very interesting people to do with on a daily basis, management was very productive and hands on, gave good insight, you work typically on game and show nights. worked with great people"
good,"As a salaried professional you are paid for ""down time"" between jobs. The difficulty is in the fact that you play no part in locating your assignments and may have long periods of down time if they can't find another job quickly."
good,"I liked that my job varied, I like switching jobs. However now I would like to belong some where. I want to be part of a team. It was fun jumping into new jobs but I am ready for something different."
good,Office Team is a good temp agency. I've worked with them for 2 years and really haven't had no complaint's. I did a lot of Networking with different companies. The management always kept me inform with assignments that came in. (had a few times no jobs was available) But all in all they treated me good.
good,"I love my manager at Accountemps, "
good,"The job itself is pretty easy, I do records indexing for a small company in my city and the people are very friendly, the work is easy but the only thing that I dislike is the fact that you don't know when you're gonna get hired in. Most temp jobs do a 2 month hire in or a year and at this job, there's been people working there for 3 years through the temp service & then there's no chance for a pay raise. I work and go to school, which I have to pay out of pocket for and the money that I make here isn't making ends meet. I spoke with the recruiter about switching positions and he told me he'd follow up with me in January. They're always posting new job openings on their site that pay more but I'm still waiting to get placed somewhere new....."
good,I hours were from 9;30 to 6:00 receiving calls from the members a and providers requesting the benefits on the Mental Health care from Horizon. I learned that customer service helps individuals with products and familizar them with information. My co-workers were very helpful with me during training and phones. Hardest part of the job was when members were not get the correct information. I am a friendly person getting along with all my co-workers and enjoying being in a enviorment that was friendly and family caring. The job was a challenge but it was worth it people were always considerate in helping when you needed help.
good,"Great for placement company. they helped place me in serveral environments, and finally in a permanent position."
good,"Great management team but compensation doesn't coinside with position responsibilities. Was never explained about holiday pay, sick pay and that their health benefits company/requirements had changed."
good,J'allais dans différentes compagnie pour faire de la comptabilité
good,Days were very structured which produced results.  Required high activity and it you are not a high activity person this will not be the idea job. Job promoted strict accountability by incorporating daily meeting to assign tasks.
good,"Robert Half seems to be a cool place to work; unfortunately, I didn't work for them as long as I'd hoped b/c another job opportunity was on the table. There's not much I can tell you except that I really enjoyed how they calculated paid time off for salaried professionals and the bonuses. I was looking forward to that."
good,"should be mindful if current employees will mesh with new temp ie, bubbly vs reserved"
good,"Typical day would be to count the safes in and start pulling banks from the tils from the previous day. Counting and balancing the tils and safe, preparing the daily deposits, and building the bank tils for the next business day."
good,"While working with Robert Half, Office Team, I enjoyed opportunities to fulfill temp to hire professional staffing needs for various companies around the greater Spokane/Coeur d'Alene area."
good,A typical day at work would be crunching number and balancing purchase orders against invoices. I learned how to research discrepancies and correct them. My co-workers worked like a well-oiled machine. We interacted well with each other and it helped get our jobs done quicker. The hardest part of my job was the commute and the most enjoyable part was the people I worked with.
good,"If your associate likes you, you get plenty of work. They sent me on three different jobs that I kept for years."
good,"I had contract that went well, with multiple extensions. Their communication is inconsistent. Hardest part about the job is feeling like they're not just another temp agency."
good,"A Great place to work for and the people were awesome."
good,You will start as a temp (depending on assignment) and eventually   get a permanent assignment depending on your work ethics.
good,This company is a pretty good company to work for. They really help out on a professional level to see that your resume and skills are matched appropriately.
good,First IT position and loved it.  Learned alot and had to chance to meet some highly intelligent individuals.
good,"A typical day at work is that of the kind of experience you have on the first and last day of a job. You are focused on success in what you are there to do, focused on correctly satisfying your client and completing your assignment with 100% accuracy and on time."
good,I think the employees will be benefited with this company.the employees will get satisfied with their job.the jobs should be hired.the company should get more advanced that no one should complain anything.
good,Through Robert Half partnered with really amazing companies to provide support to their group of a professionals in some way or another. Great company to have in your corner scouting positions for you.
good,"This was a temp agency i worked through, it was good to find jobs"
good,worked hard to find jobs kept calling them but always had trouble connecting with them also they were not able to find me the jobs I was looking for and just struggled a lot with them.
good,"Taught me good work ethic and gave me confidence to take my skills into other roles. "
good,Learned different types of business with each position that was available. The employees that I worked with made my days with different companies pleasureable.
good,"Worked for Robt Half for a 3 week contract, and was promised that they would have more work after this contract was over. At the end of the contract, that was it, no more work and never got called for any other work."
good,The staff at accounttemps are very kind and care about how you are doing in your position however they are at the mercy of the client....I was sent to volt power and was only there a week and 2 days the dept I was in was so negative no one was ever happy and apparently i attracted the attention of the wrong person and she is the reason I'm gone....only thing that really sucks is I wasnt able to defend myself since your not allowed to contact the client......I still really appreciate accounttemps and how nice and pleasant they have been to me I dont blame them at all and in fact I'm embarrassed that this happened and worry they wont help me in the future!
good,"Performed duties in office administration."
good,"If you enjoy sales, apply for this job.  Do not apply if you are looking for a true Human Resources experience.  If you work hard, you can make a good living."
good,its a good company to go through to find your next job or ideal job but having to try to get a recruiter to call you back is impeccable. I believe that it was something that I would try hard to fix vs being just another goal to have to go into their office for points
good,Nice company to work for. I enjoyed my experience with RH. They were totally professional and very informative when it came to assignments and job placement.
good,"Job longevity is lacking due to no new contracts being submitted to agency. New talent works hard, but no new assignments have come to me."
good,"Productive place, temporary position for over a year. Worked for Capital Health Systems, Medical Biller, Heavy AR"
good,"Temporary placement, good company placement excellent salary, no benefits. Must report to job assignment on time always."
good,"I was on assignment at Desert Springs Hosptial.  I would prep, scan, and perform qualtiy control on inpatient and outpatient charts."
good,"I have been on this assignment for more than a year.  I enjoy the work I do, but there is no room for advancement and there are absolutely no benefits.  I would love it to become a permanent hire."
good,"The staff was professional and polite, and friendly."
good,"Rate the CEO"
good,a great staffing agency. they have placed me in various jobs where I have always succeeded. the team gets back to you if you ask them questions... I recommend.
good,"I found that the Office Team personnel always found a placement for me very quickly."
good,"No office is loyal to their long term employees . Seems as if office projects are rare at Officeteam. It’s rare to hear from recruiters after leaving voice messages and emails, even when the correspondence is initiated by them.?"
good,"I accepted this position as a contractor, no fringe benefits.  The job was okay but not what was expected as a professional.  Left to work things out as I saw necessary."
good,"Robert Half is a great place to get temporary work for.One has to insist on getting good work and consistently, but it's all about persistence. Most places they'l send you to, will treat temps as second class citizens, and Robert Half can't do much about it. It's great for an in-between jobs situation, but not something permanent."
good,it's a temp agency. know what you are getting into. keep calling...don't wait for their call back. I was told I had a job and then called for the start date only to find I didn't have the job because I wasn't told the start date to begin with.
good,I prefer not to use Robert Half and Accounting if I am looking for full time work.  I feel that they specialize in finding temporary work for individuals.
good,Consulting firm - it is great when they have work for you. You get paid weekly. Assignments can vary in work type and length of time. Most of my assignments have lasted more than one year.
good,"Unfortunately working with employment agencies there is no job security and anytime could you loose the job."
good,I busted my butt for the company I was sent to... only to be unappreciated and taken for granted. I was just the temp... treated like a red headed step child.... by a liar in the office who was the lead clerk... said and made up stuff and of course being she was their employee so of course I was the one who got the boot
good,"I worked mostly in medical offices doing reception work and filing. I learned how to work a centrifuge at the dialysis clinic and how to process the lab draws."
good,built Excel spreadsheets of professional baseball players showing how many times each year they played (worked) in each different state and city for income tax purposes.
good,"At the time I worked for Aspen Pet, they were just starting out.  There was a office and the warehouse.  I enjoyed the job, but hated being micro managed constantly."
good,I worked at Seelye Wright through the temp agency.  I had many problems with working for this company and asked to be re-placed to another job.  They never even tried to place me somewhere else.  I was driving over 70 miles a day for 10.50 an hour and I was working long hours and I stayed there for over a year before I finally found my own job and left the Temp Agency
good,This is a temporary assignment that I am currently working.  New to legal field so I'm learning new things that I have not been exposed to.  Very interesting.
good,"They where more interested in keeping people as temps and not getting them hired. Finding jobs in your experience was difficult,  and your ability to have vacation time and/sick days were no e existence."
good,"Ma derniere experience avec Accountemps etait  superbe, l'environnement de travail etait agreable. Nous travaillons en equipe.Le client etait satisfait."
good,They are the company that hired me on a Family Healthcare Network. They are very professional and were always keeping me in the loop. They work very fast and diligently.
good,"the work is great when there is work, I haven't been called for work in  a few months, and they don't send you on Jobs that are comparable to your experience, and last but not least the compensation for your work is so small."
good,I do not wish to comment  or give  a review at this time. The job was temporary so not much time to give an accurate account of a typical work day or what I may have learned.
good,Its and ok agency but I would rather find a permanent job instead of a temporary job. Also I believe they could pay more than what they are offering..
good,"I wish not to comment on this subject, my focus is to find jobs. If you looking for work this is a good place to work compare to others I sign up for."
good,"The last assignment I had was fun and supportive of a major convention event."
good,My experience at accountemps has been good.  I was placed in a great job that was never intended to be permanent. I loved the work. the company did not hire me.
good,RH teaches you everything you'll need to know about staffing. This is a great place to start your career in staffing. You will have to be a go getter to make it past the first 6 months but it's worth it.
good,"People are very friendly, payments, gathering information, sending out correspondence and letters"
good,"Typical was slow, during inventory and packing. I learned how to do inventory in manufacture setting. My co-worker were very young people who like to play rather than work. The hard part of my job was the down time. The enjoyable part of my job was learning the technique of how to do inventory."
good,Assignment was interesting and I enjoy my co-workers and the customers.
good,"I enjoyed working for Desert Golf & Vacation Rentals and had a great supervisor to work for until the company was sold to Resort Quest Arizona. I lost my job during the buyout, so I would say job security not good."
good,"Office Team kept me working,at a variety of companies, but it's been 11 years since I did assignments for them, I really don't remember much about the personnel."
good,"The culture is old school. Very little flexibility. They do not allow most departments to work from home. The people who are allowed are leads, supervisors and management. They do not care about your personal or family needs.  It's all about company needs. So there is no work/life balance."
good,Evaluated skill set against job requirements and interviewed adequately to determine that skill set even though it was not a claimed skill set of the applicant.
good,"They generally worked with you to find an assignment that fit your background.  If you weren't on assignment, a rep was difficult to get ahold of, you only got to talk to someone if they had a possible assignment for you."
good,"This job was a long time ago.  They placed me at Webster Bank in Waterbury to begin with.  It wasn't a bad job, but it didn't last long.  They did call me back within a few weeks for another job at a different Webster Bank, in the Correspondent Lending Department. This department processed mortgages, from loan processing to funding."
good,I have worked with Office team since 2003. Most of the jobs that I have gotten have been through Office team and I worked at the each company over 4yrs.
good,The training class was unprofessional. The trainness ran the class and were rude. I had given my opinion about the work place. It was a call center and I clearly advised the temp service that I do not enjoy working in any call center.
good,"Flexible, pretty communicative when I could get a hold of someone and always supporting me, took awhile to get a job with them and interviewing process"
good,"They pretend to care, but if you don't benefit you, there the door. Quite a stressful job with little reward/ support from management. Shame really, they preach such a beautiful theory"
good,"Robert Half is an organization that I use between moves to keep my skills and keep up to date in the industry."
good,"Don't have any idea why not.  I have ALL the skills required for the jobs I apply for, but I'm never called.  You would think if you have all the skills they require for a job, they'd call you."
good,"Was accommodating with assignments as needed."
good,"As a temporary staffing company, Robert Half/Office Team is what it is; assignments are dispensed on a temporary basis, so there's really nothing exciting to add."
good,Had to apply for EIN Unemployment Compensation and Withholding numbers for their consumers.  I learned how to do PA 100's.  It was a nice group of people to work for.
good,Accountemps is a great temp agency. I was placed very quickly each time a temp position was up. The staffing manager I worked with was always very friendly and personable. He would always call and review positions with me to make sure it was something I was interested in before submitting my resume to companies.
good,"this was a temporary agency all positions were temp jobs and they employment me to do lots of different type of jobs, clerical and administrative, customer service etc."
good,"It's a temp agency that helps you find jobs. Can't guarantee you the job, but if you keep calling every other day, they, recognize you,  and keep you in mind. They have jobs, but its competitive because there are others who are qualified, so you are in competition"
good,"Learning from the companies as a temporary employee was fun and learned a lot. I worked three assignments and left looking for full time work. If looking for temporary employment, this is the place. Pay was good and people were great."
good,"We do not work with people at Robert Half, only the clients where we are sent to work.  It is not appropriate to review the company as I do not work for them technically."
good,"Depends on supervisor which changes often.  Last supervisor was great but she left and new supervisor has only called about a job once.  The job resume she had was 2 years old.  You have to keep proving yourself."
good,"long waits with temporary position, does not properly pick position that are requested. Unfair salary towards experienced workers. When given position the locations are good."
good,this company is for contract to hire scenarios. if you stay with Robert Half for too long then there is something wrong either with the contract or the employer. the health/dental benefits suck but they are good enough stop gaps until you get hired on full time with whomever you've been contracting for
good,"I loved working here, but I was in the internal business section and there wasn't much room for growth.  If you are looking to get into recruiting, this is a great place."
good,"I was treated very disrespectfully by one of the managers and decided not to work with them anymore. If my complaint had been taken more seriously, I would probably have a more positive view of this company."
good,"I work with Robert Half they helped me find a job with this company that is horrible.  My manager is not a good manager at all she talks down to her ""team"" and it doesn't make me feel comfortable enough to stay there and be permanent"
good,Long term assignments are few an in between. You get penalized quickly if you disappoint mgt or clients. Management doesn't support issues on the job. You get the voicemail after you locked in. Lunch is not always given. Most of the time emergency assignments.
good,"This is a temp agency and like all temp agencies there is no room for advancing within the company. Management was okay to work with but pay was not that great and uncompromising when it came down to negotiating price. It was okay. It was a start, if you need to get a job now."
good,"A typical day at work would be speaking with homeowners about the community pools, clubhouses, etc. Providing administrative support to the Community Manager."

good,"Robert Half has been fine to work for as a temporary agency. However, they provide no benefits and no time off."
good,I over all think Robert Half is a great company. I feel they could make better choices with management with more experience. also let there employees voice there opinion on well needed change.
good,Enjoyed my time at Robert Half. It allowed me to earn income while attending to my special needs son. I live in a pretty remote area & they were able to find positions near my home.
good,"The workplace was full of life, it was never a dull day at ACS there was always something going on. If you don't have enough to eat go work for ACS, because food was always provided especially on the holidays.we laughed we cried we go upset,we met our goals, we were yelled at we were praised at the end of the day everyone we all one big happy family"
good,You can join the company for a year or so.  not good to say for a long
good,Great place to get experience not great with job security. Getting a permanent job is difficult to obtain. They basically own you until about 6 months of full time employment. But its a great company for entry level work.
good,"You work for deferent companies, which give you great opportunities open to learning  more.  I was place with a great company that treated me like one of there."

good,I have been employed by Robert Half for nine months and I don't have anything bad to say about them. Iam not real sure about my future within this company but I hope for the best.
good,"It's an agency, and the work that I do for the creative group is with video production, so I get to do most of my work from home. This makes for great work/life balance. It does make the communication aspect of the job VERY important."
good,Great help for troubled seekers. Friendly and helpful support. Generally good and finding placement withing weeks at most. Good solicitation of feedback.
good,It was okay. I reported to the same individual every day.   Every morning he would give me my duties which were to completed before I left their office that day unless approved to carry over to next day.
good,Robert have is  A temp company.  That's what you do you work temporary positions. I continue to use robert half when necessary. I dont like working for temps but they are ok.
good,The Office Team staff were nice but the assignment I had left a lot to be desired. If you want temporary employment they would be one of the better places to go.
good,Not all positions were competitive. Needs more Direct Hire positions.  Great clients.  Great place for software training.  Great place to get experience.
good,"Having been this business litigation law firm's remote project assistant, no two days were ever alike. From C-level client intake, to international communication, the day-to-day ""typical"" work day consisted of appointment setting for the President, making travel arrangements, booking court translators, maintaining witness/evidence lists, spearheading a complete company database migration to the new system, and usually trial preparation."
good,"I liked that I moved to Boise and within a day I was working. I called the branch a week before I moved, she had lined up two jobs during my interview. I did not like that she manipulated my job choice. Robert Half and my assignment have an on going symbiotic relationship. Robert Half staffs this company, and they are a Vendor for RH. My recruiter gave me false information as to the background and job description to make this job look better than another job opportunity. She is also the point of contact for that branch. I did not like being mislead. But it turned out okay, as I was offered the permanent position for a considerable pay increase."
good,Frequently there was no work available.  Staff did not make an effort to promote you with clients unless you were an exact match. I appreciated the independence that I was frequently given.
good,"Thios job took me around the city, auditing the despots boxes @ each locations. We would start @ 9am and finish @4pm. Checking the names on the manifest to the banks records."
good,Signed on as a part time per diem attorney.  I was looking for more hours after showing my capabilities.  After 18 months nothing has changed.  I had anticipated getting more than 20 hours a week but after one and a half years it is still 20 hours a week.
good,I learned alot with this company as far as an office setting. The environment is very professional and courteous. The hardest part for me at the time was the spread sheets I had to learn how to do. However it was easier as time went on. The best part was the interaction with the management. They were very personable and respectful.
good,I could only say that its a Temp staffing agency and I was able to work for them for sometime If I ever need a temp assignment I will go back to them the only thing they need to work on is the follow ups
good,I enjoyed my schedule and the flexibility of my assignments; training courses; work/life balance and the culture.  Management was family-oriented and understanding.
good,"Robert Half was very good at placing me into a company right away, however in the 9 months I had three different Account Managers. The turn-over of their employees is off the charts."
good,"Worked for them in Houston and San Antonio, TX. Very satisfied with the assignments except they were not consistent and had to look at other options.."
good,It was pretty much a typical work experience to other temporary agencies I've worked with. One assignment was really enjoyable. Another assignment was not.
good,During my time working with Robert Half Staffing; they always were willing to help me out to find a good place to work.  I had great communication with people working there and they help me to find job quickly when I moved from the bay area to Sacramento.
good,"Work was a friendly environment where everyone worked individually as well as a team. I learned numerous aspects of the A/R job duties such as invoicing customers, collecting past due payments, assuring A/R account is up to date. Furthermore, I focused on paying all of the bills the company paid on a weekly basis, assured all vendors accounts were up to date, and did the weekly check run. "
good,"This job was a temporary job so my input is therefore limited other than I was paid sufficiently and on time. However, my manager was friendly and a pleasure to work with."
good,The position varied and so did the work.  One of the positions was not even close to what I was told it would be.  I had no support from Account Temps
good,"Great way to get your foot in the door. Some assignments can lead to direct hire. They offer several divisions to support industry specific companies such as accounting, creative, technical, etc."
good,"Each time I have signed up with Account Temps, I've always found a full time position, whether it was in Orlando or Atlanta.  Will sign up again if I need to."
good,"Robert Half is a staffing agency, this is a great company to work for if seeking experience/entry level position outside of current field. They offer temporary, temp to hire and some permanent positions."
good,Its a sink or swim company. One week you may be doing great and the next week you are on the chopping block. You are only as good as your next sale. There is no work life balance at all.
good,"This was a contract to implement reporting services for the State of California (OCIO). I worked in a unit responsible for reporting and reconciling statistics as a result of Federal implementation of the American Recovery Act (ARRA)"
good,I had no problem getting work when I worked for them.  I never got a permanent position with them but it was ok.  pay was good. I haven't worked for them in a long time.
good,"Great company to go through for higher end temporary work. If you are good at what you do, they will always make sure you have an assignment lined up."
good,"I do not like working temp to hire. It doesn't have any job security which makes it impossible to plan anything for the future. I think Robert Half is good for a temp to hire agency. They treated me well, but on the other hand the company they sent me to made promises that they didn't follow thru on."
good,"Robert Half provides a professional work environment, I have had an overall positive experience with this company. I appreciate the opportunity to work for Robert Half/Accountemps."
good,"A good place to work for as long as no one knows about your personal life or business. Good people, and management. Very east work, nothing hard, all computer skill, and answering phones."
good,I liked the idea of going from place to place. This company took the time to see that I was placed in adequate work environments. Some jobs were better than others. Glad to be kept working..
good,"There work placement process was quick and easy. The payment process was also quick and easy, and the representatives were easy to talk to."
good,Good place to start for someone re-entering the workplace.Allows you to learn new skills in their office to make you more marketable.
good,Provides temporary work opportunities within living distance as well as within moderate pay ranges. The turn around rate from one job to another is quick and reasonable.
good,This is a temp company and that pretty much explains the company. You work there and never know who you will be working with and or the pay. Usually 3 month contracts.
good,"Great people to work with, nice environment, good training - worklife balance however could improve. It was difficult to work 10 hour days every single day while meeting all of the metrics, keeping up with your numbers, etc."
good,Contract position with Evergreen Tank Solutions (transportation company) entering invoices into various company data bases in SAP and various other invoice collection programs. Learned new programs such as RentalMan. Co-workers were friendly. Hardest part of job were the changes in application as the company and clients were in transition mode. Most enjoyable part of job was learning new work and feeling accomplished when work was complete. Contract was initially for three months but lasted almost two years.
good,A typical day at this job is boring. Communication is great. Learning multiple systems. I don't have any hard parts of my job.
good,"Audit daily hours worked, input weekly hours for customer billing, input billing"
good,This is an excellent idea however there were unsuccessful in finding me another position when my position at Dynegy ended due to budget cuts.
good,Immediately available administrative work. Escrow Assistant work when available. It is great to have an agency looking for employment on your behalf.
good,Good assignments with decent pay. Co workers at some job were good people. There were not many assignments that were permenant
good,"I worked within a Housing Association in Gloucester.  I completed Administration work for the team whilst they were involved with doorknocking to obtain votes from tenants for the takeover of council properties."
good,"Robert Half was a temp agency also known as Office team.  A typical work day would look like being put on an assignment related to administrative assistant, which is what my title was.  I've learned to professionally communicate well with the people I've been placed at. Because Office team was a temp agency, I had different short term assignments which required me to moving to different companies and locations.  I worked under multiple  management, which were all great to work with.  "
good,"Since my contract job ended in February, Robert Half has not called me once, has not included me in contract administration positions I am qualified for, nothing. I do not understand why."
good,This was a very challenging experience. I moved around within the department and learned several jobs.
good,I company is great when you are on an assisgnment. But the don't keep there word about calling back. They say they have you in there interest but the client is in there best interest.
good,"Reconciled Bank Statements for My Dentist Companies"
good,"Robert Half is a very professional company, but I feel there are not enough job opportunities."
good,my typical day is doing a lot of customer service work and scaning paperwork. Management was very helpful at times. The most enjoyable partof the job is working with the people
good,I was sent to different companies to work on an as needed basis.  This is a temporary employment agency.  The office personal was great they sent me on nice jobs in a professional environment. Anbd I think the best part of the job was meeting an dealing wth new people and personalities allt he time.  
good,"Work hard play hard environment."
good,"Overall a very good company to work for, however, the managers need to be on the same page and increase the levels of communication along with treating their candidates with more respect and care."
good,-You get called by a Team Office with a job assingment.
good,"A professional Accounting and Administrative temporary to perm agency, if your qualifications meet their standards they will definately find you a job."
good,"This firm gives you a lot of different avenues for success, but at the end of the day it's a publicly traded company and numbers are the only things that matter."
good,"Working for RH was good while it lasted, the assignments the agency sends the employees on aren't always long term so it consist of a lot of changes in the environment."
good,This was a temp position while I am looking for full time employment.
good,Awesome temp service to work for..was able to have work..
good,"Gets you assignments to top companies, which may result in being hired, you can get your current assignment time extended or even more assignments based on your job performance."
good,"Fast job assignments placements, matching my skills and location requirements.  All assignments have been successful, and recommend using the agency to anyone looking for a professional position."
good,My experience working through Accountemps started out wonderful.  The company I was sent to had many problems and too much work for one person to complete in a day. It became very stressful so my assignment ended. This was right after Thanksgiving holiday. Accountemp didnt have anything for me for a week so I took the sales associate job at Goodwill Memphis.
good,"They always get back to me in a very timely fashion, very good at matching skills to appropriate jobs. Weekly Check-ins, another person who acts as go-between you and the employer"
good,"good company, do try to match you with your skills, but still needs improvement on salary depending on travel distance / location."
good,"Sehr höfliche aber distanzierte Kollegen im Einsatort."
good,"I started at the job less than 2 days after the interview. I have worked for this agency extensively in the past. It was a great place to work even though it was contract. I was not extremely happy with the notice they gave me, more hassle for me because of it. I would expect a little more of a  professional attitude."
good,"I liked working here because it showed me a variety of job options that are available in the accounting and finance fields. You got to learn a variety of systems in short periods of time.  This made my ability to learn much quicker. The downside of being a contractor with this company is that you are never sure  when your contract will end, if there is no longer a need for extra people in that position."
good,"My boss seemed to rely on me and I showed I had a up on all my work and kept in touch as we thought we needed."
good,"Working for RHT was a great experience. I was trained and taught the best industry standards. Great energy and incredible opportunity for advancement. Downside very long hours, can feel like a call center, Extremely competitive, hard to work as a team it could be very cut throat."
good,"I do value Robert Half staff in Merrillville, IN during both my assignments they have placed were close to my home and the pay could have been better.  "
good,"I enjoyed my time with Robert Half. The Tucson office is small, but the employees are experienced, professional, knowledgeable, and willing to share that knowledge."
good,"The interview process is quick. I received an email asking me to come in for an interview. We went over my resume and within a few days I had an appointment to meet the client. I was informed of my acceptance from the client within just a few hours of meeting them. However, the client let me go within a months time and it was for a reason that I was never informed of. I felt that was a little unfair, but that is not to be reflected poorly on Robert Half. No one ever reached out to me for another job. This is a temp agency so I didn't expect job security."
good,Robert Half and Associates was a great agency to work for. They provided me with consistent work and most of their positions were potentially permenant
good,"All of the temporary positions I accepted from Accountemps were enjoyable except the last due to not having enough training or tools to enable me to do my job."
good,"I was a temp to hire thru Robert Half so my recruiter at Robert Half was very nice and helpful...."
good,"Normal Temp Agency "
good,"Been working for them about a year. Never had any real issues until I turned down an assignment. Was told that I should take it to remain in good standing. No thank you, I will just go elsewhere where my efforts are appreciated."
good,"They weren't very involved. Once you were assigned, you were on your own. If an assignment ended, or even if they knew in advance, they didn't do much to help place you elsewhere. Huge gaps in communication."
good,I was desperate for work and not finding any jobs that aligned with daycare- Until Robert Half. I got interviewed and hired in a day and started my first posting the next day. I gained experience working in offices (which I had never done before) and eventually got a full time job. I am grateful to the company- I also enjoyed getting to work at a job before getting hired to see if it was a good fit for me.
good,Robert Half has great clients to work with. Once in the door able to gain experience and opportunities for permanent positions. Convenient online submission of time cards and direct deposit.
good,Dynamic program working for a variety of small to big sized companies.  As a consultant there was flexibility to learn in this program and to achieve quickly in the environment considering they make a very good match of one's skills and the client the work has to be filled.  Great experience at the end and fantastic matching.
good,As a job placement firm  Robert Half provided me with a number of very good permanent positions as well as most interesting temporary positions where they could
good,This is a temporary accounting contract company.  I have been placed quickly on another assignment when one ends.  The associates who place me are always in touch and most helpful.
good,This was just for the 2012 election. Since it was during the election it really depended on your schedule. If you had things to do it could be possible that you couldn't vote. Otherwise I suppose you could vote before the start of your shift.
good,They have not found me perm worm only temporary or contract.  They are not interested in my goals.  I spend a lot of time searching for opportunities.
good,Office Team is an Employment Agency. I worked at several Miami area business functions. Office Team provided several work assignments. I worked at several hotels within Miami area.
good,"Recruiters are knowledgeable about various industries, have excellent communication skills, and creative about filling roles. Seem to be more oriented about what client wants rather than the job seeker. Their commission for job placement is higher than other other staffing agencies."
good,This job allowed me to gain the experience i needed to advance.  A typical work day was a lot of paperwork.  The best part of the job is when i get off work.
good,"I had two jobs with Robert Half Office Team. I enjoyed both of them as well as learned from them. The only problem I have is that I am currently not working and haven't been since August 31, 2017. I contact them on a weekly basis but they have no work in my area. I will continue to contact them for work unless I find something otherwise."
good,"When working for Robert Half Tech. I was placed in an environment that was fast-paced, exciting, and a fantastic learning experience. I loved the job, and liked the people I worked with and for. The job was an emergency mobilization to restore computer functionality to a large corporate environment. It was 10+ hours days for two weeks, and it was interesting the amount of knowledge I was able to gain form it."
good,"great if you are looking for temporary work, quick to find job. good attitude. my caseworker was excellent. would recommend highly. very knowledgeable of job market. excellent people skills."
good,Great recruiter great company they are just slow at responding to their agents for client jobs. You have to constantly call them to make sure there is a assignment available.
good,I work a couple of assignment for them they were always their if i had a question about the assignment the people were nice and they were knowledgeable aboutthe assignement or would get the your question answer in a time fashion
good,"Company was clean and tidy. Co-workers were every informative. Training was detailed. Only was there for a short time, but keep busy to allow all invoices to go to corporate office."
good,I enjoyed the support of my fellow employees. I was testing the waters to see if working for a recruiting company as a business development person was for me and it wasn't.
good,"I enjoyed working for this company but would have rather it been a full-time permanent position, what they don't offer.  As a single parent, I needed something more of a ""regular"" job than those of a temp position.  Their ""temp to hire"" status, is not always guaranteed, and weeks or months would go by with no assignments or income."
good,"Great income. No work life balance, not for someone with small children. It is all about the numbers. No respect for a long term employee. A good employee will be terminated even if they have been or are a top produces if they irritate the regional."
good,"Accountemps is a great place to work if you are between jobs. They offer short and long term assignments. However, the transition from temp to perm is longer than anticipated."
good,Providing compensation is something they cannot control.  They and their client have to determine the wage they will pay the temp employee.  Often this is below expectation for the job tasks required.    Management can really improve their contact with the temp while at the job site.  Robert Half does take into account your need to work in a situation that meets your job/life balance; such as working part-time only in a given geographic area.
good,consulted at Robert Half.  They had excellent flexibility and work/life balance.  The compensation and benefits were not the greatest even when I transferred to full time employee
good,"If you are looking to launch your career as a recruiter, this is a great place to learn the basics. Be aware: this is definitely a sales position. If you do not enjoy selling, you wont enjoy the place. Having said that, you can also find allot of meaning in what you do when you are successful in placing your candidates. The company compensates you based on how aggressive you are with your sales. For those who demonstrate a hunger for financial success, this is a place that will reward you."
good,Great place to start and get experience. Fun crew!!! Got along well with everyone in the office. Communication was open and they do listen.
good,They didn't have the best clients and were just looking to make fast deals for quick labor. Turn over at recruiting office and a lot of unhappily placed worker.
good,This company was a good opportunity to get exposure to multiple clerical and customer service related positions. It allowed me to be in control of my job and the positions chosen.
good,"This is a temp agency , I did not have much interaction with the company only the companies they sent me to.  People I worked with were very nice."
good,"This place can allow you to learn from performing different jobs working for different companies. If you are just trying to get your feet wet or find a career, this is the place to be."
good,they got me a job they left me alone after that no follow up and when a problem was reported it was a slow response. and that is all there is to say
good,"Answering phones, handling customer calls and purchases they made in stores, review receipt information, fill out template on Excel to process an order (gift card, reship, or manual refund check or credit card refund), verify customer information, verify ESP (Assure) in formation as well, entering daily cards for catalogs and coupons to be sent out, clean work station."

good,"Extremely friendly agent managers with a day or two between assignments."
good,Great place to work at! Co-workers are the best and are always willing to help out. Love the free lunch we have. In only a little bit of time I have been able to learn so much.
good,A typical day can either be super busy or very slow.  The management is great.  The most enjoyable part is the people that you get to meet.
good,"A great company to work for that looks out for both it's employees, and moreover, their clients."
good,"Management is not run well, managers where not knowledgeable in basic functions of job, such as using Microsoft programs"
good,"Robert Half was good to get my foot in the door career wise. Although their management was musical chairs and cuckoo, I treasure my experiences with them."
good,I have worked here numerous of times on an variety of assignments. In the past I was placed on several assignments as a dependable and reliable client. Good luck for anyone starting out in the Administrative field.
good,"The best part of the job is learning new things to prepare for the future. Everyday Is a new challenge. The hardest part of the job is at times, trying to finish up within 8 hours."
good,"Had me working within 2 weeks."
good,Decent place to work for consulting.  Friendly management.  Quick response atmosphere.  Benefits are not great.  Job placement is iffy at times.  Overall one of the best staffing agencies.
good,Though it is a temp agency and working for them has given me a chance to see different companies and different work environment.
good,"Robert Half, Inc. is a temp agency. This company helps you find temporary or temp to hire jobs. They help you get your foot in the door and gain experience."
good,Youll come across great jobs here however you could have a job one day then not the next due to being a temporary office assistant.
good,"This is a temp/temp to hire company.  At first they were great.  Two of the office staff I conversed with left this branch.  I gave up because I was lied to several times by a replacement, that the positions I would take, were temp to hire, but once working on the job, found out they were not."
good,"N/A- Okay company. Learned technically how to rebotoot systems for clents and customers. Acounting on payroll approval, also Sick pay processing on Micro-J system."
good,I like working; so where I work is always the job 5o ensure customer satisfaction is achieved. The work I do is the responsibility; people is a plus of the job÷ Working to the best of my ability is what I and others do.  This company finds me work; I stay pretty busy.
good,I am very appreciative of having the team work hard to place me on assignment.  Although I believe the clients should be interviewed better before taking the assignment.
good,"As a Temporary Assistant working for OfficeTeam has been great throughout my academic career. My agents have always been very receptive to my needs as a student, and have always offered me some great opportunities to work for during times when I completed my semesters. Office Team is a great temp. agency to work for!"
good,"Great group. Hard working, nose to the grindstone type. Mostly type A. Great training environment."
good,"The company does their best to keep you working, nice to talk to about issues in your life that they are willing to make things better for you like they are doing for me."
good,"Always say yes, even if you don't like a placement."
good,"Good client base, decent rates, but lack of personal attention to career needs."
good,"I do not like working where I am not permanent. So I felt uncomfortable on every assignment. "
good,I was placed within a week of submitting my resume. The bummer is that the position is only 3 days a week and they will not allow me to work a second job with their company.
good,"Robert Half International places professionals in temporary positions. I worked for them for 9 months in Chicago, IL. The representatives at RF were easy to work with and the pay was okay. It was perfect during the recession. The job gave me the time to decide whether to stay in Chicago (they were hit hard) or move on."
good,I am still working with this company.  They have been valuable to me for job opportunities since 2006.
good,"Pokemon is a fun place to work! There are literally toys as far as the eyes can see, which made for a fun working environment."
good,This is a temporary position. Looking more for a full time position

good,"simple, I learned how to manage my work and help others and as far as my co-workers they all were friendly"
good,On site management consulting. Strong placement services
good,"Robert Half Legal is a good place of employment, but is a temporary service."
good,"My case worker was very polite.  Unfortunately, we didn't work together much.  After the one assignment ended unexpectedly, I only spoke to him once and that was it."
good,"logging into the system to enter data from unit # inventory, fuel logs i learn how to communicate better every second with my team have a balance of every detail such as weather and traffic to complete our goal on satisfying our keystone freight co. clients such as best buy,win co etc. the hardest thing i've done in my job is get in between conflicts with the druck drivers when they work in a team and they dont agree"
good,The flexibility was great. The job was good and so were the people.
good,worked customer service and then at TMHNC i worked at different companys and got lots of experience people were great.
good,I worked for many different businesses and learned many different computer programs. When I had an enhanced security clearance I work for a lot of government departments.
good,I received different sites and the jobs were interesting and it seemed like management was willing to make sure you fit the position and had help if you needed assistance. I learned more about companies that I really did not know. Co- workers at the companies generally liked the help they received from us. The hardest part of the job was just only being able to stay temporary but one of the most enjoyable was that you got to learn different jobs.
good,"Business was busy preping paper documents. Keying data into client files. Very insteresting!! Also faxing, and sorting to proper department. Testing for dirting laundry in Bank business."
good,"Not impressed with management at Office Team/ Robert Half in Colorado Springs, Co"
good,"Nice folks to work with, however they are not there for your benefit."
good,Very micromanaged. Little possibilities for transitioning between departments.
good,Mass amounts of exposure to different areas of accounting. The opportunity of working with different organizations helps accountants to establish a solid adaptability skill which will prove to be very important in any professional career.

good,Found me a placement that I loved doing. I enjoyed the contract and was sorry when it ended.  I would like to see more placements via this company rather than others
good,"I've never worked with a temp agency where you not only interviewed with them, but then had to go interview for each temp job you applied for.  It can be extremely frustrating and repetitive."
good,"I have worked off and on with Accountemps several years. They have always helped me in finding temp or permanent placements."
good,They have many contract temp to hire jobs jobs so one is able to locate where they fit.  Good communication during the contract for guidance on how to improve.
good,Good not bad. It was a good opportunity that i exposed to canadian work environment. I learned recruitment practices in canada in non for profit organizations.
good,"This place is ideal if you have little to no experience or little to no prior education. The were timely in helping me find a position but at the end of every day just like any other staffing agency, they will take a cut of every hour that is worked."
good,"Standard staffing company. Most jobs are contract work and are only temporary, but the company you work with is always able to hire you full time if they are willing to make room for you. Some positions are temporary to permanent with a company leading to being hired by the company full time, however these are competitive and hard to get into."
good,"The ways the companies I was placed with, managed their establishments weren't the absolute best. It was very stressful being placed with companies that had absolutely no structure and/or management at the time of my assignments. "
good,"I have always had a good experience working for Robert Half!  You have to keep up with them, but they are always there and trying to help."
good,"Was mislead. Would not have left a full time job for a temporary position. I helped with there busy season, then when it was over was thanked for helping and let go. I thought It was 6 months and they were hiring me full time."
good,"No review at this time.  Job placement agency.  If you only want to work here and there."
good,staff pleasant at Robert Half to help find temp positions. Pay was average but work loads sometimes should have been more pay. I would work contracting for Robert Half again
good,"Active directory"
good,"It is a temporary position until you get hired on. Your job is not secured so you are constantly worried if you will be let go. The benefits are okay, but not the best."
good,Nice company. Take care of their employees. They came in every other week to meet with us and have a raffle drawing for prizes. They are always interested in your life and how things are going.
good,It was only for couple of weeks position. I had to set up computers for students. job includes  like Assisted with network troubleshooting procedures and Ensured maintenance of end user workstations and peripheral devices.
good,"Very pleasant place to work, with the variety of working contract jobs at different locations for different businesses.  Good place to use Excel skills, and Quickbooks Online.

good,Accountemps is a professional placement service. I have been placed in some very good jobs with pleasant professional people in a good working environment.

good,"Report for work in A.M, Start job and progress as needed to best of my ability.  Follow routine as directed and make progress toward daily goal to acheive."
good,"A typical day at work was learning & following through on job requirements, until I learned to work on my own with all the new material. I learned many aspects of accounts receivable, credit card transactions, billing, the company priorities & processes. Management was difficult to communicate with at first, but we figured out a way to get the job accomplished well and proficiently. The workplace culture was great. The hardest part of the job was having to rely on myself to figure out the procedures in which they had previously been done. The co-workers were a great help, as the manager & I came to communicate in a way in which I could complete the job that was required. The most enjoyable part of the job was the people. They were great. I learned new and exciting things about the company & it's processes. I enjoyed this job very much."
good,"Definitely a place to learn a lot and hone skills, but stressful as your product (candidates) are volatile and one client's poor experience with a candidate can completely ruin your brand. love the people but its a high-stress/roller coaster environment."
good,"Temporary staff positions. Great experience to gain and dealing with different positions and companies. Fun, rewarding and greatexperience throughout."
good,It was intended to be a way to get in the door at a Hospital System by moving around as a temp. Instead I was stuck in one place for my tenure there. Coordination there was poor.
good,Great employees and easy to talk with. Enjoyed various assignments and changing clients which allowed for new challenges. You have flexibility with all assignments.
good,I actually liked working for Robert Half. I thought they did a good job of supporting their hired staff not so much for their contract staff. The lady I worked with at RH wasn’t an easy person so my opinion of RH is altered as a result.
good,A solid company to work for if you are willing to put in the work and time. Management takes notice of those that go above and beyond and tries to give them incentives to stay.
good,Good place to for temporary work.  Work is sporadic and having a good recruiter is important.   Do a good job and you will get return calls.  I would recommend.
good,It was a great place to work.  The staff in the accounting department was very friendly and willing to help you complete your task if necessary.  The Manager for the accounting department wasn't a very pleasant or approachable person.  Never knew what frame of mind she was in on a daily bases.
good,Professional in dealing with employees.They can find a job for you fast that fits your needs.Agents are very respectful and nice to deal with.They make sure that employees will be comfortable in any job assignment given.
good,Good company to work with if you are trying to get your feet into the job market but pays too cheap for the cost of living in the State of Minnesota. Worked for 1 year and it was difficult. I was hospitalized and not even a get well card was given. My assignment where i worked the company was great and fun to work with.
good,",Top notch assignments. well organized. Good customer base. everything done by phone or video call for interview. They have long term and short term assignments."
good,"On a typical day I was well respected by my peers with the exception at one employer that I was placed/hired at."
good,"I worked for them about 5-6 months and was then hired directly by the client.  I never had any issues communicating with them, regarding my paycheck or anything else during that time."
good,I worked for Robert Half/Office Team for over a year as a temp.
good,"The most enjoyable part of this Job was meeting new people, and being presented with new work opporunities when in need of work, according to the skill set the was needed.."
good,"The assignment was great! After assignment ended however, they never made an attempt to find another assignment, although they posted jobs. I called and they never called back."
good,"It's smart to get temp work between jobs, but don't get stuck and stop looking. You can get labeled as only a temp worker and get discounted for permanent positions that come up."
good,"I have no complaints. The jobs I was assigned to, served their purpose. Multiple job sites worth of experience. Gave me the chance to see where I would permanently wish to go."
good,"Learned some multifaceted skill levels of the accounts payable s customer service department, which expanded my work experience in customer service as well as the accounting field."
good,Decent people to work with. They found a position for me right away and that lasted over a year. They have not found anything for me for the past month.
good,"RHMR got me into an interim controller position that lasted about 6 months.  Worked with a great company, but I wish RHMR would have told me that I didn't have a chance at the full time position when I went in."
good,They helped me gain the experience that I needed. They placed me in jobs when I needed to work and could not wait for a full-time job to come to me. I was new to accounting and they helped place me in a job that was at my level.
good,"Job placement - occasionally but compensation low, haven't worked long enough to say much. professional recruiters. "
good,"This company is a temp agency. I have never had trouble getting work through this agency. However, they pay very, very low amounts and charge their clients quite a bit. I have gotten hired permanently using this temp agency in the past, and I know others have as well."
good,Excellent co-workers at the location I was assigned. Co-Workers always willing to assist. Free drinks to employees. Good software for remote troubleshooting.
good,"Have my first few contracts through the company.   Depends on which office you talked to,  some of the hiring managers are very efficient and talented.  They do help you with landing your job."
good,"This is a fairly busy office with multiple projects within the space. Staff is friendly. Comes with coffee, water, refrigerator and microwaves. The building is nice and easily accessible via public transportation."
good,"This was a firm which provided me with temporary assignments. I thought they are a wonderful firm, but I need now to get back  to full-time. I have no complaints with Robert Half!"
good,"Helpful with job seeking. I was able to obtain an permanent job.  However, the job I accepted and other job offers did not utilize my skills to the best of my ability."
good,"A typical work day is normal on an assignment, after the first day of work, the temp will check in with RH management. However, RH management does not always follow up to determine how well the job is going.  It appears dependent upon the manager who places you the temp employee is on their own until the assignment ends. Also, there is little to no support if issues arise."
good,"Recruiters are eager to place you in a position to keep you employed"
good,"They are helpful with your schedule. They are willing to work around your schedule and trying to get you anything available. In general, they give the choice to accept the job which is very flexible."
good,The company overall has a  good work/life balance.  The benefits are so/so but you do get free bagels Monday morning.  The compensation could be better.  Management needs to better value their employees.
good,This places is a great training ground for any recruiter but what you will find is that most people will not make it past the 2 year mark. Tread Carefully
good,Account Temps is a good company to work for.  I just had a problem with them communicating with the company about my permanent status. They weren't able to get me a permanent position like they promised. I was at the company for 6 months and then after I was let go I didn't hear from anyone with a new assignment.
good,I handled Customer Service calls for parts.  Also worked with Return Goods.  Enjoyed the job very much.  There really was nothing hard about the job.  Management didn't want to hire me full-time.  I worked her through a temp. service
good,I worked two jobs for this temp service.  The first job was amazing!  I was a data entry clerk for OrthoIndy.  I scanned and entered them in to the patients files.  The job assignment was only for two weeks.  I ended up working almost two months based on my performance.  After this assignment ened I was offered another temporarly position with a company called ALIXA RX.  I counted patients perscriptions and seperated the controlled medicine from the generic brands.  This assignment ended after six months.
good,They provided me with a good temp position that lasted 10 months.  They were in constant contact me with making sure everything was going well.  The people I worked with there were very helpful and nice to work with.
good,"Not a bad Staffing agency to work for, they will send you out to jobs regularly and are good about finding assignments. It is a good way to get entry level experience quickly. The pay is not the best but hey it's temp work and it is more than minimum. Your assignments can be terminated at the will of the company, and some companies are organized better than others/ have better corporate cultures. Overall positive experience working for them."
good,They do not pay well and no vacation time. They do pay weekly which is nice.  Not much chance for advancement.  They do work to find a temp position for people.
good,"Robert Half is generally a good company to work for. However, some of their staff are not good listeners. They ask you what salary you are expecting and then they come back with a low ball offer. Anyone who is working a mid-level or higher office job that takes skill and experience should be able to expect to make a lot more than the average person starting at Walmart. They also are fans of a canned ""you're on my radar"" response when you're looking for a position.  That is robert half speak for ""shut up and stop calling me.""  I even had one manager rip me a new one because I wasn't a good fit for the company she sent me to (they do NO training other than sitting an watching someone take phone calls).  Also, one staffing specialist caused me to be dropped from the insurance plan because she didn't send me on an assignment for over 30 days."
good,"Typical day is fast paced and productive. The management was very amicable and showed a lot of concern for my well being. I felt comfortable taking the lead on some tasks, I was later commended for my initiative."
good,"Honestly, it's a great place to start, and get a ""foot in the door"", so to speak.  I just wish they had more steady work. That's probably not their fault, as much as the economy."
good,Faced-paced environment--no day is typical. Management is understanding of the need for work-life balance. I learned how important client-company relations are and how to maintain them.
good,I have worked with Robert Half for many years and find there assistance to the best of a companies ability.  I would recommend them to any one looking for accounting assistance.
good,"Robert Half employment service provided me with several positions which paid reasonably well. Job counselors are professional,  courteous, and always willing to answer questions."
good,It might take time to be placed with a company but after a few months they were able to place me into 2 temporary assignments within  6 months.  Would have been nice if one of the job placements was temp to hire.
good,"call various to vendors, expedite and follow up orders, Receive, code and reconcile invoices. Create Requisitions in procurement, my Co workers are team players, we help one another, the work load is busy, but I manage to get the work done efficient and in a timely matter."
good,Legal processing is a great starter if you are just beginning to start in the customer service field. Everyone is friendly
good,"Hired as a Data Entry Specialist for Evergreen Tank Solutions on a three month contract; worked for nearly two years. Learning data entry programs for client/companies that Evergreen did work with/for. Filing, scanning/filing electronically, and general office duties to support staff."
good,"I liked working in the large organization with lots of different people.  The company offered lots of training and development with was fantastic. "
good,It's a contract hiring company. I do not have much experience with RH. They send me to jobs for contract purposes. I have been working with them for over 10 years.
good,Robert Half is an employment agency. I enjoyed the people I worked with. I do not have any complaints for the office management/staff or companies I temped for. They paid pretty good.
good,"First job is essentially a testing tool for them to see if you are capable to carry out actual accounting work or not. Pay is good, different work environment is what you get which I like. It allows me to hone my learning ability because I have to catch up on some of the newer software very quickly"
good,"Sales environment.  Management are the past top sellers.  Long hours, 10+ hour days. Can earn a living if you give up your standard of ethics and push every sale."
good,They are really good with lining up interviews and placing people. I would recommend Accountemps to anyone searching for a job.
good,"The interviewers were professional, efficient and easy to work with.  The company provided benefits many temporary agencies do not.  Pay scale was low, but was more likely set by their client."
good,"I answered the phones and greeted customers, transferred calls to the appropriate department.  I checked the customer service orders that were entered for any errors and scanned CPU''s and did any other miscellaneous tasks that were required of me.  This was an awesome job and I loved all my co-workers, I honestly can't say a bad thing about this particular job."
good,"People were nice and welcoming. Consultants did check in with me and asked how things were going."
good,They were able to give me a number of sites to work at on a consistent basis. None had the potential to go permanent but at the very least I was able to pay bills. even with their low ball offers for the different positions that were offered.
good,"You are sent out to a employer who is looking for assistance (in whatever field your expertise is in) and they show you your work area and expect you to dig in and do the job until the term ends.  You then submit your time sheet online weekly to get paid BY this employer.  If you have ANY questions, concerns, issues, etc., you contact this employer and let them know what's going on.  THEY in turn contact their customer and call you back to give you the resolution, if any.  You continue working until the term ends, and continue submitting your time sheet online weekly and get paid.  Working conditions vary, depending on the job.  You dress according to the rules, show up on time, take your breaks by the rules, leave the job on time, etc.  You report to 1) the office, and 2) your current boss when you need to leave for doctor, dentist, etc. (any reason) so everybody is on the same page.  Hopefully when your assignment is finished, they have another assignment waiting in the wings for you."
good,Accountemps is a nice place to work. When you are working. You have to call almost every day and they change who does the actual placing of the people. It was hard to get started and once I lost my second position. It has been difficult to get another appointment.
good,"- Empresa de gestão e gerencia próxima, reuniões diárias para orientação e informação de procedimentos;"
good,I have enjoyed the attention given to finding me contracts by my representative.  She has been attentive to my needs and always remained professional.
good,I've been employed with Accountemps for 15 years and I am satisfied with their job placements. They work hard to find job placement
good,This personnel agency had the client's best interest in mind at all times.  The service to fulfill administrative duties on a consistent basis was of quality and received with compliments.
good,"nette Arbeitsatmosphäre, sehr engagierte Arbeitskollege, Bereitschaft zu helfen. Zu höhe Leistung erfordert."
good,"I did not like the job security with this place because it seemed that once i was about to get paid for the Thanksgiving break and that was going to be my first time earning holiday pay, i was released from contract a week before due to ""budget cuts""."
good,"The office assistant position with Robert Half incorporated skills in a solid office support function from my background as a legal secretary. The office setting was a different office environment than that accustomed to, however, provided exposure to the apartment leasing industry. My co-workers were highly professional, accountable and helpful. The most enjoyable aspect of the job were the community sponsored events."
good,"Manage documents presentation for annual court hearings, draft order forms, prepare, scan, fax, file and copy documents into the Documents Management System (Docuware). Notate documents in the case note system through case management. Drafted foreclosure document and research the court hearing date for the attorneys through the Cook County Circuit Court website. "
good,"Every senior I encountered while employed made me smile. They always had a good story to tell, want to give goodies, give compliments and praises when due."
good,Robert Half Legal is a decent company for legal document review. Their work space is not very comfortable and it is very cramped. They are not very good at following up with available attorneys and the turnover in recruiters is high.
good,Was quickly matched to a job right after joining.  The pleasant memories of that job are still with me.  Looking forward to the next assignment.
good,"I really enjoyed working with the team at Robert Half. I learned so much through my many different assignments. "
good,"Not bad pay, but the supervisors are not organized; They're nice at least. The early morning hours would be great for a person whom enjoys mornings."
good,"Having to move from one company to another can be a bit challenging at times. But for the most part the assignments I received were worth the time. I was able to meet a lot of great"
good,"A typical day at work was crazy busy from the time I arrived till the time I left. I learned how the construction business in pools ran it's very interesting.  I entered sales that came in and any excavations that took place. Also entered daily deposits, daily report, and accounts payables."
good,"Most of the employees here have been here for more than five years, so they are a close group, but I must say I have never felt out of place. They have made me fell like one of the team. Most of my day consist of greeting clients and making sure postage is prepared for the mail run that is twice a day. I will also dictate letters from the CPA's  There is not a had part of this job and I enjoy all of it."
good,"Robert Half, also known as Office Team, is a temporary placement company that I would work with in the future.  They are fair minded, and while the client is their focus, in my experience, they did not overlook any time I had an issue with placement."
good,"Short term, learned great organization skills. Met some very helpful people in the industry."
good,"Typical day was marketing and providing business solutions to increase market visibility and provide competitive intelligence and consulting."
good,Had some good assignments-just don't take any concerning convention / events. Just be wary. Office assignments were wonderful.
good,"The compensation is low for the skill set most of the time, the recruiters are very helpful and find something for you fairly quickly but it is not always something that may be permanent. I am looking for job security and benefits because I have a young family and we are trying to make it work. My husband is on worker's compensation and waiting on back surgery approval and the surgery itself. He has been this way for over 2 years now. I am the bread winner and I haven't been able to really bring home the bacon with this company. It is a little better than unemployment financially but it does help you get your foot in the door if the employer wants to hire permanently."
good,A typical day a work would be based on the office job you are sent to. I always enjoyed the chance to go to a new office and learn new things.
good,I've been out of work for a couple of years but have a lot (!) of experience. They were willing to take a chance on me and gave me a position to show them what I can do. It's a start - that's all I was asking for.
good,Accountemps was extremely quick at placing me with an assignment.
good,I learned something new every day on my assignment since I was setting up an office from scratch.  I had great support from the people that I worked with.  My favorite part was the end results.  Watching people that you helped get sponsors for just the smiles on there faces was my reward.
good,Many opportunities for continued professional development in varied employment environments.
good,"Not consistent in job referrals, not accurate in direction and location which cause employee to be delay."
good,"Nice People would work for again if they can find me something,"
good,"friendly staff, good communication with agency managers, good job opportunities, very low pay (lower than most job agencies"
good,"Les équipes de Robert Half France sont des plus compétentes dans le domaine de l'intérim. l'environnement de travail est très agréable et le l'emplacement des locaux est très placé."
good,Little interaction with management.  A successive of contacts with RH made it difficult to develope a rapport with anyone.  Some dissatisfaction with division manager.
good,I feel that I did not get the right skills to get a job more then three months.
good,"I learned how to adapt in different environments as this job was for temporary work assignments at various locations. The multiple people I came in contact with (as far as working with the actually company) were great. They took time to get to know you, and your abilities in order to place you with an assignment that matched your personality and skill level."
good,Good place to start being a temp to full time employee.They send you on assignments to well known companies within your community.
good,"Temporary agency that had jobs available that fit my specific job skills; learned various programs associated with jobs held; management staff was very pleasant and kept in touch to let me know my services were appreciated; there were very few long term or temp to perm positions, which was more of what I was looking for"
good,"after i started at Office Team, they found me a job almost right away which was great. The job that they placed me at hired me on after 2 months, so i had a short time with office team, but i would go back if i need another job."
good,"positif bonne expérience, très bonne équipe."
good,"Company was pretty good while you were working for them, but weren't really great at returning phone calls."
good,"I think Office Team and Account Temps is a great place to work for if you get a person who actually cares about your growth potential with the company and not with just their pay. IT IS A FACT THAT THE LESS YOU MAKE THE MORE THEY MAKE...so do not allow them to trick you into believing you can not be given a raise, they absolutely can do it!!"
good,I was fortunate to work for accountemps at a time in my life when I needed flexibility due to personal challenges. Accountemps recruiter's are specialized in understanding their clients needs and value. They do not insult the client by recommending a job that the recruiter knows very well that the client is over qualified and should be working at a higher paying level.
good,I was able to brush up on my Tax Credit skills. I performed annual recertifications. It was a short term assignment as this company was a temporary agency. I worked alone under the supervision of a regional manager. The most enjoyable part of the job was getting to know the tenants. They hired a permanent manager within the company. I was sad to leave
good,"Positions fluctuated, which benefited me by placing me in a number of new enviornemtns. This helped me develop a concise skill for adapting to change."
good,I totally enjoyed working with all my customers.I developed a good repoire with them.
good,I enjoyed working there. It was a good company and very nice people. I would consider working there in the future...
good,Robert Half is a great company to help you transition back into the workforce. They provide you with great leads and place you at companies that treat you with respect.
good,Office is centrally located in downtown San Diego area. The recruitors are nice. but work is inconsistant and infrequent.
good,"RHI was a very good employer, keeping me informed of the primary's timeline and considerations for permanent employment"
good,Accountemps was able to find me positions based on my qualifications and with really good companies.
good,This is a temp agency they just helped me get a job. I was a temp fo about a year before I was hired as a permanent employee. Robert half assisted with the job search but that was about all they did.
good,"I worked as a contractor for Robert Half's client, work was interesting, well within my capabilities, the environment was mixed - the office space was open, and my job is difficult to perform in an open space."
good,The company is the number one in placing and recruiting accounting professionals. There is high turnover but that is because recruiting and sales are skills that take a certain personality.
good,"I have had several temporary assignments with Robert Half's Office Team. Most of these assignments have been amazing, some not so great. It is hard to make a living wage on temporary assignments, especially when they can be very short term and infrequent. However all of the people I have dealt with at Robert Half been extremely friendly and helpful."
good,They have flexibility towards job times and good company to get your foot in the door with employment with companies whom they match you with the perfect companies your a good match for
good,My goal is to have a permanent job. This has not been addressed to my satisfaction. I was employed quite a while before I had the opportunity to meet my manager at RH.
good,This is a contract company that helps you find work.  That is not too great but the staff is amazing and extremely helpful in finding you what is good for you!
good,"It was a wonderful experience. I really enjoyed my position as an Accounting Specialist I was devastated when my department was laid off."
good,Enjoyed using administrative skills for which I was well prepared for.  Politely verifying customer information allowing use of excellent customer service skills.
good,"Robert Half works with you to find the right job placement based on location. They have the tools and knowledge to help you be successful. My last placement I had with the was a bit out of my way, the compensation could have been better, however, the people I worked with were amazing and very welcoming and wanted to hire me on fulltime."
good,"Evolving challenges and high level critical thinking assignments."
good,Assignment had had a hard time keeping someone in that position. Not willing to pay much. Very professional work environment. Friendly co workers and clean workplace.
good,Great place to work for motivated and hardworking sales oriented people. Training is top notch and the support is there if you want to apply yourself and make it a decent living in a thriving field.
good,"Robert-Half if a good company to work for if you want to develop administrative skills: accounting, management and software skills. The work can be stressful since companies are looking for employees to start the job with little training. Recent position with a help-desk job allowed for two-weeks of training which was helpful in easing in to the work flow of the office. If you are looking for more work experience, this is a great company to work for."
good,"Les opportunites de develppement"
good,"I worked on a placement through Robert Half, and very much enjoyed my recruiter and RH contact. I did not work at Robert Half proper. This was a temporary assignment, so not really applicable."
good,"This temp agency for accounting has gotten me a number of short term placements, and 2 full time jobs over the time that I have worked with them.  I would recommend this company to any accountant looking."
good,"There are a lot of very personable and very talented professionals who work in Seattle and Bellevue offices in a team environment together! "
good,"L'esprit d'équipe est très important dans le cabinet. "
good,I stayed with Robert Half for about 4 years. I had many assignments with them and I felt like they did actually really care that I was happy with my placements.
good,"During my time at Robert Half Technology, I was assigned to a software development team which was very well managed. They were professional in a sense of having the AGILE methodology in terms of development."
good,"Excellent place to start your career out of college.  This company expects you to work HARD, but it pays off.  The harder you work, the better you will do.  Lots of learned skills and opportunity for advancement.  Great co-workers, some managers rock, some don't."
good,Enjoyed 99% of the contract jobs that I was assigned to complete.  They were able to do a lot of the work in getting me assignments.  I would work with RH again in the future.
good,Busy day at work. Time flies when you are at work. I always feel productive. Other employees are helpful to new employees. They always provide you feed back if you ask.
good,Good assignments overall. Takes long time to place. A lot of follow ups. Flexibility on checking and veryfing the identfication. Salary or hour rate rarely negotable.
good,"Industry leader, so broad width of career growth opportunity.  Molded environment, so you need to operate within their parameters - this is fine, as long as you're not over-entrepreneurial."
good,"This is a Staffing agency, there is no review necessary.  "
good,"Robert Half is a temp agency.   Was placed on a work assignment that was to last 3 - 4 months, but only lasted one month.   After work assignment was finished Robert Half was checking for other assignments but there were none available."
good,"good for advancement, if you work hard you can advance and will get far in this company. I would like to go back with the company at any opportunity given"
good,Work competitive with little management oversight. Benefits disappointing. Work diversity interesting and challenging with wide variety of clients/industries.
good,"I utilized this company's temp division to make money during the summer when I wasn't in school. It was a great way to get by. But, it took them a month to place me in their short term temp positions."
good,If you are in the administrative profession and in between jobs this is a good place to find work. They have a lot of variety in their placements. Most of my placements lasted 3 months and then I would go onto the next one.They were never the same. Lots of experience in different environments.
good,"Robert Half has been a go-to company when I have been without a job.  They gave me a temp job in July 1995 that turned into a 20 year job.  A lot of learning and many different experiences was acquired during this time frame.  The second opportunity arrived October 2018-June 2019, with a very positive work experience."
good,This is a contract agency that can place you anywhere within a certain radius that needs one of their salaried professionals for any amount of time. I have had a great placement and time working for Accountemps but I can imagine that you could get unlucky and have a contract placement with varying degrees of stress or difficulty.
good,"Professional organizations all under RHI. Having worked with other temp and placement agencies, I've worked (on and off) for eight years depending on my needs. Their efforts tp promote my skills have helped me focus on finding suitable positions. The recruiters ive interviewed with are all professionals, resourceful and personable people.  Assignments can vary depending on skills and interests. Overall a very good experience."
good,"entered data from work orders into computer"
good,I have been sent to jobs that I didn't qualify for and I have wanted jobs that I felt qualified for but wasn't offered. I'm still waiting for that one job that I can work with the skills I went to college for.
good,The interview was scheduled very quickly from the time of my initial phone call. The staff was professional and courteous. I received phone calls with job opportunities with the first week.
good,"I had never used a temp agency before but I applied from an online ad.  Interviewed, performed some test and within a week I had my first assignment with an awesome company that paid well also."
good,it helped me greatly to land temp gigs while living in California i would use the agency again if i needed them.  i would also recommend them to others for temp help.
good,Great company to work for!!  People are friendly and warm. Positive work environment where people feel valued and appreciated.  The location where I worked was a call center with high energy and sales promotions.
good,Variety of locations that you will be placed. The work can be completely different each day at a time. The employees are really helpful. Does a good job at keeping you up to date on new opportunities.
good,"I was told that the only job available, was difficult to reach by public transportation.  I requested a raise, from Robert Half, but never heard back."
good,Robert Half is a good company. I've worked for the company over a year and my experience has been good this far. Communication is good and I've learned from every assignment.
good,"Office Team works for Robert Half to assign employees to different jobs that's how I started working for People Ready. A typical day for me was opening up the office at 5am and letting employees in and getting them ready for their assigned jobs, making sure all of our different company's have every spot filled. Answering phones,printing out checks for employee's and taking new job orders on a daily."
good,"They didn’t have a lot of jobs in my field/area. They were helpful in finding me jobs but nothing permanent.  I didn’t have a bad experience, I expected to be placed in temp to hire."
good,"They got me through the system pretty quickly despite not having any prior admin experience.  "
good,"As a contractor, they were enthusiastic and listened to my wants and needs. They positioned me for good opportunities and checked in with me often to make sure everything was going well."
good,It was alright early on.  Accountemps is probably one of the main companies that hired me for multiple positions.  I worked there a few years ago and they said I'm finished.  I need a job now.
good,"Great company, they do their best to place you in something that really fits you.  Paid weekly.  They have great follow up and check in with you to make sure you’re happy."
good,This is a good company to work for. The recruiters try to place you with the skills that you already have and they check up on you once a week to see how the job is working out. This is the only temp agency that found me work and has kept me employed.
good,Fast paced.  Learned a number of individual EMR software systems.  Good feed back from management.  Hardest part of the job was adjusting to multiple management styles in new work assignments.
good,"While working as a salaried professional with Robert Half, I was given the opportunity to work in multiple industries that help me advance my career and build my resume for future employment opportunities."
good,It is all based upon how much you are willing to work and for what pay.  If you wanted full time and were willing to go when and where you were needed they would keep you busy.  If you needed time off or a different schedule you could do that and still work if they had something open.
good,"Would recommend to friends. Found positions with little to no down time between assignments. Most were for a good length of time, several months on average."
good,- Always a pleasure to work with all of the agents and recruiters. They are always available to answer any questions or concerns I may have. Whenever I have reached out to Robert Half they respond quickly.
good,I have had a wide range of experience and new skills.  I do not wish to add more to this  I like working in challenging environments and with challenging tasks.
good,"Robert Half/Office Team, is a temp agency. most of the assignment that i was given was on a short term basis, however there is always a job available, the only issue i had with them sometimes you are called like a hour to report to a client, which was understandable."
good,There were many different locations that Robert House allow me to work that were within my range. I had many opportunities to work with different employer and work with amazing people.
good,Anybody can work here and there are  wide-variety of employment opportunities. I had a few jobs at Oracle Arena in Oakland and it was probably my favorite job to date.
good,Robert Half found me a position very quickly. They continue to work with me as I look for a permanent position in the area. They email me and text/call me regularly. Very nice people to work with.
good,"It seems like a good company, and the people are nice, but I think there needs to be a bit more feedback on engagement results.  Really, this is a pain in the rear...no comment further."
good,I was a contractor for RH. They provided me with work opportunities when I was transitioning back to a employee. The staff at RH were always very friendly and competent. The process of getting hired and being placed was fairly easy. During the time I worked with RH the office appeared clean and organized and the employees all appeared to be very professional and well dressed. I was offered some beverages but I don't know if the office was stocked or if that was just the process for new hires. They have many opportunities for short and long term contracts as well as temp to hire positions.
good,They were good CPA positions during tax season.  There is nothing more to say.  There were two main temporary positions that I had.  One was with a CPA in Mesa and the other one was for an advisory firm in Phoenix.
good,temp agency: they always call to see if you are available to work with one of the companies they hire for. Ask for way to much personal information from 10 years back as employment to addresses. Need diploma or GED verification as well.
good,Generally supportive towards your work and may try to help you out.  Main problem I had was the lack of consistent work.  Not being contacted for work or why the schedule has changed was one of the reasons I didn't stay with them.
good,Agency was helpful in seeking an accounting position with a company that employed me full time. Loved the company they became a second family. General accounting responsibilities performed.
good,"Company provides a great training ground for the industry.  If you are tenacious and resilient, you can be very successful. It is a very competitive place to work and requires a lot of your time."
good,Good starter job if you are looking to get your foot in the door and gain some office experience and connections.  Would recommend do anyone needing more experience on their resume.
good,Managers are always available and respond quickly. Friendly staff and great customer service. Easy application and online tools to aid in job searches.
good,"I am not a direct employee of Robert half Technology as I am external employee, consulting on behalf of the company, so  I don't see why I have to take this survey. But, from what I can tell from my accounts manager and many accounts managers and project managers that the internment differs defendant upon what site you are working off of,, but overall I got the impression that is a busy, motivated, and success driven place to work in. I only hard one negative statement which could hold true but I can be the very nature of the beast here and in any private sector environment."
good,There is a lot of room for growth. If you work hard you will make lots of money. The training programs are great and they offer many incentives to keep you motivated.
good,Working as a contractor I was able to experience many different industries and learned new computer programs and other ways of doing the same type of work.
good,I worked for Accountemps on and off for several years on temporary jobs. I wasn't real impressed with the hiring staff as I felt kind of left out a lot because of my age. It made me very uncomfortable even though they assured me that was not the case.
good,Accountemps and RHI is a great stepping stone into the role of recruiting and staffing. You learn a lot about the industry and several different roles within the accounting and financial industries.
good,"Quick finding a job, listens to you finds the right fit for you. Cares about job you are looking for. lack of medical insurance and follow up. Did not explain everything in detail"
good,I worked here as a temporary employee. Robert Half Placed me in other companies that needed accounting positions. I am in my current place of employment because of Robert Half.
good,"The title says it all. This staffing agency used to be a highly reputable staffing agency, but all they do now is to fill positions without thinking if the candidate they present to the client is a potentially good fit or not."
good,It is a temp agency that got me several of the first jobs I worked in New Hampshire. They do not pay high dollar but they can reliably get you a job. I would recommend them
good,This was a temp job they placed me fairly quickly and kept me employed until I was able to find a full time position.  I enjoyed my time working with them.
good,There was quick placement and the recuiter was available for feedback. The on boarding process was relatively quick and painless. I was dependable paid the follow week.
good,"Temporary work is difficult.Very rewarding and management ade it fun to b there whenever they could. Learned a lot about payroll, many things that I did not know."
good,"Since this is an employment agency, it is hard to review the jobs.  OT is great when they send you on assignment, but it's hard to say why they stop calling.  Around the time I was going to ask why they weren't calling, I got a job.  I will be returning to OT soon and will see if things are different."
good,"Robert Half is one of the worlds oldest and largest specialized staffing companies."
good,"At Robert Half, I was solely responsible for identifying and cultivating relationships with both candidates and clients to fill roles within the finance and accounting industry. This was a fast paced job hat required a significant time on the phone."
good,"It is a great company full of many opportunities. However, I was only there briefly and only worked a couple of contracts. I was asked to stay with the company on permanent placement. However, I had already found a permanent position with a different company."
good,"Wasn't much room for advancement. However, I did learn while there and meet some great people. I went from full time to part time and things changed a lot."
good,"Accountemps was a great company for part-time work but there is an issue when trying to find full-time work due to the ""commission"" or salary ""mark-up"" Accountemps need to collect in order to be profitable."
good,I was employed through accountemps for a little while and it seemed like they always had work for me to do.  My jobs were always lined up and I could count on them for assistance when I needed it.
good,"I had a great career here.  I was able to do everything I wanted to do and feel grateful for the experience.  Getting set up for success is tough.  No one really is here.  You have to figure things out on your own, or at least I had to and most of my colleagues did as well.   We have gotten better with training but we still have plenty of managers who are swamped and have no time to train their people. We need to change the model and look at freeing up more of the managers' time so they can train, grow and lead their people."
good,Didn't have enough consistent jobs to send me out on. Not much more to say - this is a temporary assignment company mostly - although they can help find permanent position by giving a temp to hire position.
good,no real job security. communication is a little lacking. Alex G is amazing though. they are prompt after you reach out to them. there are slight problem getting consistent information from both Robert half and where you are placed.
good,Managers were very responsive. They found me two jobs very quickly and made sure that I was prepared for them. The best part of the job was that they would bring coffee or pizza to you on the job and made sure to contact you every few weeks to confirm everything was going well.
good,Excellent opportunity to learn how to manage busy work desk and balance multiple responsibilities at a time. This opportunity opened many doors for me after leaving.
good,I only worked here doing temp work because my husbands job required we move every 4 months.  There were not many opportunities that paid well in the area we were living.
good,The job gave me a chance to enter into to the administrative/clerical workforce after graduation from college. I worked for a thriving company at the time.
good,"Its been so long ago that as far as I remember it was a decent place."
good,"Great opportunities"
good,"Professional Business as a temporary service to get temporary work within the district of Columbia."
good,I had a good time working at Robert Half. I am simply not interested in reviewing the company though. How do you even explain having this as an obligation?
good,"I have worked through Robert Half Legal on several occasions to secure temporary, temp-to-hire and direct hire positions.  The Recruiter at Robert Half are thorough and encouraging."
good,"I worked as a temp looking for full time employment. I was offered a semi-permanent contract position at Repsol Services Company."
good,Great place to work. I have worked for Office Team several times in Florida and in Georgia.  It is a great alternative to getting work when the market is tight.
good,"All the employees I talked with are nice. They have not found much work for me, but the jobs they have found for me were appropriate for my skills and good places to work for."
good,I mostly worked for Office Team and they did a great job finding employment for me in a short amount of time between assignments. I will say that sometimes I ended up stuck in a bad situation and couldn't get reassigned as quickly as I wanted but for the most part it was a reliable company to work for.
good,"The hiring managers were wonderful to work with. My last contract job turned into a full-time position for 2.5 years. Sadly the department went through a reorganization and budget cut, and my position was eliminated."
good,I was a temporary contractor. I was assigned to work with various clients and acquired valuable skills before I found a full time position. I would recommend it to new graduates who do not have connections in this economy.
good,I was assigned to different places while doing temporary job assignment for Robert Half Accounting and finance. Very good experiences gained in various field of work.
good,Worked for various executives as their executive assistant.  I had an opportunity to work in many fields for both public and private companies.  Robert Half was able to assign me constant work for the two years I worked for them.
good,"The hardest part is getting consistent work when you need it. But once you get an assignment, it last for a while. The recruiters work daily getting new leads on job opportunity."
good,"Great people, long hours. A lot of management layers can be frustrating when having to fill a requirement quickly. Many opportunities to go in different directions within the company and division."
good,I worked at Duncan Oil being paid by this company.  They are a placement company whom I was very satisfied working with.  I have gone back to this company hoping to get placed into another position.
good,"Robert Half is a good company providing temporary services to businesses. When finding myself suddenly in the job market, Robert Half put me in a position within a couple of days. When that short assignment ended, they were very quick to place me in another assignment."
good,"They make it seem as though you can expect stability but you get the exact opposite, it is impossible to get in contact with one of their agents and thats a bit frustrating."
good,A typical work day at Robert Half would be receptively answering phone callas and solving problems for our customers. The hardest part of the job is being able to juggle 3-5 tasks at once. But its a great practice !
good,Good company to work at. The management are a really great bunch of people. I liked the time that I spent working there. I would recommend this company to others.
good,"The agency assisted in job placement. They were extremely helpful in assessing my job skills and training. They found a position for me that met those skills. After I was placed in a position, they followed up monthly with the employer and myself. They really aided in the interview process and how to be more confident in myself."
good,Accountemps is a staffing agency and has a lot of assignments to give to their employees. The only downer would be the process they have once the employer decide to absorb an individual as a regular employee. The transition doe snot happen until one completes a certain number of hours as a temp.
good,They provided me with several temp jobs while I was in search of a permanent position in my field. The consultants I worked with were very professional and personable.
good,"I worked as a consultant for the Management Resources group.  There were no benefits or job security for temporary consultants, but I didn't expect them either.  "
good,"I was placed on the ""salaried consultant"" team. They promise flexibility in choosing assignments, but in reality, you're supposed to shut up and take what you're given."
good,The company did a great job in placing me in jobs that I was able to turn into careers.  This has been helpful for my growth with the company I have gone on to work for permanently.
good,"OfficeTeam gave megreat opportunities in long term positions with major employers.  I was able to attain full-time, permanent employment through my OfficeTeam experience.  I would recommend them to anyone needing to get that ""foot in the door"" with a major employer."
good,This is a well managed agency. The recruiters are helpful and prompt on answering any questions. They strive to satisfy their clients as well as their temps.
good,Robert Half was a helpful first step in getting my career after law school on track.  They were able to recognize my skill set and properly place me in a contract role that I then used as a springboard for my career.
good,I am not going to write a review of this company.  I do not believe it is fair to try and force a review from users of this site.  I may have to reconsider using this site this way.
good,"Robert Half Management consulting gave me opportunities to learn new skills, work for different companies."
good,"When an assignment was offered it did match my skill sets which gave me the opportunity to work the full contract without a hitch from client (Darby Dental Supplies) Catalogues Design which I was very good at for the type of applications provided to do the job. (i.e. Quark, Indesign, photoshop, Illustrator)"
good,"It was difficult to get in with Robert Half when I first graduated paralegal school. I went there and interviewed and heard nothing back. I actually got a job referral from a friend and interviewed with a company but they had a contract with Robert Half to fill the position temp to perm so that was how I started working with them."
good,"Showed up on time for the job assignment & signed in with the supervisor for the position needed.  I worked as file clerks, admin assistants & data entry positions while employed with this company."
good,Can work various assignments when looking for a full-time permanent job. Would recommend Robert Half to anyone wanting to work while looking for a full-time permanent job.
good,Great temp company to start off with to gain some experiences in the Business/Accounting/Finance field. Learned how to do some admin work as well as accounting.
good,"I learned that ALWAYS keep an open mind, educate your self always! "
good,"of course, depends on who leads you but they are definitely fast, organized and have many job offers from many clients."
good,"Facilitate law firms with paralegal oriented tasks. However, the pay for contract positions is insufficient equivalent to $13.00 at 2018 dollars. Therefore, I would not recommend this position."
good,"I worked temporary positions with Robert Half Office Team.  My interaction with my supervisor or manager within this company was mainly through phone contact, but they were available to meet with me at any time.  My work was performed offsite at other companies, and as mentioned above, in positions that were temporary in nature.  "
good,"When I lost my job a few months ago, they were able to find a position for me quickly."
good,"Robert Half, Office Team is always thinking of me. I have few gaps between projects. I work with nice people who I communicate with often. Pay checks and payroll processing is timely. It takes too long to accumulate sick leave, worse, more time to accumulate vacation time. The benefits for a temporary worker such as myself are more like discounts vs. company paid full benefit plan. Pros of Robert Half is professional development and training. Management returns calls and emails within 24 hours or less. They are understanding to emergencies. What could be better? I should have been brought in as a senior admin instead of coming from the bottom and working my way up. My salary should have been much higher. I am learning how this process works as I stay longer, now going on my 2nd year. A temp to perm job does not guarantee that you will be hired and may be disappointed when you are working a temp to hire job and see them interviewing your competitors right by your side, then one day you are replaced by the person they really hired for the job that you have been temping in. With that said, I keep applying for full time perm jobs, and never give up. I keep working and fulfilling my assignments."
good,"They would give me plenty of jobs to go out to that gave pretty good hours. The pay here was really good, but they were only temp jobs so it was kinda like a double edged sword."
good,"I have no compliments about the temp service itself, but the job site I WAS working at was horrible. Management sucks. The actual ""employees"" had too much drama."
good,"Robert half is a temporary agency that I have worked for on and off for years. I have received a lot of different experiences working for this company. I began working here in milwaukee, wi and continued to macon, ga. I have worked as an administrative assistant, receptionist, file clerk, office assistant, etc. I have enjoyed working for robert half because of so many career experiences and so much room for growth. They are very flexible and placement on assignment are fast. I look forward to what officeteam has in store for the future."
good,I worked for Robert Half in the capacity of a temporary employee. I had no problems and the staff was helpful. My assignments were varied but closely matched to my abilities.
good,"Well, I can't just copy and paste an answer on a survey question on a company I worked for more than ten years ago. It was a different age, for sure, and no longer relevant."
good,Again short term positions. Very helpful but not what I am looking for. I am looking for a more permanent position. Accountemps is their temporary side kick.
good,I had temp jobs with Robert Half's Account Temps. I interviewed with a few different folks and the offered assignments that I could accept or turn down.
good,I enjoy the assignments that I have been sent to. I rarely had any face to face with anyone except when it was beneficial to the account manager. My experience was they were more concerned with the client than the employees. But they do attempt to keep you busy with assignments.
good,I've worked for Robert Half and it's various branches off and on over the past 14 years.  Their staff is always professional and they offer competitive pay.
good,"I have been waiting over two months for a new assignment.  I applied to all the new postings, I call in my availability daily,  but have yet to be reassigned.  The positions that were offered to be were for one day or were too far out the way."
good,"For the most part, they won't send you jobs that you don't want to do but you have to be willing to be under paid for the work that you do. They found me the correct fit for my needs at the time and I've built strong relationships with the recruiters there. They believe in the longs game and not just a turn and burn kind of mentality."
good,the intake process was well.  I didn't really get a growth opportunity but they are still a leader in legal placement. Thanks for the knowledge.  An interesting staff.
good,"I worked a wide range of positions for Robert Half as a temporary employee. While the work was generally pretty mundane office work, I met a number of interesting people along the way that have become valuable assets in searching for jobs as I have moved into my profession."
good,The short term engagement was very interesting in that I had to interact with engineering of the client to develop the bidding tool. Robert Half was good for me in this respect.
good,"Depending on which location you choose, there are several beneficial jobs that are available for your career choice and preference.  Be sure to align your self to the location where you are willing to work most."
good,"Robert Half was very helpful in getting me a new start when I decided to make a change.  I didn't work at Robert Half directly, but they helped me to get hired on at Anthem and get a start i the healthcare industry."
good,Learned a lot about Accounts Payable in my short time there. The workplace was very friendly and compliant to ones needs. The job was explained in great detail.
good,The people I've worked with all seem very nice. It is an agency so I don't work with them everyday. They could find me a few more jobs. The time in between assignments can be long.
good,Robert Half Technology was an incredible place to work. You are constantly surrounded by individuals who strive to be the best. Fast-paced work is the name of the game.
good,"This company was always able to find me another position after my temp assignment ended. They even hooked me up with several interviews for full time positions. My supervisor at the time was nice, and while busy, always helpful when I needed something."
good,The account reps are nice and very enthusiastic but there is a little too much pressure to accept jobs. They are very receptive to your requests and seem to know the clients well.
good,"they where able to provide me with two different accounting jobs that suited my experience, very pleased with their placements.  I did not work directly in office of Accountemps, they are an employment company, but I am very pleased with their ability to provide me with jobs that were fun and close to home."
good,they helped find me a job regarding my job experiences and background knowledge. worked with them before my last job ended; and they were able to find me another temp job within a short amount of time of finishing my last job.
good,The interview was very positive and professional with a friendly environment.  I was greeted with kindness and treated with respect. Although the facility I was assigned to couldn’t even come close to compare to Jarrett Wilson at Accounttemps.
good,Well experience management team.  They are part of a national organization but has a very large footprint in the Twin Cities.  They have a large sales team.
good,"This was a nice little lay over for me, while waiting on Technisource to find me another contract.  I worked at the Staples Command center.  Helping out associates that where across the country who were installing Photo Kiosks and networking them to the cash registers."
good,"This is an employment agency that got me a couple of temporary jobs.  They were very nice people, who worked to help me find employment, although temporary."
good,"As a staffing agency, I found them to be very efficient and helpful in obtaining positions that met my qualifications at the time.  They tested their individuals well to know what the applicants strengths were."
good,"It's contract office admin work, so your experience is very dependent the contracting employer.  I've been fortunate to have one long assignment at a great company that pays relatively well.  Many jobs, however, are very short term with low pay.  Recruiters aren't the most responsive, but will find you work if you're a good employee and you keep reminding them you're looking for work."
good,"It was  2 years ago,  I had to keep calling everyday to see if they had any jobs available.I told my girlfriend about the agency she sent her resume and would call  but they never would call her for a job."
good,The temporary employment with Robert Half Management Resources was a good experience. The staff were very attentive to the needs of their employees and their customers.
good,"My typical day was going on assignments and receiving the tasks for the day. I would go into the job and work in Accounts Receivables. Assisting in Reconciling accounts, calling vendors regarding payments. I did do trouble shooting regarding missing or miss allocations of payments. Management was a little stressful. The workplace and the culture was pretty tense. The hardest part of my job, was sometimes not knowing what I should be doing or being re-assigned to other tasks. The most enjoyable were some of the staff"
good,"This was a temporary agency where client needed help in mortgage loan processing - I learned different system the different companies utilized Compass. LandMark, etc."
good,Was able to work in a multiple offices to see what kind office I would want to work in the future. Mainly answered phones and handled light paperwork for each office
good,The company was able to place me as a Senior Financial Analyst at several Fortune 500 companies. The work was engaging and highly interactive with Management.
good,"data entry"
good,"Only worked on one job with agency. It was close to home and co-workers were pleasant. Learned about making outgoing calls and making appointments, and set up focus groups."
good,"The company will keep you working, would like more pay for the service and commute I provide.  Would like assignments within the District of Columbia."
good,"While working for Robert Half, I have learned so many things that I will take with me on every job I can. Because RH is a temp agency I have been contracted out to many different place learning several different trades."
good,In my first visit we spoke about my expectation about job and staff was friendly and explained about the opportunities that were available. The process was quick.
good,"I learned a lot and made some good friends while working at this Fortune 500 Staffing Corporation in San Francisco, CA.  I worked full time and sometimes did a bit of overtime."
good,"I loved my job placement contract from Robert Half, unfortunately it was not something that became permanent (Temp to Hire).  The staffers and their team are great.  They do a wonderful job of communicating important information to me, and updating me on what my schedule would look like, as the hours or days would sometimes vary."
good,Enjoyed working at various assignments and experience working with different types of companies. The management is very knowledgeable and helpful. Lots of work.
good,They have provided good jobs.  I just wish they were permanent instead of temporary.  After working for this company for 1 yr my holidays were paid.  Robert Half also offers basic benefits that you pay weekly.
good,"A JumpStart to entry level office positions that enhances your data entry skills along with customer service. Managed files, folders, produced production to meet the orders."
good,"Working at Accountemps can be stressful as in any management position. The challenging part is to go into a business that I have never worked at in the past and learn that business, the up's and down's in's and out's. As a temporary employee working at various sites is probably the most difficult part."
good,"fast-paced, competitive environment in sales."
good,I like that they find you a job and will compensate you with your work experience.  It is a pleasure working with the company.  I like to work with them again.
good,"At Access Information Management people were nice and supportive. Fast paced environment but it was fun to work. Unfortunately accounting department shifted to other city,"
good,Overall work experience was a good one with Robert Half. The staff/people where nice to work with. The work was plentiful with detailed direction on how to complete it. Nice place to work for.
good,"They are always trying to get new and consistent contract jobs for the employee. They try other avenues, that may be compatible to your past experiences."
good,This position was a fast paced environment in a customer call center for FEMA hurricane victims.  The work hours were 7 days a week and overtime on most of those days.  I learned that I could still attain a good attitude and have sympathy for what the victims had been thru. Punctuality was a must for this job!  The most enjoyable part of the day was when we could help the victims with housing and money for water and food.
good,"I learned how to handle people that feel entitled. I also learned I can kill with kindness by my professional attitude and demeanor. I am excellent in office settings. The workplace can be competitive but if you are capable of demonstrating what you can do, you will always be employable. Be dependable, no matter what show up and show up on time. Never let there be a reason why you can't be in attendance because you were hired to be there and that is what you must do. The most enjoyable part of my job was my coworkers. They commended me and kept me feeling that I was needed and important to the position, even though I was a temp."
good,"It was just a temporary job. I enjoyed the pay; disliked the inconsistent nature of the employment. With that said, they did not misrepresent anything and I would definitely take another position with them should an amicable opportunity arise."
good,"I was too long ago for me to remember what I did and where and who my supervisor was. "
good,COE is a family structured oriented business. The people are wonderful to work with. The company allows and encourages growth within the company. They periodically also provide free educational seminars/training in order to help you advance individually.
good,"This agency found work for me quickly.  I completed the task I was hired to do, then was given different duties in the same company. I was able to work part-time."
good,"This is a very competitive environment which pushes you to succeed. There is an exceptional support group, and leadership to continually provide real-time mentorship. This is a 100% sales commission environment which may not be appropriate for everyone, however the commission structure is very lucrative."
good,"As a contractor, they were very helpful in finding me jobs quickly.  They did a great job of vetting clients and workplaces to ensure a good fit for the role."
good,"Accountemps is OK but it really depends on the job that they sent you to. Some of them can be good, long term jobs and others can be only a week or two."
good,"I think Robert Half is great, it’s just temporary. Staff is SUPER friendly and very willing to work with you and your lifestyle/commitments. Only office type jobs are offered through them."
good,Learned new skills that I can utilize in the future. They even help with providing additional skill training. The company I was assigned to I learned to repair different equipment. Some days it was eight hours others days were ten hours.
good,"Hit the floor being productive,...Arrive before start time,..Remain alert and attentive at all times,..Follow shift supervisor direction and instructions,; fast-paced, competitived, stressful at times"
good,"My recruiter worked with me weekly to provide the right position to compliment my skill sets."
good,"I worked at Robert Half 11 years. Very talented people work there but the management doesn't worry about what they should worry about (performance and customer service)  and instead micromanages people to the point of stupidity.  They don't recognize  the people who work hard for them as much as they should. Also, the pay isn't as good as it could be to comparable places. Overall still  a good company and good experience."
good,"This was a temporary job, they were able to find placement.  The permanent jobs work out great so if you can get placed it is definitely worth checking out."
good,This was a temp job and it was a stepping stone to get a full time job from companies where they send you to work as a temp. No career advancement and no pto
good,"It's a ok agency to work for.  The staff is ok, but job placement is scarce.  Very hard to get me a 40 hour a week assignment.  I do a day here, a day there has yet to complete a 40 hour week since hired."
good,Office Team bridged a gap during a relocation transition to the area and made it possible to match the salary needs in the previous area with little sacrifice.
good,"Accountemps is a great way to get your foot in the door to an office setting. I used to clean at a hospital and it was difficult for me to get jobs in an office. After coming to Accounttemps, I was placed in an office quickly."
good,Accountemps itself is a great company. y issue is not with them but with a couple of the places they placed me to work. But my actual agent at Accountemps was great and has always been good to work with.
good,I have worked and made them happy. I will love to work with them again after this tenure is done. Thank you for appreciating our hard work. Thank you for everything.
good,"It's hard to rate this employer since it is a temp agency. But for the most part I enjoyed the majority of the jobs I was assigned to. They were a good temp agency that kept me working pretty consistently. I liked the flexibility and variety of working temporary jobs, but eventually had to find full-time and permanent work."
good,I enjoying working with the staff they are very efficient and they do their best to help find you work that fits your needs. The pay is decent as well.
good,"Very nice personnel to deal with, love the opportunity to improve skills with their portal. Would like more opportunity for full time placement. Good temporary opportunities."
good,". they call you for an assignment"
good,Very Quick Placement. They found something which I was interested in.  They found a good match for me which I enjoyed very much.  I would recommend this agency for people who look for temporary positions.
good,People were always kind when working with them. calling them was always a pain. they would never contact me unless my time card was late. which a guess is a good thing.
good,"Robert Half is a Business and Accounting Firm.  Meeting different people at different organizations.  Robert Half take your skills and test to see how they can place with you with competitive companies that are in need of extra assistance. The management is very professional, and they have an diverse ethnical workplace.  "
good,They offered decent jobs but the pay was terrible. They weren't very on top of things they dropped the ball numerous times where I and the company I worked for would have to call repeatedly and get issues fixed so I could input my hours and such. They were told when my assignment was over numerous times but messed up the paperwork and it messed my computer access up at the company 5 days before I was done with assignment I lost privileges and it was their fault.
good,"This was long term temp position, which allows access to many aspects of Accounting with different companies.  It was a great opportunity to learn and received ""real world"" training."
good,Good experience in various industries. Great for entry level learning or for a new working environment. All positions are an on-call basis so you have to respond immediately to secure a job assignment.
good,"always has a good variety of positions, always responsive to employees, work with you to find the right position, great resource for clients needing help"
good,"A temporary staffing agency, one of several I have worked for in the past.  Some assignments, such as the 9-month-long DrillingInfo gig, are better than others.  Love the longer-term assignments, especially data entry."
good,"in addition to the online learning that Accountemps provides, the variety of assignments, can teach a candidate about different work environments. I believe this gives valuable experience."
good,"Temp agencies do not give you great benefits so I wouldn't recommend it. It is a place you can start out of school, but you better work hard to get a permanent job if you want the benefits."
good,Accounts Payable Specialist that enjoys the daily involvement of different business that I have worked for through Accountemps. The hardest part is no benefits and usually temporary assignments
good,Temp agency with the ability to get you a job quickly. Which is very helpful as they have alot of clients. Sometimes they don't always give the best job descriptions of what you are showing up for though

good,"This company does its best to make sure they keep you employed. They work with each individual to put them in the correct job, one that is the right pay, location and fit."
good,"Prepared and entered monthly journal entries, generated checks for vendor payments, reviewed and reconciled bank and balance sheet accounts and recorded donations, educational revenue, and patient service revenue by individual and program.  I learned Quick Books On-Line.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working with the Staff and Executive Director.  The ability to telecommute was a very positive feature.  The hardest part of the job was realizing that my ""conversion fee"" to become a permanent employee was a ""deal breaker""."
good,A great temp service that does all it can to get you placed. Always following up with their clients. Well always recommend them to friends and family.
good,Good  Agency in matching your skills for employment opportunities.  I would  recommend this  agency for your  employment search and temporary employment while you are looking for full time permanent employment and allow you  to  utilize  your skills.
good,I'm so grateful to what Robert Half has done for my career. The experience I gained there is unable to be matched by any other organization in the nation in regards to practice and reputation.
good,"Robert Half is a temp agency, they favor the employer over the employee because they pay for them to stay in business but the staff is for the most part helpful."
good,Robert Half is an office staffing agency. They placed me with a few temporary positions helping me gain experience. The jobs were fine but the compensation should have been higher for the type of work demanded.
good,"a temporary accounting agency which kept me very busy,  I was always working .  Pay was great and on time and management was always correct .Always learning"
good,Comany keeps you busy with jobs if you want them. Diverse and works with you and your schedule and skillset to find you the best job that fits your needs.
good,"The work you perform is determined by the company you are sent to work. Sometimes, you don't get a response back from your point of contact. This can be frustrating."
good,"It was a Great experience working for the Ocean County Food Bank, I received this job opportunity thru Robert Half Accounting Service. I will recommend their Services"
good,Job Placement was ok. Very stressful job placement. Hi volume of work. Excessive pipeline. sometimes too much to handle. Management does not give training to full capacity.
good,"Was placed in a job position shortly after applying.  Doesn't seem to take my calls after that, even though I keep specifying I wish to change jobs now"
good,I was able to explore a few different jobs and renew my skills before entering back into the workforce. The management was amazingly helpful and listened to concerns. The hardest part was the lack of stability. The most enjoyable part of being with this company was meeting new people and becoming a part of new companies.
good,This is an agency for temporary positions.  The recruiters are very easy going and helpful. At the moment I have worked at 2 jobs as a data entry clerk and receptionist.  I enjoyed working at both placements.
good,"Good managers at the time, that made you feel like the client and looked out for your best interest...you didn't feel like you were just inventory. If you felt you were not a good fit for the client you were reassigned and not penalized."
good,"I have worked four temporary positions from 2009 through 2014 for Accountemps in Memphis, TN.  These positions were as a Credit Research Representative, an Accounting Clerk, and two as an Accounts Payable Clerk."
good,Robert Half is a temp agency that will hard to place you in the right job that will fit for you.  The staff are extremely friendly and have your best interest in mind.
good,This company was very helpfully in keeping me employed.  I was able to accept or declined jobs placements to work around my family obligations.  As a temp I was able to gain experience from different office environments and industries.
good,"Productive with excellent managers, nice people to work with."
good,"The job entailed checking patients in, verifying registration information, verifying insurance, handling copayment and scheduling/rescheduling patients, as well as other activities as needed. The challenging parts were dealing with the rushes of patients needing attention and with down time between rushes. From watching my coworkers and how patients responded to them, I learned more about this type of customer service. At the time that I worked there, they were having some pretty major changes in management. There were many undercurrents that contributed to consternation on the part of most of the employees working there. I found the management to be responsive and fair, but I know that others felt they did not have the same experience."
good,"As a division administrator, we were definitely treated as such. Very little acknowledgement or respect, and no advancement opportunities."
good,"okay, I do not give this to someone I haven't had .any contact with."
good,I had one temporary position through Accountemps and this was an assignment for The Iams Company on a 14 month project of converting two of their plant offices A/P procedures to Costa Rica.
good,Robert Half moves quickly to find assignments.  They make sure you are happy and want you to do your best at every client. The hardest part is starting a client and moving on to another.
good,"Accountemps made an effort to find me a position in which I could learn and grow, and where I felt like part of a team. My original commitment was one month, and when I was offered a full time position with the company with whom I had been placed, Accountemps was very supportive."
good,I'm a temp so I work at an offsite company. Every time I call Robert Half regarding payroll issues I always get a quick response. They placed me quickly.
good,Management was very helpful on giving you opportunities that are a great fit for you. The company gave you the option of online training with tutorial videos.
good,"When I worked with this company in the 90s it was a terrific company. They kept me working and placed me in good well paying jobs! Now I see that they have gone downhill with the quality of service that they offer from reading the reviews. Perhaps it's certain locations that are terrible. The one that was in Durham,NC was great! Now there are so many bad reviews that I'm wondering if people are paid to give the good reviews or if they are made by OfficeTeam's employees..."
good,I worked for Accouttemps in California and Baltimore.  I have found that if you have a good work ethic they will find you continuous employment.  I have also found that for the same position they pay way less than other temp agencies.
good,Great place for temp assignments. Have a wide range of companies you can work for and most are temp to perm. Temp assignment last longer than 3 months. I Had 3 assignments in a span of 3 years.
good,"I had a pretty good experience with this agency. When I reached out to them for assignments, they were very prompt in finding me work. Literally within a week, they found my first assignment and I loved it. They were also very quick about finding me a second assignment when the first one didn't work out on my end. There is a high turn over in staffing managers and I never knew who I was to report to. More than once, when I couldn't report to work, or had to report to an assignment late, the staffing manager that I was assigned to, did not notify my assignment supervisor in a timely manner. Usually it was a day late or so, after the fact. Other than that, the pay is not the best and very entry level."
good,"Every client placement can net a different experience, I enjoyed mine. The client I was with valued my work and the team I was placed with worked very well together."
good,On temporary assignment. Placed me in an assignment within 2 weeks. Not too much interaction with RH since. They did contact me immediately after working on assignment and within a couple of weeks afterwards to see if my project was nearing completion to place me in another job. I'm pleased with my experience so far.
good,Office Team helps obtain fast temporary assignments when you are in need.  They communicate proficiently with you to make sure that you are satisfied with your assignment.
good,"Work hard, play hard"
good,"I'm happy with their service. It is a very good company and great staff, I will recommended to my friends."
good,"The typical work day depends on where the assignment takes you.  Robert Half / Accountemps is a good company to work for.  They even offer benefits."
good,worked server company's for them they were all good jobs  the only problem was a lot of them were full time I learned a lot of different things at these potions and most of them were great places to work the hardest part with them was not knowing how long you would be there sometimes

good,"This employer was a staffing agency. I was sent on several office jobs for customer service and office duties. The jobs were only temporary, which I preferred a more permanent position at the time."
good,"I love working with my co-workers at RHI. I have an amazing, motivating team and leadership group. Everyone in the company is like-minded and has very similar personalities. I feel comfortable and confident when I walk into the office. I've been trained on multiple aspects of the business throughout my time there and I'm grateful for the skill sets that I've learned. I've developed so much as a friend, colleague and business partner through this company and I'm grateful that they've supported my business decisions along the way. "
good,"Robert Half is a decent company to work for. Depending on your skill and what you're looking for they place you in positions within the area. The managers that place you are very friendly and understanding. The only downside is you never know when your assignment is going to end or how soon you will be placed in something new. Sometimes it can take months before they find another assignment for you. Other than that, the positions that I've been placed in have been great for gaining experience."
good,"Robert Half has worked diligently on my behalf to secure positions that meet my needs.  I have only worked with them for a few months, but they have kept me working."

good,"Office Team is great for overall work experience in many different job arenas. I was able to gain knowledge in office work and contact centers. They also have online enrichment courses to help with resume writing, interviewing, and computer skills. At times if their are no jobs to match your skill level you can be sitting home till a new project comes into  the office. The recruiters do their best to match you with jobs the best suit your skills."
good,"i was working a  mid term contract scope was three months ended being  eleven months>"

The office is sometimes not as responsive as I'd like, and when they do call you back or respond to your call; you will most likely hear that they had nothing to say.  I do not like that. "
good,"While they are highly and they pay fairly well, their high fees to their clients do make placement somewhat of a challenge at times."

good,"I learned how to receive peoples and to place them in a office while they were waiting for their appointment."

good,I would probably still be at mitsubishi motor credit were it not for the unfortunate fact that they downsized and outsourced the department. I was very comfortable there.
good,"Lots of work, however, enjoyed every moment because it was accounting.  Management worked hard to try to succeed, unfortunately, the economy had other ideas of progression.

good,"Working and being hired onto Office Team (a Robert Half short term temporary agency) helped me with finding potential careers along my experiences to outgrow and achieve in business. Working as an accountant as for my first assignment helped with providing the benefit that most meets my role as from working as a personal banker. Dealing with on a daily basis taking incoming wire transfers, confirming daily number counties, and talking and working with fellow co workers on other situations in the workplace. The recruiters that helped me with finding the right position along the way did a fair job of finding the right work balance for me. I think overall experience so far still with Office Team is good service in the company for the most part. Some situations that I disliked were  the lack of communication with certain members replying back to my missed voicemails, lack of miscommunication on scheduled interviews with potential employers, and just overall recruiters that I would try to get a hold of wouldn't always be in the office. Other than that Office Team helped me so far with work assignments and being a temp to hire in potential growing businesses long term."

I learned many different skills and made the ones I did know stronger. Management was easy to work with but when I was faced with a problem, it took them a long time to get back with me. When I got placed out on my first assignment, I was missing lots of paperwork in my packet and so that was a mess but, they did eventually get it turned around. The co-workers there were a little rude. My first case worker was great. She helped me so much. But the second one, not so much.

When I started this position here my co-workers were extremely inviting and helpful in showing me new things and answered every question I had, and I had a few, they are a joy to work with.

Management was always supportive and eager to expand my accounting tasks throughout the assignment. During my various assignments, I always worked in close contact with each company's CFO and , when finished with my duties, I then communicated often with other company employees to inquire if I could assist them in their daily tasks. The hardest and most rewarding part of each assignment was learning the new computer system they utilized for recording accounting data to the point I completed tasks given quickly and on-time. However, the most enjoyable part of being a temporary worker on assignment with various was learning each company's particular business segment and associated accounting routine to record transactions and produce meaningful financial reports."

good,Wrking at Robert Half was a great experience. The recruiters were hands on and quick to respond if I needed help. They gave prompt and courteous feedback on my job performance and the jobs that they had available were professional and bountiful.
good,"Robert Half International has a great history, strong corporate structure, great tools, and some of the best recruiting professionals in the world. If you are thinking about learning this business there is no place that teaches the work ethic, strategy and style needed to be successful. The day is a grind which is a typical recruiters day. The company teaches the importance of connection with your market and getting out to meet people. That is the most enjoyable part. The bad part is the management. They promote the best sales people to move up and that is not always the best potential leader or most strategic business person. They are working to change that but they have quite a few 20+ year senior manager for that culture to change anytime soon. They also have lost a tremendous amount of training talent to their producing field offices and to competitors. This has caused the training to fall off quite a bit in the last 4 years. This is causing new hires to take longer to be successful creating stressful and frustrating teams."
good,"management helpful, organized, co-workers helpful, always busy"
good,A typical day at work would be based on the assignment that was given based on the placement.

My co workers were friendly in explaining my job duties and in answering questions I had about the job.  The most enjoyable part of the job was the variety of tasks I was assigned.  I learned a lot on the job."
good,Please refer to previous description.  I worked as a temp and then got hired into the company.
good,By working for a staffing agency I have gained a broad spectrum of experience. I was able to work for types of companies I would not ordinarily picture myself working for. An example would be a property management company I was assigned to. Though the work was clerical I never would have thought to even apply at a business like that because I knew nothing about managing property. I try and learn something from each assignment I take. I knew nothing about finances but took a job assignment with a financial adviser. There I learned about investments. I learned about the stock market. I learned how people who do invest should watch their money closely or have an adviser who does as the market is ever changing. The hardest part about working for a staffing agency is that it is temporary work. I get to meet lots of new people but I would like to find a home away from home working environment. A place where I could make lasting professional and personal friendships.

good,OfficeTeam is an enjoyable company to work for. The assignments they place you on are fit to your skills and experience. The pay is the same. I was recently placed on a job were the presentation of it all was a bit conflicting.. During training you go thru a basic run thru of your position and when placed on the floor you ran thru a serious of trial and error. The Management team was always second guessing each other or making an exception to the others rule. Everbody in the company kinda sits on edge because our coworkers were being fired daily.

I filed so much paperwork i filled a whole trailer up and the 5 offices it held. I had help with another guy from the company. It was strict because we made it so. we had a dead line and we both pushed to get it done. the manager would often come in and check up on us, and ordering supplies was easy as the workers often catered to us as well. It was easy access to public transportation so it was a nice ride to work. i didnt have many coworkers, just my partner. he was much older than me, and we would watch detective shows at lunch. he was a nice old man."

good,Good recruiter. Just was assigned to a poor company. Went on a leave of absence and was never called back when I returned.
good,"Fast Paced Quick environment due to the nature of the business made this a sink or swim experience. I didn't experience much of a problem, but found the continual rotation of routine to grow wearisome over time. However, it did keep my skills sharp and broaden my professional career spectrum"

good,Great assignments. Many learning opportunities in varied settings.
good,Everyone is pleasant and is appreciative of my work. They are also flexible and supportive.
good,Good working enviroment. Learned new software. GReat management. Nice co-workers.
good,"as a temp go to work and do the best I can. I have learned many traits. My recruiter is always on top of things. co-workers are fine all different, different places. Hardest part is starting all over each time we get a new assignment. A paycheck"
good,I have worked with Robert Half previously and I came back to them because of the great time I had with them. The employees are professional and willing to help you find a position that is fit for you.
good,what i liked most was the various offices and staff. management was always helpful
good,"A typical day at work is fast paced and enjoyable. Every day is a learning experience in the HR office. I learned all the different forms of work authorizations, how to process background checks, get and input drug test results, process time offs and FMLA, and even conduct new employee orientations. The hardest part of every job is always the first day. I act like a sponge so that I can soak in any and everything so that I can give a good impression. I've always been fortunate to have great co-workers and Management. Working with Robert half has always been enjoyable for me especially because I am able to use my language abilities to help other people & or company employees with language barriers."
good,excellent company for accounting needs. Co-workers are friendly.
good,Robert Half is a temp agency that finds employment for me. The jobs they find usually last from one week to permenant. Typically i am assigned to a position and then recieve the information. I work in an office setting answering phones or filing papers. In this position i have learned many skill to be an efficient receptionist. The managers are kind and understanding of lifes situations that may arise. My co-workers are very polite and professional. The hardest part about the job is the travel required. Most people go to the same building week in and week out. With this position i may have to go to many different places in the state of Rhode Island. The best part about the job is the opportunity to meet new people and work new places.
good,Company places you with good companies and the weekly pay if great.
good,Come to work and check my email to see how many documents have to be generated and how busy the other team members are. I finish my job requirements and then help other people as needed to help everyone keep within the deadline.

good,The position I am working in now is so fast-paced and challenging I don't even notice the time flying by - it's just suddenly time to go home. From the minute I get to work until the time I leave I feel like an integral and central cog in the mechanics of an extremely important operation.
good,Robert Half helped me land my first job in Canada when I came here in 2005.
good,Robert Half was a recuirment co that I worked for. The sent me on interviews for jobs that I was qulified for and that were a match for me
good,I would have loved to go Permanent with the company they sent me too. To long as a Temp.
good,"didnt really work for them directly was on temp assignments,,,"
good,Very good experience for someone that would like to try working for various companies.
good,I worked various assignments through this temporary agency
good,"They keep me busy with various legal assignments, short to long term. They are always concerned about my well being and making sure I am being treated fairly."
good,I don't mind working as a temp on my current assignment. I enjoy working for Office Team.
good,The flexibility provided exposure to various industries.
good,Back in the day work as tempt use to be very rewarding but now it is not. Competition for tempt assignments has increased especially when you have to interview for a temp assignment.
good,I have worked with this company since relocating to my current home. They are always helpful. The placements are always fit to your qualifications. I will always go back to them.
good,I like that they are so good at finding temp jobs for me and are so willing to help me in my search to find full time employment.
good,"This company is a very nice temp agency to work for. They offer long term assignments. If a company did a job assignment lay off, they would do everything they could to make sure you had another assignment within a week. When you first start an assignment they would do calls periodically to make sure that everything is going well with the job."
good,"Each assignment was like a new fresh day. I am always looking to learn and improve my skills and abilities. This is exactly what a temp, firm offers"
good,"Answering inquiries, and providing the best service to clients."
good,This was a temporary staffing position.
good,Office team try to do their best for both their temp workers and the agencies they send them to. They work at the worker and office they are going to are a good fit.
good,Proactive & enthusiastic. Comfortable to speak with. I dealt with 4 different people there and have had positive experiences with all.
good,"Installation included: unpacking cables, monitors, and associated accessories; networking PCs to server; securing hardware with anti-theft devices (locks and cables); and ensured all systems (including cables) were aesthetically pleasing to meet and exceed client’s expectations."
good,"Kept me busy while looking for permanent employment. Learned about company before accepting permanent position, culture. management style, etc."
good,"Relaxed work, I learned that I had to be with a mind of changes, I had the opportunity to be micromanaged, the coworkers were good all the time, the hardest part was to not be a permanent employee and the best part was that i had all the latest technology at my fingertips."
good,Working for Robert Half is great.. However would like a more stable position.
good,This company is a great place to work. My co-workers and bosses are the best I've ever had.
good,"Provide quality assignments with reputable companies. Decent hourly compensation, solid support from home office. Provide clear, concise information regarding assignment details, such as salary, dress code, duties, and job description."
good,Company places persons in positions which can be anything from day to day or temp to hire.
good,"Comfortable work environment within a company that had high expectations of their departments, but also was generous in ways of showing appreciation."
good,RHT has some of the best resources available. If you have the stomach for an intense matrix driven environment this is the best.
good,Great people to work with and a outstanding place to improve your account management and client relations skills.
good,Really help you find a place to work permeniently at a company.
good,I enjoyed every moment at Robert Half Internationl/Accoutemps.
good,This was my first professional job. I learned quite a bit from both my co-workers and supervisors. Communication is encouraged.
good,Very experienced and professional group of recruiters. Response time and availability when I needed help was proficient.
good,Worked a variety of locations. I was able to go from temp to a permanent position.
good,I enjoyed the variety of jobs offered to me. I also ended up getting hired from one company and I have been incredibly happy at my new job for 3 years. They supported my decision to take the offer and also gave me some letters to help assure my new company of my reliability and commitment to doing the best I could for them.
good,"Overall, I appreciate the connection I have built with the recruiters. It has been over a year and with two particular persons, they understand what I look for and help towards that end."
good,The income is low but they offer benefits and 401(k). I have not had a secure position. I was harrassed and treated badly. But I was told that if I left the position I would not be able to receive another position with RobertHalf.
good,"Good salary, however I have never received any feedback to a question I posed twice. You do not receive any paid time off until you have worked 2000 hours and only then you receive one day."
good,Friendly staff that are always willing to find you a job. They will call you to find out if your happy with where you are. The second job that I was assigned to ending up hiring me permanently.
good,"Temporary assignments. You can work when you choose. Management changes with jobs  but Accounttemps/Robert Half staff are easy to work with. The hardest part of the job(s) is always learning new companies , management, job. Must like challenges of always starting over."
good,Processing over 3500 invoices and other tasks are challenging. I like the job and being busy but i feel the pay should be more for the amount of work i do. My co workers and management on location are very peasant people and this is why i like the position. I need a sense of job security and its taking a long time for permanent hire which makes me a bit antsy. Having to work over a year(2100 billable hours ) with Robert Half to earn a paid holiday or even a sick day is a bit extreme. Makes a person feel like they do not matter.
good,It can be very beneficial to work for a Temp Agency. The different assignments you are given. You get to learn about businesses that you never knew about.
good,"I appreciate the assignments that Robert Half have given me. Their communication via E-mails is not always at its best. I have sent E-mails inquiring for updates on the next available assignment, but never received a response."
good,I work for them on a temporary assignment for a food distributor.  Always received my pay on time and my agent was great on following up on any future job prospects.
good,Position is a good way to get exposure to different industries and responsibilities.  The pay is ok... could be better.  Benefits are good just expensive
good,"Temporary position,,,,,,company will help you find work...........but the company is out of range... so commute was out of the way from where i lived but overall ok company"
good,"Decent pay with a lot of opportunities to learn new skills.  Jobs were temporary and could end at anytime "
good,I enjoyed working with them. More opportunities for me would have been nice. Most of the opportunities i had were good. I learned a lot about my own skill sets.
good,Well matched temporary assignments.  Good coordination with clients on status of projects.  Provide some voluntary benefits options for temporary employees.
good,It's an agency and temporary work it works with a temporary work which is flexible and I need flexibility sometimes. It's a good job with good agents.
good,This is a really great company to work for! I loved all the people there and it is a stable environment. The employees who are working on the support side of things are very under paid for the amount of work they have to do. I do wish the company would invest more in the admins. The training for the recruiting and sales is killer!
good,It was a great job.  I had variety of jobs during the day.  Large work load.  Hard to keep up as a new employee.   I wished I could have kept the job.
good,"My typical day starts examining the help desk ticket queue; following up with the status of current projects, and prioritizing tasks with the project manager in order to make sure everything is on time and being addressed."
good,Average Temp agency to work for. Never had opportunity for full-time employment from most job assignments. Not much on health insurance options for a Temp worker.
good,Great staffing agency. Most of the positions that I've been placed at became permanent positions. They definitely put you in the right position to succeed. You will never find a shortage of opportunities here as they have placements in about every field that you can imagine.
good,Positions are usually available. The staff is sometimes unavailable. They have some paid time off after you work a certain amount of hours in a certain amount of time.
good,First time with a temp service and the jobs have been far and few between. They go through asking about what you’re looking for and then offer you something that’s just random and not in your background or pay rate.
good,Provided accounting  services to private and non profit organizations.  Needed to check on the work and companies involved for professionalism.  Short term jobs
good,"My experience is heavily influenced by an outstanding manager that was an amazing influence.  This is a sales job, you will learn to work the phone, research customers, and build a book of business.  Or you will be out.  It's sales."
good,Robert Half Legal needs to find positions for their long time staff that have good skills and experience but have been away from legal and want to get back into the field.
good,Temporary assignments are great for when you're between jobs. There is opportunity to become permanent if the company hires you full-time. There are long term temporary workers that can take advantage of the good benefits offerings. They are great in finding a job for anyone who wants to work. I will used them again if necessary.
good,They placed me pretty quickly in jobs I did enjoy.  People at the company were friendly and always responded when called.  Understanding when I had a family emergency.
good,"I've only been on one assignment for Robert Half.  There was a slight issue with different people calling me for the same information, even after I sent it. I didn't get the first check on time, however they were very good in making sure that once my information was received by the proper department they paid me right away."
good,"A few times was placed in jobs that I did not have the skills for."
good,The management of the employees could be better often a long time between assignments. They expect you to be ready as soon as 1/2 day. Management is supposed to check in once a week with the Salaried Professionals but this rarely happens. The lack of communication is definitely a very big problem.
good,"das Unternehmen war bis heute mein einziger Arbeitgeber aus dem Zeitarbeitssegment. Insgesamt lief die Organisation und Zusammenarbeit problemlos, Kontakt besteht bis heute."
good,Screened patients for eligibility programs. Scheduled appointments and heavy phone duties. Keyed charges into system and balanced batches. Very laid back office but stressful when keying charges. Basically enjoyable.
good,Working experience at the creative group was quite good.I have learnt a lot from it. Management was very good. the hardest part of the job was overnight stays and some time working continiously for 24 hours without break.
good,"This company was able to place me in temporary positions while I was searching for work. They were ultimately able to place me in a temp-to-hire position and it worked out well for all of us.The work/life balance is great at Robert Half because I could let them know when I was available for work and could also take as much time as I needed between jobs. However, because I was not a F/T employee, there were no benefits. Also, the job security was always based on the needs of clients, which may or may not have something available for me to do. There were a few weeks that I was available to work, but there was nowhere to place me"
good,I contacted office team to look for temp jobs near me. While they have a million job postings that you are applying to they do not call you back until they find something that fits with your experience and background. they gave me a 1 day assignment and I never heard from them again. if you plan to go for any temp agency go with multiple while also doing your own job searching most likely you will be able to find a job on your own nonetheless.
good,"The people at Robert Half are what makes the company a fun place to work. "
good,"•Invoice verification for a variety or vendors in Canada, US, & Central America.Worked with scanned or paper documents to create accurate SAP invoices. Audited and corrected missing GL codes, freight, and tax entries"
good,A typical day at work was to greet clients and answer telephones.  I enjoyed working with and meeting new people.  Management was supportive and friendly.  The work environment was always pleasant. The most enjoyable part of my job was the people.
good,"Robert Half is a great place to work when in between employers or working your way through college.  My recruiter had worked consistently with me for the past 4 years while I attended college part-time in the evenings. "
good,"Depending on what you are looking for this company provides a lot of transferable skills and helps you grow within the work force. They had interviewees me for a perm job but for budget reasons have me as a temp. It feels a little less secure, but there is a possibility in becoming perm. I took this job to build my resume and it is a great resume builder. Work at times can be slow, but when it picks up it can get pretty stressful."
good,Attempting to work on a consistent basis requires a modicum bit of work on your side to succeed. You are not limited to just one requiting manager as many are available.
good,"Robert Half, being a Temp agency did allow me to receive jobs that I might not have been able to find on my own. The staff was very friendly and easy to work with, and seemed dedicated to finding their clients positions they would be satisfied with. They also worked hard to find positions that paid fairly well."
good,"(I had an excellent experience with Robert Half in Massachusetts.  I got offered a full time position within 3 months of working at my assignment."
good,"Robert Half/Office Team is a recruiting firm that locates positions for you.  However, many times you are left hanging due to their clients not returning an answer on your hiring status.  After interviews you call the rep back and wait for feedback.  Many times you don't get one and left hanging.  Not a great way to keep clients."
good,They had their favorite folks that they sent out to work. They didn't really advocate for us employees when sent out to jobs. The pay was fair. They offered benefits that were decent..
good,"My time at Robert Half was long but, I would rather not speak about Robert Half as a company. I will say Robert Half finds jobs in a some what decent timely manner."
good,"I've been able to work with both the contracting and direct hire sides of the business. The managers of the local office are competent, knowledgeable, personable, and professional. They've worked hard to find positions that are a great fit for me and at the best compensation possible."
good,"The work recruiters and staff members so helpful and able to give work on a day notice. They are accommodating, flexible and honest. Service always with a smile."
good,Good temp agency to work for. Found me a position quite quickly. Start up paperwork was quite lengthily to complete which really should have been sorted before I started working
good,"Very quiet; fast paced due to needing a certain speed of files out per day; no chance for advancement due to team lead not wanting anyone with more ""schooling""...ie college degree than she had"
good,"It was  great place to work. I never did check out the benefits, so I can't really comment on that. Over all, great company to work for.  Sometimes they provided lunch."
good,"Beneficial for keeping HR Polices and procedures current."
good,A typical day at the  work consist of office assisting.  I sought to learn from each job assignment the nature of the company and the expectations of my assignment.  Overall the work place cultures were good.  I did'nt experience anything hard about the jobs and what I enjoyed most is working in professional settings.
good,I had several positions they were all good. None developed into permanent positions. Most employers at the time were not looking for permanent help. They do offer benefits. I did not take advantage of them.
good,"Difficult to live on temporary wages.  Jobs are far between.  I have learned MANY new programs.  The hardest part is surviving between jobs.  The most enjoyable is that I haven't had to go on unemployment, yet."
good,"officeteam provide me with a job.  these jobs are temporary in nature but can on occassion become full time direct hires.  Most of the time, the jobs offered were what I was looking for"
good,"My review is that it is really a great company to work for. The hours was my biggest thing because if I needed to be off I did not have enough time in to get paid for it., They go by how many hours you worked the year before which is 2100 hour if I am not mistakes, plus when you are working you dont get paid for holiday pay.  adn the hours sometimes 4 other times  no more than 6.  Couldn't support my family had to get a second job ."
good,"I worked ""thru"" not at Robert Half as a temp worker and as a temp to perm employee. I was placed at 3 positions thru Robert Half and was happy with the assignments and compensation for the jobs."
good,This a contract consulting business that placed me with a good experience that lasted nearly a year.  Once this assignment was over they wanted to continue using me as a contract employee when I was seeking full time employment.
good,I enjoy working for Account Temps they have a great team. They are always on your side. Communication is strong. Always the first agency I contact. Nice people to work with.
good,This does not apply as Accountemps is a placement service.   The career person assigned to me was very responsive and helpful in getting me a placment quickly.
good,"Working as a contractor gave me great experiences in different ares of accounting: Treasury, reporting, Management, Training, as well as networking with people in companies of various size."
good,Since I'm forced to do this review although I was ONLY planning to update my resume i'll go ahead and say its a great company that has kept me employed whether its short term or long term assignments.
good,"They always kept me working, excellent  job placements. Management  is very helpful. Always there to answer any questions.  Learning tools available to help advance your career."
good,Good communication with counselors and quick response to any problems with temp assignments. Assignments varied with each company but they tried to match client skills to company needs.
good,"This was an assignment with a law firm  Lasted one year due to  hiring freeze at the time. Hours were good, people were very friendly."
good,I actually work at Kahlig Auto Group in a temporary position where I have been tracking the background information for an internal audit.  I have also been asked to occasionally work on special projects for both the Human Resources and IT departments.
good,I was an employee of the agency in order to secure temporary employment while I was in between jobs.  They are very professional in finding job placements.
good,I enjoyed my job assignments with this employment agency.  They matched me with companies who needed my knowledge and skills and they paid a decent wage per hour.
good,"They give you the tools to be the best you can be. The industry as a whole, is ridiculously stifled, and there's not as much to be made as when the managers were starting out. Sometimes it feels like your competing against other groups and teams for the same job, every man or woman for themselves. "
good,"Man hat mich gut behandelt. Leider war der Einsatz nicht wie vereinbart mit einer Übernahmeoption verbunden, da der eigentliche Stelleninhaber zurück gekommen ist."
good,"friendly environments, got to know a lot of people, could easily keep a positive attitude at each workplace.  Hardest part of job was that it was temporary.  Most enjoyable part was getting to meet new people"
good,"The person I worked with to get employed with another company at Robert Half was very helpful and gave me great tips for interviews, resumes, etc."
good,"My day varies based on the work given. At this point, I am happy with the temp work I have received. The recruiting staff have been kind and knowledgeable."
good,I have not worked in the Robert Half office.  I am sent on part-time temporary assignments.  I especially enjoyed the assignments that used my professional talents and skills.  I appreciate the opportunities and assignments.
good,"A typical day at work:  Great workplace"
good,"This is a great place to work for someone who is looking to gain knowledge in the field of sales and recruiting.  All positions require that you interact with people on a daily basis, so communication skills are a must.  The great thing about this company is they do provide training to help make you a stronger candidate for positions in the future."
good,"As a registered employee, there were many opportunities that I had the priviledge of being exposed to. From corporate clients to Non-profit organizations."
good,"It was good working for Robert Half. Therefore there is not good opportunity for advancement. There is not annual review, therefore no salary review. There is not time for vacation."
good,Working for Robert Half was ok its just they only find you a job for a  little  while a couple of months.   They put jobs in the paper but when you call them they say they don't have any  jobs. I hate to  be lied to .
good,You are always pushed to do better at work. Very competitive. You have to work hard if you want to become successful. Management can micromanage at times. But you get out what you put in.
good,"Working for Accountemps has been wonderful, and they have not yet disappoint me yet. The work load with wonderful employees who are friendly and not pushy."
good,"i worked and got payed, it was very straightforward and simple. any complaints i made were heard and addressed in a timely manner. i would work for robert half technology again in the future if the opportunity presents itself"
good,Robert Half and Accountemps is well known and well respected.  They will find work for those honestly seeking employment.  I am usually placed on a job close to home and within my salary requirements.
good,"Good place to work, staff was very professional and accommodating. Whenever I had a question they got back to me quickly. I was placed at a job that was the perfect match for me and after my contract was up I was offered the job by the company I was placed at!"
good,The only bad thing about working for Office Team is the pay and benefits outside of that they are great. If you are looking to have a little extra cash and you don't mind having a small check then I would say go to Office Team.
good,Being able to handle different clients and different industries are the pros. But salary is not that high compared to the market. Good thing they have benefits if you are under SPS.
good,I thought it was a good experience to work with Accounttemps. They couple of assignments that I had were very beneficial to me and I absolutely gave me some skills to apply to other jobs down the line.
good,"I was sent on temporary assignments that could last any where between 1 weeks to months.  Longest assignment I was on was with American Cancer society which lasted approximately 11 months.  "
good,I enjoy working for  this company. Just did not keep me working enough thru the year. Would like to work for this company more often and more assignments.
good,"File Clerk, disassemble documents to be scanned and copied quality control during coping and scanning process, reassembles and below bind disassemble documents!"
good,Although my time was short they went above and beyond to help me whenever there was an issue and I appreciate the times with them I wished there were more jobs available through them but since it was a temp job I understood that.
good,"varied jobs, lower rate of pay,temp to start, choice of jobs, varied locations different office atmospheres, good company to work for.loved the different companies."
good,"Great people to work with.  Teams are great and flexible.  Hardest part is driving your own business.  Have to get out there and find clients, or else you will end up sharing your commission recruiting for other team members jobs. Hard to get started but if you are a dedicated person it may be worth the effort"
good,My position was a contract position through Robert Half.  Office support was OK at times it took many phone calls to get confirmation.  Information was not passed on
good,The jobs I had with Robert Half was very decent and I really like the last job I worked for New Line Construction company. I wish I still work with them.
good,"Great temporary jobs. I worked for Officeteam several times over the years. The pay was experience based, but no benefits. I was not fond of a ""team"" of managers instead of just one person to go to when there was an issue. If you're looking for a career, this may be a way to get a foot in the door. Most jobs are limited duration, which is fine if that's what you're looking for."
good,Great temp agency to work for. They have excellent contracts with terrific companies. They do offer some temp to hire positions. Recruitment staff is friendly and very helpful. they maintain contact and try to assist with whatever they can.
good,My position started out a a temporary position and became temp to perm after six months.  Enterprise hired me on and I couldn't have been happier.  Thank you Robert Half and Accountemps!
good,"Although I was paid thru Robert Half, I didn't work for them, per se. I worked for the company assigned by Robert Half. They were helpful in finding another temporary position when the previous temporary position ended."
good,Recruiters are friendly and they have good assignments in reputed companies. Work opportunities are abundant but they specifically require Canadian Experience and hence not good for immigrants who don't have Canadian experience.
good,"I absolutely love working at Robert Half, but the Job security I slow and there is a very large turn over. You see people come and go day by day and only a few are kept."
good,Was floating from job to job overall was okay not stressful at all. Ive learned to do billing and coding as well. Some days were better than others if you allowed the stress to bother you. Only complaint I have is the pay is very low for temporary work
good,"This is a great job for a military spouse just moving to the area, wanting to get familiar with the local job market before committing to permanent employment."
good,"Robert half placed me at a small family owned company. I answered phone, sales, billing, etc. It was a stress-free work environment. My supervisor from Robert Half would stop in to check on me once a month."
good,Work was always complementary to on the job skills and jobs were always available.  Would have preferred a salary to match skills but was always told to be grateful.
good,Accountemps is a temporary service that has a better listing of jobs than most temporary services.  Six week job turned into 5 months.   I have signed up with them for future jobs.
good,"found me a position quickly and was very helpful when I decided to proceed with the company I temped for full time."
good,"Very much enjoyed working with government sub contractors. Pay is pretty good, management good also. Working mostly with Defense/Navy contracts. These were full time positions with benefits."
good,"I was sent out on several placements with companies that were in need of fast temporary help."
good,Well Child is very diverse. As I notice working at Well Child we stated as a group of about eleven. Within the month Office Team had at least 20 recruits out at Well Child.
good,"Robert Half is an agency that found me individual contract jobs.  Though Robert Half is who I technically worked for in that they received the job opportunity and I filled that job for their clients, I didn't actually work in their office environment.  My environment varied depending on the client."
good,When ever a contract ended they had something else for me to start on right away. The recruter was always available and they answered all my questions
good,"Great environment, fast paced and need to learn fast. Team wants you to succeed but must be aware of the office culture at the time of hiring. Hiring process too about 4 weeks and was conducted via interviews in person and via video chat."
good,Accountemps is an excellent company to work for. My placement was great and I learned a lot. The management at Accountemps are very informative and helpful.
good,I was given the opportunity to try many different types of positions that fit within my skill set which challenged me. I enjoyed working with the staff.
good,"As a recruiter, call potential candidates that may be a good fit for the temporary positions open from the client. Screen and work in between the client and candidate."
good,Its a great temp services to work for. They would always get me assignments quickly. I highly recommend them for any type of office job and if you need skills they will help you get this.
good,"I was only an employee of office team for a brief period.  The pay received for the work I did was adequate, but opportunities for work were not offered unless there was an immediate need.  I found it stressful to be called on the day the job was needed to go to work.  I also had expressed a need to earn within a certain pay scale and was offered work at a significantly lower rate of pay.  "
good,"At Windstream the Job  was enjoyable and very easy.  Even though I am used to working alone most of the time I enjoyed working with other co-workers.  The most enjoyable part of the job was working together.  This position only lasted 3 months."
good,"You can make a lot of money if you work hard! Great comp packages, but the corporate culture of ""never enough"" can be frustrating. If you like sales, work here."
good,Robert Half is a great place for gaining relevant work experience. The recruiters there are very pro active about getting you work assignments and competitive pay.
good,"Overall Office Team is a good agency if you are looking for any professional or in office jobs. They pay rate usually start off pretty good. The benefits are ok, but if you are a placed in a temp to hire position you will most likely be eligible for better benefits when hired directly through whatever company you work for."
good,"I only worked here as contract for a short period of time, so am unable to write an adequate review.  They were professional in presenting me to other companies for employment"
good,My recruiter is easy to talk to and had gotten me a temporary position within a week of walking in the door.  I really like the position I was placed at; I am sad that it is a temporary and not a permanent one.
good,"Contracts were great! didn't get the opportunity to find solid work but I enjoyed it as a stepping stone."
good,The employees are friendly and helpful. This made a great working environment. I learned a lot from my co workers. The drive to and from work was not bad at all.
good,I haven't received an assignment in over two months. That's what has brought me to Indeed. I can only speak of the clients that I was placed with. They were all decent places to work.
good,This was a temporary consulting position. Work related aspects are based not on Robert Half but on the client that you are assigned to. This position is temporary with a slim chance of permanent placement.
good,"Not a bad company, but if you have never worked agency, you'll want to understand what that means before you join up."
good,RHT does an excellent job of pairing you up with companies that have attractive environments and also places that are looking for your mindset and you meet and exceed their expectations.
good,Robert Half is a temporary agency.  They sought me out from my online resume. They were unable to locate a part-time position once I was ready to return to work.
good,"Two times in my career I was placed in temp to perm positions with account temps. I was thrilled both times!"
good,"Robert Half Officeteam does not seem interested in providing new assignments to there employees. They rarely contact you for new opportunities. In the initial interview they act as if they can place you right away, then you don't hear back from them. It is up to you to maintain contact. And even if you do that, it is hard to get the recruiters to return phone calls."
good,"Worked for a tech company through Robert Half and everything has handled pretty well. After that contact ended they would still send notices offering other contract positions, which was nice."
good,Temp company has a fast turnaround on finding employment assignments. On the downside benefits are rarely available for temp employment. Hardest part is leaving a work place where you are a good fit.
good,I was called in for assignment the day after I applied.  They are very great at job placements.  The hardest part of the job was having to take a pay cut when moving from assignment to assignment.
good,This place helped me get my foot in the door of a govt agency.It was a convenient way to obtain employment quickly but the compensation is not that great.
good,". I like to be a part of your corporation and by providing my knowledge and skills to escort your corporation up to the pinnacle of success."
good,"Very nice people to work. Didn't always have positions based on my experience. It does take quite a long time to get assignments, I did have to reach out a few occasions"
good,"I have, overall, had a good experience with Accountemps. There are several employees in the Chicago office and they seem to have a low retention rate."
good,"Worked varied jobs with Robert Half. It is a temp agency. Have a wonderful track record with them. I am 1 of their top employees. They always have found me jobs in the areas I prefer to work i, Minneapolis, Bloomington, Richfield, Eden Prairie"
good,"I have been with Office Team since the 1990s.  Then it was more geared for the employee and would provide training on software that would be needed in upcoming positions."
good,The recruiters are easy to work with but jobs have a short lifespan which leaves job security to be desired but they do compensate for this with better pay.
good,A typical day at work would begin with a team meeting. The job allows you to work independently when necessary. Its nice to work with people who care.
good,I had a good experience with Robert Half. They were good at gauging who should be placed where. Never felt I was underutilized or overwhelmed with my placement.
good,"Enjoyed be paid hourly, effort put in resulted in compensation achieved. Most enjoyable part of working for Robert Half was the various assignments I was given."
good,"Good Temporary company"
good,"Overall, the Team Leaders and employees/consultants were very friendly at all times.  Always there to provide support.

Overall experience has given me the opportunity to explore my own possibilities."
good,I enjoyed working at Saint Francis the atmosphere and coworkers. I liked the position I had working in insurance billing and collections. My manager was very efficient but wasn't very lenient on days off.
good,Great place to work because they allowed me to experience various positions. I gained a lot of medical and accounting experience while working at Accountemps.
good,Good place to use when you are between jobs. Make sure to keep up with your tests so they do not leave you waiting for weeks. Make sure to keep another job in mind because they might not let you know about your contract expiring till last minute.
good,"I have to say that I've enjoyed working for Robert Half as a contractor.  The pay isn't horrible, but could be better considering the level of skill I posess.  However, if you ever need a quick job and salary isn't a huge object, I've found that they come through relatively quickly.  I don't know why a lot of people aren't satisfied with the company... I've had a pretty decent experience with the company and it has landed me into a perminate role at least once.  I recommend using them as they have a lot of oppurtunities that cross their desk."
good,I have been working with them since 2016. They do a good job with finding job placements in your area. They encourage to explore and increase your work experience if desired. Its always good to send in your resume and speak to a recruiter.
good,"My time working for Office Team, Robert Half International was good for the most part. Worked in a variety of locations, industries, and job descriptions. Doing so really allows your skills to be diversified. The downside is that there is no guarantee of work on any given day should an employer decide they no longer need you. So it is what it is."
good,Once it's proven that you are available for employment opportunities Robert Half will consistently place you on adequate job assignments that pay well.  Most assignments last at least 30 days.
good,"Didn't have many permanent opportunities. "
good,"RH are very nice people and I was given so many opportunities for this company. The only thing about the RH is the pay rate is very low,  not like other staff agency they will give you a good pay which base on your experience, but other than that, people are nice and very helpful."

good,"Very satisfied with. Have worked in a number of work environments and like the type of work I've been connected on. Worked in a number of industries, both corporate, retail & business to business. I like that I've worked in a number of different kinds of markets in a large area in the Twin Cities. It's been very rewarding experience. "
good,"Good company to work with for job seeking.  Long standing reputation with quality contacts, offers additional training resources; considerate to requirements & needs"
good,"Very busy switchboard, I learned a lot about preparing depositions for court. The Management was great, workplace culture very professional.  The hardest part of the job was that it was only a temporary assignment.  The most enjoyable pat of the jo was when the firm wasn't so busy the atmosphere was like a family."
good,"Great placement, excellent people skills from recruiter, interview was pleasant, I have been assigned a job that fits my skills at this time. I love working for this company"
good,Management was good. Very helpful and supportive of assignment. Work environment good. Loved team I worked with. Enjoyed corporate environment. Wish it paid more.
good,"I was new to Buffalo area, and needed to work.  The job solution was temporary because I could work when I wanted\needed.  It gave me a great way to get to know Buffalo\suburbs\and it's companies. I worked in a variety of companies.  If I didn't like the company\work, I could call my 'agent' and tell him to get me out of there."
good,Did not have much interaction with actual Robert Half Staff. Over 99% of my daily work was at a contracted site (Allegion). I work at Allegion for exactly one year on various I.T. projects.
good,"While they are not in charge of what the culture will be like at your assignment. Robert Half recruiters are the hardest working nice people. I always felt listened to and my concerns addressed. Well worth the time to apply, while they did not find me a forever job home as I had hoped, I did earn a great wage and they treated me kindly."
good,"▪	Maintain a clean and organized work space"
good,"Robert Half is a temporary placement agency. The goal being to find you a temp to hire job. The placements and money have been good, you get paid every week. You're eligible for insurance as soon as you hit 40 hours, but the insurance is expensive and you pay roughly 50% out of pocket. Haven't had much luck with a placement turning into a full time gig but that's not their fault. They're very supportive and touch base with you on a regular basis to make sure the assignment is working out and to provide you with any feedback they may have gotten from the assignment's supervisor about you."
good,The agents are quick to respond and helpful in the job search. They helped find me a job that best fits my skill set and to also help me grow. There were also online training available and other professional resources.
good,Fun place to work but little time to have the fun as days are long and workload is significant.  Management is some of the best I've seen and everyone does their best to get the work done.

good,This was a temporary employment agency so work was not completed onsite.  The people I dealt with were friendly and helpful. They have great follow-up with clients using their temp employees.
good,"I had the freedom to do what was best at the building I was managing.  I coordinated move-ins and move-outs.  I scheduled tours, delivered packages, greeted residents, cut keys, general upkeep, security checks, and obtained quotes from vendors.  "
good,"This is a temp company. They work for the client, not you.  So remember that, & you'll do fine.  I've gotten a lot of permanent jobs through them. Some started as temporary, but became permanent after I started."
good,"Robert Half Staffing allowed me to enter the business field and gain valuable experience. I was able to find things that I liked and disliked, and it helped steer me to my current career aspirations."

While working there the employee will learn many things about the staffing industry, working with various businesses, and yourself.  Be sure to work in a location that you either love or that is close to your home because the work hours (although exciting) are quite long and therefore you need to highly balance your work life with that of you home life.

good,"A typical day at work for Robert Half would be working as an administrative assistant at any office.

The management called frequently and visited to make sure everything was okay at job sites, but didn't encourage any type of growth in jobs.My co-workers were at different job sites so they were rapidly changing. The hardest part of the job was learning a new job every few weeks, and knowing that the job wasn't going anywhere. The jobs were temporary though, so you knew they would end."

good,This is a great temp agency to work for. I have been with them for some time now and they have given me a wide range of assignments in very metro convenient locations.
good,I would really like a more active search to be done to place me in another position.  I contacted Robert Half when my position was terminated in August of 2019 and have still not been placed in a position.
good,"Learning new systems, different work environments. Meeting new people and a different way of doing things.  "
good,Have worked for them for a number of years. Pay is decent and they offer limited benefits. Your contact at the agency checks up with you while on assignment to review the position. Have an ongoing issue with payroll that has not be resolved after 6 months. But I recommend them if you aren’t proficient at networking.
good,"Apesar de ser trabalho temporario e excelente para networking ,pois nos permite vivenciar a rotina de varias empresas."
good,Recruiting managers work hard to find best fit assignments for job seekers.  Recruiting managers return phone calls and emails promptly.  Highly recommended.
good,"Robert half is a good company when locating jobs, but they lack to hire people of diversity in the high salary jobs.  They will place you in 30k position but are reluctant to place you in anything higher or prestigious if you are of any racial group of color.  This could be their client's preference.  Hopefully they will see this and change."
good,"Great recruiters, responsive, positive, encouraging.  They helped me get my start in the legal field, a join I truly love.  They placed me quickly and made sure that things were going well at my job."
good,This agency has competitive rates. I had no issues with being paid on time and the staff was friendly and professional. I have worked with them a few times and it was mostly a positive experience.
good,"I enjoyed my time at divvyDose I learned a lot about pharmacies and getting refills on meds and how to read medication prescriptions.  I learned a lot in my short time there.  Unfortunately,  they had budget cuts and I was released from my position."
good,"Never been to their offices except to interview, I deal with them primarily on phone for assignments."
good,Great place to start your career. You learn a lot and make great relationships with the employees. It also had a good amount of work life balance. People work hard and play hard.
good,A nice company to work for if looking for temporary work. They have short term and long term positions available. Gaining health benefits are not possible with this company.
good,"I was hired to work with a University which I am very familiar with. I enjoyed working with the client and Robert Half. I did the functional analysis, led a few meetings with the University officials."
good,Offers some benefits. They did not follow with the employees after the contract end. The employee is a new contrator after each contract end. They need to follow with the employees.
good,"While working through this agency I never worried, about the lack of work hours. I was always able to obtain a job through them. They are a good team."
good,I did work assignments through Accountemps while going to College to get my Bachelors degree. They offered and I received partial tuition reimbursement while going to school. I was able to get experience in my chosen field while attending school.
good,Very helpful staff. Friendly and welcoming. They will do all they can to help to find employment. Would not hesitate to seek their assistance again if needed.
good,They are a placement agency that I have worked with for several years at numerous temporary posiions. They are aware of positions that I am comfortable with.
good,"Overall being a Salaried Professional with Robert Half  can be an rewarding experience because you have an opportunity to expand you skills by working in various contractor roles if you are assigned to short term roles.  However, the down side is the possibility of Robert Half not having a new role for you when the assignment is completed."
good,"Rotina era bem definida, com visitas e prospecção ativa de novas contas."
good,"The Eugene office is outstanding!  They listen to your career goals, whether temporary or permanent, and work with you to find your next position!  And, they have on line tutorials to sharpen your skills."
good,I enjoyed my job and learned a lot of new skills. The team I worked with was great and I looked forward to coming into work everyday. I got a chance to work on equipment I hadn’t worked on before
good,"I have received assignments from Robert Half off and on for about two years. The assignments are sporadic, and I recommend that you diligently look for work at the same time."
good,"Open concept offices. Fun, good company culture. Lots of opportunity to move around company/change positions. Fun working environment, nice people, lots of learning opportunities"
good,"Great people ,good leads on jobs, kept  me  in the loop with next jobs"
good,No complaints with this company. The only thing I would say is that the company I contracted with was not fair about the job I initially went for. I worked labor and not the position I was supposed to do. They used me warehouse work.
good,"They will place you somewhere eventually, but sometimes there is a bit of a wait for a new assignment to come through, as is typical with most types of contract employment."
good,"Die Einsatzorte sind nicht immer auf die Person abgestimmt und für nur wenige Arbeitsstunden muss man oft große Entfernungen zurücklegen."
good,I have been with this staffing company for awhile but there is not enough work for me. I have been doing office services work but no temporary paralegal work.
good,I was interviewed for a temporary position which accommodated my final semester at school.  I was later referred for a temp to hire and was eventually hired permanently.
good,"Working with Robert Half is very diverse because it is a staffing agency.  Each role, opportunity and culture is different.  I feel they are good at assisting me with jobs that work with my skills, abilities and availability.  One of the hardest things each job I have had has been temporary and employees at some places are not always receptive to temps and assisting them when needed.  The most enjoyable part is strengthening skills and working in various atmospheres."
good,Was able to find work through this company in a short time. They always answered emails and phone calls. Was really appreciative of their help finding employment.
good,Loved working here. Lost job because my mother was dying of cancer and I chose her over the job. There wasn't family leave or compassion among employers at that time
good,They haven't called me back for another assignment and my contact doesn't return phone calls.   Had a great experience with a CPA firm during the tax season but haven't worked since.
good,"Its definitely about who you know and who is willing to give you a chance to show your skills. The process can be a bit much, but a cool assignment is the reward."
good,"Over the last 10 years I have worked in litigation. As you would see in my LinkedIn profile I had started in corporate law but the recession occurred creating many layoffs in that area. Thankfully after graduating with my Law Clerk diploma, but no experience, I worked as a process server with the Toronto courts so my transition into litigation was not difficult."
good,"Helpful in onboarding. Very friendly people. Since I was a contractor at a different location, I did not get much interaction with them. I have to add more to get past this review."
good,"The health benefits are pretty weak and PTO practically non-existent.  My state just enacted mandatory sick time accrual, but that is brand new. But I enjoy the working relationship I have with my recruiters."
good,I was a temporary/contract employee. They do a great job of giving you plenty of options for employment and finding the best fit for you and the employers they work with.
good,"Robert Half is a good company to work for, but when you call them to let them know that you need to talk to someone they never call you back.  they have placed me at good companies."
good,"⦁	Answered Customer phone calls , to help and guide them, give them knowledge so they will prevent making the same mistakes. We professionally help them discover easy ways to help secure thier information. We set goals for ourselves to make sure theyre satisfied within our time region. Data entry clerk as well, store data to let other fellow co workers techs informed on the issue that the customer had as well, let them know what they are headed against. Also i learned Chat text in customer serice tech."
good,Different clients had different culture and policies. Jobs are normally temporary they offered benefit and worked hard to find positions for their consultants.
good,"Robert Half/Accountemps provide a crucial service to the economy as a whole as well as individual employers and candidates. In my own experience they take great care in managing placements, and hold a ""good fit"" in high regard.  I have used them twice in my career and in both instances it has lead to opportunities for permanent employment, one of which I accepted."
good,"Robert Half is a temp agency whom I have worked for and I receive a permanent position through them and started working for Adventist Health/Cerner, what I do at my permanent position is medical follow-up and audits for home health and hospice, working with payers blue cross, blue shield, united healthcare, cigna and all hmo and ppo payers.  I love working their but I am desiring a remote position were I can work from home."
good,This is a great way to get back into the workforce or looking to change careers.  It provides a method to try on different jobs by temporary assignments.
good,The Salaried Professional (SPS) role offers variety and challenge.  Employees are rewarded for exceptional service results.  My experiences at RH have been professionally rewarding.
good,"I have only worked for RH as a part time and contractual employee."
good,"As a consultant, most of my work was Off-site from the office. My typical day at the client's site was normally very interesting, but very busy with the clients' work demands. However, most of the clients have been very flexible in regards to time off needed and over-time that needed to be put in when month end activities need to be done. However, many of RH's clients are not near to the RH office, which means many hours of commute time for the Consultant. They do have travel reimbursement though, which helps somewhat with the expense of travel to and from the clients' site."
good,"Only worked for a short time.  Not enough time to collect benefits, although they do offer medical if you are they after a certain amount of hours.  I was placed at different companies to help them."
good,"Working with the recruiter at Robert Half was great, they gave you all the details and how to proceed with the next steps.  The company they were able to find for me had great hourly pay, but you work for the agency, not the actual company you're contracted with so after your 1 year is over, no matter how great of an employee you were, you were let go and they would get another to replace you and would have to be trained all over again.  Seems ridiculous.  The agency did offer benefits but just the basics, but it's better than nothing."
good,"Account Temp-Robert Half is a good company however, Health Benefits are not good at all (and was paying for it).  Also to get Holiday pay, you must work 2,100 hours within a 52 week period."
good,"This is a job placement service. They work hard to place their employees in positions that fit the employees skill set. They pay weekly, which is very convenient."
good,A good place for temporary work with assignments where or close to where you live in the field you are looking.  Many jobs are temp to perm and in some cases the company hires you outright.  Management takes care of you
good,"Robert Half is a fairly conservative company, but I'm surrounded by a great team and an amazing manager. Aside from being in San Ramon i would recommend RH to a friend."
good,"Overall just a great place to work for, always helpful in finding a new position/assignment. Make sure you answer calls and/or emails. Best way of contact with them."
good,Typical day differed from place to place that I was hired for. The jobs were normally either Temp or Temp to Hire. I learned a lot of different things while working for them. The management were great. They all made sure everything was good and they contacted you to see if you had any questions. They were also very friendly and professional. The office environment was decent depending on where I was placed. The hardest part of the jobs were the people that I worked with for some of the job placements. The most enjoyable part of the job was the management.
good,Good people at Accountemps.  Seems to work with you if you need to get time off for important appointments.  Will get back to you in a timely manner. Nice
good,"The rating is not a reflection of Robert Half, overall, as they are a legal staffing firm.  I had very little direct interaction with anyone there on a daily basis.  However, when I did, I felt that it was very upbeat and personable."
good,"Definitely a great place to have gotten my foot in the door in the administration field.  Wonderful team and collaborative atmosphere.  Great feedback system in place. Some cons: low pay for support roles and no opportunity for advancement, unlike the recruiting teams, who make commission on placements and can advance their careers based on performance.  Fairly high turnover rate."
good,"No two days were ever the same at Robert Half. Always fast paced, always changing, always new goals to meet. The people are fun and friendly but also mostly Type A. It is most definitely a sales environment."
good,This is a temp agency. Your work day is based on the company you are assigned to. If you have issues with your assignment you have to contact the main office
good,Working for Robert Half as a Temporary Contract Advisor was  very rewarding. I was able to network and get some contacts inside the industry that I did while I was in the United States Army for many years. I learned a ton working for Robert Half and would recommend this place of employment to anyone transitioning from military to civilian life.
good,The background I was given from Robert Half did not match the information I received from the partner when interviewed.  It gave me concern if Robert Half was not truthful or the potential employer.
good,The company has grown over the years organically and has a cult-like following and internal culture.  People either love it or they move on.  Very strong training program for recruiters and sales associates.
good,The job was all it was built up to be . I came into the job ready for a new experience. The management didn’t contact me much about updates or new tasks to do each day.
good,"J'ai obtenu exactement ce que je recherchais, compte tenu de l'expérience que je possède en comptabilité: travail d'équipe, belle ambiance de travail, collègues positifs, excellent soutien d'une collègue qui m'a beaucoup aidé par sa patience et son expérience."
good,"Fun, face-paced work environment.  Sales oriented with daily goals.  Overall I would recommend. Goals were easy to reach. It's important to be a multi tasker and not afraid to pick up the phone."
good,I found working at at Accountemps (A Robert Half Co.) fun. I was sent on temporary assignments to different locations. Most of my assignments were of the bookkeeping nature on a part time basis.
good,"Although there is no job security (your assignment can end at any point with little to no notice), if you are a hard worker and find a great company, you can take advantage of the opportunities this job offers. It requires you to be PROACTIVE- call them, follow up, call again, get answers- and a good candidate and interviewer. Don't just apply for one job- apply for anything and everything you can in all surrounding areas and be thorough about follow up. My wait time between contacting Office Team and landing an interview (or three, as in one case) was less than a week both times, and I landed a job within two weeks both times as well."
good,I loved working for Robert Half and am disappointed that they did not have more work for me so that I could have continued working for them. I tried to get more work with Robert Half but they didn't have any and the Omaha market was short on opportunities so I left Omaha and moved back to the KC/St. Joseph are in Missouri to pursue other opportunities.
good,"I work at the client, so I can't tell how is the environment at Robert Half.  That being said, they always answer fast when I need them, and I always try their best to give me a solution for any problems I have."
good,The direct team that I work with is fantastic and one of the best teams.  I have grown tremendously in the time I have been with the company
good,"the last time i worked for robert half technology was in february and all i did was disconnect, move and reconnect equipmennt from one location to another."
good,My work experience was only temp to permanent but overall they found a great company for me and I ended up not excepting the job offer. Robert half is an agency and it worked for what I needed it for in that time of my life. When I was ready to move on to something else it was hard getting them to help me with that.
good,"The staff and placement managers are all very helpful, trying to find the right fit for each of their clients. I feel they have a very high success rate."
good,I enjoyes going through robert half and if I had to I would again. I was recommended by a friend and I would do the same as well if the time comes where I need to find employment again.
good,Robert Half is a great place to start a carrier. You are surrounded by wonderful people and you get exposure to client when your good work is noticed.
good,"Robert Half came to my decision due to my uncertainty to accept Aryzta job offer. I was trying to get away from the manufacturing environment so I gave Aryzta a try and fell in love with the organization. I became permanent 2 months later."
good,"Friendly staff, but assignments were not steady. Sometime 1-2 months between assignments. Staff easy to work with. Assignment expectations were usually accurate."
good,RHI has a great atmosphere. When there is work available everything is fine... it's only when the work dries up and they can't place you somewhere is there a problem. The managers are nice and organized.
good,I really like this company due to the fast job placement and high response they have as well they will not place you somewere you are not skilled at they will follow your request for a job environment.
good,I enjoy working for Account Temps they have a great team. They are always on your side. Communication is strong. Always the first agency I contact.  Nice people to work with.
good,I've done several assignments with Robert Half over the years. The pay is competitive and the experience has helped further my career. My work was mainly in the Pricing / Finance arenas in the Atlanta area.
good,"They provide quality jobs, but could be moretimely in finding work. They could aslo provide benifits at a more cost effective rate, and also pay holiday pay."
good,"The company is great, but temporary; looking for a permanent job. As with a temporary agency, there are no benefits and mostly temporary positions. I am requiring both a permanent position, and benefits."
good,"work set in order and even when issues occur they are resolved quickly, food is provided in time for a break depednig on how long we are there for. Tea work is a great part of the work environment."
good,"My position at Robert Half was as a contractor with other companies. "
good,"A very good place to learn, to gain experience also teaches you how to get ready for an interview. The hardest part of the job is securing a permanent position, a lot of companies will not buy out your contract."
good,"This is  good situation for me, because I like to work with companies that offer part time basis."
good,"Good company, with good values, very different to most other staffing companies RH are above the rest in class and professionalism, however the work life balance is terrible the company hasn't moved with the times and the bonus scheme for rookies isn't very good."
good,nice place to work would like work the on a larger scale of pay and vacation and more time off better pay work recognition more interaction with employers
good,"Nice people to work with."
good,Although there is a lot of turnover - these were some of the best people I had the pleasure of working with for 3 years. If you can find success in staffing then you will make a lot of money.
good,It's a good temporary assignment. The company takes pride in their workers suggestions and complaints. I like the every week compensation. They place you on assignments in a timely order.
good,"Officeteam works hard to get you in a job that is best suited for you. They keep in touch which is nice. I don't believe I went more than one day without a job to go to."
good,Great people and opportunities. The management went above and beyond in getting me contracts on a timely basis. Communication was constNt in addressing my needs. Clear direction and quick response time.
good,Great temp agency to work at.  Learned a lot about excel and word programs.  Various locations to choose from to work at.  Good benefits and good people.
good,"As far as temp Agencies go this company is one of the better ones. If you have a good skill set they will work hard to find you a decent job. I appreciate how hard this can be to do, when the job market is heavy with unemployable people."
good,"* Input and process client's information"
good,I didn't feel like they worked hard enough to make sure I had assignments. They also never seemed to be available to assist me in my search for employment.
good,I've had great opportunities with Robert Half that have led to permanent positions with reputable organizations. The training has always been up to date and informative. Management has always been super resourceful for permanent job placement.
good,They were very helpful in finding jobs for me.  They are a temporary agency.  I worked a various jobs and enjoyed what I did.  I don't have a lot to say.  I worked for various companies and they seemed to find good position for me.
good,"I am a hard worker, and I hoped that they would've been able to renegotiate my pay. In the long run, they were unable to and now I am working well over my pay grade."
good,"There's no push to make you a permenant employee with business after 3+ years. It's steady employment, but hard with small bonuses, no paid time off. If you're looking for temporary employment, it's probably one of your better options."
good,"The company worked quickly to place me in a position.  This temporary assignment will end soon and I look forward to my next assignment.  We are paid weekly and usually receive our check by direct deposit between Wednesday and Friday.  They are a hands-off agency, which means they don't micromanage.  However, they are there to resolve any issues that may arise."
good,Doing staff accounting work and learning new computer programs has been a plus.  It is difficult to keep leaving assignments and starting new because having to be trained for a short period of work assignment.
good,"Great company for temporary projects for administrative, marketing, and finance jobs. I wish opportunities or positions were more consistent and had higher pay."
good,Enjoy getting different work experience on different computer software. I will refer others to work there because of the flexibility. Working with this company was a good balance for work and home.
good,"I loved working with Robert Half and currently work with someone I placed at the company I work with now! Great atmosphere. You definitely have goals to meet, but every success is rewarded."
good,"The only Job I did so far was a great challenge and it was very nice to do it. The issue was trying to establish a good feedback from the client. The briefing was kind of poor, but I pull it off with two or three calls."
good,The SPS team is a great way to learn ways many different companies operate and learn different systems that are used throughout accounting. It's also a great way to be exposed to different industries.
good,I felt the management for this temporary placement agency was great to work with. They worked to provide a good experience for me as a temporary employee with the various organizations with whom they were contracted.
good,This was a great temporary place to work. I enojoyed getting to work in different offices around the city but there were offen times when i wasnt called for a job for weeks at a time. I needed something more stable
good,"I loved my Recruiter, they always looked for jobs for me."
good,Did not find that manager wanted to help you progress and would try to cause friction through the team. Managers also do not know when to praise achievement but never miss out telling you any fails. Staff are great to work with. Great benefits.
good,"Found me a position within a week. The pay is not great  but acceptable. I don't care for the lack of security with the position, but that is going to vary based on placement."
good,"Performed a variety of back office banking functions for various financial institutions; including Wells Fargo, Union Bank and Community bank. Performed branch capture functions Processed interest and Canadian checks. Entered IMS data. Perform wire verification and signature card scanning."
good,The above rating is for Sturgeon Electric ONLY - From what I experienced while there they were very generous with extra perks with the employee's.
good,There were some issues regarding communication and receiving it last minute or having to jump through hoops because they weren't timely in requesting it.  But overall I had a pleasant experience working with them.
good,Very professional approach to clients work engagement.  Very good exposure to world class firms.  Good interaction with management and other staff. Work time and days are in some cases flexible.
good,I probably could not give an accurate review. paralegal is female dominated field and male discrimination runs deep in my opinion. was never given the opportunity to explore the field I have a bachelors degree in.
good,Have been with RH for over 2 years and have moved from different divisions. Management style varies. Sales driven environment. Easy to move up if your good at sales.
good,"If you are looking to find an opportunity asap, definitely a great company to reach out, they will find you an opportunity with your needs (pay, location and duration)."
good,I had a good experience with this company. The only complaint is that they never have any work for me and are very slow at returning calls and/or emails.
good,Very nice place to work. Employees were very helpful. I learned new skills to add to my skills set. The hardest part was the mounds of mail every day.
good,"Robert Half was very professional and efficient in getting me a placement at a company. I had a wonderful manager who listened to everything I had to say and really took it into account when she was looking for placements for me. After she helped me get a placement, she came in on multiple occasions to check on how the placement was going and to ensure that I was being treated fairly and properly. I would absolutely use Robert Half again if I ever need a job quickly."
good,this company does help you to look for something quick if you are one that likes to work short assignments and not look for anything that you look at as a long term company.
good,I am at a location at a jobsite on behalf of Robert Half Staffing. It is for logistics and would be better with better training. They go over something once and expect you to understand.
good,"I had very little interaction with them once  job was found."
good,"I am disappointed in how I have been informed about job openings. No communication unless I call them."
good,"The job is really demanding. The compensation is poor, but unlimited overtime. There is stable job security. There are good management, but can change in a moment. The job culture is relaxed, but clickish."
good,"I was looking for a part time position with some flexibility in hours and/or days.  They found a job for me that fit my needs.  I love the people I work with and the work I perform.  It is a very stressful, comfortable, safe environment to work int="
good,"I have no issues with this company. Just looking to do more and spread my wings. Benefits are great (medical, dental, vision & 401K). Good place to start your career"
good,"helpful when looking for full or part time employment,  Staff is good to work with and seam to really want to help you locate employment.  Salary could be better but it is a placement agency"
good,I learned a lot from my time at Robert Half.  I was frequently asked to take on new roles and learn new things.  I enjoyed being a part of an every changing environment.  I was encouraged to share ideas and information but also had times that leadership didn't want your input and just wanted you to work.  There were times that unrealistic goals were set and expectations were to work until the goal was reached.
good,Accountemps is a well-run ship for accounting professionals looking for available temp work.  They are more responsive than most and do a good job in balancing the needs of their clients versus their talent.
good,Working as a consultant the company was very responsive and extremely helpful. They constantly followed up to ensure that the assignment was going well. The Recruiter that I worked with was very professional and we currently still have a good relationship.
good,"Very good at placing work for the temp and making sure the temp is qualified to fill the position.  The manager assigned was very aggressive with clients to secure the position.  Only downfall was temp jobs rarely lead to permanent positions and they do offer benefits but the temp has to have worked steadily for so many hours per year which is hard to do in this environment.  Also, healthcare insurance was minimal."
good,The recent positions I have had with Robert Half were great environments to work in.  Staff was pretty easy going.  The work that was assigned was pretty easy to execute and supervisor gave good direction to help in problem areas.
good,"I always thought of RH as kind of like used car salesmen.  However, it seems in the past rew years they have taken care in hiring more qualified folks who actually have worked in the field (accounting, finance etc)"
good,A typical workday is relaxed and you are kept busy. The recruiter will periodically give a follow up call to see how things are going. They start off at a salary that is just ok. I've had to reach out to get pay raises which leads me to believe that the company likes to keep a greater part of contract monies that are set with the client. I feel that if you prove yourself and are dedicated and hard working that the recruiting agency should be more willing to let go of more of the monies to reward the employee. I understand that it is a business and that the industry standard is 30-40% of monies is given to employee. If you have an employee that works hard (I've only taken 10 days approx off in 3 years) that increases should follow.
good,"I enjoyed working for Robert Half Technologies.  At that time, they did not have long-term assignments for me.  I fulfilled the ones I had but looked for a better placement opportunity."
good,"I have been placed in two jobs through Accountemps.  When I was placed, I was told that both positions were temp to perm.  The first one was actually a 6 week assignment for a company that didn't even have enough work for me to do so it was basically part time.  The most recent was also supposed to be a temp to perm placement, but the company had a hiring freeze until June 1st and the department that I worked in had yet to hire anyone.  There were some temps that had been there for over a YEAR!  I do not believe that this was due to the Accountemps, but rather that companies do not want to pay benefits, vacation and holidays.  It is a sad sitiuation."
good,"Not a lot of jobs to choose from, and not many jobs temp or temp to hire coming in on a regular basis. Very few leads for temp to hire. You have to keep in touch with the office via email or phone to get consistent leads."
good,It's a good stepping stone in the direction that you are in control of. You have the opportunity to launch a new career path. You've got to lobby for work.
good,"Worked at a few different places for them, but if you show a habit of being on time and simply working, they will bend over backwards to accommodate any situation you may have. They will also negotiate on pay if you have a long commute, or if a certain duty is rather taxing.  "
good,"I had a positive experience working with Robert Half-Office Team. "
good,"It was a temporary job, which I gave more than 100 percent of my time and dedication to."
good,"I wanted perminant employment and with Accountemps the hours required kept me as a temp far to long.  This 450/620 hours before you can be hired is too long.  There is no pay unless you work.  No holiday, sick, vacation or anything.  This I did not like..."
good,"They will find you a job based on your skills. You do take placement tests. Based on your placement tests; your hourly rate."
good,I went to work for only a short contract with Robert Half I enjoyed the work and the pay was descent if it would have been permanent I would probably still be there
good,"I would highly recommend it for people who's looking for temp jobs, they really help you to find a job no matter what you are looking for. They make sure that they keep you updated and call you every week for any opportunities!"
good,"I was assigned various office assignments and enjoyed all I came in contact with.  "
good,"I would work typically first shift customer service\data entry jobs. Most managers I would report to were genuinely nice individuals. The people I would work with were creative, knowledgeable in their field, and always willing to answer any questions I would have regarding the job. Always the enjoyable part of my assignments were the people I worked with. But sometimes the hard part would be when an assignment would end early."
good,I have worked with Robert Half/Accountemp for a long time. The people there are very business friendly. But I do feel they think they are better than any one else.
good,"A great company, with a great reputation. Some of feel they could pay us a bit more given the amount of business they do in the greater Washington DC metro."
good,"I enjoyed working the temp positions that they assigned me to, but weeks and months would go by between each job assignment to where I had to collect unemployment.  Their ""temp to hire"" status is not always guaranteed.  I just wished they had found me a position that was more on a permanent basis, but they never had."
good,It's hard to give an overall rating as my assignment was only temporary. Temp agency was helpful. Management at my various assignments were pleasant and appreciative and easy to work with

good,"After a year of unsuccessful job searching, I turned to Accountemps to get more experience on my resume.  I was changing careers so applying for other jobs proved to be very difficult since businesses want at least a year of actual work experience for any kind of consideration.  The two assignments I accepted lasted just over two months each, and I got the opportunity to improve my Excel and administrative skills.  Both jobs ended with a lay off due to the firm's lack of funds.  I was only looking for jobs that were temp-to-hire, so there were times where it would be weeks before I would be  fully employed.

good,"Good Company, high turn over with staffing managers. The job itself is difficult and high stress, but can be rewarding with time."
good,"This company is fantastic to work with! They communicate clearly, they actively stay in touch with you if there is a question you need clarification on and whether you've been with them a long time or brand new, they treat you as if you're a life long friend."
good,The company was pretty consistent with assignments on a daily to weekly basis. The part I didn't care for is that the amount of experience and education I had didn't match the pay grade even on a temp level. One company stated that the agency was taking a large portion of the cut thats why. I did like majority of the companies I was assigned too though.
good,Was great in helping me find a job. I worked with them getting experience after school in order to find out which field in accounting I wanted to go into. That is when I wanted to start doing the billing and cash side and haven't looked back.
good,Very friendly and helpful staff that facilitated the easy transfer of positions from job to job. They handle all the resumes and interviews for multiple different firms and help to match each candidate with the best job fit for them. They did not do well at finding me a permanent career but did great at getting me short term employment.
good,"I get good jobs, the pay is more than what I would make anywhere else on my own and the locations so far have been really nice. I wish the assignments I was offered were temp to perm so I could stay at a job I end up liking and being good at. "
good,i love where i was working and wish it could lasted longer it was a great assignment and learn alot from this jobs. it was very business and professional
good,RH provides the opportunity to connect with different employers in different fields on a contractual basis enabling expansion of work experiences/knowledge base.
good,"When I was brought on by Robert Half we discussed all the different opportunities I'd have through working on different projects for different companies all over the nearby area.  The benefits of being an SPS are great, but if they can find any work for you after being ""benched"" for a month, they take you off the salaried program.  What is frustrating is that once you're done with a project, there's often downtime (benchtime) between finishing one project and finding the next one.  I like to stay busy and am a workaholic, so you can imagine my frustration when I'm looking for leads to send my boss to look into so I can get back to work, even though it's not my job to find these leads, this is literally what this company is paid to do.  Please note that it was not all a negative experience, this was just the one that broke the camel's back.  For the most part, the staff is friendly and encouraging and the company offers great benefits.  I still work for them, albeit not with the advantages I once had and was promised."
good,"Great organization with plenty of room for growth. Excellent training programs, and individualized coaching. Great location, right near the Oakbrook Center Mall."
good,"Lots of clerical positions however,  they choose what place to send you to interview.   The pay is not up to par.  They should coach more on interviewing skills."
good,Be confident to be honest to the staff with what you are seeking for employment so they can do their best to help you. A staff member alway met with me after the first day after placing me at a job. They want to hear my feedback and I in turn wanted to hear the feedback from companies they had placed me. Great communication!
good,"Jobs are usually close to the area of town chosen, so the commute is often short.  Good culture at the job locations. Usually, the responsibility can be light but important."
good,"Most of jobs are temporary, and benefits are not good, but they will help you to land a good job with their clients. This is a good company if you need to get different jobs experience and get a job asap."
good,"Very hectic and busy environment, however with their excellent training program everybody is set for success if they use the given tools."
good,"A typical work day always begins with many meeting from daily goals, to cold calling scenarios to end of day wrap ups."
good,"They always kept me working.  When one assignment ended, don't worry if you did a great job with their last client they will send you to another assignment immediately."
good,"Created AR batches and applied cash received.  "
good,If I didn't need full time I would still be temping through this agency. They keep you working. When one contract is about to end they get you into another so they try to make it where you don't miss any days.
good,They found me jobs quickly and they were jobs that i was able to do with ease and related to my experience. All the recruiters i worked with were super nice and friendly.
good,I don't get enough work from them. I was a temporary worker. I still want to work for them but they have not called me in over a year for any type of work. I have called and emailed them numerous times but they have not responded to me.
good,"I enjoyed being a Concierge.  And I enjoyed the time at my work site."
good,Robert Half creates and environment that is truly beneficial for anyone starting out their career. They have a lot of great training with good word tracks. They try to keep a fun work environment as well.
good,I learned accounting and the fact that i get to meet new people and learn other career possibilities. i would love to get more training from this company to get better positions while in the market for a new job
good,RHT was only using unemployed technicians to staff immediate open short term roles. They made promises that were never kept and were dishonest about pay rate. I would still accept any role or position if offered.
good,I didn't feel that this position was right for me. It should require more training or teaching and I was thrown into this company blindsided even though the pay was decent.  I didn't really enjoy it.
good,"Working with Accountemps means that you'll likely be able to find something pretty quickly, but mostly for only the short term (a few weeks or months). The problem comes when a good company wants to keep you, but they are stuck as hiring you permanently would cost them substantially more than if they took their time to find another employee without an agency representing them. When economy is tougher, it is highly unlikely you'll end up serving the company for longer than a few months and then end up training a replacement they find for half the amount they pay the agency. "
good,The experience was with the temp was bad but Rh Is good overall. I would work there again. I would actually prefer to work there in a different city and state.
good,"The work assignments that I was sent on were good. The pay was okay, but needed more compensation and longer assignments. I would both recommend and work for this agency again."
good,Risorse umane molto sviluppato. Ambiente piacevole e confortevole.
good,"Much like any other sales careers you must hit your numbers but you're coached to do so and encouraged to balance work and your own life. It is truly a career and not a ""job."""
good,"Very strong sales focused organization. Highly focused on outbound activity and client meetings. Great place to learn the mechanics of sales as well as clienteling. Direct manager was a great coach, and mentorship has lasted throughout my career."
good,"Got placed quickly and its a little hectic for the first week, but was relatively smooth. Any problems or questions that came up were taken care of when contacted."
good,i have never used a agency before and Robert Half was quick on getting me a placement in a near by town with pay close to what i was getting before. will work with them again
good,"I have worked for Office Team since 2012 and for the most part, I didn't have any issues with the company.  I just wish that they would find a position for me that meets my needs.  I found some of the positions, lacking as far as not being able to get hired on a more permanent basis.  Some of the positions that were offered didn't pay enough or they didn't offer benefits like 401K."
good,"People at Robert Half were looking out for the individual. Helped along the way to try and find the right job for ME."
good,"I have only had one assignment, but it had been a very good experience. I have enjoyed my assignment and I am anxious to see what the next assignment challenges will present."
good,"I've always enjoyed working with Office Team. They are flexible to my schedule. They find employment for me easily. The staff is always helpful, and personable."
good,"It's been a while, but Robert half has a lot of benefits. For me, I was able to set my own schedule up to a certain degree. My interface with management was always pleasant."
good,"I don't have anything negative to say about this company. When one assignment was up, they would work to get me something asap. Definitely a place to work."
good,Contract and Direct Hire Employment Agency.  Can assist in helping get access to job opportunities that you might not find otherwise.  Must be diligent about follow up.
good,I have always had mostly all positive experiences when working with and for RH.  They have been great with finding good job placements and I really enjoyed working with the staff as an SPS Salaried Professional as well.
good,RH recruiters will work hard to find you work but the recruiters will not necessarily place you with you requirements foremost in mind. They are professional
good,"I had a very good experience at Robert Half, gaining experience in the Healthcare field that will likely prove to be invaluable for me in the future. My co-workers were wonderful people and honestly were often inspiring at times."
good,This job was a sub-contract job and provided little opportunity for advancing as.  The assignments were interesting but not that challenging.  I was assigned to various employers as needed.i
good,"This is a temporary agency.  The jobs I was sent out on were great jobs.  Being a temp employee gives you the chance to see if you like the company, work, the environment and most of all the people.  The people were very friendly and outgoing at the last position I held."
good,"Pros: Did a great job at finding me a career. They were great at helping me become acclimated with Veolia. "
good,"They were able to place me fairly quickly, but had very little support once I was placed. It was hard to hear from my supervisor and when I asked for a new placement, there was no follow through"
good,The assignments was a good way to see different office settings and experience more then just an internship.  Would have done it longer if not for needing a full-time stable job.
good,This was an easy company to work for although it takes sometime before you are eligible for any benefits. The Culture is somewhat relaxed and they make sure you are well prepared for the position assigned for .
good,Had my back. found an excellent placement. stayed in contact and followed up. Kept me informed of what was going on so I knew how long I would be there.
good,"I still work for Robert Half & have been for 8 yrs. It's been great while I'm looking for work. Eventually, I hope to land the right job in the right company for a great fit :)"
good,As a contract accountant I was exposed to many different industries.  This was my intention.  An exceedingly good opportunity to learn from various generations and management styles.
good,"Co-workers And management were always professional and made it comfortable to work with."
good,I had just moved back into town and had to find a job as soon as possible.  OfficeTeam is a reputable temporary agency affiliated with the Robert Half organization.
good,"Competitive environment with weekly, monthly and semi-annual goals. Long working days that affect the balance between personal life and work. Good salaries and bonuses at the end of the semester."
good,Liked the variety and the staff was a good environment for me and a pleasure was able to gain more knowlegde and skils fory trade and make a few friends along the way
good,"The Company would assign you to a company, telling you where to report and who to report to. Some positions were for a couple of days to months depending on what the Company's needs were."
good,This was a great company to work for there is career advancement and they have a great work culture. I had an excellent experience working here I wish I had not have had to relocate.
good,Good company to work for! You just have to work hard and stay consistant to climb up the ladder. Benifits are decent. Work/life Balance is not the greatest but they do give you flexible CTO which is the same as PTO.
good,I have worked consistently for 2 years with Robert Half.  It is great for temporary employment.  You get to preview a company before committing to it.
good,Make sure to establish a good relationship with the person helping you find placements. You can learn all kinds of good stuff. Just be open to different opportunities.
good,"i worked with vehicle titles.  They had very extensive, fairly complex filing system for the titles.  Filing, processing, retrieving, finding for customers."
good,May consider working with the company in the future. Grateful for the opportunity to gain more relevant experience in the current administrative world.
good,I enjoy working for Accountemps they are constantly checking on their employees to make sure the job is going  well and your comfortable with the employer
good,"I have nothing but appreciation for the robert half company, although I may disagree with their pay scale for the amount of skill I provided to their temporary positions."
good,Solid consulting jobs but be prepared to move around and accept different roles. The recruiters will try to play to your strengths.  Typical jobs last 4-18 months depending on role.
good,Staff was a bit difficult to get in touch with when I had concerns. the receptionists can be quite rude and had many questions as to why you needed to talk to your rep. Other than that  I had no issues.
good,The companies they placed me with was great. Some positions I worked at I wished it turned in to a full time position.  The variety of work was great.
good,"This was a great place to work. Staff seemed to care for each other. There were good lines of communications between staff and temporary employees, and good on-site coordination with host companies."
good,"Seems like clients can basically say anything and do business here.  I was put into a couple of jobs that were not what they had appeared to be.  Just basic questions need to be asked like what's your document, accounting, etc programs that you use.  That kind of thing."
good,"Unfortunately this temp agency was not able to keep me employed enough, so I had to go through other employment agencies as well as job hunting. This was during a time when many employers were not hiring, so I was forced to work through temporary employers until something more permanent came up."
good,"Most days in my position was monitoring network, systems and applications. Management was good and bad, like any company. The culture is work hard and get rewarded. The hardest part of the job was getting new tasks to perform but not getting quite enough background and training. The most enjoyable part of the job was mastering a new task and being able to solve a problem and prevent an outage. Also like working with the support personnel and being able to assist them."
good,"Only worked one assignment for them and it was a good experience for the most part.  Good, friendly office atmosphere, but supervisor was a little inpatient with me.  Seemed like a good company though with room to advance."
good,I worked with Accountemps as a temporary. They placed me in a field that I had experience and enjoyed the ease of the working environment. Very pleasant experience.
good,This staffing company effectively places employee candidates on temporary and permanent positions.  Their team is skilled and trained to make the best working environments with the candidates they have.  They're good at what they do.
good,I have used Accountemps for many years and I highly recommend them. They provide a variety of jobs and opportunities for those either starting their careers or those within their career who want differernt opportunities.
good,"Good temporary agency. Was hired out for a few temporary assignments short term, then eventually placed long term with a company that I ended up being recruited to."
good,"A good Company to Start your career, Lot to learn here about Retail Industries, Competition, Logistics in Modern Trade. Supply Chain part and Operational work."
good,"Processed"
good,"I've used Robert Half/Accounttemps twice over the past five years.  Each time they quickly placed me in a position where I was able to succeed.  I didn't stay long enough to qualify for benefits but they seemed reasonable, not great."
good,"learned so much within a short period of time, fast pace of work but also relaxing when you know what you are doing. friendly environment and good place to start a new career."
good,"I enjoyed working for Robert Half at Follett School Solutions.  Follett is a great company to work for and the position is one that has growth and learning with it.  A typical day would be receiving assignments from the manager, contacting the client associated with the assignment to schedule a presentation meeting.  Requesting an implementation specialist to be a part of the presentation meeting. Hosting a presentation of the Destiny system and scheduling the implementation of the software system and any training that is purchased by the client. I would follow up on any questions or concerns the client had.  This would be done for multiple clients daily.  The people working at Follett School Solutions are really great and I really would love to work there for Follett."
good,"Robert Half is a good employer to work for, I am just looking for a permanent position that is closer to home. Again it is that life and work balance that I seek."
good,The staff at the temp service are nice. They find good jobs & good wages. They are willing to work with me verification using skype to verify who I am instead of a long drive to St. Pete. Job is local which I like. Would prefer a smaller fee for companies wishing to take temps to perm but I understand the nature of the business.
good,The management at RH were amazing. i worked through them for an Austin company called a Apogee doing some laid back fun IT/ customer service work. great communication between the temp service and the client as well as feed back to temp employees.
good,I worked a temp to hire job so I didn't have a lot of exposure to the staff at Robert Half. I really only worked with the people where I eventually became employed.
good,The temporary positions that were assigned through Robert Half were temp to hire. I enjoyed working with the assigned Clients. I would work with Robert Half at anytime.
good,Great if you need an income quickly. Multiple positions available. Paid weekly via direct deposit. The recruiters are very nice and they understand when you have emergencies come up.
good,"it varied due the assignments I would go on,  there was a large variety of opportunity to learn several different new skills on different computer programs"
good,"I’ve worked for Robert Half for less than a year. The staff was very helpful in placing me. Sometimes the placement was sporadic and I would be off 2-3 weeks at a time. If you are looking for something consistent, it can be a challenge. Overall assignments were good and they work hard to ensure you are a right fit."
good,"One job, recalled 4 times as work needs fluctuated, worked most of two years with just 1-3 weeks between recalls.  Pay at the time many years ago was ok, don't know about today.  Did not follow up with me when contract ended. Management seemed good but a little impersonal, maybe due to the size of the organization-they are one of the largest agencies in the country."
good,"Robert Half representative teams will work to match your skills to clients.  If they don't have openings, they will use outsourcing media to help generate some leads."
good,"The job I initially took was relocated to New York less than two weeks into training. We were told by the company hiring us that we would have to move to keep our contract which I was unable to accomodate. RH was able to place me into another position within the same firm in less than a week, which they had no obligation to do. I was eventually hired on full time and have been with that firm for 3 years. The workload as a consultant was much lighter. Since then my roles and responsibilities have grown significantly. Would definitely reccomend RH to anyone looking for job placement."
good,Robert Half (Office Team) is a good agency to work with.  Staff was responsive and collaborative when I worked with them.  The agency resolved an issue with a client who asked me to perform a questionable task. .
good,Accountemps is a great place to work. They work hard to find work for people. They provide training. They are very supportive of the needs of their people.
good,I learned about commissions and processing checks to Realtors and Property Managers. I also learned how to input the information of the clients into the Long and Foster system.
good,"You never get a raise or a vacation; If you are ok with that, its an excellent place to work. You also cannot just request to move to another position- you have to put in a notice (2 wk notice like quitting) and hope for a new position or you will be jobless."
good,They are often quick to contact you with new job opportunities. You can be working sometimes within a week. Management was courteious and weekly pay is nice.
good,"Very good employment recruiters. They assesed my resume, qualifications and researched temporary employment opportunites.  Made an effort to accomodate my hours, traveling time and placed me in suitable jobs."
good,"My coordinator was amazing to work with, she did everything she could to find a good matching position for me.  She also followed up with me periodically through the assignments to insure I was happy."
good,"As a contractor through Robert Half, the least enjoyable part has been the low pay and lack of vacation/sick days. It is easy to take the time off but not getting paid for it is awful."
good,Great place to start and they really help you get noticed for hard work. They work very hard to get you a position that suits your skills and talends and follow up with you all along the way on how it's going.
good,Temporary service is a good option while looking for a permanent position to be offered.  I have worked with accountemps a few times and have always found a good position through the company.
good,"Office work that required staying on the phone calling for 8 hours a day. Majority of calls were pleasant, your pay after training phase was determined on whether or not you could get someone to pay on a medical bill. This position takes a certain type of person."
good,"Busy, lack of job role fairness, great compensation, hard working team, heavy work load, poor time management, not much paid time off, management turn over is moderate"
good,"Not a bad place to work for , they had frequent short term postings and were very flexible. Never felt pressured to take a posting and the various jobs were interesting"
good,"Fayetteville, AR branch is always on top of trying to find you a position. They try to make sure you make what you are worth. They try to meet your needs."
good,"they will find you a job within weeks, temp to perm is a bit of a hassle, wish the pay rates were higher since i know accountemps gets paid more than enough for me."
good,"I enjoy meeting new people. I enjoy resolving vendor related problems.  I enjoy working with numerous vendors, and field managers.  The heavy workload kept me busy throughout the day."
good,"Bad result to an assignment that was on track to becoming permanent.  The company I was working for filed chapter 7 unexpectedly.  I really liked working for the leadership I reported to and was looking forward to becoming a permanent employee.  I enjoyed the team I was on, I liked the job I was performing.  I just wish the business would have continued."
good,Great place to work and get a variety of assignments in different industries. Extremely flexible schedule and relatively good benefits for a temporary staffing agency while looking for my dream job.
good,I received job placement fairly fast & they were easy to work with & followed up with me to make sure my assignment was going well & was a good fit for me.
good,I have used Robert Half on more than one occasion to help me find temporary work while i am job searching. I have also taken a temporary assignment and moved to a permanent one through them.
good,I had a good work experience working for the team. Very professional and they usually get back to you in a timely manner. I have no negative comments about the company.
good,The management is amazing at Robert Half. They really look out for their employees and try to always get them the best positions possible. Have really good companies on board as well.
good,"One of the advantages of working at Robert Half, is the exposure to various working environments which leads to work experiences in various industries."
good,I loved working and communicating with Robert Half. just being a temp everything feels less valid that you do. They let me work at Crabtree and Evelyn and the working environment there was fantastic. I will miss the people.
good,"Wonderful client placement opportunities. Professionally run organization. The number 1 in the industry. This is from a temp's perspective, not an internal employee."
good,"superviser le travail et les employés à la production de la paye"
good,The jobs come few and far between.  I didn't appreciate being told jobs where available and yet when I called they couldn't place me due to no current jobs.  That speaks volumes about what kind of company it really is.  I also don't believe they are strong advocates for those working for them.  When an issue arises they need to stand behind those they employ not leave them out to dry.
good,"Very stressful, but potentially rewarding position. The office culture is great, and it can be truly life changing. Most of the big customers are taken locally, but if you put the work in, it can be great."
good,"Accountemps is a good place to get you foot in the door on some of their job assignments, It is also a good way to see that you are a good fit for long term employment with an assigned company"
good,I was interviewed to see what the best placement would be. I ended up being placed with an Employer as a temporary worker and was fortunate to be hired full-time with the same Employer.
good,Robert Half is a temp agency. The people are nice and work hard to find positions when I contact them for work. The management staff on contract jobs do a good job of treating everyone fairly. They usually manage about 200 people per contract and yet they manage to be personable and engaging when you approach them.
good,Love working with Rober Half. The people there are always nice and helpful in getting you a placement in job. Its a good start to get your self into a career.
good,Good temp positions - good variety of jobs. RHL places you in interesting positions that usually last some months or a year or so. Flexibility to work when you want.
good,"A good place to start you recruiting career. Good training program, hard work, good networking. 1st year have to put in a lot of hours to build your book of business."
good,It is a temporary agency so it is what is to be expected. When they receive assignments you are given a call if the assignment and you are a good match
good,"If you prove you are a valuable worker and professional, Accountemps really works hard to put you to work quickly."
good,"After initial interview with the agency, all interaction is via telephone/email. Salary is provided by the placement agency but job duties/requirements are unique to each separate company worked for."
good,I worked on various projects to provide Human Resources support for clients that may need temporary support. This could be due to a HR Professionals going on leave or a high volume of support needed for a short period of time.
good,"I worked at Veins clinics of America, I think it was great company  to work for overall however their were expectations that couldn't be met at times.  The staff was pleasant. The manager at Robert half  told me they were looking to hire someone full time however the managers at Vein clinics were not certain of their availability.  Robert Half is a good company to work for."
good,Stressful in not knowing how long the job assignment would play out.  I was always nervous about being laid off whenever sent to a temporary job assignment throughout town.
good,"They're very knowledgeable about the market and can help you advance your career. They stay extremely busy, so know that going into it as a contractor."
good,This was a temporary assignment. You have to be willing to learn the assigned job culture which offered opportunity for growth and to learn how apply new skills with old skills. You had opportunity to  apply what you were taught in school to real life experience.
good,Good experience in the Administrative Assistant role. would recommend to any one that wants a temporary role in Calgary. Hard to find jobs at this time of the economy though. Not many opportunities .
good,I enjoyed working for Office Team & Workway. Always called to see if I was available for receptionist positions. Great temporary to hire companies that work with the employee to find a great fitting job.
good,"I have been with the Agency for about 20 years, since I lived in New York. They have offices all over. I have received good positions through them that almost always lead up to permanent positions."
good,"The typical day was average, not too many problems. There were different job routines which improved. The workplace culture was acceptable. The position was not hard to work and the enjoyable part of the job was interacting with other employees."
good,"Robert half is great, "
good,Steady employment. Easy to communicate with.  Enjoy the variety of positions.  Very thorough during interview.   Concerned about goals and matching accurately.
good,This is a temporary service.  I worked several jobs with this organization that I enjoyed for the most part.  The office staff is nice and responsive.
good,communication could have been better but otherwise it was a good experience. i loved the manager and the commitment robert half had with its employees.
good,"Robert Half is actually a temporary agency so jobs will vary.  Any time I walked in there, the atmosphere was mostly calm; though, I'm sure, like any other place, it could get stressful at times.  The people do contact me from time to time to check up on me to make sure I'm still okay with my particular assignment; however, I have not heard any feedback from the last time anyone contacted me."
good,"Robert Half / Accountemps is a great company for gaining experience.  The recruiters try to fit assignments to your wants and needs.  Also, they check to see if all is well while you are on assignment."
good,"They care for their employees including temps very well. Very nice working environment. They are up to date with technology and they provide all kinds of refresher courses like Excel, QuickBooks, SAP on an ongoing basis to all employees and temps."
good,Robert Half works to match clients with qualified talented candidates and does a great job on behalf of both parties. There could be more ongoing training provided to stay current in the business culture with continuous changes however there was always support and encouragement with a stress on beating and exceeding expectations.
good,"Office Team has been an awesome employer for me the past year. They communicate extremely well before, during, and after assignments. They really care about placing you where you best fit."
good,I've used their services for many many years and have increased my skill set tremendously.  They always work with my schedule and have sent me to some terrific companies.
good,"I worked assignments at the time i did not receive any medical or dental benefits, because i was a Temp but i learned a lot and i enjoyed the experience."
good,Great company to work for if you're between jobs and looking for a new challenge.  They have the resources necessary to find a position within many of their clients within a short period of time.
good,Office Team provided me with job assignments that kept my work skills fresh while completing an education.  The positions varied in pay rate as well as duties and kept me engaged with other working professionals.
good,They found me a job very quickly with the desired amount and location I needed. They have a great team and staff. The process and interview was very quick and simple.
good,My days at CCWRD are very rewarding. The IT Support Services Team is very nice to work with. The end users are pleasantly friendly and the environment is low stress and very happy. I enjoyed every minute there!
good,Robert Half will find a perfect fit for a position to your liking.  The staff is wonderful and nice!  They will find a job for you when you have a hard time finding one!
good,I did not work directly at the company. I worked as a contractor for RHI. They paid a fair salary and the recruiters were very respectful and friendly.
good,"The team has been friendly and helpful especially out of the lynnwood office in washington.  A lot of temp to hire jobs. Time to find work can be long- so don't think next day you'll have work. It can take over a week, which honestly sucks, but they work at finding something that suits you."
good,"Have had the opportunity to work with/through Robert Half and Accountemps over a number of years. Some with success, others not. Truly learned much while at Gift of Adoption Fund and was glad I could fill in for a medical leave at Curt Joa."
good,"Once assigned to a division of the accounts payable department, it was very busy and continuous work.  Most coworkers were enjoyable to meet and work with."
good,"If something sounds like I wouldn't be interested in doing it, they have no problem with me declining the job.  Some of my assignments have been less than a day and one was 5 weeks."
good,"With 7 lines of business, each is team in each market is different but overall it is a good company.  I think the technology group is more progressive than the business LOBs."
good,"My experience working through Robert Half Legal Staffing has been mostly positive.  The staff are friendly and professional, and they are good at listening to what you are looking for in a position."
good,"Great company to work for when looking for contract or temporary work. As long as you are skilled, friendly & flexible then work will be assigned to you. My last assignment was for a semi-permanent position in Las Vegas at a hospital. Enjoyed the work & the environment I worked it."
good,Working with Robert Half has been quite rewarding.  They were persistent in the beginning to locate a job opportunity that would support my preferences.
good,I was thankful for the many jobs that Robert Half assigned to me but unfortunately the pay was too low. The staff was helpful and were easily available.
good,"Robert Half is a nice company. The company has great clients and pay benefits: 401K, dental insurance, vision insurance. You are usually on one client for 3-6 months, can be longer or shorter."
good,I really liked working with th agency but it was only Part time positions and i need a full time position to take care of my needs and to grow with a company that i could retire from.

good,"I spent time working at Robert Half through OfficeTeam when I took a year off from university and had a great experience with them. There isn't really a ""typical day"" because you are often at one office for a day and another the next. But, in my experience I primarily worked in offices as an assistant or receptionist. These gigs were anywhere from 1 day to 2 months long and the pay was okay, typically $14-16/hour, but in some cases I recieved over-time pay which was great. They also pay you every week which is something I liked! If the recuiter calls you with a job that you are not interested in, they are typically fine with you turning it down (I did this for some opportunities that were only for a day) so it has flexibility. Overall, I would reccommend OfficeTeam to anyone who is in between jobs and wants to gain administrative experience!"
good,"A typical day starts greeting the people at the office, checking the agenda and plans made for the day: interviews, reviews, documentation, emails to be sent. Speaking to the employees in charge of the engagement, finding out their priorities and any questions or comments, meeting with the engagement team reviewing the main points discussed  with the employees in charge of the engagement and if needed adjusting the  schedules. Before leaving the office, I review the tasks pending and completed, and verify if all necessary communication has been done. In addition, I adjust my priorities list."

good,Great company to work for. Fun work place with supportive management with a positive work environment. decent amount of pressure as in a any big company.
good,"Upon arrival, I check my personal email and open up my tracker. If I do not have any work, I ask for work. If I do have an assignment, I work on that until it is complete. I may have only one error or one queue a day or I may have multiple errors or queues. There is no play or fun, it is all work and constantly thinking and analyzing."

good,A typical day consist of creating and distributing a daily coverage to all workers with in the department as well as collecting important data for departmental audits. I learned the importance of keeping track of medical data for auditing purposes. I feel that the management in this position is very understanding and holds the department together as well as keeps everyone on the correct path. There are over 75 co-workers in my department alone and I enjoy working with every single one of them as I have learned so much from them since I became part of the team. The hardest part of the position is sometimes being able to fit all tasks into an 8 hour day. I enjoy working with my co-worker as well as learning something new everyday!
good,I was assigned to BCI through this company. When job ended they had me out on other interviews.
good,"I am a temporary employee, my typical day at work is very relaxed and comfortable, and my current position has afforded me the opportunity to work on a daily basis in MS Access. My co-workers are great to work with, I enjoy casual Mondays/Fridays, the flexibility, and I am only a few miles from home."
good,This position was a project to reconcile payroll accounts after the payroll system was outsourced to another company for processing. It was a challenging project that enabled me to bridge the gap between permanent employers and granted the flexibility I needed at the time for my family.
good,I've worked with robert half/accountemps for a while now and I have only been placed in one job. I would like a more consistant work flow.
good,A delightful experience at Quest Laboratories. Would appreciate employment opportunities at this time.
good,Excellent company to work with starting out of school. Very good at looking for jobs for you and keeping in contact with you
good,"Reliable, recognized company, celebrated in the Industry for professional advancement."
good,"Good reference to a host of open positions, was referred to temp to hire permanent positions in accounting, different management and co-workers were a good exposure to office working environments."
good,I have worked for Accountemps for a couple months as a full-time temp. The type of work I performed were basic accounting duties as well as general data entry for clients that the company (where I have been placed) had business with. My daily responsibilities included:
good,Typical day at work is very face paced and production driven.
good,Analysis of mainframe programs to compare coded business rules to extracted business rules coming out of an automated tool.
good,I had a very good experience working for Accountemps. I would recommend them to anyone. They are very proactive and attentive to your needs.
good,"I applied through them many times over many years. The previous 2 or 3 times I was forgotten. They never got back to me. But after they locked me into a position, they stayed with me even for good side jobs."
good,Learn the recruitment process and sales in a fast pace environment
good,Friendly atmosphere with type A typical sales personnel. Numbers focused/driven. Must be able to multi-task and be very customer oriented for this position
good,Providing phone and desktop support to clients. Documenting problems and resolution steps.
good,Enjoyed assignment and co-workers. Ok it was just temporary assignment.
good,The opportunity to meet different people due to the constant change of assingments. Learning and growing as an individual experiencing the challenges encountered with the process of the new environment.
good,This was a place that put me in to a temp to hire position 8 years ago and has always checked up on me to see how things were going. I felt so welcome in this company that tehy had multiple request for me and never wanted me to leave.
good,One of the best temporary companies I've worked for. The recruiters were friendly and very helpful.
good,"They try but are not always sucessful at the goals they set. Assignments are in far away, desolate areas"
good,Overall I have enjoyed working with Office Team that are very efficient and quick to find you a new assignment once you've completed assignment. Typically they do their best to match you with the right clients so far I have worked for the companies and I have picked new skills that are valuable.
good,"With my reputaion being strong for Accountemps and Robert Half, I was able to build relationships and resources that have proved invaluable in my current feild."
good,They tried to keep you working as much as possible. I did not have a problem with them answering questions. And they treated you with respect.
good,The hardest part of my work place was finding to fit in. Everyone expected you to know your job with five minutes training. Just because you are a temporary person . My suggestions is take notes and asks  a lot of questions. Make sure you got down or you will loss out your future benefits. Be positive and determine. I suggest looking the part and acting the part too. G.O.A.T.
good,I was able to find employment through this company.  My only issue was that they were not as attentive after I was placed on a job site.  Other contractors were more attentive I noticed.
good,"Typical contracting company, minimal interview process, not much interaction after placement. Have to inquire about new projects when assignment is over."
good,They are excellent in finding temporary employment.  The company's I was assigned I enjoyed being their as well as the work load which kept me busy from the time I arrived until the time I left. Flexibility and working environment I've enjoyed thoroughly.
good,Working through this firm has been a great way to experience different workplace cultures.  You are never blindsided as to what an assignment/contract entails.  Your input is always welcome.  They do a good job of matching your skills to a client. One drawback is that the downtime between contracts can be longer than desired.
good,"This was a good place to work for my first office job. They have fairly high turnover, and pay about average in the beginning. You can earn more as you improve and move up within the company. Different work environments depending on which team you join."
good,"If you like an environment and job duties that change every few weeks or months, this a great company to work with. The only down side to staffing agencies is that the work may not be consistent- one week you could work 40 hours, the next week may be 25 hours. It depends on the client."
good,"Overall company has been a positive experience for me. I have worked for Office Team here in Florida as well as Phoenix Arizona and have had the best people find assignments for me. One that went from a temporary position to permanent job in Phoenix,"
good,They keep me pretty busy.  They are good at pulling and filling between clients with their own candidates.  They know how to match people and assignments for a good fit.  They also try to accommodate candidate’s personal interests where possible.
good,I learned Vision. Typically I had to expect the unexpected.  Workplace culture was inclusive. Challenge was to embrace structure. I appreciated  client feedback.
good,If you are looking for accounting/financial/admin assistant type of work then this is the temp agency to use. I was pleased with with them. They locate relevant positions quickly and were very easy going.
good,"thus far it has been a good experience , the  hiring agents keep the lines of communication open . they look out for you and keep you employed.I am fairly new  but so far I have no complaints. If you are looking for short term employment and like meeting new people , this agency is right for you."
good,"Friendly colleagues, ready to help with any questions, including "
good,Role and duties are given to you. Not stressful. Great companies to work for and get great references. They invest in their people. They let you train on courses at no expense. A diversity culture.
good,"Depending on company that you are assigned to your days can range from light to heavy. "
good,Nice job assignments.  They get you interviews with local companies.  Staff is quick to answer questions and pay is weekly.  Easy in login with your phone to record timesheet.
good,"Great company philosophy, brand & culture.  I highly recommend Starkey Hearing Technologies as an awesome place of employment! I enjoyed the work, variety of projects, diversity and culture."
good,I was pleased with my time at RF. My recruiter was hands on and explained job descriptions thoroughly and in-depth. Asked my preferences and what I felt was a suitable atmosphere for me.
good,"I was in desperate need of a job and I received a call from them and I was employed within a week!  They brought me in for the initial interview and was able to find a job tailored to my needs, commute time and schedule."
good,"Robert Half took great care to understand my employment needs and scheduling.  They treated me with great respect as a professional, and not just a ""warm body"" as other staffing agencies tend to do.  They found jobs for me that were an excellent fit for my needs and the employers.  The RH staff was always highly professional, courteous and intentional in their communications."
good,I would go into work everyday at 8:00 AM and prepare to make 50+ outbound dials to build a successful book of business. I would also schedule offsite meeting in the afternoon to share market data and information for today's labor market.
good,Gets you the experience you need to build your career but for low pay. The agent takes apart of the pay you would've received if gotten the job yourself.
good,Very good company to go through to match your skill set and finds you work quickly. this company is a temp agency and is not a place of employment recruiters are very easy to work with.
good,Very good place to work.  Website fairly easy to use.  Staffing manager well informed and very communicative. Paid every week and benefits provided.  Good experience
good,"Learn all you can, work diligently, negotiate the pay. Be a team player and first do your work that you were hired for. Then offer assistance when ever you can. Do not be afraid to ask for additional work, especially something that will help you move forward in your career."
good,"Robert Half ( Office Team) has a professional, family orientated environment. Their agents work fast and efficiently for great job selection for both temporary and permanent placement."
good,It was a great experience. Working as a contractor is a little bit different than working as a full-time employee but is not bad at all. Will do it again.
good,Robert Half was recommended by a friend who had worked with them.  The interview process was easy and the recruiters are great to work with.  Getting a new assignment when one ends is pretty seamless.
good,Great recruiters to work with that are very responsive and supportive of me when interviewing for short term roles. The team works diligently to get me places in roles and provides great feedback that is constructive and useful to help me grow in my projects.
good,"Account Temp  is a ok place to find work if you are looking for part time, or temp work. They were quick to find me an assignment, the pay isn't all that great but they will keep you working."
good,"Hardest part of the job was all the various systems, or lack thereof, to efficiently do the work.  Many of the people in my department were able to work from home one day a week."
good,I would recommend them if you are looking for a temporary position. They were great to work with. I worked with them for several months while looking for a permanent position.
good,Jobs are with good companies and the working conditions are good for the kinds of work that they hire you to do.  Clients are courteous and RH  is professional.
good,"I've had the privilege to work various positions within this company on temporary and contract basis."
good,"My experience has been fun! Some assignments not so good, others were enriching. The greatthing about working with recruites is they are looking to make both the employers and employees fit well."
good,"A lot of reviews for this company were referring to what the company you're placed with would do, in lieu of what Office Team does.  That would need to be a review for that company Office Team places you with.  I worked for Office Team until my contract expired with them, and the company they placed me on hired me on as their employee.  Office Team literally had very little contact with me, which I did not mind.  I do not know about other areas but for mine, they negotiated exactly what I wanted to make.  So what if they charged the company more if I'm making what I expect?  That is how temp agencies make money. "
good,"Need to support temp workers against abrasive attitudes of clients."
good,"Robert Half is a great place to work, A typical day at work starts with a call-in to your manager and then fulfilling the client's requests. I learned that acquiring skillsets in different areas opens your mind up to new possibilities. Management is really excellent and the workplace is supportive. The hardest part of the job is the potential frequent changes to the job, or division one may be assigned to. It is enjoyable to learn new things constantly. One of the advantages is the ability to move to a different company assignment, if a current assignment is not working out."
good,"Great Company with worklife balance. Lot of benefit for employees which really counts. Highly recommended. Nice people to work with., Nice office, great view.1"
good,"Structured, learning environment.  Flexible with schedule/work day.  Provided for a good work life balance and took a sincere interest and value in work/life balance."
good,Really enjoyed working at Robert Half. They help coach you into growing your career there. The culture is business professional with casual Friday optional
good,"I enjoyed this job for a while, but ended up deciding it is not the best opportunity for me. Individual with the right mindset and drive within sales and staffing would do great in this role."
good,Very professional co workers. Many opportunities with lots of  great companies that arent usual available or easy to find. Flexiable. Easy to work with.
good,They were great with keeping in touch with me while on work assignments. I could reach out to anyone at the office and they would be more than happy to assist me. Great with placing you with jobs that fit your experience and skills
good,The company will help you to find your dream job. Will guide you all the way until you get hired. Management are very helpful and accommodating. Excellent
good,"Opportunities to work as a salaried consultant exposes you to new companies and different industries. Only drawback is the need for travel to different locations with every new engagement. "
good,"When working for Accountemps, they were able to keep me busy with temporary assignments. I found 2 full time positions through them that worked out well at the time."
good,"They found me a decent job very quickly.  The job did not work out for me, but my recruiter seems to be diligently seeking a new position for me.  I have hope that they will find me something quickly."
good,"Time spent processing and managing clients payroll activity."
good,Great environment and the ability to work remotely is nice as well. the only draw back is that there is a constant draw against your paycheck. The compensation aspect can be a bit troublesome
good,I was found for a specialty on a short term contract - was provided excellent support by RHT recruiters and staff.  Would definitely work for them again!
good,I have been on assignment for over a year and Robert Half checks in periodically but they trust that you are professional and are doing your job.  They do keep in touch with the contact employee that you work under for updates.  Overall it has been a great experience.
good,7:30 am to 6:00 pm great work environment.  Structured employee training.  Mentor program great work life balance in the workplace culture.  Hardest part of the job - maintaining productivity- the sale.  The most enjoyable part of the job is the great team mentality !!

good,"Job Placement, Recruiting and Marketing"
good,The process of finding employment with Accountemps  is very easy.  They take pride in matching your skills to the perfect job setting.  They are diligent in finding assignments quickly.
good,The thing I do not like about account temps is that they are about the company they are placing an employee into.  They will only allow you to have an average increase in pay of 5%.  This is unacceptable.

good,"This is a temporary agency for clerical help.  They have a very upscale group of businesses they work with and expect you to be as professional as they are.  Because they charge the client so much for providing this service, expectations by the customer are sometimes unrealistic, however, when the client has experienced my work ethic, I have had no problem exceeding their expectations.  I enjoy the change of position and learn so much from each company.  Hopefully I will find my ""forever job"" working through this company!!!"
good,"Good place to work for better paying jobs than the general population is used to, although temporary. "

good,"Accountemps is a good temporary placement agency. They are quick to put you to work, but then tend to leave you on the job with minimal contact. You will have to drive your own career with this company. This is not a place to go if you are looking for stability. This is a very good place to go if you are between employers and need to have a paycheck coming in."
good,Officeteam was a great staffing agency to work for. They kept me busy and always had a job opportunity for me the whole three years that I worked for them. They were very consistent with providing employment opportunities for me.
good,"Great Place to work! "
good,You get paid weekly and the companies core  values are outstanding. The workplaces they assign you to are mostly 500 companies. Accountemps also makes sure you are up to date with the last software.
good,"Accountemps was able to find a temporary position immediately. Hopefully, assignments will continue to come through once this one is completed."
good,"Wages were decent. The definitely answered all my questions about the job they were sending me to. I wish that I can work for Accountemps at any time. The most enjoyable part of the job was my co-workers. I learned a lot about foreclosure as Accountemps sent me to Claims Recovery Financial Services in Albion, NY to work for them."
good,"Consultant for SPS has potential to find many additional skills in different company environments to add to your wheelhouse."
good,I enjoy working at officeTeam. They are friendly and caring staff. They care about your needs and try hard to match you with your profession. Thank you officeTeam!
good,"Enjoyed the places I was sent to on a temporary basis"
good,"This was something that I have never done before, insurance. There is a learning curve because there are so many companies and they have multiple names for one company. Other than that it was a great place to work for."
good,I only had one assignment from Robert Half and did enjoy it.  The down side is that the manager did not provide the same account of job responsibilities as the company for which I covered the property manager while she was on medical leave.
good,"I have not had the opportunity to work here very long, but what I have seen thus far is very positive.  Communication in Robert Half is very good.  It is a very open, worker friendly environment.  I would recommend Robert Half as an employer for anyone that has that opportunity."
good,"My employers were good organizations to work for.  The pay is not all that great but the environments were nice and most of the managers were, too. Accountemps was very helpful and supportive wherever I worked."
good,People who worked with Rh they are very friendly and knowledgeable. They did help me to find local jobs. i had great experience so far with them......
good,"Robert Half is a staffing agency that placed me with CFSearch Marketing on a temp-to-perm basis. CFSearch Marketing optimizes website traffic for vehicle dealerships, and is a certified MOPAR advertiser. The position itself required writing and re-writing vehicle listings, creating original content each time. There was also editing and back-end website work."
good,I work on various projects throughout the year for many different companies.  I enjoy the change of opportunities that come from the position. As a result I can learn from various different companies and see positives and negatives from many without jumping from company to company.
good,"A challenging environment with spurts of intense office activities."
good,"its easy job i learn something new i enjoyed working there the paid was not really good but overall it was OK  "
good,"Accountemps did well in matching me with appropriate temp assignments.  I wish there were more or that some of them had turned into full time.  They also presented me with two permanent full time positions which would have been great, I unfortunately did not get either one.  I got as far as the last two people for the job.  They take the time to match me with the appropriate jobs where I will be happy and their client will be happy."
good,"I was able to use my pc skills and excel expertise to complete tasks at several employers."
good,"I have worked a number of jobs in the San Diego area since moving here in December 2016. My first job placement lead me to getting a full-time job in a position I did not have a degree but the company believed I could perform well. And I did, although career wise it wasn't the direction for me it gave me great experience, more network connections, and a greater confidence in myself."
good,"It has been a while since I last worked for Office Team in Los Angeles, however I still think of my time with them fondly.  Personally, I really enjoyed and appreciated the experience gained from working so many types of jobs and most all of the placements I had were several weeks or more at a time.  I would recommend the company to anyone starting out- or starting over- as a great place to find excellent work opportunities and experience."
good,This company is a staff agency that is quick to put you into work. Finds the perfect job for your experience. Works around your schedule. Fair pay its provided.
good,Very good place to work.  Placement is excellent and they really try to place you in the position that will be a good fit for you as well as the place if employment.
good,"When I work there, I worked with portfolio managers that each were responsible for providing staffing for various companies in their respective portfolios. They would look through resumes to find a good fit and interview you if they though you could do the job. Then you would report to the company in question and do whatever work was needed for the duration of the contract."
good,My recruiter was great however the other handlers were ridiculous to deal with because they didn't all know what was going on. Rather than being mediators they ONLY sided on their own instead of both the clients at hand.
good,Enjoyed working for both agencies.  Express Staffing at the time gave me more assignments.  The staff was efficient and the assignments were in a convenient area.
good,"Good job/work like balance; accommodating work schedules. "
good,"Robert Half is an agency that leads us to work in the best companies based in São Paulo, through this agency I had the opportunity to develop a job in the company Inbrands which is a large company in the clothing business."

good,"Robert half Finaces & Accounting,"
good,It is a good place to work.  I have learned many different things at Robert Half.  My department was team based and worked well together.  I would suggest working at Robert Half.

good,"Good management that treats employees fairly. A great way for students coming out of college to get there foot in the door with a company, or someone looking for temporary work between jobs."
good,"I have greatly enjoyed working with Robert Half International in a variety of placements over several years. Being a military spouse and moving to a new location every few years, Robert Half International has helped different companies and myself find a good fit.  Robert Half International saves companies and myself time and money in labor costs."
good,You're placed in mostly customer service positions. The positions they place you in are decent for someone looking for a temp job. I wouldn't make this a long term decision.
good,Love the current position that I am in love my coworkers and bosses.  Have not meant anyone I do not like nor have I met a challenge that i could not tackle

good,"As a consultant, you feel appreciated and the company strives to build a good relationship with the consultant."
good,It was a pleasure having an opportunity to work with Robert Half Technology. They were very engaging and heavily involve throughout the job placement and interviewing process.
good,the assignment that I've with Robert Half was enjoyable. one of the assignment that they sent me on was the work load was very heavy with the amount of money they wanted you to work for.  I thought that was unfair to have some one to work for a large company that you had to handle a two person job.  that was the hardest part of the job that I did not like and I ask to be replace some where else.  The company that I work for that was an administrative position and not a clerk position.
good,Tended to give me temp positions the opposite of the direction that my career was going. Found positions based on what was at the moment instead of waiting for opportunities that fit the individual;.
good,Helped me to earn a living while not being able to secure a permanent full time job. I was always matched with positions that matched my qualifications.
good,"I have done several contracts through Robert Half"
good,As a accounting consultant for Robert Half you gain knowledge and experience in various industries and multiple companies. The placement staff works hard to get you into companies that best suit your experience and environment choice. A drawback is the inability to become extremely well versed in a specific industry.
good,"Robert half is a very professional and very successful. On a scale 1-10, I would rate Robert Half at least an 8.They are very persistent in their job searches."
good,Never give up finding work with Robert Half Technology because there are hundreds of people competing to get placed too and so be consistent with contacting staff. This company is great with customer service satisfaction.
good,"I have had mostly good luck with Robert Half."
good,"A typical day at work here started with you turning on your computer signing in, setting up for calls putting on your head set and getting ready for calls. This was a fast paced environment where you rarely had nothing to do. You have to learn how to multitask as you will be taking calls and typing up reports, filling out information for sales and doing over the phone computer troubleshooting. Its a blast. Management is great! They are happy to help when there is trouble, they understand what the job is like so they rarely get upset with you. The people here are friendly and fun, fast talkers who become great work friends. The hardest part of the job is that you will have people calling just to yell at you because something about the site or the tickets they purchased without help have upset them. It is rarely the fault of the person getting yelled at. You learn great people skills from this though, not to mention get some funny stories for parties and future interviews. Its most enjoyable part of this job is the people you work with, everyone here is fun. Great coworkers! Also if you like fast paced work you never get bored working here."
good,I have been satisfied with Robert Half.  They have been both professional and ethical in their interactions with me.  I look forward to working for them in the future.
good,My days at work are quite peaceful. Management and the other co-workers are warm and friendly and maintain a high level of respect. The work is predominantly easy and I enjoy that everyone gets along very well with each other.
good,I enjoyed it. It was only a temp job for open enrollment from Oct thru Feb. I would take calls and assist the patients who would call and sometimes needed help on the plans that were available.
good,"management is easy to work for. They were very supportive of issues I've had and made sure I felt like my needs were important."
good,"I have held three different temporary positions through Office Team/Robert Half. The recruiter I have worked with has been very proactive in looking for work for me. She is the only one I have worked with, so I can't say how the others are, but based on my experience, I would recommend registering with their agency."
good,"Caters more to client than employee.  Overall not a bad place to work.  Job security is good, benefits, time off.  Some assignments are long and can be grueling.  Need better pay and reps need to consider locations are good for employees."
good,A good company with lots of short term contract with some a lot of the major players.  Wish there were more long term contract of 1-2 years and more permanent work.
good,"Last time they assigned me was over a year ago.  Not enough assignments to keep me busy.he hardest part of working with Accountemps is waiting for assignments. "
good,"Is Robert Half associated with Manpower and other temp agencies?  If so, I have had the pleasure of working for them and hopefully would be able to find me another job as I am ready to get back on the work force."
good,"This is a job placement agency, different experiences, hardest part is getting use to your co workers and the position and it being only a term position"
good,"Staff works hard to find jobs that meet the skills of the temporary worker."
good,"Work is slow, we need work right now.  The $20/hr for me is low but something is better then nothing at the moment.  Have not been back yet, have not been called out."
good,"Log on to a computer and type you had to make sure you let them know what you were doing every minute of the day by putting what you process onto a system called Omega."

good,"Executive Assistant to CEO and his Wife at a 500 company."
good,I was a candidate at the company but was considered for many positions there. I was placed at a company for temp to hire but during my time I was able to pay the bills I needed so that I can stay afloat in this economy.
good,its a really great company full of wonderful people they are always on top of everything and always willing to help no matter what
good,I wish they would be more  clear on temp to full and contract.  Other than that they pay on time and management as good to me. I learned a lot about loan mortgages
good,"I love those working in Mechanicsburg, PA office. Professional, helpful, and fight for you to help keep you working. The pay they get and companies are lower grade but working with an office that cares is nice. Had trouble with my pay check this last time and they corrected it that day! They work hard to find a job you will fit in with regarding your skills and have free training or refresher courses while you are employed you can use whenever you want...very big bonus."
good,"A typical day starts greeting the people at the office, checking the agenda and plans made for the day: interviews, reviews, documentation, emails to be sent. Speaking to the engagement contact persons, finding out their priorities and any inquires or comments, meeting with the engagement team reviewing the main points discussed  with the employees in charge of the engagement and if needed adjusting the  schedules. Before leaving the office, I review the tasks pending and completed, and verify if all necessary communication has been done. In addition, I adjust my priorities list."
good,"My supervisor now is wonderful. He checks in with us once in a while, makes sure we know that we can call him any time that we need to, and is a genuinely great person to interact with. My placement has been a great experience as well."
good,"My typical day at work is processing invoices, answering phone calls, and filing any invoices to files. As a part of processing invoices, I spend most of my time scanning invoices to our billing system. Everyone is very thoughtful and was able to work a schedule around my school schedule. The most enjoyable part of the job is being able to complete my task accordingly and being able to help accountants with any invoices."
good,"Accountemps offered me long-term assignments that kept me working. I got to experience the companies I would want to work for. I learned a lot about other accounting software. Most of all, I went from temporary to permanent thanks to Accountemps."
good,"Robert Half is a pleasant place to work. Great employees. I have learned a lot of flexibility working with them, however, I would rather work for a company that provides better benefits."
good,"Typical day at work consists of working on branch reports, reconciling branch revenue, formatting resumes,  setting up recruiters appointments and occasionally setting up for team events. It's very fast paced. A lot of multiple requests at once, so you always want to prioritize. However, if your team is supportive and fun, you can expect to have a good time."
good,"very good temp service to work for, team was nice and punctual with information about the company. away available when issue or problem occur."
good,"My niece was a traveling pediatric oncology nurse, I took a year and traveled with her in California and Texas.  Robert Half provided me the services for temporary full time placement.  Working as a executive assistant in Ventura, California during tax season.  I ran the front office, and set up appointments for the president of the company.  My boss was smart and funny, there were only 3 of us, and we got along great.  I loved meeting the clients and getting to know them.  The hardest part of the job was knowing I was going to move to Houston and had to leave.   On arrival in Houston Robert Half staff had interviews awaiting me, and I was hired at Allied Waste/Republic Services for a 6 month full time placement.  I learned everything there is to know about the waste industry...including riding on a garbage truck, and a roll off truck, going to a landfill...pretty stinky there in 110 degree Houston. The field trips were a great way to gain hands on knowledge for assisting customers with complaints and providing superior customer service. Best manager I ever worked for, the co-workers were a close knit group and welcoming to new employees.  The hardest part of the job was dealing with irate customers who didn't want to pay for trash service, it is required by the city, and is not a choice.  The most enjoyable part of the job was scheduling roll off trucks."
good,"I work with a great team of people that bring a spirited enthusiasm to a productive environment. An established, consistent set of standards and expectations, that was not contradicted from manager to manager, would benefit the department."

Getting through many managerial and functional layers posed a challenge  Yet, the wide level of flexibility to accomplish responsibilities was encouraging."
good,"I enjoyed the position and the people I worked with. I learned a ton from this company. Management was supportive and let us have enough free reign to get our jobs done. I found compensation a little low and didn't agree with some of the strategic decisions that the management took. "

good,"Robert Half is an excellent company that tries very hard to do well for both its clients and employees.

good,"Robert Half Agency is professional and dedicated to finding the right job for you.  They gave me the opportunity to enhance my office management and administrative skills by offering online training."
good,I had worked with many agencies and found this to be the most professional.  The recruiters are always trying to make things better and work hard to find you employment.  Pay scale is above what other agencies offer for the same type of work.

good,"OfficeTeam/Robert Half is a fantastic staffing company for anyone who is wanting to work in various fields and gain valuable experience before deciding on a permanent field.

good,"I have enjoyed working for Robert Half so far.  They have placed me in a temp-to-hire position which has unfortunately lost their approval to hire for the position that I have worked in for nearly four months.  i have learned a lot in this position and hope to be able to further my learning and experience in my next role."
good,Working with different companies and learning different things. Recruiters were very good with making sure you had an assignment.

Answering phones and answering questions. I've learned new different techniques as an office clerk in a medical office. My Co-Workers were easily adaptable, hardworking, team players that individually have a strong work ethic.

And the most enjoyable part of the job was just learning something new and getting to know a medical office setting."
good,Office Team was great when I needed temporary or supplemental work.  They were great with contacting me for positions they thought would best fit my needs.
good,A typical day at work was arriving 5-10 minutes early and preparing myself for the busy day ahead. Constantly updating my Excel spreadsheet of all youth that were assigned to me for case management. Management was good and always made sure that myself and other co-workers were on top of their cases. Co-workers were always helpful if you ran into a problem that they had already dealt with. The hardest part of the job making sure you case noted every single activity done with youth on case load.

good,Agents are always friendly and try to get people into jobs they will enjoy.
good,"I have worked for OfficeTeam (Robert Half International's administrative staffing branch) for about seven years in three major cities.  It is a good organization overall but there definitely are ""hit-and-misses"" along the way with the jobs assigned.  I have worked on multi-million dollar projects to sweeping floors in an old, chemical warehouse.  RHI's OfficeTeam does well when it is feasible in the marketplace as they can only give you assignments that's out there in the community."
good,"If you are not dependant on the salary could be fun for you.  Job vary and most of the people are happy you are there.  I had lots of receptionist positions and you need to bring a book.  Some let you surf the web."

good,The creative group has been very willing to work with me and make adjustments as my desires and needs have changed throughout my career path. They are kind and almost always available to make time for you.
good,"I enjoy interacting with the staff at Robert Half and Office Team. Their clients could provide them with more information at times prior to tasking them with finding staff. They do the best to get missing information in a timely manner. Any cons go along with working in the temporary staffing industry and are not specific to this agency. I would, and have, recommended this staffing agency to others."
good,In my position as a software developer I had autonomy to pursue solutions for our clients and was provided the support by my team at RHT to successfully complete our mission. RHT provided a good benefit package while also being somewhat competitive with salary. The culture was great when we were able to meet our fellow colleagues and share our experiences.
good,"As any agency, it can take time to place you. East lansing office tries their best to place you in a job you are qualified and pays what you are asking."
good,Knowledgeable recruiters extremely professional cares about placing you the right position. Routinely follows up with you while on assignment.. Recruiters always returned call and emails by the end of the day.
good,What can i say about a temp agency except this agency is one of the top notch and fun to work with. pay is very good and the work is always there to do.
good,"They helped me greatly Summer 2016.  For 2017, they helped me for the most part but preferred to not have me work full-time during the day that summer, because I was finishing up my final semester of college and needed Tuesdays through Thursdays off during July and August.  "
good,I work through them for a medical insurance company. It was an amazing experience. The people were great to work with and everyone made you feel like you were family.
good,"The reception here is a bit stand-offish, but the account managers are very friendly and helpful. There is space for work and training at the facility, but is discouraged and only used for testing in favor of ""at home"" training and testing, which doesn't work for everyone. I'm a bit spoiled by my experience at Professional Staffing Group of Boston, which had professional advancement work stations at the office and really helped me land them two full-hire commissions. Low paying ""starter"" positions here, such as Data Entry, seemed to be lacking in favor of meatier 14-18$ hour temp jobfinds. The skillsport tutorials are outstanding, and they do a great job of interviewing and trying to match what employees and employers are looking for."
good,"While I enjoy working for Accountemps, I prefer to work, not stay home and wait for a phone call.  I enjoy talking with the people at my home office and they will answer any question I have."
good,"brilliant management! very efficient on health & Safety, very informative, not really any job security. very good at understanding on family commitments. always willing to help on a professional and personal level."
good,"A typical day at work was such that you had to be a quick-learner and adaptive to changing work settings.  I did so successfully in all assignments."
good,"Robert Half is a temping agency, so I would receive a phone call whenever they needed a position at a company filled and based on the hours of the job I either was or wasn't able to fill the position. I enjoyed every job that I worked for. It was a variety form car dealerships to working at urgent care. Being able to work at different companies you gain experience of dealing with different situations and completing different tasks."
good,I worked for another temp agency and it was very nice at first but then I did not have any type of communication with them. This agency was on the ball and answered my questions quickly.
good,I didn't learn much and it was very difficult to get into contact with my employer. I was assigned a temporary position and was promised another position that would better suit my skills.
good,I really enjoyed working for Robert Half. I have learned several things while on the job. The management was friendly and willing to work with you. Also would help when it came to your assignments and hours that you needed.
good,Robert Half was a fun place to work. I learned a lot and had a terrific boss at the Beachwood branch. We worked long and hard hours but you were rewarded with a generous bonus program.
good,Great company to work for. Downside you don’t get paid to be off (no holidays or sick pay). Because your a temp must work a year to receive any of these benefits. Missing work and not getting paid for some could mean not eating or having money to pay for medication. The team checks on you weekly to see how your doing and if you need anything.
good,"I enjoyed working with the company, competent people."
good,"A typical day was making payments and receiving payments to various entities within the company for projects. It is critical to make sure any account is posted correctly. Management is needing to be backed up for there business decisions. This is the most enjoyable part of the job, knowing you completed your job at the end of the day. ."
good,"Groupe ayant un belle assise financière, notorité mondiale. "
good,The company Robert Half placed me at had a fantastic culture. However the two top manager could not come to an agreement to hire me full time. One had negotiated salary and benefits one day the the other said the company could not afford the buy-out from the short term contract.
good,Good Company to work for. I enjoyed working as a leasing agent at some different properties at Robert Half. My supervisors were nice and so were all the residents
good,"Although the pay and benefits could be better, as long as I did a good job, I knew I'd have a new assignment each time a finished an assignment.  Most assignments were good, some were bad, but all in all, Robert Half was easy to work with."
good,For some reason without warning I stopped receiving calls for jobs. I really loved this company. I really wish someone would have returned my numerous emails and phone calls.
good,Michele & I have a good relationship. She finds me very appropriate & timely positions! I trust her to place me without too much delay!  I appreciate her work for me!
good,Accountemps does a great job of placing you with a company that you can learn new skills and experience.  Constant communication with you on the progression of the work.
good,Accountemps provide productive and centrally located environments and fun workplace. I fell that the salaries for contract employees are low and not compatible to the market rates.
good,I was always busy and there was opportunity for overtime.  I have worked with Robert Half for many years and have great positions with them whether it was temp or temp to hire.
good,"they sent me to several different jobs until was got hired into a company, i finished all the work i was sent to do. they were very helpful in placing into a great job."
good,It was very oriented place to work and everyone got along great. We would have pot lucks every Friday.  We did insurance for different company's when people would go to the doctors.

good,They were able to get me job fairly quick from when I first applied with them. The staff was helpful and in my corner to help me find some work in a a timely manner.
good,"strong motivation is key to any development of a productive workplace, and acknowledgment of handwork goes a log way. Robert Half is very good about communication, but I really wish more opportunities to hardworking temp employees were offered on a more regular basis."
good,"I've worked for multiple agencies over the years and the Office Team staff in Perrysburg, OH have been wonderful. They're always keeping in touch and keeping me updated on jobs that I may be interested in.  Even when I was employed elsewhere they'd still check in about once a month. The pay schedule is more determined by the job you're on and when your hours get approved and I've never missed a paycheck. I'm currently working with them again to find another opportunity after another agency left me high and dry with absolutely nothing."
good,"Your role as a consultant means you are there to do a specific job, but ultimately you don't ""own"" the role as an employee would. That can be a challenging for certain indviduals."
good,"My assignment was too short - we finished the job in 4 weeks and it was expected to last 6 weeks so my time at Robert Half was cut short.  I loved the people and the work, although the work was not well thought out and divided up well."
good,"Robert Half is a good company.  They are always helpful in helping you to succeed in a position."
good,Working for Robert Half has been a great experience. Trying to find part time work to fit my hours has not been easy but Robert  Half has been able to. I have loved the various positions and new experience I've gained from my assignments. I look forward to see where they send me next!
good,The best placement company I have ever worked for.  I wish I could work for this company full time and would accept if there were the opportunity for a permanent position.
good,"pay was okay but communication was horrible. Even when you called in your availability, you would have to stay on top of them if you wanted to work.  They would also try to lowball you with the pay if you let them"
good,"Robert Half honed in on my aspirations in a career, and the agents I worked with were quite helpful in assisting me to find employment.  I landed a few assignments for successful companies, which also fortunately had a matching culture to what I was looking for.  They have a great team!"
good,If you show initiative and work hard they are always willing to make sure you have a job to go too. They also encourage finding a full time job and do not penalize you when you give your 2 weeks notice after finding one.
good,I was placed at a few temporary locations with this company. The staff are fabulous to work with! I was given a variety of duties and loved the variety!
good,I do not physically work there since they send me on temporary positions.  They have been helpful with my resume and check to see if the current position I am on is working out for me.
good,I updated and re imaged desktops to be compatible with the new point of sale system that was installed. I re imaged desktop in a PXE environment and installed drivers for printers and scanners.
good,Robert Half is a proffesional and courteous agency which takes pride in their placement and supports their agents to the best of their ability in the roles that they find for them. They are willing to work with their agents to find an amicable solution to the day to day of balancing the needs of finding a job with personal life.
good,"Working for Robert Half International was a wonderful opportunity.The employer, employee rappor and exchange was a Win/Win from beginning to end. Great group,they always accomodated and sought assignments that were perfect. A long non-stop day was sometimes rewarded with lunch/dinner, etc."
good,After long time break I started work for RHI at client location.            Very flexible and friendly atmosphere. Lot of fun activities.          Staffing service is so good. Lots of Jobs!! Weekly Pay!!
good,"Overall the Maine office had assignments for me every week. "

The website for reporting my time was never a problem to get to or fill out.
good,"A typical day will vary from company to company."
good,"The company provides an exciting and professional environment. Great people to work with and learn from, and a lot of great challenges."
good,I enjoyed going through Robert Half to land a temp position. The only thing is that what I was being hired and paid for is not what I ended up doing. But overall it was/is a great experience
good,"Enjoyed working at various job assignments, where you get to meet new people, and gain insight on the operations of different companies and an overview of how their accounting departments are run."
good,Productive enviorment with room for advancement. You get to meet lots of interesting people by working for accounttemps.
good,"While the diversity in experience and exposure is great, the clients are smaller and growth is limited.  Working as a salaried professional through Accountemps is a great way to gain experience in different industries and specializations without committing to a company."
good,Smooth mornings. Energetic people to work with. Understandings bosses. Employee were treated very well. Compensation was very fair for the work being done.
good,If you have qualifications they may place you. Some recruiters are better than others you must be active in communicating with them or you can get lost in the shuffle.
good,Managers allows consultants to manage their time and engagements to foster a positive working relationship with the client and foster great work life balance. I most enjoy getting the opportunity to work in various industries; however the hardest part is transitioning from client to client after developing a solid rapport with the current client.
good,This place was filled with great people to work alongside. They offer great benefits and various flexible assignments in the area.
good,"Professional Office that cares about the Clients and Employees that work on the assignments and assuring that they are a fit for the position that they are placed in. "

good,"This temp agency had me working since day one i signed up with them. I did not have to worry about not liking an assignment, they made sure i was always comfortable and they made sure I had a good paying job."
good,"Placement concurs with work experience, agents are easy to contact, and they are pretty quick to find available jobs.  The downfall is that assignments are temporary and I need something permanent."
good,Great staff that will assist you with finding a temporary job when it is difficult on your own.  I only struggle with getting paid during the holidays even after 2 years of service because of strict hours that you  must work in order to access holiday pay.
good,"I was hired by Robert Half on behalf of Promontory Financial Group. "
good,"Very good genuine company, always looking out for your best interest, trying to motivate you into doing better."

good,Most of the positions were highly professional. I was their go-to for confidential assignments with little or no notice. The staffing managers were polite and professional. Most of all of my assignments were also professional. I always worked well with my temporary colleagues. The hardest part of the job was leaving at the end of the assignment. The best part was meeting new people and tackling new challenges.
good,"I am currently full time working as an accounting/admin. assistant for George Webb Corporate office in Waukesha  where I manage accounts payable and receivables on a corporate level, as well as payroll for our 120 corporate employees. The culture of my company is fun and upbeat, I enjoy seeing my co-workers and managers because it is just a positive environment. My job is very diverse which makes it enjoyable, because I am doing something different everyday. The most difficult part of my job would have to be prioritizing and time managing. Our office is a small tight nit group, which is wonderful but it also means that each person has a heavy load and we all need to keep up so that it doesn't slow down the whole operation."
good,Great way to get skills needed for your career. Staff is very helpful and work to get you the best pay and jobs availible.
good,"This company is a temporary agency.  I have had numerous assignements, in a variety of industries, so I can't really describe a ""typical"" day."

good,"I was here for six months as a Business Analyst intern. I can't really complain, it started my career in IT and the team that I worked with was friendly for the most part."
good,"Awesome recruiters"
good,"A typical day at work is hard but it's enjoyable because of the challenges that arise and the comforting atmosphere where people are wanting to help if you have any problems. I would come in and grab a tea from the kitchen, sit down in a cubicle and commence my work. I've learned that everyone's work in the office is connected and what I mean by this is that there are many divisions in the company and they all work together to help an individual get a job and on Mondays they always congratulate the teams that have done well and give encouragement to the other teams to keep up the good work. My co-workers are amazing and they're really helpful and friendly. The hardest part of the job I would say is trying to stay focused sometimes because sitting in that cubicle from 9-5 is kind of tiring and I would say the most enjoyable part is meeting new people and enjoying the atmosphere of different personalities."
good,"A typical day at work would include sending emails, confirming compliance with safety standards, and communicating with managers daily. I've learned plenty of skills from excel. Management is really helpful and informative. The co-workers are fun and eager to learn and work. The hardest part of the job would be the month-end reporting. However, the month-end reporting is the most enjoyable part of the job because of the challenges that it presents."

good,Easy to connect with management
good,prompt in placing me in temporary positions until I find a full time permanent position
good,"Robert Half internal workings are much like any highly competitive company. The role I played as a Staffing Manager is highly competitive and must meet certain daily, weekly and monthly metrics. It is an obtainable metrics that they hold there staff too. Since a majority of the position is a sales role I will focus on that. As far as sales go the weekly model they use is a intense roller coaster. Most sales position are based off monthly goals, but the nature of the Staffing industry is weekly. Simply put it makes every week a new challenge, so you better be ready and eager to go at it every day!"
good,"A typical day was full of accounts payable and receivable jobs. I learned a lot about accounting at the assignments I was sent to. The management was good. I got along very well with my co-workers and they are very smart and knowledgeable. I really do not think there were any hard parts to these jobs. But the most enjoyable was the amount of work I had and how very, very busy I was. I felt useful and that I was really helping a company."

good,"To write a review, the kind of the one RH would be expecting, a closer look is definitely necessary. Even though I have been interviewed and admitted, I’m sure that having a time more than what I’ve had the chance to spend there, the balance would be Great. I’m really Glad to have been admitted, and I look forward to having much more experiences. Thank you so. PKD."
good,"This was my first experience with a temp agency, as I had recently relocated.  They quickly and easily found a job that was exactly what I was looking for.  If I ever went temp route again, I'd definitely give them a call."

good,Accountemps is an agency that helps you find a job in the field you want to be in. It gets you at first a temporary position to gain the experience that you might not have received in order for you to receive the permanent position you are looking for. I only had retail management experience and wanted something that was better hours with less stress. Accountemps helped me get a temporary position to gain experience in an office setting that I would not have had otherwise.

Once you are hired there is a representative who comes out at least once a month to check on you and ensure that you are liking the position and to answer any questions. I am very happy to be working with them!
good,"I worked as a temp in the Office Team division of Robert Half for three years.  The staff was excellent, my needs were always met, and though I wish the pay had been higher during some assignments and Job Security is a joke when you're a Temp, it honestly was some of the most fun I've ever had as an employee.  I loved the diversity of assignments the most.  If you enjoy being challenged and trying new things, I recommend spending some time with Robert Half."
good,"Robert Half and Office Team have a good crew for hiring temps. They are very friendly towards the people they are trying to help and offer any assistance as far as training or multiple chances for testing."
good,"I work with 13 different directors to source for IT talent across the United States. During my time here I have grown my knowledge of the IT industry to the point of being able to speak intelligently and confidently with prospective candidates. The management is great, and does not interfere with what I was hired to do. My co-workers are a wonderful, diverse group of individuals, each with their own unique traits and personalities. The hardest part of my job is also the most enjoyable, and that is being able to speak to many different skillsets as well as to candidates from all walks of life including entry-level to C-leve."
good,"A typical day including meeting with families to discuss their life insurance needs, door-to-door collection of cash and check premium payments and calling to schedule insurance reviews.  The education provided pertaining to products made it easier to service consumer. Management was very supportive and understanding when production levels did not meet quoto.  The position was very enjoyable because there was a new adventure everyday - meeting with clients to ensure they were provided with adequate coverage in case of an emergency, job lost or death."
good,The Office Team in Surrey is great to work with and very supportive.
good,"Robert Half Office Team is the first staffing agency that I ever used and the only one which found me fairly consistent work. Recently, however, I have been trying to get positions with them and am getting little response."
good,I started working with OfficeTeam as a way to supplement my income. I've gained valuable experience along the way and the networking I've done may be of use later.
good,I only wish I was more busy. There never seems to be enough work.
good,"Due to the fact that Office Team provided me with temporary positions, job security was always an issue. However, they provided encouragement and sent me on assignments where my co-workers were both diligent and friendly."
good,"I love Robert Half/Office Team. With various job assignments, so many new skillsets are learned. Great Place with Great Management."
good,This a temporary employment agency to work for if you are looking only for temporary/contract work
good,"They work with you to find you a great fitting position. Nice personnel, clean offices, they keep in touch with you to make sure you have a job."
good,"Worked at Robert half as a contractor. I felt that the people that I worked with/for were very approachable which is very important. I also felt that I was a part of a ""family""; which is great. However, the HC benefits, I believe, were not great."
good,I was responsible for retrieving patient medical charts for doctor and nursing appointments. I would prepare the medical charts for the next day's appointments and retrieve/file charts as needed throughout the day.
good,Great place to work if you are looking for stability. Lousy place to work if you are looking for growth opportunities in your own department.
good,"Great place to work. Very nice people, very good co worker, nice atmosphere."
good,staffing specialists are always helpful. fast placements.
good,They are very proficient in helping you find a place to work and what best fits your needs. They try to get you as close to the pay rate and job of choice. Per your preferences
good,"I enjoyed working for Roberthalf. Through them I was able to obtain full time, permanent employment.They are a relaxed company to work for, however, the pay is not enough to live off of in the Collin County area."
good,Robert Half Technology was very productive and always knew what job to pursue for me.  Robert Half employees were  hardworking and were all very nice and great to work with.
good,"The job I had was good but found out the pay was contracted less than another agency."
good,"I would receive assignments from various clientele, for more than fair compensation. Upon completion of the assignments, I would receive compensation."
good,This company has found most of my jobs for me including temp to hire. Robert Half is a very good staffing agency for  placement work . I have always chose Robert half to work for.
good,Robert Half provided the best support system to their contract employees. They placed the hires at jobs that matched their skill levels and adequate support to enable their hires to function well at work. The compensation package was also excellent.
good,"Office Team is one of the best employment services companies I have ever worked for. They treated you with respect and only contacted you about assignments that you were a great fit for. They kept me constantly on assignment, they gave me a bonus every year, I received paid holidays after a year and I was offered health benefits immediately. I could contact them either via phone or email and never have to worry about not receiving a response back the same day or the very next business day. They were always polite and genuine to me over the phone and in person. I would not hesitate working for them again in the future."
good,"Robert Half never has the limitations on what you can do to be successful within the company. If you are willing to put in the work, the rewards come right along with it. Also, the workplace environment is exceptional."
good,Good company go apply  excellent people nice work environment if they would give me another chance I would go back.  😀😀😀😀😀😀😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃😃 Make sure you work really hard show your skills and smile everyday. Everybody is loving and caring also.
good,"I worked with Accountemps through Robert Half. It was a great experience. They Communicate really well, and helped us to feel comfortable in our new role. They also provided resume classes to prepare us for our next job."
good,I enjoyed being able to work at different companies.  Having a manager that looked out for you.  Hardest part of the job was not having an assignment to go to.  Enjoy part of the job was meeting new people.
good,"Robert Half is a fantastic employment agency that has helped me find work a number of times in the past year. Their people are polite and punctual, and attentive to clients' and temps' needs. I would thoroughly recommend Robert Half to anyone else looking for Temp work or work placement."
good,"I think Robert half is an amazing company! They have top of the line software, and the training has been so beneficial to the position. The company offers a lot and although it is hard work, it is a great company to work for!"
good,Highly recommend this company to anyone who is looking for employment.  Just need to make yourself available when a job offer present itself.  Will work with you to make sure you are okay on any placed assignment.
good,"Wonderful reputation with local employers.  "
good,I was only with them for a short time due to medical problems.  Very nice place to gain employment.  Great place to learn more skills.
good,go in learn duties and perform to the best of your abilities.  If you don't know ask.great folks to work with. Willing to help with thing you don't fully understand
good,Had lots of fun learning new things. I have had lots of new small projects that needed to be complete but I finished too soon there for my job ended very quickly. I wished it could've lasted a lot longer.
good,Accountemps is a very good company to work for with a variety of positions that a person can work at specializing in accounting work. I work on three temporary assignments for them and found the work interesting and challenging. As a temporary company goes this is a very good one.
good,"During my time working for Office Team, the staff was readily available to listen and respond to my needs.  The team is courteous and trustworthy."
good,"Apesar de ter sido somente minha empregadora nos trabalhos temporários que realizei em duas empresas, eu nunca tive problema e sempre pagaram tudo certinho, além da comunicação sempre foi muito favorável."
good,"A typical day at work consists of: Medical billing for three Specialty Practices in the Delaware Family Area, Followed up on all claims, setting up payments arrangements, working on appeals and denials. I have learned from this job to maintain extreme organizational skills.  Our office was extremely large, management was fine however it was more individual and independent working. The more difficult part of this job was trying to retrieve money from people who were not able to give it or were at their lowest point in life at the time.  The most enjoyable part of this job was able to make my goals and maintain my monthly quota."
good,I enjoy working at Robert Half. All employees I have worked with are very professional and really know what they are doing. A great example to the technology profession
good,Office Team Temp Agency gave me the opportunity to work for the American Cancer Society. Specifically for the Making Strides Against Breast Cancer 5k Walk on May 4th. It was an amazing experience! The people I worked with were terrific and the staff at Office were always very helpful.
good,Great place to work. Friendly environment with fun and positive co-workers.
good,Loved being a part of the company. Everyone was very supportive.
good,"I worked for temp accounting agencies for 8 years while going to school and looking for a permanent position. They helped me get through the tough times I encountered while living in the Minneapolis, MN area when employers would not hire me for any excuse that they could come up with. (Over or under qualified, No BSBA degree etc)"
good,"Good pay and they were helpful and quick to find a good placement. "
good,"I have been with RHMR for 3 years now and have a very nice variety of jobs. Yes, some of the client environments were somewhat depressing but this comes with the territory and is not the norm. 80% of the time spent on client visits have been pleasant although the month end close process at any company at the beginning of each month can bring about the usual stress along with about 10-15 extra OT hours. The rest of the month is usually a cakewalk and it is pretty easy to get in the standard 40 hrs/per week WITHOUT the grueling 60 hr/weeks that most employees at those clients are forced to work. If you have a family like i do TIME is so much more IMPORTANT than gobs of money which salaried corporations usually do not give those employees the benefit of enjoying anyway. Plus, if you think about it IS THERE REALLY SUCH THING as a PERMANENT JOB anymore?? Sure you are a contractor but the benefits offered along with fantastic work/life balance is worth every bit of being a ROBERT HALF EMPLOYEE. In this day an age of EXTREME COST CUTTING along with unrealistic corpoate objectives (that i see with many of our clients) it is better to be a RH employee which almost FREES YOU from the SHACKLES of Corporate 'Serf-dom'. If you are lucky enough to have the skillsets RH needs you will do pretty well for yourself here!"
good,I would highly recommend working for Office team the staff was very friendly and helpful. I received a job very quickly and I love it. The work place were I was placed was amazing.
good,"This is a temp service so the jobs were difference all the time and would last for a week at a time and sometimes, up to two months. I did a lot of data entry work."
good,"Working here was the highlight of my career. The office environment was fun yet challenging. Compensation was well worth the day to day challenges. If given the opportunity to work here again, I'd definitely return. Yes, the hours can be long but it can also be rewarding financially and for future career opportunities within the firm. Sales calls are easy because the lists are already there for you. Meeting quotas can be done easily as long as you plan accordingly everyday and put in the effort. This is definitely a team environment. You have support in every direction from Admin, to Management, from Corporate to I.T. Every Manager in every department has the genuine spirit to help you succeed."
good,"On the rare occasions when they've offered me work, RobertHalf Technology has sent me on jobs that perfectly match my personality and working style. Great if you want an enjoyable, engaging job once every six months."
good,"Great company to work for, enjoyed the experience. Learned a lot about the company, enjoyed the fact that they would provide training for more skills in order to find employment opportunities."
good,I loved working with them but a lot of the times they would forget to get back to me with anything. I used to work with a different person who used to work at the salt lake location (she's the one who set me up at Wells Fargo) but she ended up moving to New York and I really tried to be understanding about learning the ropes but it's been that way ever since. This was in 2013
good,I've been with them since March and so far so good. The company that I was placed with was very nice. AND THEY PAY WEEKLY!!!! I'm wrapping up my first assignment this week.
good,When they do have work they are really great companies.  They got me a job with CBIZ and I loved that assignment.  The hours great and the other employees were very helpful.
good,Great company to work for. They do care about their employees and work/ life balance. I love job culture and dynamics there. You can grow if you hired.
good,Fun work place with supportive management. Not all about the numbers but how to personally grow and develop. The most enjoyable part of the job was working alongside my colleagues and learn from them. Office Team is very supportive to its clients and personnel.
good,"-They are Employers in recruiting Industry"
good,Very professional and also very friendly.  The assignment they found for me is first rate.  Paychecks are correct and on time.  The reps are totally cool.
good,"Daily intake of client resumes and applications. Processed timesheets for temp employees. Entered client information and handled confidential forms such as, I-9 form for employment. Supported sales reps and assisted branch manager."
good,the one job they had me on was a good enviroment. They were awesome but after that one job they have yet to get me another job. i dont know much about the agency besides they help find temp jobs.
good,"I believe that Office Team has skilled professionals that recognize the skills and strengths of their employees."
good,"Provided “back office” support for the human resources department and Talent Center, performing such tasks as sending welcome packets to new employees , completing new hire paperwork, and filing personnel documents"
good,"because it was on contract and we know what we are getting ourselves into before we enter into the jobs, it was as good as it can get.  The good part for working for them is that you get to experience a lot of different positions in the field.  I loved the fact that i was able to be a bit more experienced in the various aspects of information Technology.  ."
good,Very reliable and easy to get temporary positions with this company. They usually had assignments for me and were always able to meet my minimum salary requirements.
good,Great environment and awesome co workers who were very hard working.  I have gained a lot of customer service and accounting skills. I loved the dress code (casual).  The hardest thing was working in cubicles with 10 other females in the office! Ten different personalities was a lot of getting used too.
good,They were a great group of people to work with. They always tried to find some kind of work for you to do and always kept in touch with you with any potential places of employment!
good,"M-F work week , however temporary assignments don't last long. Otherwise it is great to learn new skills on the job and enjoyed efvery part of meeting new people."
good,This was working for Office Team.  I worked at high end companies like Ameren UE and Ralston Purina
good,Had no problems when working for Robert Half; would response quickly to any concerns. They checked in to see how things were going or in you had any questions.
good,"Not applicable, I didn't work at the agency. They hired me to work for a mobile clinic. The facility I worked at was located in Rocky Mount, NC. The staff at AccountTemps were very friendly and informative."
good,Robert Half don't keep you working on a consistent and the testing they give I feel is a waste of time. Because some people have been out of work for some time and they need some practice on different software. But you want get a position because of your score on the test even thought you are capable of doing the job and have the experience. Also some people aren't good  at testing.
good,They sent me to a low pay 3 to 5 day long commute job.  The job was extended and it was costing more in gas.  I worked a month before calling Office Team. I left a message and had to call again 3 days later as no one returned my call. They said they would see what they could do.  Another 2 weeks went by and i had to once again call them.  They couldn't get extra pay so i asked them to place me at another position possibly not so far away. I never heard from them again.
good,Didnt inform me with accurate info. Every time I was sent on assignment I was told it was long term to hire and it was only temp work.
good,Temporary assignment ended early due to building fire.
good,Being that assignments are in various locations it is interesting to meet new people
good,"When assignments are available Robert Half is a great place to work."
good,"Very enjoyable place to work. Everyday was consistent and steady from start to finish. Only want contract employees, no possibility of stable employment."
good,This was a employment agency and there's nothing else to say. The assignment was a good experience. Everyone will have their own personal opinion.
good,"I learned different kind of tasks from my previous jobs ,nice people working with,more oganized works, enjoy so much on holidays with all the  departmental offices"
good,"Since 2003 I have been on and off being a contracted temporary employee of Robert Half company through Accountemps. In the beginning, I have been assign for a job for 3 months to 6 months, sometimes extended to one year. Only once that I obtain a permanent position of full time employment. I feel that the recruiter was only there to look for a job for themselves but recruiting pass over applicant who can't find employment on their own because companies would rather pay for a fee to find an applicant they thought would suit for the vacant position, or applicant who can't seem to pass the interview process. This company is very recommendable because the recruiter can find a client for you that you can work for even for a short duration of employment if you are a job hopper. There is no job security on contracted temporary employment. As I have been told; if you are not a college graduate, they can only put your resume for a temporary assignment hence to cover for ELO (Emergency Leave of Absence) Maternity leave, or long vacation (1 month). I like this agency because I learned different accounting procedures from different types of industries and businesses but I can't wish for a permanent position because I dropped out of college"
good,"As a staffing company the recruiters were very quick to find me a position that started immediately.  Though there were no benefits and no time off it was necessary that I get a job as soon as possible.  The company they sent me to was a pleasant place to work, but the work was fairly mundane, but not difficult and my co-workers were pleasant."
good,"Overall a very good company to work for. I've worked with them in ny and in florida, lots of position's available, the pay is fair didn't really have any compliant's"
good,Enjoyed working with them.  Would like more future assignments.  I am waiting for another call from them.  They are nice people to work for and pay promptly.
good,This is an Agency that is really good for when you do not have any work and a temporary potion can help to build your experience while have income coming in.
good,"Great company to work for. I am very pleased with their customer service, etc."
good,"I am only writing a review because it is required, but if I had to say anything about Robert Half it is that for me, it was great for temp work, but horrible for permanent assignments.On any given day, I would be offered an assignment, and I would accept. More often than not, they were fun places to work with a fantastic group of employees and managers, but usually they only need someone for short term assignments and nothing more. If you need a check coming in, that's OK, but not if you're looking for something long term. Over all, it was OK, but I wouldn't bet my life on getting anything through them alone."
good,"This was a contract company. I learned to work independently. The managers were located in a different state so i only communicated witht them via phone or email. I didnt have any coworkers, I was the only one that did my assignments."
good,I enjoyed working through Office Team. I gained alot of experience in different industries. It was very rewarding.
good,"Great place to work, and I would work for them again given the opportunity. The job flexibility depends on the contract you are working on, at the given time."
good,I had a good experience working with the recruiters. They were very friendly and helpful. This is a good company. They were able to find me almost full time work for over a year.
good,This is a temp agency. They call only when a temporary position fits my skills. Whenever they called me it was only for when the job requirements fit my skills.
good,The companies I worked for were great and with awesome staff.  All the contracts I was on were short lived due to competitive rates from The Creative Group.  In order for me to work at a specific company they would have to pay me and pay them double.  So I completely understand how they make their money and how I fell through the cracks with work.  Plus I had at least four different managers in my short time with them.
good,"Collected previous days drop off payments, verified daily receipts balanced cash drawer balanced, entered all payments received, verified meter readings, created work orders, made adjustments to accounts as needed, created spread sheets for growers water supply, assisted accounts payables data entries, monthly billing runs, stuffed, sorted, postage, typed letters, memos, bank deposits daily, phones, customer service."
good,Great company.  They recruited me for the project on 529 project and provided immediate assistance when I needed assistance on work issues. I would work for them again.
good,Have worked almost every week since I started. I have made not only happy clients but also friends along the way.  Would recommend to anybody looking for an administrative job.
good,"Robert and Half agency placed me in TELACU, a senior housing for the elderly that is in need of a safe home to live. I was place as a temporary manager for three months. My time is about to be up in August but I have no answer of whether or not I'll be leaving already."
good,"easy job, great environment, learned new systems. very fast past must be very detailed.  I wish the job paid more. but overall great company to work for."
good,I loved that I could have a variety of different positions and see what the job would be like if I was to be hired on.
good,"I looked forward in going to work everyday mostly because I worked with great people whom made it that way."
good,"If you worked fast, you were sent home. The client hired someone then fired them in a week and brought me back, then laid me off because they would have had to pay too much to account temps."
good,agreeable to work with - was temping at Glass Doctor in Langley for three months and am now awaiting another temp position from Robert Half - I found Robert Half to be a very professional company but slow to assign me temp positions
good,I loved working  for may last assignment and would have loved to have stayed. Great people.  I was part of a buyout and was dismissed by the new owners.
good,Currently working in a contractor position. This position could potentially lead to a permanent job. Robert Half placed me in a position after several months of signing up with them.
good,"this is contract service company - no direct experience of workplace culture - staffing managers helpful and relatively thorough, but don't always understand limitations for hearing impaired"
good,"I really liked working for Robert Half but this position was also a temporary position. I thought that it would maybe lead up to becoming permanent but the workload couldn't handle me. At first it was very fast paced, i loved the independence of my duties and the work kept me busy all day. Toward the end (last couple months) the atmosphere began to change and i didn't feel like i was a part of a team anymore. The workload started to lack and became very boring. I asked for extra duties but i guess all of the duties were already taken up by the permanent employees. I would have stuck around if they wouldn't have ended the assignment."
good,I worked for them years ago and I don't completely trust my memory. What I remember is from years ago and the assignments I got were only for a couple of days.
good,They try very hard to secure jobs for you. They try to arrange the positions around how you want to work. The staff are professional and understanding
good,I was paired with a great recruiter to place me in jobs. I took a month long vacation though unpaid but when i came back i had expected to start from scratch but that was not the case
good,"Assisted with forwarding messages from voice mail and to appropriate personnel, answered incoming telephone calls, determined purpose of callers and forwards calls to appropriate personnel or department, answered questions about requests and provides callers with appropriate information.welcomed on-site visitor, determines nature of business and announces visitors to appropriate personnel, created memos, correspondence, reports and clerical duties as required. Also received and maintained office supplies, reformed other clerical duties as needed, such as filing, photocopying and collating. This was not a hard job for me at all. I enjoyed working with instructors and students. The hardest part of this job was when I had to prepare for their closer."
good,"OfficeTeam is an employment agency.  I was in a paralegal position with the City of El Paso, El Paso Water Utilities in the Legal Dept at the hourly rate of $14/hr.  I worked with them for 4 yrs & during those 4 years, I did not receive a raise nor benefits.  The water utility decided to hire me and after 4 years, the utility had to pay a pretty steep price to hire me directly."
good,good temp agency. got a long term assignment that never became permanent even though i as told it would. pay was pretty bad even with my experience. would probably look for something else
good,"Working for the agency until I was hired short time after I started with this company"
good,flexible  for me at the time but now i want something more permanent.  I was previledged to have worked in various jobs that made me more experienced in my desired field.  Different problems will arise daily for you to troubleshoot and fix.  I have installed a lot of devices to be certain i have the experience to perform most jobs required.
good,Its hard to answer these questions for a temp agency because I worked for other businesses while at Accountemps so I didn't have a manger there. The pay rate could have been higher considering the amount the business I worked for was charged.  The quickness of filling one position to another when an assignment ended could've been done better.
good,Temporary agency so you would get different assignment they gave me a lot of fun assignment and they do get you jobs that you can get hired in and very fun environment
good,"Pretty good placement at good companies.  Good pay.  Poor benefits-would like vacation/sick/holiday pay even if it's a fraction. Had good companies, good hours, likeable co-workers, very flexible."
good,I was there for a short assignment and was offsite the whole time.  This is a staffing firm and they had a minimal presence on my life.
good,This was a great place to work while contemplating your next career move.  Exposure to various opportunities while learning different aspects of the job/
good,"While my recruiter did a great job in landing me a job quickly, he did not stay in very good communication with me while I waited for a full-time position to open up."
good,"Managers were polite and welcomed me with open arms.  I received  training on the process and procedures and was allowed to work independently on several projects.  "
good,"Had many Part-time jobs available on their list.  Staff were friendly,  knowledgeable about the employment situations and quite helpful in assisting one pursing a position"
good,"Prepare month end journal entries for financial statement, post monthly transactions for Morgan Stanley Accounts, bank reconciliations, transfer manual general ledger posting to The Shelby system; balance intercompany accounts and finalize financial statements."
good,No real job culture to speak of because you rarely see or hear from the agent reps to discuss the ongoing relationship of your job to agency.
good,Love working with Office team. The company has a variety of job assignments to choose from.
good,I enjoyed this position because it was voluntarily and I was extremely happy helping a non-profit organization and seeing peoples lives change and inner-city at risk youth turn their lives around for the positive.
good,"Robert Half is always there when you need them"
good,"Office Team sets me with a day that usually consist of helping one of their clients from Corporate Offices to Medical Offices and Law Offices as well as Real Estate Offices. This will include greeting all clients, answering phones sometimes multiple lines. I will also assistant with anything the office needs such as faxing, copying, ordering supplies and collecting payments. At times some offices have a fast working environment and some are a normal pace, I easily adapt to either one. I learn to work in different types of companies different personalities different clients and even a variety of different social status. I do not have contact with co-workers it is a Temp-Agency and we are singly assigned to different companies. The Management is great and they all try really hard to give me the positions that best fit my needs. The hardest part of the Job is that it is Temp work and some of the assingments last only for a day or two. And sometimes we have to adapt to the fact that even if we are at an assigments for a month or two or longer we may it may end abruptly. The most enjoyable personally I can travel to different locations and meet all kinds of different people and it has helped ability to work and communicate with all types of people."
good,Found to be a great service to work with for a temp agency. Staff was great to work with and easily contacted.
good,"nice place c/o great.. management alright..no permit offers,"
good,"have a chance to choose job task"
good,High pace work environment. Great entry level sales and business development job.
good,"It took several years, took multiple test and had to continue going through the process every six months to find work. Most of the positions they offer are short term contract positions with possible permanent hire potential. Most companies that use recruiters do not have permamnat postions available at the end of the contract, and contract postions often relieve employees before the contract ends."
good,"Temp jobs, no further assignments are available. Have good companies assignment. It is temp agency so you do not work for the Agency, you work for the company"
good,I was able to use my education of Computer Network Technician
good,I have had some wonderful experiences with Robert Half/Office Team and Account Temps. The pay does not match the job meaning that the job given pays a lot more or some what higher then Robert Half. but when you have bills and you need money you will take anything that comes your way.
good,Overall great weekly pay. It is a temp service so the job is not secure. You must call them to see if jobs are available. Its not steady but its great pay
good,"This is a good place if you are single and starting off your career. It requires alot of hours, but you will learn a lot. I have taken the tools I learned"
good,"Working with Robert Half I gains so much experience in many fields. I worked for a lot of different companies doing a variety of jobs for a total of 3yrs. I learned multiple software programs, skills, office procedures etc..."
good,I only worked on a per job basis so I really can't say about work life and benefits. Job security was non-exsistance because of the per-job basis. A good place to work.
good,"They always find me something when i am in the market for job"
good,"Throughout the day I complete various administrative duties, including reviewing and analyzing the data for errors and reporting the data to various departments. The information is entered into various computer programs, and compile statistical reports on payable for outstanding invoices to accounts payable. I’ve learned by being detail-oriented allows me to process quality results in a timely manner."
good,"I enjoyed working at Accountemps, it gave me more exposure to different job markets like banking and manufacturing besides working for a marketing firm."
good,Salaried Professional Services provides interesting assignments.  Commute times can be over an hour.  Bench time has a limit per year.
good,"During my employment at Adventist Health Medical Center was very touching and rewarding experience. "
good,BG staffing is a great company especially if you want to get started in the apartment management Industry BG staffing will give you the skills that you need to be calm a great leasing agent
good,Love working and leaning new things with interesting people of all walks.  Working at Stryker I have learned so much about medical products and the people that are in so many different divisions.  Every day is a leaning experience that keeps my mind sharp.  Great to be out and about.
good,"I had the opportunity to meet various wonderful people, all places I worked were wonderful unfortunately all jobs were contract jobs so I was unable to secure a job."
good,"A typical is being in a room with 30 data entry people doing the same job.  "
good,"I get to work with a lot of different types of people. I learn new things with every job I'm given. Every company has a little different way of doing things. The management treats me with respect and wants to hear my feedback. The hardest part of the job is going into a new company and ""starting over"" with co-workers and feeling like I am not really a part of the company I am working for. The most enjoyable part of the job is meeting new people with each job and getting to learn different ways of doing things."
good,"Currently in my present position my duties include billing routine exams, billing second insurance, submit paper claims, contact providers of service to seek authorizations, and code claims from the medical charts, and electronically submit claims to providers of service."

That said the training is top notch and you don't start selling until you learn exactly what to do. Division managers mentor you sitting on the sales floor in clusters or adjacent cubicles with direct line of sight which increases their ability to help you on the fly with a pitch , negotiation etc. Division and Branch Managers track sales and make sure credit is awarded fairly and ethically as much as possible and are available at all times to mediate the inevitable sales credit/commissions conflicts that arise over territory etc. Very fast paced and not for the fainthearted. Many don't last a year in sales but do go on to careers in HR or other less stressful (perm) staffing jobs.

good,"Worked on various projects for the company but they had no room for improvements in the process. The managers I worked with were of a mind-set of, if it's not broke don't fix it. I think this was relayed down from a regional manager."
good,Management is the best. They are very hands on and care about you and your experience and progress. They show true concern if you have an issue with the employer
good,"The recent job I had with Robert Half location was great. The staff was a great team of people to work with and we managed office coverage well. I learned how to multi task a busy phone system while handling mail, visitors and reserving office space. The workplace culture was very diverse and that made the office even a more welcoming place to work. The hardest part of the job was communicating transparency and not being clear of the job security after being communicated something else."
good,"A typical day would be to get contacted by Robert Half that an assignment was available and to go to the location and do administrative work.  I learned to work in a variety of office settings and to learn their office culture quickly.  The hardest part of the job was getting accustomed to working at the location and then the assignment would end.  However I was hired full time from the temp agency before, which is really nice."
good,The people were great to work with maintained a pleasant work area. Everyone was easy to talk to and made it feel comfortable asking for help if needed. The customers walked in and knew everyone by name and seemed happy to do business there.

If you inform them you are looking for perm position they will put the work in to find if not a perm position they will make sure to set you up with some temp to perm positions.  It will be up to you once you in the position so shine.  They are a agency that will keep you working but you do have to stay on top of them because you can fall on the back burner if you are not pushing.
good,"They always send me an some good assignment, and they always get back great reviews on my job performance. Work was always fun I had great times with the staffing manger."
good,I have worked with Office Team on different assignments. The pay is always good. The companies are always different and the locations are near and far. Over the years the distance has become down time to relax before getting to work and after leaving. I have no complaints. I have enjoyed working for them over the decade.
good,"This is a temp agency that I worked at for a while. What I loved about it was that you could experience a wide variety of jobs until you found the right one that fit or became available. By doing this I learned a lot of different skills and all the locations that were offered were always very friendly. Usually as a receptionist, I would be answering phones, filing, scheduling appointments, sorting the mail and whatever else they needed me to do. Some of my jobs were full time and then there were times that I had part time work."

good,"This bank position through Robert Half was for a major bank in downtown Port Huron, MI.  It was a temporary assignment.

My part in the project was to help the HR Department get ready to move from the old building they were in to a brand new one."
good,Accountemps Clients are very professional and offer pleasant working environments. They fill a variety of accounting assignments.  I am able to match  my education and work experience to assignments

good,Working for the City of Stow on behalf of Accountemps was perhaps the second best job I have had in my career.  I enjoyed not only the assignments I was tasked with completing but also the people with whom I interacted on a day-to-day basis.  I will truly miss everyone there.
good,"Worked through them at The Penrod Co. in Virginia Beach, VA. Overall they kept me busy and that was all that mattered at the time. Assignment can be short or long. Assignments can also become a permanent position for you within the company you are working for."

good,"I have worked off and on with Office Team for several years. Through the years and the various agents and jobs, I always felt like they truly cared about matching me with the appropriate job. Should there be an assignment that was not a good fit, they worked with me to help me end that assignment and move on to something else."
good,I really enjoyed working with office team and if they were willing to pay a bit more to the contractors that would be a blessing.  They were always nice and willing to help me.

I was the Top Producer in getting people to participate and raise money.  I enjoyed this position because I spoke to different people at various companies informing them about the MDA fundraising event.
good,Great place to help you find a job that hopefully will turn into a career. They let you know what positions they have available and let you choose where you would like to go.
good,I have worked for temp agencies in the past. Accountemps is by far the most productive. However the company I got placed at had an extremely hostile environment. The payroll manager was not professional in any way. Talked about other employees problems and used abusive language.
good,Would work for them again but dont get pregnant because they will remove you from an assignment and they wont find you ananother one until they fill they want to or will send you jobs that you are over qualified for.
good,Una muy buena empresa con unos excelentes jefes y compañeros   muy colaboradores entregados a su traba 100%

I'm lucky I got the experience and I still use everything I learned there everyday."
good,"The management in which I dealt with, could of been easier to talk to. It was always a challenge getting the proper information about a new job from them. A better description is needed not so much about the company they would send me on."

good,"Muito boa, recomendo. Me ajudou em meu desenvolvimento profissional."

good,The was a contract position. They kept me busy from week to week on new contracts. Some positions were for longer time frame than others. There were no benefits working for them as they are an agency. For me it was a great experience. Yes accounting is accounting and you have to know how it works. Depending on the type of company the books are set up differently. The type of accounts vary depending on the type of company they are.
good,"The folks at Office Team Cincinnati are highly professional and very communicative. In addition, they are kind and thoughtful."
good,"I work as a temporary employee.  I answer phones, scan documents and perform any other tasks required.  Co-workers have very negative attitudes,  One person can be very rude to tenants.

good,On assignment at Illinois Institute of Technology's Bursars office where I enjoyed working with the students on paying off their tuition balances. The office was very helpful to me and treated me as a co-worker not just as a temp. The hardest part of the job was the reports I had to do tracking balance reductions and the heavy workload at the beginning of the new semesters dealing with new and existing students.
good,"On a typical day, I arrive at 8 A.M and begin proofreading reports. Throughout the day, I primarily am left to my work without interference. My co-workers are excellent and management is very understanding of time off requests."
good,"OK for temp work. Working for the employer-not always looking out for the worker. Assignments include receptionist, customer service, telemarketing. Employers required high level responsibilities with minimal pay. Often used candidate to do high pressure jobs with minimal pay."

At this particular position I worked alone in the office but was in communication by phone and e-mail with the client at the corporate office in regards to what I should be expecting in as far as items and packages.  I enjoyed most just being trusted that I would do what ever the client needed me to do.  The hardest thing was sitting around waiting for packages to arrive with nothing else to do."
good,Co-workers are great. Job itself is easy. I file and enter data into spreadsheets daily. Hours are good.

good,"Contract work for Providence Health Plans in the Membership Accounting Department."
good,"The company provided ample training, and enrichment for the job duties as an AML Analyst. Some days could be challenging, due to the type of Alerts and consistent changes of procedures.

My duties at this temporary assignments have varied. All in office environment and clerical work duties. I have enjoyed each and every one of them."
good,My most enjoyable part of the job is completing my tasks so that the company can have a profitable reward.
good,"I had two assignments while working with Robert Half.  The first was a temporary controller's position for an automotive parts manufacturing facility.  This was a fun position, in that I was able to get involved in all facets of the business and learned a lot.  They used oracle financials which I had never used.  I also did not have any experience with this industry and found it to be very informative.  The hardest part of the job was knowing that I was only there to handle the operations of the plant while their staff was facing layoffs due to the plant closing."
good,"My current typical day at work is pleasant, I never get over stressed and everyone around me is usually in a great mood.  The office is quiet, but not too quiet.  I've learned many valuable administrative skills and I hope to learn more very soon.  I currently like the hours I work and the management there is laid back for the most part. "

good,Robert Halfe has offered several positions that were for at least 6 months work. They were great about making sure I was okay in the position that I had taken. The hardest part of the positions were that they didn't go permanent.
good,Good company to work for. Worked at different locations short term for them. Left for a full time position at Aramark.

good,It is document review so it is what is is they do pay well. But it is temporary work.
good,I had an opportunity to learn a lot about human resourses processes working for one company for 6 months.  This experience led to other HR positions where I really like working.  I've also worked as a receptionist and administrative assistant.  The pay has been better than other office temp to perm companies as well.
good,"Stuff that I was use to doing for the last 20 years. break fix, Hardware, Software. Many other things that I have been doing for year. If you want to find a good job right away while you might be looking for a permanent job these are the guys for you."

good,"It was just a  temporary position, so didn't work for them for more than 3 months.  Had a great experience though.  Just wish they could hurry up and find my next job."
good,"Die Zusammenarbeit mit den Personalern ist auf Augenhöhe. "
good,"I’ve enjoyed working for Robert Half. Only thing I would really try to improve is more of an effort to stay in communication with consultants during a project (checking in, listening to how things are going, take steps to try and make it a great experience, etc)."
good,Robert half has a very detailed and friendly approach when dealing with staff. Robert half also has a robust library for self improvement and training.
good,"It's a great staffing company. Will review your resume, match you up with jobs that your skilled for and even help you build up your skills level. The managers will work with you."
good,Overall good experiences working with this company at different times during the past ten years. Company is a little slow at finding a job in a particular field for a particular person. The pay rate should be higher.
good,Overall this is a good company to for. I wanted more job stability and benefits. But a good company to get your foot in the door at place you want to work.
good,The assignment was to help them prepare for an audit.  Their office was very organized.  The accounting staff was very welcoming and the supervisor was organized.
good,Robert Half technologies has fantastic recruiters. They work really hard to find the correct fit for both the employee and employers. They serve the employee well in finding the best fit and compensation.
good,I was out of work for some time and the staff at RH was able to find an assignment that met my work criteria. It has been a joy working with RH. Would recommend to anyone who is looking to find work or is unsure about their career plans and future.
good,"This temp agency gave me a lot of decent opportunities, they accommodate u to the best of their ability. I believe my first interview was over Skype cuz I couldn't make it to the office. I dont mind working for them again."
good,Only thing negative I am finding right know is lack of available assignments. They are good at explaining the assignment and what is expected of you. Very nice to deal with.
good,"I've had a great experience working with The Creative Group- they've kept me employed as a contractor, been easy to work with, and they provide benefits (which few agencies do). I've worked with great reps that are super helpful. It's a great place to be!"
good,Good benefits.  I have been a contractor for Robert Half at several companies.  Always treated with respect.  The recruiters are extremely professional.
good,"OfficeTeam provides a variety of opportunities to get you started on the right foot. While assignments may be few and far between, the staff does their best to place you in a work environment that will help you advance to your desired career."

good,The positions were well explained and suited to my needs.  My recruiter checked on me regularly and the companies I worked for were wonderful.  Great company to work for.
good,"Robert Half assigned me with State of Oklahoma - OMES, got to use my previous experience and incorporate it for this job.  Employees were great to work with, nice environment."
good,I have a productive day Monday through Friday. I have learned so much working for this company. My number one priority is the customer. The customer should always have a smile on his/her face when completing a call with me. My focus is to keep the customer happy. The workplace culture helps the company to be more unique. I believe the hardest part of the job is when you have that one angry customer that just isn't satisfied no matter what. It will take determination to calm that customer down so that he/she can be assisted. The most enjoyable part of the job is being the first point of contact.
good,This has been a great experience  and will allow me the activities to increase and utilize my experience. I enjoyed working with polite and knowledgeable leadership.

A typical day was filled with keying invoices, verifying vendor statements, calling the restaurant managers or vendors, filing, researching issues, paying bills, and once a week meetings with supervisor/director. This job was fast paced.  I enjoyed researching issues, working with vendors statements and restaurant managers.

Working with accountemps has been challenging and rewarding.  Most job assignments bring someone in because they are having difficulties and need assistance to bring the department into current status.  I have had several opportunities to show my skills in that regard and leave the company feeling good about what I have accomplished.  I enjoy the co-workers and the management team.

good,"I'm very grateful for the fact that because of RH, I've been able to find steady work, but I do wish that they would review some of the businesses before they agree to send a rep to work. I've always had great managers, but the co-workers were either shiftless or extremely unprofessional. I found it very sad that a lot of times, I was the youngest person on any given team, but the hardest working. I understand that in these situations I am the temp and my job is to do work that needs to be done, but a lot of times all of the work would get dumped on me. That's not fair."
good,"Robert Half is a temporary agency that has been very reliable in getting job assignment's. The current job assignment I am on is with a company called Millstream Apartment Complex. I am the Administrative Assistant and I have come to greatly enjoy working with the residents that live here. The best part of the day is when I am collecting the rent and everyone stops in and chat's. And I really love the part of my job where I am answering all of the client's questions in regard to renting at Millstream Apartment's. Of course the hardest part of the job is when I have to send letter's out to the resident's for past due rent. But even then, I still get to have great conversation's with everyone."
good,I would highly reccommend this agency. They are professional at all times and they make you feel very important to their company.
good,"Working in an industrial setting, mainly job costing, accounts receivable, accounts payable and month end responsibilities.  I have learned more about job costing during my assignment in a Value Added atmosphere.  The coworkers are an awesome variety of people.  The hardest part of doing the job assigned is learning the manufacturing pieces and learning how to fix problems within the job costing software.  The most enjoyable piece is doing month end because that is my comfort zone."
good,The most enjoyable part of the job was meeting new people and learning new software programs.  I was offered full time permanent positions while working on various contract jobs of which I accepted with NAES Power Contractors.

good,Great when the job market sucks. Pleasant hiring staff. No guarantee of assignments. The summer months are especially slow for finding assignments.
good,"There are no typical days while working on temporary assignments.  All assignments have different MOs and one has to be very flexible and adaptable to any and all situations successfully.  The hardest part of working on temporary assignments, is dealing professionally with all types of individuals at all times...meaning one can rarely relax to show your true personality."
good,The companies that Robert Half placed me with were very friendly environments and I really enjoyed working for some of their clients and I know that they enjoyed me too.  GE Johnson wanted to hire me full time but the timing did not work out as I was about to have a new baby.  The recruiters at Robert Half were very good about checking in on me and giving me feedback.
good,"Typically the assignments are temporary so punctuality is key to a good start. I excel in Customer Service and Account Management as my attention to detail and personal approach to working with others has helped me grow as a person and business professional. In this environment you must adapt, overcome and develop tough skin quickly in order to thrive. Working with such a diverse amount of people and industries has proved I learn and succeed quickly and efficiently."
good,I have worked with several of the people there when it came to searching for a job and setting up interviews. Because of their excellent track record they were able to place me into a position without an interview first.
good,"Speaking as a 'temp', or the staff that is sent to client locations to fulfill short-term contracts, they really treat me right. The only real awkwardness is being handed around the various divisions (admin roles to technology roles to accounting roles) which can be cumbersome when I'm being called with multiple offers at the same time."
good,"Office Team is a staffing agency.  They have helped me find temporary work and is continuing to help me. Unfortunately, as a temporary agency, they do not have many permanent assignments."
good,"Working with a staffing company such as, I did the long-term contracts paid very well however, you could be there 6 weeks or 6 months and they always in my experience hired from within or someone who applied directly.  However, it gave me an opportunity to be exposed to training I may not gotten had I not been on contract."
good,Accounts payable included input of invoices for payment; discount tracking.  Weekly check run in SAP of payments.  Some vendor maintenance.
good,"The assignment that I am on is a temp to perm hire at Emcor Services / Aircond.  I have been here for a little over four months and it has been an overall positive experience.  The recruiters have been excellent as far as communication and making sure that I acclimated into the position with as few issues as possible.  I have learned dispatch for a busy HVAC company with no previous experience.  My co-workers on site have been very helpful in making the transition from electronic filer to dispatch a relatively easy one.  The hardest part of the job for me has been learning everyone and their departments at first, but as days go by, I am continuing to learn everyone and their functions.  The most enjoyable part of this job is being a part of a really great dispatch team in a fast paced environment, so I am never bored and the days pass quickly.  I have really enjoyed learning something that I have never done before and learning more about the workings of this company."

good,"Working with Officeteam was great. They helped me get out on jobs and helped me build my resume. I learned a lot from working with Garner Environmental, which was a part time assignment, where I had to do general office work and answering their 10 line phone system. I also kept files and sent phone message to the correct employee using Outlook. The employees there was great and I enjoyed each day I worked there. Since it was a part time job, I unfortunately had to leave to find full time work."

During training I realized that once I recognize the documents it became an ease to get the work done accuracy and a timely manner. I was able to increase my work load due to understanding the process. I enjoyed my co-workers and we all work together to help each other to understand so that our team would not be behind. The hardest part of the job was the down days, in other words; days without work. The most enjoyable part of the job for me was being busy and getting the work done correctly and on time. I learned new skills in home mortgage and how to help others in more efficient ways."
good,"If you are planning to find a consistent flow of IT jobs to fill you needs, you may want to see additional sources.

good,"I valued my experience at Robert Half with different temp jobs and excellent experiences in different work environments. I would recommend "
good,They try to get you raises from the companies they send you to work for and they are concerned about your wellbeing. They check up on you and try to find you exactly what you want and they stay involved with you and the assignment. They basically do what you ask it may take some time but the will get it done.
good,"The support with Robert Half from Regional Managers and above is amazing. My typical day is pretty smooth not too many surprises which is nice. I think admins are always not given the respect they deserve, nothing is different here. Other admins are respectful but the staff can forget how much we do and why the office runs as it does. That makes it frustrating and upsetting. This has been the best job I've ever had though and it is a great company to work for. You will always have co workers and bosses you don't like."

good,"Overall, I really enjoy Robert Half/ Office Team. My recruiters are really helpful, and I've enjoyed the assignments they've sent me out to.  My pay is low, so it's not a sustainable situation.

Denver has a large amount of qualified people looking for positions in this field, and it is a highly competitive market. There are numerous respected law firms who work with Robert Half to find employees. I have worked on assignment for Robert Half in the legal assistant/paralegal field, and have enjoyed the challenges presented as well as skill development they have offered. Denver is one of the most expensive places to live in the country right now (probably in the top 10 or 15 most expensive metro areas to live in due to an explosion of population in the past 5 to 10 years, and definitely the most expensive city in the Rocky Mountain region).

Their calendars and meetings changed at the last minute, continuous requests came in, often at the drop of a hat and simultaneously. During the two months on contract, I created and maintained their road-show schedule along with scheduling new speaking engagements daily, making dinner reservations and setting up daily lunch deliveries in Princeton and across the United States.

I was giving the opportunity to supervise a group of very hard working individuals who took their job serious while maintaining a sense of humor.

The team management was outstanding, always calm and quick to act of a situation did arise. They also had a great understanding of the work the engineers where doing. The hardest part of the job would have been a occasional  break down in pier to pier compunctions which would lead to a ticket being assigned wrong or lost."

good,Both jobs RH has put me in were temporary. One was fair pay the other very low pay but it pays the Bills. Loved both jobs so I'm staying at the second until I can find something within the company and ask for a raise becausei knowthey can afford it. I told my recruiter and they are going to  Re negotiate the contract with the company so the next generation can get higher pay. Doesn't help me lol but at least its helping someone else. The job culture is amazing. Also they will keep renewing your contract until a permanent position opens up

good,"When my Temp jobs were up, they were very good about placing me in a new position right away.  The most frustrating thing was there were not a lot of ""Temp-to-hire"" jobs available."
good,"My only issue with RHT is the cut they take eats into what I could be making. It comes with the territory, though and if I freelanced, I'd probably end up hiring a manager who would take about that much anyway.  I haven't used their permanent placement services, but they've been great for contract positions so far."

Good relationship with them; the wonderful personality and mutual respect was definitely what kept me with the confidence that I would land a permanent position through them.  Which did end up occuring with DCH Auto Group LLC.  My peers from the agency working at DCH Auto Group LLC at the time we got along good and we gave each other the mutual respect expect from each other.  At the time the hardest part of the job was to re-organize files at a pace that I was comfortable with.  I always do my best to exceed the level of expectation.  My great enjoyment of the assignment was that I was learning an industry that I had no experience with and that was fun for me.
good,I enjoyed working for this company because I learned a lot on every job assignment I was sent to work. I learned how to conduct myself professionally and I obtained most of the experience I would need to enter the career I went to school to learn. The co-workers were very friendly as well as helpful in any situation. The hardest part of the job was when the assignment came to an end. The most enjoyable part of the job was how my co-workers and I worked closely.
good,"This was a temp position since I was laid off from my permanent job, I was also pregnant at the time.  The company I was placed at suited my needs and was laid back.

I learned how to do records retention, how to scan healthcare documents and digitization of documents. The management at Office Team are very nice people, they always want to make sure that everyone is doing their job and will come to help if need be. The hardest part of the job is when I would accidentally release a batch too early and not create a new batch; I would be unable to find any of the previous batches that I had already scanned, and I had no experience on going onto the database to retrieve them...so I would have to redo all of the reports I had already scanned. The most enjoyable part of the job is getting to meet people; I had three other coworkers on my team and they were talkative and very kind, they would help me out if I was stuck and I did not know what to do."
