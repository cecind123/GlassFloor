bad,Don't waste your time.  No respect from upper management and they talk out of both sides of their neck.  Not even a good stepping stone.  Would not recommend this place to anyone.  They (Management) don't care about their people but as long as the Management team looks good that's all that matters!
bad,This company has gone into the toilet & continues to get worse. Burn out period is about 9-13 months. Don’t get caught up in the benefits you are initially promised; you’ll hardly ever be able to use them.
bad,The operations Manager at Buckeye Hammond is the definition of what you dont want in a manager ever. He lies to make himself look good. Freaks out about every little thing. Treats contractors and anyone else poorly if things arent going his way. The women in the office are no better. They gossip and take favorites going behind other managers backs. The culture at Buckeye Hammond is toxic. The turnover rate is insane. Save yourself the trouble if you're thinking about working here.
bad,I would not recommend Buckeye
bad,Management turnover is terrible and they strive on a dictatorship. You comply whether right or wrong or they pull their at will employment card and get rid of you! Pay is great if you can avoid the drama and unsafe practices they embrace. If you can befriend a person in upper management you'll do great.
bad,"Lots of back stabbing, horrible management and favoritism happened within my department.   Other areas seemed fine to work in.  Really glad I chose to leave."
bad,"Company is great - Department managers are not."
bad,"Total stress trying to keep employees working and doing the job right. Lacked job security, employees. Upper management would belittle employees in front of co-workers."
bad,"BEEN with the company for 15 years was a great place now if you are not a ""yes"" they will fire you   linden location is the worst, and the h.r. dept is the saddest you will ever encounter"
bad,"processing invoices, check runs, ach and wire transfers answering vendor inquiries"
bad,Large Company with great Benefit and growing.  Culture for Women extremely limited.  There are literally no women in management as this is an old Oil Industry mentality.  The company is fairly disorganized in its growth and the culture is not modern and fully developed.
good,"Not very diverse workforce. 4 on 4 off rotate days and nights sucks. Jerk you around to different shifts as they seem fit. Force you to learn multiple consoles, which only endangers your chance of a mistake and losing your job. Management from bottom to top is unorganized and secretive. Pay and benefits is only thing keeping most people around."
good,"Buckeye Pipeline at Bayonne is 24/7 operation 365 days of the year."
good,Inner-office politics and no HR repercussion pair up to create a pretty uncomfortable experience. This could be a very good opportunity if they didn't squander it by allowing for negative and neglectful employees.
good,A place to learn and gain experience. Nice slow pace to work. Held safety meetings before the shift started. Comfortable people and co workers to be around.
good,"From a operations aspect opportunity to learn and gain some experience is there, but not utilized to a full potential. Nice crowed and people to work around with, but a stepping stone to greater career development."
good,"I learned a great deal of the process of the oil and gas industry, The hardest part of the job was dealing with things that was not right overlooked. The most enjoyable part of my job is delivering for buckeye. took pride i what i did."
good,Overall - a good place in general; Everything started of good but it was just the department personnel that changed with the new structure and many people became unhappy.
good,"Pros: Good working atmosphere. Helpful co workers. "
good,"Buckeye has gone through a lot of changes since 2008. Although the growth through acquisitons is relatively fast paced, at times pushing changes through internally can take time. Communication issues between PA and TX offices make solving issues difficult. Good job security for the most part."
good,great challenges and fun folks to work with.  sr. management is not always in tune with developing from within.  a bit of a boys club at times.  promotions are only for those inside the circle of sr. leadership favorites
good,"12 hour days, not to bad. management is a huge downfall here. Lack of info and you will get tons of emails on the phone they give you and be relief until all the old guys retire. Hope you like not being trained and people yelling at you."
good,"Spineless management. High school drama between employees. Trainer would say you're doing a good job then tell the manager something different. Definitely don't question why they do something a certain way because you have prior experience. "
good,Monitor and calculate the movement of product throughout the pipeline. Requires sitting for 12 continuous hours and a non traditional work schedule ( rotating 12 hour shifts ).
good,"The work environment is very relax, however it can be stressful doing months end. Management is laid back, and is very supportive of there  employees however they struggle to ensure security within its employees.Employees have been contractors for 30+ years. Lack of stability is my biggest issue. Which has prompted me to look a jobs that will provide me with security."
good,"This is a great little company.  They have super VPs and great EA's!  I recommend they weed out one person, who is too elderly for her Senior Executive Admin position. Other than that... the company is great place to work! Sadly I found no mentoring from upper management. However, I did seek it through other great workers. I learned new programs and found new ways to improve my goals and job performance. BPLP also has some great leaders that I admired and respected. The employees are hard-working talented people. I enjoyed working along with them as a team player and as my service to them each day."
good,They had an unusual practice of firing plant and operations managers. They went thru 3 while I was employed. The HR Manager was fired and they seemed to overload people with multiple job tasks outside their normal job role. They did provide the opportunity to further your education.
good,Working at Buckeye is a good job. It offers job security with benefits. I had 5 weeks of vacation and went down to two so that is not good for me and the four on four off schedule is a little difficult but workable with vacation use. All vacation is scheduled for 4 days at a time so it could be better in this area. People are really nice and easy to get along with. This would be a fantastic job for a young person or someone who doesn't have much going on outside of work.
good,Collaborative environment.  Employees are highly skilled and knowledgeable of the industry and their specific function.  Customer base appreciates support and is open to new ideas.
good,"Outstanding group of controllers to learn from, and reliable managment."
good,The company provides an excellent work environment with emphasis on a strong safety culture.  Leanly run company where everyone’s contribution is recognized and appreciated.
good,"The management team holds themselves and others accountable for results that add stockholder value.  The teams are focused on continuous improvement - keep what works, improve what needs to be adjusted, and remove what doesn't work from any process - Back Office through Operations."
good,This job has a ton of benefits including great pay and benefits. The work hours for this job are 12 hour swing shifts. The company did a great job taking care of the employees.
good,"I really appreciated the culture which encouraged learning on a regular basis.  "
good,A great group of people made this a great place to work.  Each day brought a new challenge and a great team was there to help solve them.  I would recommend  Buckeye for anyone that is a self starter.
good,This company takes care of it's employees and is expressed from local to CEO managment. With the policies and benefits allowed from this company are far beyond any of the other companies I have worked for in the past
good,I absolutely love working here. You are part of the team of professionals from day 1 and your expertise is appreciated and valued. The Senior Level Management makes a point to keep all informed on the status of the company.
good,"•a typical day at work- meetings, planning, project reviews"
good,It was a great place to work. Your learn a lot about petroleum bi-products. Great place for someone to start understanding how different valves/pumps and tubing. I would definitely recommend it.
good,"Going in everyday with a fabulous group of co-workers who enjoy their jobs and the people they work with."
good,"They are great company but this is the first splitter oil plant they have built and operated.  They are more of a transportation company."
good,"Great place to work. The culture and work is fast paced, the company is very stable, all of the groups that I've worked with have been very collaborative groups, overall very good people to work with. You'll get more breadth of responsibility and experience here than anywhere else."
good,The last 15 years have been very rewarding with career advancement potential and interesting opportunities.  The atmosphere is very collaborative and my colleagues are interested in maintaining our goals.
good,I thoroughly enjoyed working for Buckeye Partners. I would highly recommend the company. There is an excellent culture of success and I would certainly go back some day
good,"Want to go back, but their HR is a one man show, and uses it for personal use. If love to go back, but took a position else where to further myself. It didn't go back, but she would let me back. Even if I qualified and rest of management enjoyed my work"
good,Buckeye is a great company to work for. The compensation is really good as well as the work environment. I like my co-workers and my boss.
good,"I really enjoyed working at Buckeye. The benefits, compensation, and job/life balance are great. They also have a great 401k plan and contribution percentage."
good,"Great people, work environment and culture. Offer training and career development.  Team environment and the chance to work with great people.  Great job security and industry.  Challenging work and great day to day.  Managment was a great team.  Opportunity to do a good amount of field work and not be tied down to a desk or stuck in a cube farm.  Good salary, bonuses, benefits and career development and opportunity for advancement."
good,I loved the job and the manager was awsome. I loved working there. The staff is great. Lots of learning and keeping busy. The days go by fast and usually weekend offs.
good,Buckeye Partners LP is a great company to work for. The teamwork and dedication I have seen here is only matched to the same atmosphere I experienced during my military career. The IT PMO Office really cares for the PMO and each department it supports. I would work here forever if I could.
good,"great group of individuals to work with."
good,enjoyed working for them friendly supportive and pay well I had a good time with them. and hired a good contractor for the project
